The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .
Mr . Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self - denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning ' s work for her .
She recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .
How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
All looked up to them .
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
" A house of her own !-- But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?
" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !
Randalls is such a distance .
" The carriage !
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London .
He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Mr . Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after " poor Isabella " and her children were answered most satisfactorily .
When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .
I wish you may not catch cold .
" Dirty , sir !
" Well !
that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .
"
Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ," said Emma , " and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .
my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .
You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .
" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .
But if you want to shew him any attention , my dear , ask him to come and dine with us some day .
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
Some scruples and some reluctance the widower - father may be supposed to have felt ; but as they were overcome by other considerations , the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills , and he had only his own comfort to seek , and his own situation to improve as he could .
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
Now was the time for Mr . Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .
" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr . Frank Churchill has written to Mrs . Weston ?
Mr . Woodhouse told me of it .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
"
Mr . Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr . Woodhouse ' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .
With such an opinion , in confirmation of his own , Mr . Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair ; but still the cake was eaten ; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone .
There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - cake in their hands : but Mr . Woodhouse would never believe it .
Not unfrequently , through Emma ' s persuasion , he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him : but evening parties were what he preferred ; and , unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company , there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card - table for him .
Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .
Encouragement should be given .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :
Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .
Quick and decided in her ways , Emma lost no time in inviting , encouraging , and telling her to come very often ; and as their acquaintance increased , so did their satisfaction in each other .
Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .
Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith ' s being exactly the young friend she wanted -- exactly the something which her home required .
For Mrs . Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .
Emma encouraged her talkativeness -- amused by such a picture of another set of beings , and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs . Martin ' s having " _two_ parlours , two very good parlours , indeed ; one of them quite as large as Mrs . Goddard ' s drawing - room ; and of her having an upper maid who had lived five - and - twenty years with her ; and of their having eight cows , two of them Alderneys , and one a little Welch cow , a very pretty little Welch cow indeed ; and of Mrs . Martin ' s saying as she was so fond of it , it should be called _her_ cow ; and of their having a very handsome summer - house in their garden , where some day next year they were all to drink tea :-- a very handsome summer - house , large enough to hold a dozen people .
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .
She was in no hurry at all .
" Oh yes !-- that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of .
"
not handsome -- not at all handsome .
"
A young farmer , whether on horseback or on foot , is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity .
" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .
His mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry .
They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .
"
"
They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .
He thought we walked towards Randalls most days .
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .
So very odd we should happen to meet !
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
Were not you struck ?
I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here .
"
"
" Oh yes !-- there is a great difference .
" There is no saying , indeed ," replied Harriet rather solemnly .
" But there may be pretty good guessing .
What has he to do with books ?
" I wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .
They have more gentleness .
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
"
Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .
The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
Mr . Elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
"
" A bad thing !
They will read together .
"
" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
How well she looked last night !
Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?
"
I will keep my ill - humour to myself .
"
" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .
" convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
"
No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed ,
" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !
I would give any money for it .
I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
You know nothing of drawing .
Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face .
" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success .
Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet .
She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved .
There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
Then , here come all my attempts at three of those four children ;-- there they are , Henry and John and Bella , from one end of the sheet to the other , and any one of them might do for any one of the rest .
" We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ;-- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again .
" By all means .
" So prettily done !
"
" What a precious deposit !
" Who could have thought it ?
" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied Emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him .
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
" Well ," said the still waiting Harriet ;--" well -- and -- and what shall I do ?
"
" Oh no , no !
Harriet was silent .
This is a point which you must settle with your feelings .
" Not for the world ," said Emma , smiling graciously , " would I advise you either way .
If you prefer Mr . Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
" You could not have visited me !
" she cried , looking aghast .
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
"
" Dear affectionate creature !-- _You_ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm !-- _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life !
"
"
Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions .
I am quite determined to refuse him .
What shall I say ?
" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .
The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet .
"
" Now he has got my letter ," said she softly .
"
It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight .
She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .
"
"
" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter .
" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better .
"
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .
"
" Almost every moment .
" Very serious !
Who makes you their confidant ?
Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr . Elton ' s having dropt a hint .
Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .
I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused .
"
" Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her .
She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse .
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion .
It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again .
Harriet ' s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
" To be sure !
"
Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief .
Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .
Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
But the case is altered now .
" cried Mr .
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
"
The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr . Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ' s friendship and woman ' s feelings would not justify .
He had frightened her a little about Mr . Elton ; but when she considered that Mr . Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr . Knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .
CHAPTER IX
He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon .
"
Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked .
" said she ; " that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you .
She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , " Very well , Mr . Elton , very well indeed .
This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance .
May its approval beam in that soft eye !
Harriet exactly .
A man must be very much in love , indeed , to describe her so .
Ah !
An excellent charade indeed !
and very much to the purpose .
She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ' s wondering questions .
I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least .
What can it possibly be ?
Can it be woman ?
or a shark ?
" Mermaids and sharks !
Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown .
Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
"
I thought it must be so .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr . Elton were most desirable or most natural .
There cannot be two opinions about _him_ .
It is a certainty .
You and Mr . Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .
"
Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury .
When I look back to the first time I saw him !
" Yes , very true .
" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly .
"
" continued Harriet --" these two last !-- But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ?-- Oh !
He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed .-- Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming .
Trust to me .
"
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
It will be giving him so much pleasure !
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- You must let me read it to him .
"
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in .
` Woman , lovely woman .
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
I hope we shall have her here next week .
I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she was going to be married .
" We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here .
He sat musing a little while , and then said ,
I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?
"
I am sure I do not know who is not .
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr . John Knightley is an affectionate father .
The children are all fond of him .
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other .
"
Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said ,
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life .
"
" I do not often walk this way _now_ ," said Emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury .
"
so charming as you are !
Emma laughed , and replied ,
" Ah !-- so you say ; but I cannot believe it .
" Dear me !-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so !
"
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
"
That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?
"
one can think of nothing else .
The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr . Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther ,
The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .
His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done .
"
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
" Part of my lace is gone ," said she , " and I do not know how I am to contrive .
She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it .
He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
" Cautious , very cautious ," thought Emma ; " he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure .
There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .
The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
"
Mr . John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls .
Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish .
papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .
"
" It would be very hard upon Mr . Weston if she did not , papa .-- You quite forget poor Mr .
" I think , indeed ," said John Knightley pleasantly , " that Mr . Weston has some little claim .
"
I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .
" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty .
You forget how time passes .
" How very pleasing and proper of him !
I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him .
She thought it was time to make up .
I was sixteen years old when you were born .
As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong .
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .
After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
"
" Ah !
"
I have a great regard for Mr . Perry .
my dear sir , her throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August .
"
" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them .
the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .
" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago .
"
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season .
" Ah !
I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- Mr .
"
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .
"
You will like Harriet .
Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
Here was a dangerous opening .
" Ah !
It does not bear talking of .
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good .
my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air .
Has Perry seen her ?
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
"
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
With men he can be rational and unaffected , but when he has ladies to please , every feature works .
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you .
"
You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do .
" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken .
He said no more .
The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing .
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .
She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , " Much the same -- not better .
"
" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer .
" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
"

Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly ,
"
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body .
"
" My first enjoyment ," replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again .
Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs . Weston ' s drawing - room ;-- Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr . John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .
She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of .
With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .
I should like to see two more here ,-- your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete .
and Mrs . Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself .
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ," replied Emma ; " but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .
"
" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life .-- She is an odd woman !-- But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank ' s account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him .
To you -- to my two daughters -- I may venture on the truth .
Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs . Weston .
Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him ; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable .
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
I am sorry for it .
"
I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ," replied Mrs . Weston .
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
He could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ?
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
I am not at all afraid .
It will be bad enough for the horses .
"
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .
Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied ,
"-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,
"
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
CHAPTER XVI
He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !
She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .
His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .
There was no denying that those brothers had penetration .
that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh !
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield .
Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
CHAPTER XVIII
It is impossible .
"
He cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .
"
" Yes , sometimes he can .
I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion .
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
Respect would be added to affection .
"
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
"
" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs . Weston .
It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due , and she must doubly feel the omission .
Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no .
"
" And mine ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing !
" I will say no more about him ," cried Emma , " you turn every thing to evil .
We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here .
" But I am very much , and without being at all ashamed of it .
" He is a person I never think of from one month ' s end to another ," said Mr . Knightley , with a degree of vexation , which made Emma immediately talk of something else , though she could not comprehend why he should be angry .
The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr . Elton .
She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
" Thank you .
And , indeed , though my mother ' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God !
All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ' s handwriting .
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now .
"
My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .
The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .
Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things .
He is a most charming young man .
)-- But ever since we had the history of that day , I have been so fond of Mr .
"
I think they judge wisely .
Mrs . Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax .
" Oh !
"
" Yes , that of course .
"
A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ?
poor Jane is ill !
If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry .
Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her .
Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power .
It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history .
The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon .
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her .
When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .
Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr . Knightley , " She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome !
She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr . Churchill .
You left nothing undone .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
The muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough .
I think you understand me , therefore .
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .
Mr . Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr . Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates ' s , said --
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
Have you heard the news ?
Mr . Elton is going to be married .
for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` Oh !
my dear ,' said I -- well , and just then came the note .
' Well , Mr . Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --"
" Mr . Elton going to be married !
He seemed to me very well off as he was .
" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse !
"
" cried Emma .
When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind .
And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .
She seems quite recovered now .
Oh !
I told you he was plain .
But I gave what I believed the general opinion , when I called him plain .
Well , that is so very !-- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm .-- Mr .
If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s .
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again .
Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .
She was not thoroughly comfortable herself .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
" It might be distressing , for the moment ," said she ; " but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it .
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
During his present short stay , Emma had barely seen him ; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over , and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension , now spread over his air .
As to connexion , there Emma was perfectly easy ; persuaded , that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet , he had done nothing .
On that article , truth seemed attainable .
She brought no name , no blood , no alliance .
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton .
Sometimes Mr . Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
Harriet had not been at home ; but a note had been prepared and left for her , written in the very style to touch ; a small mixture of reproach , with a great deal of kindness ; and till Mr . Elton himself appeared , she had been much occupied by it , continually pondering over what could be done in return , and wishing to do more than she dared to confess .
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet ' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?
They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .
They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent .
The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary .
It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither " master nor mistress was at home ;" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield .
There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with ,
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr . Weston ' s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent , and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing .
" My dear , dear anxious friend ,"-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , " always overcareful for every body ' s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
I remembered what I used to do myself .
"
His manner had no air of study or exaggeration .
But when satisfied on all these points , and their acquaintance proportionably advanced , he contrived to find an opportunity , while their two fathers were engaged with each other , of introducing his mother - in - law , and speaking of her with so much handsome praise , so much warm admiration , so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father , and her very kind reception of himself , as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please -- and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her .
He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else .
"
" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs .
"
He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
"
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
If you do not call early it will be a slight .
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
He was immediately interested .
"
" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .
He shook his head and laughed .--" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion .
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs . Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman .
"
He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment .
She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself .-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ' s performance .-- I have been used to hear her ' s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .
How did Miss Campbell appear to like it ?
" You are right .
"
" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed ," said he .
" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing .
There is safety in reserve , but no attraction .
One cannot love a reserved person .
"
She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr . Elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper ' s room , or a bad butler ' s pantry , but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy , and that whenever he were attached , he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment .
CHAPTER VII
Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .
He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
"
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley .
" She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .
The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls .
Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses .
" Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was .
The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
"
I shall have no fears for you with him .
And when you get there , you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again ; and you had better name an early hour .
You will get very tired when tea is over .
"
no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .
" And no great harm if it does ," said Mr . Woodhouse .
" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles .
I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs . Goddard .
" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .
"
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .
for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner .
You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances .
" Nonsensical girl !
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
Mrs . Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting .
" One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .
" I rather wonder that it was never made before .
" You may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine .
"
Dixon in them .
" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .
Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her ' s .
Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first .
At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance .
In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
" Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax ; but it was most prudent to avoid speech .
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
But just got acquainted with Mrs . Weston , and others !-- I hate the recollection .
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen .
He started .
" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I cannot keep my eyes from her .
" How ?-- They were invited , were not they ?
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
"
I know no man more likely than Mr . Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
See the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?
I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr . Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !
"
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
no , no ;-- every feeling revolts .
" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad .
I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
"
He does not care about Jane Fairfax .
In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home .
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever .
I cannot help suspecting him .
"
"
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner .
"
Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed .
" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , I am sure .
" And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
"
" That will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet .
" And Frank Churchill was heard to say , " I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .
They have no mercy on her .
"
There was no immediate appearance .
Two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed .
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s .
She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy !-- And left a name behind her that would not soon die away .
The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
" Don ' t class us together , Harriet .
"
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him .
"
Harriet had business at Ford ' s .-- Emma thought it most prudent to go with her .
"
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
But then , Mrs . Goddard will want to see it .-- And I could take the pattern gown home any day .
But I shall want the ribbon directly -- so it had better go to Hartfield -- at least the ribbon .
"
My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
How is Mr .
Mrs . Weston told me you were here .-- Oh !
I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome .
"
I did not see you before .
.
.
My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
.
CHAPTER X
The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
" This is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated .
You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed .
At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .
" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth .
Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete .
True affection only could have prompted it .
" You speak too plain .
"
" I do not see much sign of it .
How is Miss Fairfax ?-- I hope she caught no cold last night .
"
I could not stay two minutes .
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
William Larkins mentioned it here .
He never can bear to be thanked .
" Oh !
CHAPTER XI
But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
" But will there be good room for five couple ?-- I really do not think there will .
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
So you would all .
I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !
"
Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill ' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten .
"
" There is no denying it ," he replied .
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .
It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement .
It is his own idea .
you were perfectly right !
Is not it a good exchange ?-- You consent -- I hope you consent ?
I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be .
" Sir ," said Mr . Woodhouse , rather warmly , " you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr . Perry to be that sort of character .
Mr . Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .
Nobody could be so imprudent !
Dancing with open windows !-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs . Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it .
I never could have supposed it .
One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry .
" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited --"
I doubt it .
Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !
"
" Aye , very true .
I shall never forget it .
I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry .
I was desired to say so from both .
There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .
It regarded a supper - room .
"
"
I do not wonder at you .
We are growing a little too nice .
Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both .
All the rest , in speculation at least , was perfectly smooth .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
"
Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love .
there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr . Knightley .
He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance .
He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience .
"
He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
" Ah !--( shaking his head )-- the uncertainty of when I may be able to return !-- I shall try for it with a zeal !-- It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares !-- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever .
Do not forget your engagement .
" he continued ; " every day more precious and more delightful than the day before !-- every day making me less fit to bear any other place .
" As you do us such ample justice now ," said Emma , laughing , " I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him .
Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours .
" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then "--
He was silent .
It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh .
My regard for Hartfield is most warm "--
A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial .
She has been so kind as to promise it .
In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again .
"
" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !
Her ideas only varied as to the how much .
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
Her intentions were unchanged .
Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness .
Was it impossible ?-- No .-- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour .-- For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
" I must not dwell upon it ," said she .--" I must not think of it .
"
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
It was all my doing , I know .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest .
" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .
" There is nothing to be compared to it .
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
"
"
" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful .
" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .
"
To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .
' How delightful !
"
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house .
( with a little sigh of sentiment ).
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs . Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style .
She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply ,
" My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring , or summer at farthest ," continued Mrs . Elton ; " and that will be our time for exploring .
I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards Mr . Woodhouse ), Your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .
"
" And then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly .
I absolutely cannot do without music .
" We cannot suppose ," said Emma , smiling , " that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive .
" Well ," said Mrs . Elton , laughing , " we shall see .
" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman !
I could not have believed it !
Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs . Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer .
Ah !
"
" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
Mr . Elton knows you .
" Well , papa , if this is not encouragement to marry , I do not know what is .
This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry .
"
Mrs . Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first .
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
'
but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !
One can see that she feels the want of encouragement .
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
"-- thought Emma .--" You have not deserved this .
" said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
" You are right , Mrs . Weston ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs . Elton .
Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .
"
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
"
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago .
"
Mr . Knightley was thoughtful again .
The result of his reverie was , " No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you .
He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more .
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
"
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
"
" I see what a life I am to lead among you .
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss .
"
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
Mrs . Bates , Mrs . Perry , Mrs . Goddard and others , were a good deal behind - hand in knowledge of the world , but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged .
Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons .
He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her .
"
Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax .
I always fetch the letters when I am here .
"
you are not serious now .
"
" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain .
My dear , did you change your stockings ?
The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
"
The public pays and must be served well .
" I have heard it asserted ," said John Knightley , " that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough .
I have not always known their writing apart .
And so does poor Mrs . Weston "-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her .
"
It is like a woman ' s writing .
" No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
I have a note of his .-- Do not you remember , Mrs . Weston , employing him to write for you one day ?
" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr .
"
She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs . Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .
June will soon be here .
" But have you really heard of nothing ?
" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet .
" Oh !
my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing .
"
" said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?
You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations .
I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove .
A cousin of Mr . Suckling , Mrs . Bragge , had such an infinity of applications ; every body was anxious to be in her family , for she moves in the first circle .
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in .
" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .
" Something that would do !
"
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said Jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now .
" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you ," said Mr . Weston .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
I hardly ever get a letter .
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
Oh !
a considerable journey .
"
You will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and Mr . Bragge went to London and back again with four horses .
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
I always stand up for women -- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs . Churchill ' s making incredible exertions to avoid it .
Do not run away with such an idea .
" Is not she ?
Then she is no rule for Mrs . Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld .
Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
He had done his duty and could return to his son .
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair .
May is the very month which Mrs . Churchill is ordered , or has ordered herself , to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe -- in short , to spend in London ; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring -- precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it : days almost at the longest ; weather genial and pleasant , always inviting one out , and never too hot for exercise .
I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .
"
" And I assure you , Mr . Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour .
She was the instigator .
Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves !
People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families .
The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr . Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs . Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
" That is very likely .
"
"
"
" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life .
Let them be sent to Donwell .
These amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been ?
VOLUME III
CHAPTER I
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days .
Such was his own account at Randall ' s .
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan .
Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
He would be always coming over .
The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never .
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
I have never seen either Mr . or Mrs . Elton .
" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !
"
"
Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire .
And Jane declares -- Well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) Well !
` Oh !
Delighted to hear it indeed .
I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present .-- So kind of her to think of my mother !
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
Richard ?-- Oh !
Richard ?-- I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs . Otway , I protest !-- and good Mr . Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline .-- Such a host of friends !-- and Mr . George and Mr .
"
" Oh !
" How do you like Mrs .
"
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
The ball proceeded pleasantly .
" to which his prompt reply was , " Most readily , Mrs . Weston , if you will dance with me .
"
"
She would not look again .
How very odd !
I was convinced there were two , and there is but one .
I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere .-- I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane ,-- There was a little disappointment .-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again .
Where _I_ sit is of no consequence .
"
" asked Mr . Knightley .
" said he , offering his hand .
" Indeed I will .
A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury .
But poor Harriet could not follow .
The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .
In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint .
It was no more than a wish .
It was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
"
" Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do .
" Not the least in the world .-- Did he ever give you any thing ?
" No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much .
" No , indeed I do not .
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat .
"
Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure .
But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment .
I have an idea he was standing just here .
" Ah !
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them .
" I shall be happier to burn it ," replied Harriet .
I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven !
Churchill ?
"
" Mr . Elton indeed !
"
"
" Service !
oh !
Such a change !
Consider what you are about .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
Be observant of him .
Let no name ever pass our lips .
In this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June opened upon Hartfield .
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
That Emma was his object appeared indisputable .
But while so many were devoting him to Emma , and Emma herself making him over to Harriet , Mr . Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax .
Mrs . Weston looked surprized , and said , " I did not know that he ever had any such plan .
"
"
"
I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls .
Mr . Knightley ' s eyes had preceded Miss Bates ' s in a glance at Jane .
From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
Mr . Weston had walked in .
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
The word was discovered , and with a faint smile pushed away .
She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " I did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .
We really must wish you good night .
She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr . Knightley could not tell .
She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them .
" The joke ," he replied gravely , " seemed confined to you and Mr .
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
"
" Never , never !
"
"
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
I will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference .
They could go there again with them in the autumn .
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings .
Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr . Weston ' s temper .
A large party secures its own amusement .
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
"
If Mr . Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the " Oh !
" I certainly will come .
"
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself .
" Ah !
"
" Not quite .
And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey .
Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it .
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible .
Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
Mr . Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .
He did consent .
The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
Disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- The considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it .
In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin .
" Certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ?
"
I must order the carriage .
" I am ,"-- she answered --" I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits .
"
Emma had not another word to oppose .
Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again .
Some people were always cross when they were hot .
" In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off .
" I am glad I have done being in love with him .
I want a change .
Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us .
"
"
"
" These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself .
Emma and Harriet went together ; Miss Bates and her niece , with the Eltons ; the gentlemen on horseback .
And Mr . Weston tried , in vain , to make them harmonise better .
It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
You begged hard to be commanded to come .
"
You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine .
"
Any nonsense will serve .
It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now .
Better pass it off as a joke .
"
I will do my best .
I am sure I do not know .
"
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
Understanding and gratification came together .
" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else .
"
I knew who it came from .
We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .
An old married man -- quite good for nothing .
I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot .
Come , Jane , take my other arm .
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
"
"
" Very well .
" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes .
I care for nothing else .
Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
" If you please , my dear .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
" Oh !
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
She was most forcibly struck .
The truth of this representation there was no denying .
She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her .
I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma ' am ?
"
Emma seriously hoped she would .
A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .
But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .
` It is only Mrs . Cole ,' said I , ` depend upon it .
" So very kind !
'"
Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party .
" Whenever the time may come , it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends -- but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible -- I mean , as to the character and manners of the family .
Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs . Elton ' s acquaintance .
Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- And her salary !-- I really cannot venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse .
Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane .
"
madam ," cried Emma , " if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned .
" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it .
So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma ' am , do not let us think about it any more .
"
Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence .
What Mr . Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject , being the accumulation of the ostler ' s own knowledge , and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls , was , that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill -- which messenger , however , had been no more than was expected ; and that Mr . Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines , containing , upon the whole , a tolerable account of Mrs . Churchill , and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early ; but that Mr . Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly , without waiting at all , and his horse seeming to have got a cold , Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise , and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by , the boy going a good pace , and driving very steady .
" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .
Mr . Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father .-- Mr .
But is not this a sudden scheme ?
"
" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time .
Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs . and Miss Bates , Mr . Knightley , as I told you before .
Knightley .-- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square , for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed -- but it might have happened at a better time -- and to have had longer notice of it , would have been pleasanter .-- They parted thorough friends , however ; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance , and his unfinished gallantry ;-- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion .-- He had been sitting with them half an hour , she found .
It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
"
The great Mrs . Churchill was no more .
In one point she was fully justified .
It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr . Churchill do without her ?
" and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady .
Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command .
They spoke , therefore , of Mrs . Churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .
She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed .
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her .
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
The answer was only in this short note :
" Miss Fairfax ' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise .
" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
She was sorry , very sorry .
She must see you .
" No , no ,"-- he gravely replied .--" Don ' t ask me .
"
In fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- Humph !-- In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .
"
Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward .
He is half way to Windsor by this time .
" Has your son been with you , then ?
Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is .
" Have you indeed no idea ?
"
"
" Mr . Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ," said she .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
"
" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --"
"
"
"
" thought Emma , " he would have done as much for Harriet .
At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .
It is not a connexion to gratify ; but if Mr . Churchill does not feel that , why should we ?
" cried Emma feelingly .
This was a device , I suppose , to sport with my curiosity , and exercise my talent of guessing .
" Harriet , poor Harriet !
"-- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .
Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .
"-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
" About Jane Fairfax .
" What did Mr . Weston tell you ?
Her character appeared absolutely changed .
Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax .
what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"
I know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person .
I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr . Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side .
And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing !-- I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
Are you speaking of -- Mr .
"
Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !
" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ' s having some hope of a return ?
It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr . Knightley must marry no one but herself !
What blindness , what madness , had led her on !
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
" Mr . Martin !
"
Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps .
He was coming through the hall .
To that point went every leisure moment which her father ' s claims on her allowed , and every moment of involuntary absence of mind .
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
This point was just arranged , when a visitor arrived to tear Emma ' s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them , sleeping or waking , the last twenty - four hours -- Mrs . Weston , who had been calling on her daughter - in - law elect , and took Hartfield in her way home , almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself , to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview .
Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
This was one of her expressions .
" Poor girl !
" Poor girl !
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .
I am sure she is very good -- I hope she will be very happy .
" Are you well , my Emma ?
Alas !
They walked together .
She thought he was often looking at her , and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give .
Yet she could not bear this silence .
" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you .
" Have I ?
" Her arm was pressed again , as he added , in a more broken and subdued accent , " The feelings of the warmest friendship -- Indignation -- Abominable scoundrel !
I am sorry for _her_ .
"
"-- but checking himself --" No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much .-- He is no object of regret , indeed !
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
" I have no doubt of their being happy together ," said Emma ; " I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached .
" returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
"
" You speak as if you envied him .
"
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
Emma , I must tell you what you will not ask , though I may wish it unsaid the next moment .
then , don ' t speak it , don ' t speak it ," she eagerly cried .
Emma could not bear to give him pain .
"-- repeated Mr .
"
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice .
As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy .
" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed .
" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent .
My courage rises while I write .
It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble .
This was the fact .
I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence .
If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ;-- and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .
You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you .
And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .
I cannot doubt it .
My uncle has been too good for me to encroach .-- I must still add to this long letter .
The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me .
She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable .
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
CHAPTER XV
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference .
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right .
"
" And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment .
Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable .
` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .
"
But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ' s happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her !-- Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy !
It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
The difference of Harriet at Mrs . Goddard ' s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
There was consciousness , animation , and warmth ; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted .-- She came forward with an offered hand ; and said , in a low , but very feeling tone ,
Emma could have wished Mrs . Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs . Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
You see how delightfully she writes .
she is a sweet creature !
I managed it extremely well .
It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .
if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst !
But yet I think there was something wanting .
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you .
Elton ?-- That will be a favour indeed !
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
They seem not able to do any thing without him .--` Upon my word , Mr . E .,' I often say , ` rather you than I .-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants .
" said Emma .
no , the meeting is certainly to - day ," was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- " I do believe ," she continued , " this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .
It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs . Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .
" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come !-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with .
"
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say .
I feel it so very due .
We must do whatever is to be done quickest , and I think our feelings will lose no time there .
It would be a great comfort to Mr . Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr . Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs . Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .
It will be the only difference .
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
" Do you ?-- I have no doubt .
I do not believe I did you any good .
I did it because I thought it would offend you ; but , as you made no objection , I never did it again .
This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
" He writes like a sensible man ," replied Emma , when she had read the letter .
He seems perfectly unprepared for that .
"
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr . Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying --" Those matters will take care of themselves ; the young people will find a way .
It was all right , all open , all equal .
" It is to be a secret , I conclude ," said he .
But that would be all over now .-- Poor fellow !-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_ .
But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together .
" Good or bad ?
" I mean that he has done it ," answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , " and been accepted .
"-- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , " Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .
Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
His good sense and good principles would delight you .-- As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
"
" Do you dare say this ?
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?
"
"
" Me !
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over .
"
I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon .
"
But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late .
" I never had the smallest , I assure you .
" That appears quite wonderful .
" It is not now worth a regret ," said Emma .
" Oh !
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,
"
Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father .-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt ' s jewels .
This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
Harriet was a little distressed -- did look a little foolish at first : but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly , and self - deceived , before , her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words , and leave her without a care for the past , and with the fullest exultation in the present and future ; for , as to her friend ' s approbation , Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature , by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations .-- Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley ' s , and the dinner the next day ; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight .
Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
[ Persuasion by Jane Austen 1818 ]
Chapter 1
He had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty - four , was still a very fine man .
His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .
For one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .
Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .
He was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .
As the head of the house , he felt that he ought to have been consulted , especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand ; " For they must have been seen together ," he observed , " once at Tattersall ' s , and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons .
This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still , after an interval of several years , felt with anger by Elizabeth , who had liked the man for himself , and still more for being her father ' s heir , and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot ' s eldest daughter .
Such were Elizabeth Elliot ' s sentiments and sensations ; such the cares to alloy , the agitations to vary , the sameness and the elegance , the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life ; such the feelings to give interest to a long , uneventful residence in one country circle , to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad , no talents or accomplishments for home , to occupy .
While Lady Elliot lived , there had been method , moderation , and economy , which had just kept him within his income ; but with her had died all such right - mindedness , and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it .
If he will adopt these regulations , in seven years he will be clear ; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth , that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions ; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people , by acting like a man of principle .
" Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate , he had no scruple ," he said , " in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side .
Lady Russell was fond of Bath , in short , and disposed to think it must suit them all ; and as to her young friend ' s health , by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge , every danger would be avoided ; and it was in fact , a change which must do both health and spirits good .
The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part , and a very material part of the scheme , which had been happily engrafted on the beginning .
She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London , sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out , and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience ; but always in vain : Elizabeth would go her own way ; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay ; turning from the society of so deserving a sister , to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility .
Many a noble fortune has been made during the war .
Therefore , Sir Walter , what I would take leave to suggest is , that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention ; which must be contemplated as a possible thing , because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other ; consequence has its tax ; I , John Shepherd , might conceal any family - matters that I chose , for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me ; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude ; and therefore , thus much I venture upon , that it will not greatly surprise me if , with all our caution , some rumour of the truth should get abroad ; in the supposition of which , as I was going to observe , since applications will unquestionably follow , I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to ; and beg leave to add , that two hours will bring me over at any time , to save you the trouble of replying .
But soon afterwards , rising and pacing the room , he observed sarcastically --
"
I have known a good deal of the profession ; and besides their liberality , they are so neat and careful in all their ways !
I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable ; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden .
Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights .
I venture to hint , that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own , as John Shepherd will be for him .
What Miss Anne says , is very true ," was Mr Shepherd ' s rejoinder , and " Oh !
One day last spring , in town , I was in company with two men , striking instances of what I am talking of ; Lord St Ives , whose father we all know to have been a country curate , without bread to eat ; I was to give place to Lord St Ives , and a certain Admiral Baldwin , the most deplorable - looking personage you can imagine ; his face the colour of mahogany , rough and rugged to the last degree ; all lines and wrinkles , nine grey hairs of a side , and nothing but a dab of powder at top .
What do you take his age to be ?
In fact , as I have long been convinced , though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn , it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any , who can live in a regular way , in the country , choosing their own hours , following their own pursuits , and living on their own property , without the torment of trying for more ; it is only their lot , I say , to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost : I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young .
He was in the Trafalgar action , and has been in the East Indies since ; he was stationed there , I believe , several years .
"
At this moment I cannot recollect his name , though I have heard it so lately .
Penelope , my dear , can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford : Mrs Croft ' s brother ?
A name that I am so very well acquainted with ; knew the gentleman so well by sight ; seen him a hundred times ; came to consult me once , I remember , about a trespass of one of his neighbours ; farmer ' s man breaking into his orchard ; wall torn down ; apples stolen ; caught in the fact ; and afterwards , contrary to my judgement , submitted to an amicable compromise .
I thought you were speaking of some man of property : Mr Wentworth was nobody , I remember ; quite unconnected ; nothing to do with the Strafford family .
As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter , he mentioned it no more ; returning , with all his zeal , to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour ; their age , and number , and fortune ; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall , and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it ; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot : an extraordinary taste , certainly , could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter ' s estimate of the dues of a tenant .
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other , or which had been the happiest : she , in receiving his declarations and proposals , or he in having them accepted .
Troubles soon arose .
He had been lucky in his profession ; but spending freely , what had come freely , had realized nothing .
But it was not a merely selfish caution , under which she acted , in putting an end to it .
They knew not each other ' s opinion , either its constancy or its change , on the one leading point of Anne ' s conduct , for the subject was never alluded to ; but Anne , at seven - and - twenty , thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen .
The sister , Mrs Croft , had then been out of England , accompanying her husband on a foreign station , and her own sister , Mary , had been at school while it all occurred ; and never admitted by the pride of some , and the delicacy of others , to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards .
" reciprocal compliments , which would have been esteemed about equal .
The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas ; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month , there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement .
" I cannot possibly do without Anne ," was Mary ' s reasoning ; and Elizabeth ' s reply was , " Then I am sure Anne had better stay , for nobody will want her in Bath .
" Mrs Clay ," said she , warmly , " never forgets who she is ; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be , I can assure you , that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice , and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people .
" There is hardly any personal defect ," replied Anne , " which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to .
Lady Russell felt this break - up of the family exceedingly .
" Oh !
"
It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday .
" Dear me !
"
" Did you go then ?
I was very well yesterday ; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning .
" I am very glad you were well enough , and I hope you had a pleasant party .
"
" Where shall we go ?
Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance ; but still , saved as we all are , by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange , she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments ; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together , that good - humoured mutual affection , of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters .
"
He had very good spirits , which never seemed much affected by his wife ' s occasional lowness , bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne ' s admiration , and upon the whole , though there was very often a little disagreement ( in which she had sometimes more share than she wished , being appealed to by both parties ), they might pass for a happy couple .
They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money , and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father ; but here , as on most topics , he had the superiority , for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made , he always contended for his father ' s having many other uses for his money , and a right to spend it as he liked .
"
I am sure , Anne , if you would , you might persuade him that I really am very ill -- a great deal worse than I ever own .
"
Mary ' s declaration was , " I hate sending the children to the Great House , though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them , for she humours and indulges them to such a degree , and gives them so much trash and sweet things , that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day .
" And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne , to say , " Oh !
They are quite different creatures with you !
But to be sure , in general they are so spoilt !
It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them .
"
" Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady , that it would be high treason to call it in question ; but I am sure , without exaggeration , that her upper house - maid and laundry - maid , instead of being in their business , are gadding about the village , all day long .
She could do little more than listen patiently , soften every grievance , and excuse each to the other ; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours , and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister ' s benefit .
She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves , but having no voice , no knowledge of the harp , and no fond parents , to sit by and fancy themselves delighted , her performance was little thought of , only out of civility , or to refresh the others , as she was well aware .
Lord bless me !
Michaelmas came ; and now Anne ' s heart must be in Kellynch again .
Mrs Croft , though neither tall nor fat , had a squareness , uprightness , and vigour of form , which gave importance to her person .
She was quite easy on that head , and consequently full of strength and courage , till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft ' s suddenly saying ,--
" added Mrs Croft .
She could now answer as she ought ; and was happy to feel , when Mrs Croft ' s next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke , that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother .
Only think if anything should happen ?
This was quite a female case , and it would be highly absurd in him , who could be of no use at home , to shut himself up .
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter .
"
Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain .
"
" Well , if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself , suppose you were to go , as well as your husband .
" Are you serious ?
Oh !
They were gone , she hoped , to be happy , however oddly constructed such happiness might seem ; as for herself , she was left with as many sensations of comfort , as were , perhaps , ever likely to be hers .
She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting .
In two minutes after Charles ' s preparation , the others appeared ; they were in the drawing - room .
Was this like wishing to avoid her ?
Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister ' s in a common way , but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound .
" Altered beyond his knowledge .
" These were words which could not but dwell with her .
Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them .
He had thought her wretchedly altered , and in the first moment of appeal , had spoken as he felt .
He had not forgiven Anne Elliot .
She had given him up to oblige others .
" A strong mind , with sweetness of manner ," made the first and the last of the description .
" Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with , but it must not be much .
When he talked , she heard the same voice , and discerned the same mind .
Anne suppressed a smile , and listened kindly , while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more ; and for a few minutes , therefore , could not keep pace with the conversation of the others .
Quite worn out and broken up .
"
" I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse , which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember , and which at last , on some very wet day , is lent to yourself .
"
" Oh !
He had a wife .
Excellent fellow .
Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions .
I am glad I was not a week later then .
"
There can be no want of gallantry , Admiral , in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high , and this is what I do .
"
" Nothing to the purpose ," replied her brother .
Pray , what would become of us poor sailors ' wives , who often want to be conveyed to one port or another , after our husbands , if everybody had your feelings ?
" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft .
I have always been blessed with excellent health , and no climate disagrees with me .
I am quite of your opinion .
The Miss Hayters , the females of the family of cousins already mentioned , were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him ; and as for Henrietta and Louisa , they both seemed so entirely occupied by him , that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good - will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals .
If he were a little spoilt by such universal , such eager admiration , who could wonder ?
She is never tired of playing .
It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day .
Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins , and a very amiable , pleasing young man , between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth ' s introduction .
Henrietta fully thought so herself , before Captain Wentworth came ; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten .
Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth !
I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family , and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them .
It did not appear to me that -- in short , you know , Dr Shirley must have a curate , and you had secured his promise .
The younger boy , a remarkable stout , forward child , of two years old , having got the door opened for him by some one without , made his determined appearance among them , and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on , and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away .
Once she did contrive to push him away , but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly .
Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise .
One morning , about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a - shooting together , as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work , they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion - house .
" What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister !
They meant to take a long drive this morning ; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills .
They talked of coming into this side of the country .
" But nobody heard , or , at least , nobody answered her .
Winthrop , however , or its environs -- for young men are , sometimes to be met with , strolling about near home -- was their destination ; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures , where the ploughs at work , and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence , and meaning to have spring again , they gained the summit of the most considerable hill , which parted Uppercross and Winthrop , and soon commanded a full view of the latter , at the foot of the hill on the other side .
Henrietta , conscious and ashamed , and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path , or leaning against any gate , was ready to do as Mary wished ; but " No !
Charles , in the meanwhile , was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt , now that he was so near ; and very evidently , though more fearfully , trying to induce his wife to go too .
What Anne first heard was --
" And so , I made her go .
I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense .
When I have made up my mind , I have made it ; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to - day ; and yet , she was as near giving it up , out of nonsensical complaisance !
"
This nut ," he continued , with playful solemnity , " while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot , is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of .
For herself , she feared to move , lest she should be seen .
"
" Do you mean that she refused him ?
" Oh !
"
" I do not exactly know , for Henrietta and I were at school at the time ; but I believe about a year before he married Mary .
I wish she had accepted him .
Her own emotions still kept her fixed .
This long meadow bordered a lane , which their footpath , at the end of it was to cross , and when the party had all reached the gate of exit , the carriage advancing in the same direction , which had been some time heard , was just coming up , and proved to be Admiral Croft ' s gig .
He and his wife had taken their intended drive , and were returning home .
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in , they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired ; it would save her a full mile , and they were going through Uppercross .
" Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home .
" Very good humoured , unaffected girls , indeed ," said Mrs Croft , in a tone of calmer praise , such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother ; " and a very respectable family .
One could not be connected with better people .
A letter from his friend , Captain Harville , having found him out at last , had brought intelligence of Captain Harville ' s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter ; of their being therefore , quite unknowingly , within twenty miles of each other .
Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself , it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross ; though November , the weather was by no means bad ; and , in short , Louisa , who was the most eager of the eager , having formed the resolution to go , and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked , being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way , bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer ; and to Lyme they were to go -- Charles , Mary , Anne , Henrietta , Louisa , and Captain Wentworth .
The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night ; but to this Mr Musgrove , for the sake of his horses , would not consent ; and when it came to be rationally considered , a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place , after deducting seven hours , as the nature of the country required , for going and returning .
The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms , and still descending , soon found themselves on the sea - shore ; and lingering only , as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea , who ever deserved to look on it at all , proceeded towards the Cobb , equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth ' s account : for in a small house , near the foot of an old pier of unknown date , were the Harvilles settled .
"
Captain Harville was a tall , dark man , with a sensible , benevolent countenance ; a little lame ; and from strong features and want of health , looking much older than Captain Wentworth .
The varieties in the fitting - up of the rooms , where the common necessaries provided by the owner , in the common indifferent plight , were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood , excellently worked up , and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited , were more than amusing to Anne ; connected as it all was with his profession , the fruit of its labours , the effect of its influence on his habits , the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented , made it to her a something more , or less , than gratification .
They went back to dress and dine ; and so well had the scheme answered already , that nothing was found amiss ; though its being " so entirely out of season ," and the " no thoroughfare of Lyme ," and the " no expectation of company ," had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn .
When the evening was over , Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before ; nor could she help fearing , on more serious reflection , that , like many other great moralists and preachers , she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination .
Chapter 12
He declares himself , that coming to Lyme for a month , did him more good than all the medicine he took ; and , that being by the sea , always makes him feel young again .
Do not you , Anne ?
Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley , who have been doing good all their lives , wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross , where , excepting our family , they seem shut out from all the world .
I wish his friends would propose it to him .
And at Lyme too , only seventeen miles off , he would be near enough to hear , if people thought there was anything to complain of .
I am afraid of her , as I have told you before , quite afraid of her , because she is so very clever ; but I respect her amazingly , and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross .
When they came to the steps , leading upwards from the beach , a gentleman , at the same moment preparing to come down , politely drew back , and stopped to give them way .
They ascended and passed him ; and as they passed , Anne ' s face caught his eye , and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration , which she could not be insensible of .
She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves , and determined that a well - looking groom , who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back , should be his servant .
It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves ; and this second meeting , short as it was , also proved again by the gentleman ' s looks , that he thought hers very lovely , and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies , that he was a man of exceedingly good manners .
They had nearly done breakfast , when the sound of a carriage , ( almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme ) drew half the party to the window .
" Many had looked on each other , and many had repeated the name , before all this had been got through , even by the smart rapidity of a waiter .
In the very same inn with us !
Do you think he had the Elliot countenance ?
"
" Miss Elliot ," said he , speaking rather low , " you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much .
It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?
We cannot part .
"
) " The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before ; no danger of her being sent to sea again .
Anne did think on the question with perfect decision , and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish , or as his seemed able to bear , for he was too much affected to renew the subject , and when he spoke again , it was of something totally different .
He advised her against it , thought the jar too great ; but no , he reasoned and talked in vain , she smiled and said , " I am determined I will :" he put out his hands ; she was too precipitate by half a second , she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb , and was taken up lifeless !
Captain Benwick obeyed , and Charles at the same moment , disengaging himself from his wife , they were both with him ; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them , and everything was done that Anne had prompted , but in vain ; while Captain Wentworth , staggering against the wall for his support , exclaimed in the bitterest agony --
He knows where a surgeon is to be found .
Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea , and in a moment ( it was all done in rapid moments ) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse - like figure entirely to the brother ' s care , and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity .
" Yes , yes , to the inn ," repeated Captain Wentworth , comparatively collected , and eager to be doing something .
The tone , the look , with which " Thank God !
" was uttered by Captain Wentworth , Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her ; nor the sight of him afterwards , as he sat near a table , leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed , as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul , and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them .
They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect .
Between these two , she could want no possible attendance by day or night .
He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville ; but as to leaving his sister in such a state , he neither ought , nor would .
The usefulness of her staying !
"
And to go home without Charles , too , without her husband !
Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill - judging claims of Mary ; but so it must be , and they set off for the town , Charles taking care of his sister , and Captain Benwick attending to her .
" Oh God !
She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character .
Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon .
" I have been considering what we had best do .
She could not stand it .
When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over , and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped , and the daughter all the better for being with them , he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme ; and when the horses were baited , he was off .
" She really left nothing for Mary to do .
Mary had been hysterical again this morning .
When he came away , she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick , which , he hoped , would do her good .
Anne was to leave them on the morrow , an event which they all dreaded .
They were wretched comforters for one another .
She had little difficulty ; it was soon determined that they would go ; go to - morrow , fix themselves at the inn , or get into lodgings , as it suited , and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved .
If Louisa recovered , it would all be well again .
An hour ' s complete leisure for such reflections as these , on a dark November day , a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows , was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell ' s carriage exceedingly welcome ; and yet , though desirous to be gone , she could not quit the Mansion House , or look an adieu to the Cottage , with its black , dripping and comfortless veranda , or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village , without a saddened heart .
There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell ' s joy in meeting her .
She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross .
The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch , and which she had felt slighted , and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves , were now become but of secondary interest .
Lady Russell had only to listen composedly , and wish them happy , but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure , in pleased contempt , that the man who at twenty - three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot , should , eight years afterwards , be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove .
The first three or four days passed most quietly , with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme , which found their way to Anne , she could not tell how , and brought a rather improving account of Louisa .
By remaining in the neighbourhood , I am become inured to it .
She could have said more on the subject ; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts , and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants , felt the parish to be so sure of a good example , and the poor of the best attention and relief , that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal , she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay , and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners '.
Oh , how fallen in their destination !
" No , except when she thought of her mother , and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside , she had no sigh of that description to heave .
" Ay , a very bad business indeed .
Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it .
" Well , whenever it suits you .
A good place is not it ?
Anne , finding she might decline it , did so , very gratefully .
My wife should have the credit of them , however .
And take it altogether , now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge , there is not one that we like better than this .
Chapter 14
They had left Louisa beginning to sit up ; but her head , though clear , was exceedingly weak , and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness ; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well , it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home ; and her father and mother , who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays , had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them .
Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her ; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid - servant to wait , and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence ; but then , she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was , and there had been so much going on every day , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles , and she had got books from the library , and changed them so often , that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme .
She had been taken to Charmouth too , and she had bathed , and she had gone to church , and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross ; and all this , joined to the sense of being so very useful , had made really an agreeable fortnight .
Anne enquired after Captain Benwick , Mary ' s face was clouded directly .
" Oh !
I do not know what he would be at .
Charles laughed again and said , " Now Mary , you know very well how it really was .
It was all your doing ," ( turning to Anne .
That is the fact , upon my honour , Mary knows it is .
"
So , I give you notice , Lady Russell .
"
He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived .
He has walked with me , sometimes , from one end of the sands to the other , without saying a word .
Give him a book , and he will read all day long .
"
With regard to Captain Wentworth , though Anne hazarded no enquiries , there was voluntary communication sufficient .
He had not seen Louisa ; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview , that he did not press for it at all ; and , on the contrary , seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days , till her head was stronger .
Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles , whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage , expressly arrived to amuse them .
Louisa was now recovering apace .
when shall I leave you again ?
Her making a fourth , when they sat down to dinner , was noticed as an advantage .
Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after .
They had Mr Elliot too .
This was an article not to be entered on by himself ; but a very intimate friend of his , a Colonel Wallis , a highly respectable man , perfectly the gentleman , ( and not an ill - looking man , Sir Walter added ), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings , and had , at his own particular request , been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot , had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage , which made a material difference in the discredit of it .
There had been the charm .
Here was a great deal to soften the business .
Elizabeth was certainly very handsome , with well - bred , elegant manners , and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot , knowing her but in public , and when very young himself .
How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one .
Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice , or too observant if Elizabeth were his object ; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so , and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea , seemed apparent by a glance or two between them , while Mr Elliot ' s frequent visits were talked of .
yes , perhaps , it had been Mr Elliot .
Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men , and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere .
" Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them !
" Modest Sir Walter !
"
"
They could think of no one else .
Anne drew a little back , while the others received his compliments , and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour , but " he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before ," & c . & c ; which was all as politely done , and as politely taken , as possible , but her part must follow then .
His tone , his expressions , his choice of subject , his knowing where to stop ; it was all the operation of a sensible , discerning mind .
Having alluded to " an accident ," he must hear the whole .
When he questioned , Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also , but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt .
She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell , in the wish of really comprehending what had passed , and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it .
You must not run away from us now .
In the course of the same morning , Anne and her father chancing to be alone together , he began to compliment her on her improved looks ; he thought her " less thin in her person , in her cheeks ; her skin , her complexion , greatly improved ; clearer , fresher .
Lady Russell ' s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point , in her intercourse in Camden Place .
As Mr Elliot became known to her , she grew more charitable , or more indifferent , towards the others .
Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay .
very well ; time will explain .
"
The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple , and her daughter , the Honourable Miss Carteret ; and all the comfort of No .--, Camden Place , was swept away for many days ; for the Dalrymples ( in Anne ' s opinion , most unfortunately ) were cousins of the Elliots ; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly .
No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland .
The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner ; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself , no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch , and , consequently , there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed .
Good company requires only birth , education , and manners , and with regard to education is not very nice .
Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place , and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible ?
While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place , Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description .
She had called on her former governess , and had heard from her of there being an old school - fellow in Bath , who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering .
Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on , and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation .
It was the choicest gift of Heaven ; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which , by a merciful appointment , it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want .
She had weathered it , however , and could truly say that it had done her good .
" And she ," said Mrs Smith , " besides nursing me most admirably , has really proved an invaluable acquaintance .
A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes .
Here and there , human nature may be great in times of trial ; but generally speaking , it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber : it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude , that one hears of .
She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings ; a mere pretty , silly , expensive , fashionable woman , I believe ; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery .
They were only asked , she was sure , because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold , was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her ; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity --" She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow .
A widow Mrs Smith ; and who was her husband ?
" She sees nothing to blame in it ," replied Anne ; " on the contrary , she approves it , and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs Smith .
Mrs Smith !
Such a name !
Anne kept her appointment ; the others kept theirs , and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening .
She had been the only one of the set absent , for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship ' s service themselves , but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others , and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot ; and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early , and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her .
Her kind , compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow , sick and reduced , seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot .
He thought her a most extraordinary young woman ; in her temper , manners , mind , a model of female excellence .
Her early impressions were incurable .
She prized the frank , the open - hearted , the eager character beyond all others .
It was three weeks since she had heard at all .
The Crofts must be in Bath !
" What is this ?
The Crofts who rent Kellynch ?
those letters are convenient passports .
" My dear Anne ,-- I make no apology for my silence , because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath .
We have had a very dull Christmas ; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays .
Charles heard it quite by chance ; they have not had the civility to give me any notice , or of offering to take anything .
I do not think they improve at all as neighbours .
In the first place , I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday , offering to convey anything to you ; a very kind , friendly note indeed , addressed to me , just as it ought ; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like .
But now for Louisa .
She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely , and in the evening we went to ask her how she did , when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party , for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles ; and what do you think was the reason ?
We are all very well pleased , however , for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth , it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter ; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent , and Captain Benwick is expected to - day .
And this is the end , you see , of Captain Benwick ' s being supposed to be an admirer of yours .
" How is Mary ?
"
Elizabeth , may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place ?
Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel !
Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove !
The answer soon presented itself .
She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment .
He would gain cheerfulness , and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron ; nay , that was probably learnt already ; of course they had fallen in love over poetry .
The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street , perfectly to Sir Walter ' s satisfaction .
Thank you , thank you .
But what a thing here is , by way of a boat !
What queer fellows your fine painters must be , to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that ?
Well ," ( turning away ), " now , where are you bound ?
" That I will , with all my heart , and farther , too .
" taking a last look at the picture , as they began to be in motion .
She has a blister on one of her heels , as large as a three - shilling piece .
There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson .
It suits us very well .
We do not like our lodgings here the worse , I can tell you , for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth .
" Ay , ay , Miss Louisa Musgrove , that is the name .
He was courting her week after week .
The only wonder was , what they could be waiting for , till the business at Lyme came ; then , indeed , it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right .
When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward ' s , and there he has been ever since .
" Indeed you are mistaken there , sir ; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick ' s manners .
I thought them particularly pleasing , and I will answer for it , they would generally please .
It is not a mere bit of gossip .
" Now he must begin all over again with somebody else .
I think we must get him to Bath .
Do not you think , Miss Elliot , we had better try to get him to Bath ?
"
They were in Milsom Street .
It began to rain , not much , but enough to make shelter desirable for women , and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple ' s carriage , which was seen waiting at a little distance ; she , Anne , and Mrs Clay , therefore , turned into Molland ' s , while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple , to request her assistance .
much thicker than Miss Anne ' s ; and , in short , her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be , and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined , that the others were obliged to settle it for them ; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already , and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal , that his cousin Anne ' s boots were rather the thickest .
She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door ; she wanted to see if it rained .
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight .
She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments .
They had by dint of being so very much together , got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness ; but he could not do it now .
"
" being all that she had time for , as she passed away .
What a very good - looking man !
" And so do I .
No comparison .
"
She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time ; but alas !
But it was more probable that he should be come to stay .
Of course they must attend .
If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again , she fancied she should be satisfied ; and as to the power of addressing him , she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred .
"
But hardly were they so settled , when the door opened again , and Captain Wentworth walked in alone .
Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne ; she knew nothing of their looks , and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done .
While they were speaking , a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear .
After talking , however , of the weather , and Bath , and the concert , their conversation began to flag , and so little was said at last , that she was expecting him to go every moment , but he did not ; he seemed in no hurry to leave her ; and presently with renewed spirit , with a little smile , a little glow , he said --
"
" I confess that I do think there is a disparity , too great a disparity , and in a point no less essential than mind .
But I have no reason to suppose it so .
A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman .
He ought not ; he does not .
We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours , and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment .
So much novelty and beauty !
" Lady Dalrymple , Lady Dalrymple ," was the rejoicing sound ; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance , Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her .
But " they should meet again .
Her happiness was from within .
Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed ; but she knew nothing about it .
You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted , transposed , curtailed Italian lines , into clear , comprehensible , elegant English .
"
"
" A very fine young man indeed !
" More air than one often sees in Bath .
" No , I just know his name .
As her eyes fell on him , his seemed to be withdrawn from her .
It had that appearance .
She had no longer any inclination to talk to him .
Now she hoped for some beneficial change ; and , after a period of nothing - saying amongst the party , some of them did decide on going in quest of tea .
He did not come however .
Why was it ?
" No !
Chapter 21
All that she could tell she told most gladly , but the all was little for one who had been there , and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith , who had already heard , through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter , rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate , and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company .
Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs Smith .
It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect .
But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off ; and we were exceedingly well placed , that is , for hearing ; I must not say for seeing , because I appear to have seen very little .
" But I ought to have looked about me more ," said Anne , conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about , that the object only had been deficient .
"
A blush overspread Anne ' s cheeks .
"
"
She caught it instantaneously ; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety , soon added , more composedly , " Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot ?
"
"
" No ," replied Anne , " nor next week , nor next , nor next .
I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week .
Till it does come , you know , we women never mean to have anybody .
"
He seems to have a calm decided temper , not at all open to dangerous impressions .
I consider him with great respect .
I have no reason , from any thing that has fallen within my observation , to do otherwise .
"
" It first came into my head ," replied Mrs Smith , " upon finding how much you were together , and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you ; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way .
" Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday ?
Was not it Mrs Speed , as usual , or the maid ?
" I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years ?
" I did .
"
Then do tell me what he was at that time of life .
They were both silent : Mrs Smith very thoughtful .
He has no feeling for others .
You must allow for an injured , angry woman .
The intimacy had been formed before our marriage .
I found them most intimate friends ; and I , too , became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot , and entertained the highest opinion of him .
" He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him , but I heard him speak of them for ever .
"
I have always understood they were not a happy couple .
He had no concealments with me .
" To be sure I did ; very often .
" This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night ," cried Anne .
Money , money , was all that he wanted .
Depend upon it , whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now , as a young man he had not the smallest value for it .
It would not be fair ; and yet you ought to have proof , for what is all this but assertion , and you shall have proof .
" Indeed , my dear Mrs Smith , I want none ," cried Anne .
Anne , seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it , did as she was desired .
The box was brought and placed before her , and Mrs Smith , sighing over it as she unlocked it , said --
At present , believe me , I have no need of your services , being in cash again .
Give me joy : I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss .
He is worse than last year .
I am sick of it .
" The language , I know , is highly disrespectful .
" I can explain this too ," cried Mrs Smith , smiling .
I cannot produce written proof again , but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire , of what he is now wanting , and what he is now doing .
He is no hypocrite now .
I will give you my authority : his friend Colonel Wallis .
"
When I talked of a whole history , therefore , you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed .
Mr Elliot ' s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father .
" I know you did ; I know it all perfectly , but --"
" Only give me a hearing .
But there was another , and an earlier , which I will now explain .
"
Here Mrs Smith paused a moment ; but Anne had not a word to say , and she continued --
Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man .
You can imagine what an artful man would do ; and with this guide , perhaps , may recollect what you have seen him do .
"
" He thinks Mrs Clay afraid of him , aware that he sees through her , and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence .
A scheme , worthy of Mrs Wallis ' s understanding , by all accounts ; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it .
"
But Mr Elliot was not done with .
She learned that ( the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot ' s marriage ) they had been as before always together , and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune .
Mr Elliot , raised by his marriage to great affluence , and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself , ( for with all his self - indulgence he had become a prudent man ), and beginning to be rich , just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor , seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend ' s probable finances , but , on the contrary , had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin ; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined .
The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it .
It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne ' s good offices with Mr Elliot .
Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him , as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed .
Chapter 22
He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth , in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness ; and the evil of his attentions last night , the irremediable mischief he might have done , was considered with sensations unqualified , unperplexed .
Pity for him was all over .
But this was the only point of relief .
" I had not the smallest intention of asking him ," said Elizabeth , with affected carelessness , " but he gave so many hints ; so Mrs Clay says , at least .
Each behaving so pleasantly .
" Quite delightful !
" Exactly like father and son !
" My dear Miss Elliot !
"
She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere , but now she saw insincerity in everything .
He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest , bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable .
You need not tell her so , but I thought her dress hideous the other night .
Something so formal and arrange in her air !
"
Make a civil message ; but I shall only leave my card .
The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville ' s wanting to come to Bath on business .
His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see ; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding - clothes for herself and her sister ; and , in short , it ended in being his mother ' s party , that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville ; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience .
" And a very good living it was ," Charles added : " only five - and - twenty miles from Uppercross , and in a very fine country : fine part of Dorsetshire .
In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom , surrounded by three great proprietors , each more careful and jealous than the other ; and to two of the three at least , Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation .
"
She never did , you know .
"
His reading has done him no harm , for he has fought as well as read .
He is a brave fellow .
The visit passed off altogether in high good humour .
Elizabeth was , for a short time , suffering a good deal .
They will be delighted to come to - morrow evening .
She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot , and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , who were fortunately already engaged to come ; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention .
It was a heartiness , and a warmth , and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more , from the sad want of such blessings at home .
He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation .
I recollect .
"
Not know Mr Elliot , indeed !
He has changed his hour of going , I suppose , that is all , or I may be mistaken , I might not attend ;" and walked back to her chair , recomposed , and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well .
" Good heavens , Charles !
Never worth remembering .
"
We were asked on purpose to be introduced .
" We had better put it off .
Eight years and a half is a period .
They were obliged to move .
After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings , she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves .
The interruption had been short , though severe , and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out , but not to Anne .
He held the card in his hand after they were gone , as if deeply considering it .
She exclaimed , however , with a very tolerable imitation of nature : --
"
She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner .
She had only to submit , sit down , be outwardly composed , and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed .
Two minutes after her entering the room , Captain Wentworth said --
Materials were at hand , on a separate table ; he went to it , and nearly turning his back to them all , was engrossed by writing .
The two ladies continued to talk , to re - urge the same admitted truths , and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation , but Anne heard nothing distinctly ; it was only a buzz of words in her ear , her mind was in confusion .
Captain Harville , who had in truth been hearing none of it , now left his seat , and moved to a window , and Anne seeming to watch him , though it was from thorough absence of mind , became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood .
But who else was there to employ ?
" That I can easily believe .
We cannot help ourselves .
"
He has not been forced upon any exertion .
I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental ; and that as our bodies are the strongest , so are our feelings ; capable of bearing most rough usage , and riding out the heaviest weather .
Neither time , nor health , nor life , to be called your own .
" Have you finished your letter ?
" said Captain Harville .
I am in very good anchorage here ," ( smiling at Anne ,) " well supplied , and want for nothing .
" We never shall .
"
"
Anne knew not how to understand it .
" I can listen no longer in silence .
I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach .
You pierce my soul .
Have you not seen this ?
" I must go , uncertain of my fate ; but I shall return hither , or follow your party , as soon as possible .
But the chair would never do .
Worse than all !
"
"
Anne could do no more ; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity .
Presently , struck by a sudden thought , Charles said --
" Captain Wentworth , which way are you going ?
"
All the little variations of the last week were gone through ; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end .
That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath ; that had returned , after a short suspension , to ruin the concert ; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done , or omitted to say and do , in the last four - and - twenty hours .
That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment .
To a degree , I could contradict this instantly ; but , when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same -- her own family , nay , perhaps herself -- I was no longer at my own disposal .
I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways ; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls , at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report , were there no other ill effects .
Anne smiled , and let it pass .
It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach .
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once , remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety , not of risk .
In marrying a man indifferent to me , all risk would have been incurred , and all duty violated .
I had no reason to believe her of less authority now .
The force of habit was to be added .
I left you in this belief ; and yet , I was determined to see you again .
Do not mistake me , however .
It was , perhaps , one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides ; and for myself , I certainly never should , in any circumstance of tolerable similarity , give such advice .
I have now , as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature , nothing to reproach myself with ; and if I mistake not , a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman ' s portion .
I trust to being in charity with her soon .
But I too have been thinking over the past , and a question has suggested itself , whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady ?
Would you , in short , have renewed the engagement then ?
Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared .
They might in fact , have borne down a great deal more than they met with , for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth .
This however was what Lady Russell had now to do .
Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her , no landed estate , no headship of a family ; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet , she would not change situations with Anne .
He soon quitted Bath ; and on Mrs Clay ' s quitting it soon afterwards , and being next heard of as established under his protection in London , it was evident how double a game he had been playing , and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman , at least .
Mrs Clay ' s affections had overpowered her interest , and she had sacrificed , for the young man ' s sake , the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter .
They had their great cousins , to be sure , to resort to for comfort ; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others , without being flattered and followed in turn , is but a state of half enjoyment .
The disproportion in their fortune was nothing ; it did not give her a moment ' s regret ; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly , nothing of respectability , of harmony , of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters , was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity .
Finis
[ Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen 1811 ]
The late owner of this estate was a single man , who lived to a very advanced age , and who for many years of his life , had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister .
But her death , which happened ten years before his own , produced a great alteration in his home ; for to supply her loss , he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr . Henry Dashwood , the legal inheritor of the Norland estate , and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it .
His attachment to them all increased .
The son , a steady respectable young man , was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother , which had been large , and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age .
To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters ; for their fortune , independent of what might arise to them from their father ' s inheriting that property , could be but small .
Mr . Dashwood ' s disappointment was , at first , severe ; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine ; and he might reasonably hope to live many years , and by living economically , lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large , and capable of almost immediate improvement .
Elinor , this eldest daughter , whose advice was so effectual , possessed a strength of understanding , and coolness of judgment , which qualified her , though only nineteen , to be the counsellor of her mother , and enabled her frequently to counteract , to the advantage of them all , that eagerness of mind in Mrs . Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence .
The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great .
They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow , seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it , and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future .
How could he answer it to himself to rob his child , and his only child too , of so large a sum ?
Had he been in his right senses , he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child .
" Why , to be sure ," said her husband , very gravely , " that would make great difference .
" I would not wish to do any thing mean ," he replied .
" One had rather , on such occasions , do too much than too little .
"
my dear Fanny ; her life cannot be worth half that purchase .
It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities , that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world .
" To be sure it will .
Indeed , to say the truth , I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all .
Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then .
" Certainly ," returned Mrs . John Dashwood .
When your father and mother moved to Norland , though the furniture of Stanhill was sold , all the china , plate , and linen was saved , and is now left to your mother .
" Yes ; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house .
This argument was irresistible .
It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before ; and he finally resolved , that it would be absolutely unnecessary , if not highly indecorous , to do more for the widow and children of his father , than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out .
Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising .
Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs . Dashwood ' s attention ; for she was , at that time , in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects .
"
" Like him !
"
I felt for my sister most severely .
"
" Nay , Mamma , if he is not to be animated by Cowper !-- but we must allow for difference of taste .
Yet , though smiling within herself at the mistake , she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it .
"
"
"
She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister .
Elinor could not help laughing .
What his mother really is we cannot know ; but , from Fanny ' s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions , we have never been disposed to think her amiable ; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way , if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank .
She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it .
But , whatever might really be its limits , it was enough , when perceived by his sister , to make her uneasy , and at the same time , ( which was still more common ,) to make her uncivil .
She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother - in - law on the occasion , talking to her so expressively of her brother ' s great expectations , of Mrs . Ferrars ' s resolution that both her sons should marry well , and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN ; that Mrs . Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious , nor endeavor to be calm .
She gave her an answer which marked her contempt , and instantly left the room , resolving that , whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal , her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations .
He earnestly pressed her , after giving the particulars of the house and garden , to come with her daughters to Barton Park , the place of his own residence , from whence she might judge , herself , whether Barton Cottage , for the houses were in the same parish , could , by any alteration , be made comfortable to her .
He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin ; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections .
It was within four miles northward of Exeter .
Though her late conversation with her daughter - in - law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable , it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended .
HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three ; two maids and a man , with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland .
" Dear , dear Norland !
As a house , Barton Cottage , though small , was comfortable and compact ; but as a cottage it was defective , for the building was regular , the roof was tiled , the window shutters were not painted green , nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles .
The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills , and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows .
But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them .
In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord , who called to welcome them to Barton , and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient .
His countenance was thoroughly good - humoured ; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter .
He hunted and shot , and she humoured her children ; and these were their only resources .
The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected .
Colonel Brandon , the friend of Sir John , seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend , than Lady Middleton was to be his wife , or Mrs . Jennings to be Lady Middleton ' s mother .
Marianne ' s performance was highly applauded .
He paid her only the compliment of attention ; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion , which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste .
Mrs . Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure .
" said Elinor , " do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ?
" Mamma , you are not doing me justice .
I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature .
" Perhaps ," said Elinor , " thirty - five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together .
" A woman of seven and twenty ," said Marianne , after pausing a moment , " can never hope to feel or inspire affection again , and if her home be uncomfortable , or her fortune small , I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse , for the sake of the provision and security of a wife .
It would be a compact of convenience , and the world would be satisfied .
What else can detain him at Norland ?
" I rather think you are mistaken , for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber , she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it , as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time .
And Elinor , in quitting Norland and Edward , cried not as I did .
"
Their visitors , except those from Barton Park , were not many ; for , in spite of Sir John ' s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood , and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service , the independence of Mrs . Dashwood ' s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children ; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk .
The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks .
The gentleman offered his services ; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary , took her up in his arms without farther delay , and carried her down the hill .
But this he declined , as he was dirty and wet .
" Know him !
Why , he is down here every year .
But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr . Willoughby ' s pointer , than he could describe to her the shades of his mind .
Brandon will be jealous , if she does not take care .
" I do not believe ," said Mrs . Dashwood , with a good humoured smile , " that Mr . Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him .
"
" Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert .
You will be setting your cap at him now , and never think of poor Brandon .
Their tendency is gross and illiberal ; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever , time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity .
"
Sir John did not much understand this reproof ; but he laughed as heartily as if he did , and then replied ,
" Ay , you will make conquests enough , I dare say , one way or other .
CHAPTER 10
Her skin was very brown , but , from its transparency , her complexion was uncommonly brilliant ; her features were all good ; her smile was sweet and attractive ; and in her eyes , which were very dark , there was a life , a spirit , an eagerness , which could hardily be seen without delight .
But how is your acquaintance to be long supported , under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse ?
You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic .
"--
is this just ?
" My love ," said her mother , " you must not be offended with Elinor -- she was only in jest .
"-- Marianne was softened in a moment .
Willoughby , on his side , gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance , which an evident wish of improving it could offer .
He came to them every day .
Colonel Brandon ' s partiality for Marianne , which had so early been discovered by his friends , now first became perceptible to Elinor , when it ceased to be noticed by them .
He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park , and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him .
"
" In defence of your protege you can even be saucy .
" I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour .
" I do not dislike him .
"
I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man , well - bred , well - informed , of gentle address , and , I believe , possessing an amiable heart .
When Marianne was recovered , the schemes of amusement at home and abroad , which Sir John had been previously forming , were put into execution .
In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included ; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods , to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne , of marking his animated admiration of her , and of receiving , in her behaviour to himself , the most pointed assurance of her affection .
Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment .
Every thing he said , was clever .
Her admiration and regard , even her sisterly regard , was all his own ; but he was a lover ; his attentions were wholly Marianne ' s , and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing .
This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park , when they were sitting down together by mutual consent , while the others were dancing .
His eyes were fixed on Marianne , and , after a silence of some minutes , he said , with a faint smile , " Your sister , I understand , does not approve of second attachments .
" This will probably be the case ," he replied ; " and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind , that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions .
" There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne ' s , which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for .
Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought ; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage .
After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying ,--
"
Elinor attempted no more .
But Marianne , in her place , would not have done so little .
Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more .
Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion .
I shall keep it only till you can claim it .
"
I am sure she will be married to Mr . Willoughby very soon .
" But indeed this is quite another thing .
But the effort was painful .
Marianne felt for her most sincerely ; but she did more harm than good to the cause , by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret ,
" Yes , yes , we can guess where he is ; at his own house at Norland to be sure .
"
"
Willoughby opened the piano - forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground .
The morning was rather favourable , though it had rained all night , as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky , and the sun frequently appeared .
" What is the matter with Brandon ?
In about five minutes he returned .
It came from town , and is merely a letter of business .
"
"
" My own loss is great ," be continued , " in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party ; but I am the more concerned , as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell .
But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day !
"
"--
Elinor then heard Willoughby say , in a low voice to Marianne , " There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure .
" I have no doubt of it ," replied Marianne .
Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party ; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable .
"
"
" I can guess what his business is , however ," said Mrs . Jennings exultingly .
" And who is Miss Williams ?
" Oh , yes ; and as like him as she can stare .
It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening , and that every body should be extremely merry all day long .
" Yes , yes , Mr . Impudence , I know that very well , and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to .-- I hope you like your house , Miss Marianne .
Marianne turned away in great confusion .
Elinor could hardly believe this to be true , as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose , or Marianne consent , to enter the house while Mrs . Smith was in it , with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance .
"
" I am afraid ," replied Elinor , " that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety .
"
" If they were one day to be your own , Marianne , you would not be justified in what you have done .
As this silence continued , every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both .
" What !
Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded .
" Do not be alarmed ," said Miss Dashwood , " nothing of the kind will be done ; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it .
But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours , or of any one whom I loved , for all the improvements in the world .
" To me it is faultless .
I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation , and grieving that no one should live in it .
Then continuing his former tone , he said , " And yet this house you would spoil , Mrs . Dashwood ?
" You are a good woman ," he warmly replied .
The promise was readily given , and Willoughby ' s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness .
" said Mrs . Dashwood , when he was leaving them .
Mrs . Dashwood ' s visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day , and two of her daughters went with her ; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party , under some trifling pretext of employment ; and her mother , who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent , was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home .
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantel - piece with his back towards them .
" Almost this moment .
" This is very unfortunate .
But Mrs . Smith must be obliged ;-- and her business will not detain you from us long I hope .
Elinor felt equal amazement .
This was broken by Willoughby , who said with a faint smile , " It is folly to linger in this manner .
They saw him step into his carriage , and in a minute it was out of sight .
In about half an hour her mother returned , and though her eyes were red , her countenance was not uncheerful .
He did not speak , he did not behave like himself .
He had not the power of accepting it .
" Can you , indeed !
This is what I believe to have happened .
And now , Elinor , what have you to say ?
" Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened .
You had rather look out for misery for Marianne , and guilt for poor Willoughby , than an apology for the latter .
And , after all , what is it you suspect him of ?
" I can hardly tell myself .
There is great truth , however , in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him , and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body .
"
" I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly .
How could such a thought occur to you ?
" How strange this is !
"
" No , I cannot think that .
" You must remember , my dear mother , that I have never considered this matter as certain .
" I love Willoughby , sincerely love him ; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me .
Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately , it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once : but this is not the case .
It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun , for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance ; and even secrecy , as far as it can be observed , may now be very advisable .
They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time , when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word .
This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening .
She read nothing but what they had been used to read together .
No letter from Willoughby came ; and none seemed expected by Marianne .
"
" Months !
One morning , about a week after his leaving the country , Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk , instead of wandering away by herself .
She walked eagerly on as she spoke ; and Elinor , to screen Marianne from particularity , as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby , quickened her pace and kept up with her .
He dismounted , and giving his horse to his servant , walked back with them to Barton , whither he was purposely coming to visit them .
He was confused , seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them , looked neither rapturous nor gay , said little but what was forced from him by questions , and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection .
No , he had been in Devonshire a fortnight .
" I was at Norland about a month ago .
They are seen only as a nuisance , swept hastily off , and driven as much as possible from the sight .
But SOMETIMES they are .
Look up to it , and be tranquil if you can .
Did you ever see their equals ?
You may see the end of the house .
" It is a beautiful country ," he replied ; " but these bottoms must be dirty in winter .
"
" No , not all ," answered Marianne ; " we could not be more unfortunately situated .
Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder .
He received the kindest welcome from her ; and shyness , coldness , reserve could not stand against such a reception .
" I shall not attempt it .
"
" You have no ambition , I well know .
"
" TWO thousand a year !
"
" And yet two thousand a - year is a very moderate income ," said Marianne .
"
"
"
" What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London ," said Edward , " in such an event !
" And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs .
" Perhaps , then , you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim , that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life -- your opinion on that point is unchanged , I presume ?
"
" Undoubtedly .
At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed .
" Marianne is as steadfast as ever , you see ," said Elinor , " she is not at all altered .
"
" Why should you think so !
" Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ' s ," said Elinor ; " I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry .
"
" I believe you are right ," he replied , " and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl .
" She knows her own worth too well for false shame ," replied Edward .
"
What am I to tell you ?
"
But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open , and , turning round , was astonished to see Edward himself come out .
"
***
Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country ; in his walk to the village , he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage ; and the village itself , in a much higher situation than the cottage , afforded a general view of the whole , which had exceedingly pleased him .
"
" I am afraid it is but too true ," said Marianne ; " but why should you boast of it ?
Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel , and is disgusted with such pretensions , he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses .
"
" It is very true ," said Marianne , " that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon .
I admire them much more if they are tall , straight , and flourishing .
I do not like ruined , tattered cottages .
Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt -- but when she saw how much she had pained Edward , her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his .
She was not in a humour , however , to regard it as an affront , and affecting to take no notice of what passed , by instantly talking of something else , she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself , beyond all doubt , that it was exactly the shade of her own .
" Impossible !
" said he , in a low voice , to Miss Dashwood , by whom he was sitting .
Marianne ' s countenance was more communicative .
" What do you mean ?
" Oh , Edward !
" The consequence of which , I suppose , will be ," said Mrs . Dashwood , " since leisure has not promoted your own happiness , that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits , employments , professions , and trades as Columella ' s .
In feeling , in action , in condition , in every thing .
"
" I think ," replied Edward , " that I may defy many months to produce any good to me .
But as it was her determination to subdue it , and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away , she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne , on a similar occasion , to augment and fix her sorrow , by seeking silence , solitude and idleness .
Their means were as different as their objects , and equally suited to the advancement of each .
The business of self - command she settled very easily ;-- with strong affections it was impossible , with calm ones it could have no merit .
The closing of the little gate , at the entrance of the green court in front of the house , drew her eyes to the window , and she saw a large party walking up to the door .
How do you like them ?
I see her instrument is open .
And where are your sisters ?
all alone !
He entered the room with a look of self - consequence , slightly bowed to the ladies , without speaking a word , and , after briefly surveying them and their apartments , took up a newspaper from the table , and continued to read it as long as he staid .
How I should like such a house for myself !
Should not you , Mr .
It is so ridiculous !
Mrs . Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment , and every body agreed , two or three times over , that it had been quite an agreeable surprise .
" You may believe how glad we all were to see them ," added Mrs . Jennings , leaning forward towards Elinor , and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else , though they were seated on different sides of the room ; " but , however , I can ' t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast , nor made such a long journey of it , for they came all round by London upon account of some business , for you know ( nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter ) it was wrong in her situation .
" No , none at all ," he replied , and read on .
Mrs . Jennings asked her , as soon as she appeared , if she had not been to Allenham ; and Mrs . Palmer laughed so heartily at the question , as to show she understood it .
Well !
" My love , have you been asleep ?
He made her no answer ; and only observed , after again examining the room , that it was very low pitched , and that the ceiling was crooked .
He then made his bow , and departed with the rest .
Mrs . Jennings and Mrs . Palmer joined their entreaties , all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party ; and the young ladies were obliged to yield .
" said Marianne , as soon as they were gone .
The alteration is not in them , if their parties are grown tedious and dull .
"
As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing - room of the park the next day , at one door , Mrs . Palmer came running in at the other , looking as good humoured and merry as before .
She took them all most affectionately by the hand , and expressed great delight in seeing them again .
" said she , seating herself between Elinor and Marianne , " for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come , which would be a shocking thing , as we go away again tomorrow .
He never tells me any thing !
How few people know what comfort is !
We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know .
"
" As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life ," said Mr . Palmer .
Marianne remained perfectly silent , though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said .
" Did not I tell you , Sir John , when you spoke to me about it before , that it could not be done ?
They dined with us last .
" Do you know that you are quite rude ?
" I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill - bred .
It was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good - natured , or more determined to be happy than Mrs . Palmer .
The studied indifference , insolence , and discontent of her husband gave her no pain ; and when he scolded or abused her , she was highly diverted .
" Oh , my dear Miss Dashwood ," said Mrs . Palmer soon afterwards , " I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister .
Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas ?
Now , pray do ,-- and come while the Westons are with us .
"
They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation .
" But indeed you must and shall come .
The Westons will be with us , and it will be quite delightful .
He declares he won ' t .
Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation ; and by changing the subject , put a stop to her entreaties .
Palmer !
" But I do assure you it was so , for all that , and I will tell you how it happened .
yes , quite well ; and so full of your praises , he did nothing but say fine things of you .
"
He seems an excellent man ; and I think him uncommonly pleasing .
" Is Mr . Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire ?
She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him , upon my honour ; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her , because she is so very handsome and agreeable , that nothing can be good enough for her .
" You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon , have not you ?
The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day , and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other .
As it was impossible , however , now to prevent their coming , Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it , with all the philosophy of a well - bred woman , contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day .
" Do come now ," said he --" pray come -- you must come -- I declare you shall come -- You can ' t think how you will like them .
Lucy is monstrous pretty , and so good humoured and agreeable !
" John is in such spirits today !
She still screamed and sobbed lustily , kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her , and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week , some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple , the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch , and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it , gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected .-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother ' s arms , in quest of this medicine , and as the two boys chose to follow , though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind , the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours .
" What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is !
I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex .
In some surprise at the familiarity of this question , or at least of the manner in which it was spoken , Elinor replied that she was .
" added Miss Steele .
"
" And had you a great many smart beaux there ?
" But why should you think ," said Lucy , looking ashamed of her sister , " that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex ?
But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux , and had as lief be without them as with them .
"
one never thinks of married men ' s being beaux -- they have something else to do .
"
To do him justice , he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve , by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins ' situations in the most delicate particulars ,-- and Elinor had not seen them more than twice , before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister ' s having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton .
" Ferrars !
" Indeed !
Then , perhaps , you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is ?
" No ," returned Elinor , cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward ' s mother , and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity -- " I know nothing of her .
" I am sure you think me very strange , for enquiring about her in such a way ," said Lucy , eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke ; " but perhaps there may be reasons -- I wish I might venture ; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent .
I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs .
" I am sorry I do NOT ," said Elinor , in great astonishment , " if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her .
But if I dared tell you all , you would not be so much surprised .
Astonishment , that would have been as painful as it was strong , had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it .
She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .
"
" Four years !
"
Elinor , though greatly shocked , still felt unable to believe it .
" Yes ; Mr . Pratt .
Did you never hear him talk of Mr .
" We can mean no other ," cried Lucy , smiling .
"
She was silent .-- Elinor ' s security sunk ; but her self - command did not sink with it .
" Then taking a small miniature from her pocket , she added , " To prevent the possibility of mistake , be so good as to look at this face .
" I am sure ," said she , " I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret , because you must know of what importance it is to us , not to have it reach his mother ; for she would never approve of it , I dare say .
"
" Sometimes .
" continued Lucy , after wiping her eyes , " I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely .
"
" Did not you think him sadly out of spirits ?
" You know his hand , I dare say , a charming one it is ; but that is not written so well as usual .-- He was tired , I dare say , for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible .
Elinor saw that it WAS his hand , and she could doubt no longer .
"
How much could it not tempt her to forgive !
Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele ; could he , were his affection for herself out of the question , with his integrity , his delicacy , and well - informed mind , be satisfied with a wife like her -- illiterate , artful , and selfish ?
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne , what had been entrusted in confidence to herself , though it obliged her to unceasing exertion , was no aggravation of Elinor ' s distress .
My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed , I know , if the basket was not finished tomorrow , for though I told her it certainly would not , I am sure she depends upon having it done .
Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child .
Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech .
"
" You are very kind ," said Lady Middleton to Elinor ; " and as you really like the work , perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber , or will you take your chance now ?
Believe me ," and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity , " nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea .
I felt sure that you was angry with me ; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since , for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs .
" Edward ' s love for me ," said Lucy , " has been pretty well put to the test , by our long , very long absence since we were first engaged , and it has stood the trial so well , that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now .
Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion .
"
Lucy looked at Elinor again , and was silent .
" Not at all -- I never saw him ; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother -- silly and a great coxcomb .
"
A mutual silence took place for some time .
" I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head , for bringing matters to bear ; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret , for you are a party concerned .
"
" I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement .
We seem so beset with difficulties on every side , that though it would make us miserable for a time , we should be happier perhaps in the end .
"
" said she with all her accustomary complacency .
" Certainly not .
To be sure , your brother and sister will ask you to come to them .
Elinor was soon called to the card - table by the conclusion of the first rubber , and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end , to which both of them submitted without any reluctance , for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before ; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife ; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage , which sincere affection on HER side would have given , for self - interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement , of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary .
The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied .
Their favour increased ; they could not be spared ; Sir John would not hear of their going ; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter , in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately , which was in full force at the end of every week , they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park , and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance .
Elinor , without observing the varying complexion of her sister , and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan , immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both , in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations .
" Nay ," cried Mrs . Jennings , " I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne ' s company , whether Miss Dashwood will go or not , only the more the merrier say I , and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together ; because , if they got tired of me , they might talk to one another , and laugh at my old ways behind my back .
Lord bless me !
"
It should not , must not be a struggle .
Whatever Marianne was desirous of , her mother would be eager to promote -- she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust ; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London .
It is very right that you SHOULD go to town ; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London .
"
" That is very true ," replied her mother , " but of her society , separately from that of other people , you will scarcely have any thing at all , and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton .
"
To this determination she was the more easily reconciled , by recollecting that Edward Ferrars , by Lucy ' s account , was not to be in town before February ; and that their visit , without any unreasonable abridgement , might be previously finished .
" I will have you BOTH go ," said Mrs . Dashwood ; " these objections are nonsensical .
Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel .
Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness ; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive .
Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs . Jennings , and beginning a journey to London under her protection , and as her guest , without wondering at her own situation , so short had their acquaintance with that lady been , so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition , and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before !
Should the result of her observations be unfavourable , she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister ; should it be otherwise , her exertions would be of a different nature -- she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison , and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne .
She sat in silence almost all the way , wrapt in her own meditations , and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking , except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister .
This conviction , though not entirely satisfactory , gave her pleasure , and she continued her letter with greater alacrity .
" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms , when Colonel Brandon appeared .
It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness , and she immediately left the room .
Elinor answered in some distress that she was , and then talked of head - aches , low spirits , and over fatigues ; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister ' s behaviour .
Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town , but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival ; and at length , by way of saying something , she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last .
" Oh !
How does Charlotte do ?
However , I got a very good husband , and I don ' t know what the greatest beauty can do more .
Ah !
No other visitor appeared that evening , and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed .
In Bond Street especially , where much of their business lay , her eyes were in constant inquiry ; and in whatever shop the party were engaged , her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them , from all that interested and occupied the others .
" Has no letter been left here for me since we went out ?
" Are you quite sure of it ?
"
The man replied that none had .
" How odd , indeed !
" repeated Elinor within herself , regarding her sister with uneasiness .
my dear mother , you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young , a man so little known , to be carried on in so doubtful , so mysterious a manner !
I long to inquire ; and how will MY interference be borne .
The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements ; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others .
This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country .
It was a lucky recollection , all her good spirits were restored by it .
"
There seems to me a very decided difference .
The clouds seem parting too , the sun will be out in a moment , and we shall have a clear afternoon .
Colonel Brandon , who had a general invitation to the house , was with them almost every day ; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor , who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence , but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister .
She feared it was a strengthening regard .
His card was on the table when they came in from the morning ' s drive .
" Elinor , rejoiced to be assured of his being in London , now ventured to say , " Depend upon it , he will call again tomorrow .
" But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her , and on Mrs . Jenning ' s entrance , escaped with the precious card .
But Marianne , not convinced , took it instantly up .
" said Elinor , unable to be longer silent .
"
" Nor I ," answered Marianne with energy , " our situations then are alike .
We have neither of us any thing to tell ; you , because you do not communicate , and I , because I conceal nothing .
It was from Lady Middleton , announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before , and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening .
This was an affair , however , of which Lady Middleton did not approve .
After they had been assembled about an hour , Mr . Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town , though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house , and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come .
She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street .
" Aye , aye ," said Mrs . Jennings , " we know the reason of all that very well ; if a certain person who shall be nameless , had been there , you would not have been a bit tired : and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited .
It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction ; for , more than once before , beginning with the observation of " your sister looks unwell to - day ," or " your sister seems out of spirits ," he had appeared on the point , either of disclosing , or of inquiring , something particular about her .
Is it impossible to -?
These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much .
She acknowledged , therefore , that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other , of their mutual affection she had no doubt , and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear .
He listened to her with silent attention , and on her ceasing to speak , rose directly from his seat , and after saying in a voice of emotion , " to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness ; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her ,"-- took leave , and went away .
" she exclaimed , " he is there -- he is there -- Oh !
why cannot I speak to him ?
" Pray , pray be composed ," cried Elinor , " and do not betray what you feel to every body present .
Perhaps he has not observed you yet .
She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature .
He approached , and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne , as if wishing to avoid her eye , and determined not to observe her attitude , inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs . Dashwood , and asked how long they had been in town .
Willoughby , what is the meaning of this ?
"
" I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday , and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs . Jennings at home .
" But have you not received my notes ?
Marianne , now looking dreadfully white , and unable to stand , sunk into her chair , and Elinor , expecting every moment to see her faint , tried to screen her from the observation of others , while reviving her with lavender water .
"
With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself ; and to persuade her to check her agitation , to wait , at least , with the appearance of composure , till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect , was impossible ; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings , by exclamations of wretchedness .
In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase , and telling Marianne that he was gone , urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening , as a fresh argument for her to be calm .
" Marianne , may I ask -?
At breakfast she neither ate , nor attempted to eat any thing ; and Elinor ' s attention was then all employed , not in urging her , not in pitying her , nor in appearing to regard her , but in endeavouring to engage Mrs . Jenning ' s notice entirely to herself .
I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married .
"
Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby ' s letter , read as follows :
That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible , when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere , and it will not be many weeks , I believe , before this engagement is fulfilled .
" I only wish ," replied her sister , " there were any thing I COULD do , which might be of comfort to you .
This , as every thing else would have been , was too much for Marianne , who could only exclaim , in the anguish of her heart , " Oh !
Elinor , I am miserable , indeed ," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs .
but do not torture me so .
"
" Many , many circumstances ," said Elinor , solemnly .
" No , no , no ," cried Marianne wildly , " he loves you , and only you .
Much as you suffer now , think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period -- if your engagement had been carried on for months and months , as it might have been , before he chose to put an end to it .
" cried Marianne , " there has been no engagement .
The first , which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town , was to this effect .
At any rate I shall expect you to - morrow .
I have been told that you were asked to be of the party .
Tell me what it is , explain the grounds on which you acted , and I shall be satisfied , in being able to satisfy you .
"
"
no one , no one -- he talked to me only of myself .
"
Another pause ensued ; Marianne was greatly agitated , and it ended thus .
Oh , what would HE say to that !
Elinor advised her to lie down again , and for a moment she did so ; but no attitude could give her ease ; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another , till growing more and more hysterical , her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all , and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance .
Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs . Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .
Mrs . Jennings came immediately to their room on her return , and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered , opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern .
And so I shall always say , my dear , you may depend on it .
Had not Elinor , in the sad countenance of her sister , seen a check to all mirth , she could have been entertained by Mrs . Jennings ' s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love , by a variety of sweetmeats and olives , and a good fire .
With a hasty exclamation of Misery , and a sign to her sister not to follow her , she directly got up and hurried out of the room .
And the dried cherries too !
Well , it is the oddest thing to me , that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill !
a smart , stylish girl they say , but not handsome .
I remember her aunt very well , Biddy Henshawe ; she married a very wealthy man .
and by all accounts , it won ' t come before it ' s wanted ; for they say he is all to pieces .
"
" Aye , I believe that will be best for her .
Let her name her own supper , and go to bed .
how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it !
" It would be unnecessary I am sure , for you to caution Mrs . Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr . Willoughby , or making the slightest allusion to what has passed , before my sister .
yes , that I do indeed .
And what does talking ever do you know ?
" Well , my dear , ' tis a true saying about an ill - wind , for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon .
Oh !
' tis a nice place !
" You had better leave me ," was all the notice that her sister received from her .
In the drawing - room , whither she then repaired , she was soon joined by Mrs . Jennings , with a wine - glass , full of something , in her hand .
Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea , and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne , Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there , and , in short , that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence .
He knows nothing of it ; do tell him , my dear .
" Perhaps , then ," he hesitatingly replied , " what I heard this morning may be -- there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first .
" You mean ," answered Elinor , with forced calmness , " Mr . Willoughby ' s marriage with Miss Grey .
Where did you hear it ?
" Her sufferings have been very severe .
and , in some points , there seems a hardness of heart about him .
" said Colonel Brandon , " there is , indeed !
Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself , and at others , lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him .
In one thing , however , she was uniform , when it came to the point , in avoiding , where it was possible , the presence of Mrs . Jennings , and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it .
Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs . Jennings ' s entering into her sorrows with any compassion .
" No , no , no , it cannot be ," she cried ; " she cannot feel .
All that she wants is gossip , and she only likes me now because I supply it .
" I met Mrs . Jennings in Bond Street ," said he , after the first salutation , " and she encouraged me to come on ; and I was the more easily encouraged , because I thought it probable that I might find you alone , which I was very desirous of doing .
" I understand you ," said Elinor .
He stopt a moment for recollection , and then , with another sigh , went on .
"
Had I remained in England , perhaps -- but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years , and for that purpose had procured my exchange .
I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings , and under proper attendants ; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life : I was with her in her last moments .
But to what does all this lead ?
I WILL be more collected -- more concise .
I saw her there whenever I could , and after the death of my brother , ( which happened about five years ago , and which left to me the possession of the family property ,) she visited me at Delaford .
I called her a distant relation ; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her .
" The first news that reached me of her ," he continued , " came in a letter from herself , last October .
Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister ?
She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing .
" I have been more pained ," said she , " by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest ; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do .
Now , though at first she will suffer much , I am sure she will soon become easier .
One meeting was unavoidable .
" I could meet him no other way .
Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this ; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it .
" Is she still in town ?
"
mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets , which SHE could wish her not to indulge !
" A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well !
He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England !
Such a scoundrel of a fellow !
"
Colonel Brandon ' s delicate , unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood .
The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry - tree , the canal , and the yew arbour , would all be made over to HER ; and Mrs . Jennings had , for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs . Ferrars .
Elinor only was sorry to see them .
"
" There now ," said Miss Steele , affectedly simpering , " everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor , and I cannot think why .
' Lord !
My beau , indeed !
said I -- I cannot think who you mean .
The Doctor is no beau of mine .
" Long a time , indeed !
Elinor , with great civility , declined the proposal .
But the correctness of his eye , and the delicacy of his taste , proved to be beyond his politeness .
At last the affair was decided .
She turned her eyes towards his face , and found him with some surprise to be her brother .
Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr . Gray ' s shop .
Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days .
Harry was vastly pleased .
I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal .
But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street , and be introduced to your friend Mrs . Jennings .
" Excellent indeed .
"
He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister - in - law , for not coming too ; " but she was so much engaged with her mother , that really she had no leisure for going any where .
" Me , brother !
"
" I believe about two thousand a year .
" Indeed I believe you ," replied Elinor ; " but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME .
And her mother too , Mrs . Ferrars , a very good - natured woman , I am sure it would give her great pleasure ; she said as much the other day .
He has a most excellent mother .
" More than you think it really and intrinsically worth .
" Why , I hope not that .
" Where is the green - house to be ?
" Upon the knoll behind the house .
" Nothing at all , I should rather suppose ; for she has only her jointure , which will descend to her children .
"
She was as handsome a girl last September , as I ever saw ; and as likely to attract the man .
She will be mistaken , however .
Dorsetshire !
Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon ; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished , and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman , and promoting the marriage by every possible attention .
" Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman !
Edward assured them himself of his being in town , within a very short time , by twice calling in Berkeley Street .
They were to meet Mrs . Ferrars ; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party .
The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother - in - law .
Her complexion was sallow ; and her features small , without beauty , and naturally without expression ; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity , by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature .
Elinor , having once delivered her opinion on William ' s side , by which she offended Mrs . Ferrars and Fanny still more , did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion ; and Marianne , when called on for her ' s , offended them all , by declaring that she had no opinion to give , as she had never thought about it .
I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before , but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well .
Marianne could not bear this .-- She was already greatly displeased with Mrs . Ferrars ; and such ill - timed praise of another , at Elinor ' s expense , though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it , provoked her immediately to say with warmth ,
"
" Dear , dear Elinor , don ' t mind them .
"
Every body ' s attention was called , and almost every body was concerned .-- Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did .-- Mrs .
" My dear friend ," cried Lucy , as soon as they were by themselves , " I come to talk to you of my happiness .
Now was not it so ?-- You saw it all ; and was not you quite struck with it ?
"
Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me !-- No pride , no hauteur , and your sister just the same -- all sweetness and affability !
I am sure it will all end well , and there will be no difficulties at all , to what I used to think .
"
" I am glad of it with all my heart ; but really you did not look it .
I should be sorry to have YOU ill ; you , that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world !-- Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship .
If she had only made me a formal courtesy , for instance , without saying a word , and never after had took any notice of me , and never looked at me in a pleasant way -- you know what I mean -- if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way , I should have gave it all up in despair .
"
The ladies recovered themselves first .
She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness , and after slightly addressing him , said no more .
But Elinor had more to do ; and so anxious was she , for his sake and her own , to do it well , that she forced herself , after a moment ' s recollection , to welcome him , with a look and manner that were almost easy , and almost open ; and another struggle , another effort still improved them .
She would not allow the presence of Lucy , nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself , to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him , and that she had very much regretted being from home , when he called before in Berkeley Street .
" Dear Edward !
Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved , but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt .
That must be enough for us both .
" said Edward , willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject .
Poor Edward muttered something , but what it was , nobody knew , not even himself .
" Engaged !
"
"
" Why so ?-- we were all his friends , and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any .
was safely delivered of a son and heir ; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph , at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before .
This event , highly important to Mrs . Jennings ' s happiness , produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time , and influenced , in a like degree , the engagements of her young friends ; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte , she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed , and did not return till late in the evening ; and the Miss Dashwoods , at the particular request of the Middletons , spent the whole of every day , in every day in Conduit Street .
It was censure in common use , and easily given .
Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy .
Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them , and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times , she feared they would despise her for offering .
Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three , by their presence ; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely .
The power of disappointing them , it was true , must always be her ' s .
" Upon my soul ," he added , " I believe it is nothing more ; and so I often tell my mother , when she is grieving about it .
Why would you be persuaded by my uncle , Sir Robert , against your own judgment , to place Edward under private tuition , at the most critical time of his life ?
' This is the way in which I always consider the matter , and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error .
' My dear Courtland ,' said I , immediately throwing them all into the fire , ' do not adopt either of them , but by all means build a cottage .
" Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations , no space in a cottage ; but this is all a mistake .
' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it , so I said , ' My dear Lady Elliott , do not be uneasy .
' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought .
You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power , as my taking them out this evening shews .
They are very well behaved , good kind of girls ; and I think the attention is due to them , as their uncle did so very well by Edward .
Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was , above all things , the most material to her interest , and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings !
CHAPTER 37
" Lord !
But Charlotte , she would not be satisfied , so Mr . Donavan was sent for ; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street , so he stepped over directly , and as soon as ever he saw the child , be said just as we did , that it was nothing in the world but the red gum , and then Charlotte was easy .
" What !
' Lord !
' says I , ' is Mrs . Dashwood ill ?
Mr . Edward Ferrars , the very young man I used to joke with you about ( but however , as it turns out , I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it ), Mr . Edward Ferrars , it seems , has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy !-- There ' s for you , my dear !-- And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter , except Nancy !-- Could you have believed such a thing possible ?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another ; but that matters should be brought so forward between them , and nobody suspect it !-- THAT is strange !-- I never happened to see them together , or I am sure I should have found it out directly .
Mrs . Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house , and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too , to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes .
THEN she fell into hysterics again , and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr . Donavan , and Mr . Donavan found the house in all this uproar .
for they say he is monstrous fond of her , as well he may .
Here Mrs . Jennings ceased , and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts , she was able to give such an answer , and make such observations , as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce .
She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was ; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last , than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy .
What Mrs . Ferrars would say and do , though there could not be a doubt of its nature , she was anxious to hear ; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself .
For HIM she felt much compassion ;-- for Lucy very little -- and it cost her some pains to procure that little ;-- for the rest of the party none at all .
Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses , no less than in theirs ; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind , and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence , was readily offered .
Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement , and the length of time it had existed .-- Marianne ' s feelings had then broken in , and put an end to all regularity of detail ; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress , lessen her alarms , and combat her resentment .
"--
Marianne was quite subdued .--
She performed her promise of being discreet , to admiration .-- She attended to all that Mrs . Jennings had to say upon the subject , with an unchanging complexion , dissented from her in nothing , and was heard three times to say , " Yes , ma ' am .
"
'"
While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him , was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person !-- such a suspicion could never have entered her head !
All that Mrs . Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement , assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments , and Fanny ' s entreaties , was of no avail .
Duty , affection , every thing was disregarded .
I never thought Edward so stubborn , so unfeeling before .
Marianne was going to retort , but she remembered her promises , and forbore .
Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement .
" Well , sir ," said Mrs . Jennings , " and how did it end ?
"
It is a melancholy consideration .
Born to the prospect of such affluence !
"
I left her this morning with her lawyer , talking over the business .
Mrs . Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor ,
" Get it all out of her , my dear .
" And then lowering her voice , " I suppose Mrs . Jennings has heard all about it .
And Lady Middleton , is SHE angry ?
Good gracious !
Look , she made me this bow to my hat , and put in the feather last night .
There now , YOU are going to laugh at me too .
My cousins have been so plaguing me !
"
She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first .
Once Lucy thought to write to him , but then her spirits rose against that .
However this morning he came just as we came home from church ; and then it all came out , how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street , and been talked to by his mother and all of them , and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy , and nobody but Lucy would he have .
But , to be sure , Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking ; so she told him directly ( with a great deal about sweet and love , you know , and all that -- Oh , la !
"
"
)-- No , no ; they were shut up in the drawing - room together , and all I heard was only by listening at the door .
" Oh , la !
And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me ; for a year or two back , when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together , she never made any bones of hiding in a closet , or behind a chimney - board , on purpose to hear what we said .
"
I wonder what curacy he will get !-- Good gracious !
( giggling as she spoke ) I ' d lay my life I know what my cousins will say , when they hear of it .
They will tell me I should write to the Doctor , to get Edward the curacy of his new living .
La !
and Lord help ' em !
how poor they will be !-- I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house .
"
though we have suffered dreadfully , we are both quite well now , and as happy as we must always be in one another ' s love .
That was just like Lucy .-- Poor soul !
" No , I cannot go to Cleveland .
" Ah !
we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats .
"
This set the matter beyond a doubt .
" I shall always think myself very much obliged to you .
"
" The cruelty , the impolitic cruelty ,"-- he replied , with great feeling ,--" of dividing , or attempting to divide , two young people long attached to each other , is terrible .-- Mrs . Ferrars does not know what she may be doing -- what she may drive her son to .
Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford , now just vacant , as I am informed by this day ' s post , is his , if he think it worth his acceptance -- but THAT , perhaps , so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now , it may be nonsense to appear to doubt ; I only wish it were more valuable .-- It is a rectory , but a small one ; the late incumbent , I believe , did not make more than 200 L per annum , and though it is certainly capable of improvement , I fear , not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income .
She thanked him for it with all her heart , spoke of Edward ' s principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve ; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure , if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another .
" This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr . Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor ; it cannot enable him to marry .
What I am now doing indeed , seems nothing at all , since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal , his only object of happiness .
His marriage must still be a distant good ;-- at least , I am afraid it cannot take place very soon .--"
" repeated Mrs . Jennings --" Oh !
as to that , when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing , somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity .
" You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose ," said Elinor , with a faint smile .
"
" Well , my dear , I must be gone before I have had half my talk out .
But , however , we may have it all over in the evening ; for we shall be quite alone .
I do not ask you to go with me , for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company ; and besides , you must long to tell your sister all about it .
Marianne had left the room before the conversation began .
A few moments ' reflection , however , produced a very happy idea , and she exclaimed ;--
Ay , to be sure , he must be ordained in readiness ; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you .
Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs . Jennings ' s speech , neither did she think it worth inquiring into ; and therefore only replied to its conclusion .
However , I will not disturb you ( seeing her preparing to write .
So goodby , my dear .
) Colonel Brandon , who was here only ten minutes ago , has desired me to say , that understanding you mean to take orders , he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant , and only wishes it were more valuable .
What Edward felt , as he could not say it himself , it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him .
" Colonel Brandon give ME a living !-- Can it be possible ?
"
I do assure you that you owe it entirely , at least almost entirely , to your own merit , and Colonel Brandon ' s discernment of it .
I have always heard him spoken of as such , and your brother I know esteems him highly .
" Colonel Brandon , I think , lodges in St . James Street ," said he , soon afterwards , rising from his chair .
When Mrs . Jennings came home , though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before , and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say , her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession , than by anything else , that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared .
" No , ma ' am ; THAT was not very likely .
"
my dear , how calmly you talk of it ; and can the Colonel wait two or three months !
"
But , my dear , we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage , and make it comfortable for them , before Lucy goes to it .
Elinor was quite of her opinion , as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more .
It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street , and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife ' s indisposition , beyond one verbal enquiry , Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit .-- This was an obligation , however , which not only opposed her own inclination , but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions .
Marianne , not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself , was very urgent to prevent her sister ' s going at all ; and Mrs . Jennings , though her carriage was always at Elinor ' s service , so very much disliked Mrs . John Dashwood , that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery , nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward ' s part , could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again .
Ferrars .
" Well , well ; whatever Colonel Brandon may be , Edward is a very lucky man .-- You will not mention the matter to Fanny , however , for though I have broke it to her , and she bears it vastly well ,-- she will not like to hear it much talked of .
"
" But why should such precaution be used ?-- Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs . Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon ,-- for THAT must be quite out of the question ; yet why , upon her late behaviour , is she supposed to feel at all ?-- She has done with her son , she cast him off for ever , and has made all those over whom she had any influence , cast him off likewise .
Elinor ," said John , " your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature .
"
"
" The lady , I suppose , has no choice in the affair .
Not that you have any reason to regret , my dear Elinor .
Poor Edward !
I am extremely sorry for it -- for I know him to be a very good - hearted creature ; as well - meaning a fellow perhaps , as any in the world .
' That was what I said immediately .-- I was most uncommonly shocked , indeed !-- Poor Edward !-- he has done for himself completely -- shut himself out for ever from all decent society !-- but , as I directly said to my mother , I am not in the least surprised at it ; from his style of education , it was always to be expected .
My poor mother was half frantic .
I offered immediately , as soon as my mother related the affair to me , to talk to him myself , and dissuade him from the match ; but it was too late THEN , I found , to do any thing , for unluckily , I was not in the way at first , and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place , when it was not for me , you know , to interfere .
I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light .
But now it is all too late .
He must be starved , you know ;-- that is certain ; absolutely starved .
He had just settled this point with great composure , when the entrance of Mrs . John Dashwood put an end to the subject .
She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town , as she had hoped to see more of them ;-- an exertion in which her husband , who attended her into the room , and hung enamoured over her accents , seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful .
CHAPTER 42
Very early in April , and tolerably early in the day , the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes , to meet , by appointment , on the road .
Elinor ' s satisfaction , at the moment of removal , was more positive .
In such moments of precious , invaluable misery , she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland ; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house , feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty , of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude , she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers , in the indulgence of such solitary rambles .
She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple , and perhaps all over the grounds , and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it ; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking .
Mrs . Palmer had her child , and Mrs . Jennings her carpet - work ; they talked of the friends they had left behind , arranged Lady Middleton ' s engagements , and wondered whether Mr . Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night .
Nothing was wanting on Mrs . Palmer ' s side that constant and friendly good humour could do , to make them feel themselves welcome .
The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner , affording a pleasant enlargement of the party , and a very welcome variety to their conversation , which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low .
She liked him , however , upon the whole , much better than she had expected , and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more ;-- not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism , his selfishness , and his conceit , to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward ' s generous temper , simple taste , and diffident feelings .
She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away , in about seven days from the time of their arrival .
On the morning of the third day however , the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away ; for when Mr . Harris arrived , he declared his patient materially better .
" Is mama coming ?--"
Her fears , he had no courage , no confidence to attempt the removal of :-- he listened to them in silent despondence ;-- but her difficulties were instantly obviated , for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion , and the service pre - arranged in his mind , he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs . Dashwood .
She was on the point of sending again for Mr . Harris , or if HE could not come , for some other advice , when the former -- but not till after five o ' clock -- arrived .
He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours , and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them .
With strong concern , and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid , did Mrs . Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed .
Her former apprehensions , now with greater reason restored , left her no doubt of the event ; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor , her conviction of her sister ' s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope .
Elinor could not be cheerful .
She continued by the side of her sister , with little intermission the whole afternoon , calming every fear , satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits , supplying every succour , and watching almost every look and every breath .
At ten o ' clock , she trusted , or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them .
The night was cold and stormy .
is it really true ?
"
He rose up , and walked across the room .
" Mr . Willoughby , I advise you at present to return to Combe -- I am not at leisure to remain with you longer .-- Whatever your business may be with me , will it be better recollected and explained to - morrow .
" At Marlborough !
"
"
" If that is all , you may be satisfied already ,-- for Marianne DOES -- she has LONG forgiven you .
"-- he cried , in the same eager tone .-- " Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it .
Elinor bowed her assent .
" I do not know ," said he , after a pause of expectation on her side , and thoughtfulness on his own ,--" how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister , or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me .-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me ,-- it is worth the trial however , and you shall hear every thing .
To avoid a comparative poverty , which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors , I have , by raising myself to affluence , lost every thing that could make it a blessing .
" You did then ," said Elinor , a little softened , " believe yourself at one time attached to her ?
" To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness !-- Is there a man on earth who could have done it ?-- Yes , I found myself , by insensible degrees , sincerely fond of her ; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable , and my feelings blameless .
But in the interim -- in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass , before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private -- a circumstance occurred -- an unlucky circumstance , to ruin all my resolution , and with it all my comfort .
Smith had somehow or other been informed , I imagine by some distant relation , whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour , of an affair , a connection -- but I need not explain myself farther ," he added , looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye --" your particular intimacy -- you have probably heard the whole story long ago .
I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me .
) was scarcely less warm than hers ; and whose mind -- Oh !
she offered to forgive the past , if I would marry Eliza .
"
The sight of your dear sister , however , was really dreadful ; and , to heighten the matter , I found her alone .
I had left her only the evening before , so fully , so firmly resolved within my self on doing right !
A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever ; and I remember how happy , how gay were my spirits , as I walked from the cottage to Allenham , satisfied with myself , delighted with every body !
But in this , our last interview of friendship , I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling .
Elinor first spoke .
"
" Marianne ' s note , by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days , that in spite of the many , many weeks we had been separated , she was as constant in her own feelings , and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever , awakened all my remorse .
But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me .
All that I had to do , was to avoid you both .
" Watched us out of the house !
I could not answer it .
With my head and heart full of your sister , I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman !-- Those three or four weeks were worse than all .
It was a horrid sight !-- yet when I thought of her to - day as really dying , it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those , who saw her last in this world .
She was before me , constantly before me , as I travelled , in the same look and hue .
"
It happened to catch Sophia ' s eye before it caught mine -- and its size , the elegance of the paper , the hand - writing altogether , immediately gave her a suspicion .
Affecting that air of playfulness , therefore , which is delightful in a woman one loves , she opened the letter directly , and read its contents .
She was well paid for her impudence .
And , in short -- what do you think of my wife ' s style of letter - writing ?-- delicate -- tender -- truly feminine -- was it not ?
" Your wife !-- The letter was in your own hand - writing .
Your wife has a claim to your politeness , to your respect , at least .
"
You tell me that she has forgiven me already .
His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer ; and so much of his ill - will was done away , that when we parted , he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy .
Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness , dissipation , and luxury , had made in the mind , the character , the happiness , of a man who , to every advantage of person and talents , united a disposition naturally open and honest , and a feeling , affectionate temper .
Vanity , while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another , had involved him in a real attachment , which extravagance , or at least its offspring , necessity , had required to be sacrificed .
"
I have business there ; from thence to town in a day or two .
"-- said he , letting it fall , and leaning against the mantel - piece as if forgetting he was to go .
His answer was not very encouraging .
" What do you mean ?
But she felt that it was so , long , long before she could feel his influence less .
Elinor ' s heart was full .
Short was the time , however , in which that fear could affect her , for within half an hour after Willoughby ' s leaving the house , she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage .-- Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment ' s horrible suspense , she ran immediately into the hall , and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it .
Elinor ' s delight , as she saw what each felt in the meeting , was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep ;-- but Mrs . Dashwood could be calm , could be even prudent , when the life of a child was at stake , and Marianne , satisfied in knowing her mother was near her , and conscious of being too weak for conversation , submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her .
It was thus imparted to her , as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred .
Her daughter , feeling by turns both pleased and pained , surprised and not surprised , was all silent attention .
It came out quite unawares , quite undesignedly .
But his coming for me as he did , with such active , such ready friendship , is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men .
But he did not ask for hope or encouragement .
Elinor could NOT remember it ;-- but her mother , without waiting for her assent , continued ,
Their gentleness , their genuine attention to other people , and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition , than the liveliness -- often artificial , and often ill - timed of the other .
I am very sure myself , that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable , as he has proved himself the contrary , Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM , as she will be with Colonel Brandon .
Marianne ' s illness , though weakening in its kind , had not been long enough to make her recovery slow ; and with youth , natural strength , and her mother ' s presence in aid , it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove , within four days after the arrival of the latter , into Mrs . Palmer ' s dressing - room .
I know the summer will pass happily away .
I have formed my plan , and am determined to enter on a course of serious study .
Our own library is too well known to me , to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement .
By reading only six hours a - day , I shall gain in the course of a twelve - month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want .
But the resolution was made only to be broken .
Elinor tenderly invited her to be open .
" Yes .
Long before I was enough recovered to talk , I was perfectly able to reflect .
I considered the past : I saw in my own behaviour , since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn , nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself , and want of kindness to others .
I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings , and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave .
The kindness , the unceasing kindness of Mrs . Jennings , I had repaid with ungrateful contempt .
But you ,-- you above all , above my mother , had been wronged by me .
"
Marianne pressed her hand and replied ,
They shall no longer worry others , nor torture myself .
> From you , from my home , I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move ; and if I do mix in other society , it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled , my heart amended , and that I can practise the civilities , the lesser duties of life , with gentleness and forbearance .
"
She paused -- and added in a low voice , " If I could but know HIS heart , everything would become easy .
She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt ;-- she was sorry for him ;-- she wished him happy .
But the feelings of the past could not be recalled .-- Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken -- a character unblemished , to Marianne .
Had Mrs . Dashwood , like her daughter , heard Willoughby ' s story from himself -- had she witnessed his distress , and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner , it is probable that her compassion would have been greater .
In the evening , when they were all three together , Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again ;-- but that it was not without an effort , the restless , unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting -- her rising colour , as she spoke ,-- and her unsteady voice , plainly shewed .
" in a tone that implied --" do you really think him selfish ?
"
" It is very true .
MY happiness never was his object .
" At present ," continued Elinor , " he regrets what he has done .
He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which , because they are removed , he now reckons as nothing .
Her daughter did not look , however , as if much of it were heard by her .
Their man - servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business ; and when , as he waited at table , he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand , this was his voluntary communication --
Mrs . Dashwood , whose eyes , as she answered the servant ' s inquiry , had intuitively taken the same direction , was shocked to perceive by Elinor ' s countenance how much she really suffered , and a moment afterwards , alike distressed by Marianne ' s situation , knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention .
" Who told you that Mr . Ferrars was married , Thomas ?
So , I made free to wish her joy .
"
Elinor ' s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward ; and Mrs . Dashwood probably found the same explanation .
"
"
Mrs . Dashwood now looked at her daughter ; but Elinor knew better than to expect them .
"
" Did Mrs . Ferrars look well ?
"
But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self - provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay .
It was a gentleman , it was Colonel Brandon himself .
Now she could hear more ; and she trembled in expectation of it .
She looked again .
He coloured , seemed perplexed , looked doubtingly , and , after some hesitation , said ,--
" Perhaps you mean -- my brother -- you mean Mrs .-- Mrs . ROBERT Ferrars .
His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful .
He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart , and raise his spirits .
His heart was now open to Elinor , all its weaknesses , all its errors confessed , and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty - four .
She was pretty too -- at least I thought so THEN ; and I had seen so little of other women , that I could make no comparisons , and see no defects .
Lucy ' s marriage , the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all , formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers ;-- and Elinor ' s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view , as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard .
Other designs might afterward arise .
" I have burnt all your letters , and will return your picture the first opportunity .
Please to destroy my scrawls -- but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep .
"
"
" She will be more hurt by it , for Robert always was her favourite .-- She will be more hurt by it , and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner .
" Your behaviour was certainly very wrong ," said she ; " because -- to say nothing of my own conviction , our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT , as you were THEN situated , could never be .
"
He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart , and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement .
Elinor smiled , and shook her head .
One question after this only remained undecided , between them , one difficulty only was to be overcome .
No rumour of Lucy ' s marriage had yet reached him :-- he knew nothing of what had passed ; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering .
It would be needless to say , that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other , as they advanced in each other ' s acquaintance , for it could not be otherwise .
Mrs . Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale , to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl , and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr . Edward , who , she was sure , had quite doted upon the worthless hussy , and was now , by all accounts , almost broken - hearted , at Oxford .-- " I do think ," she continued , " nothing was ever carried on so sly ; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me .
Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs . Ferrars ; and even , if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son , his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter , nor be permitted to appear in her presence .
" And when she has forgiven you , perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement , almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first .
CHAPTER 50
What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered ; and here it plainly appeared , that though Edward was now her only son , he was by no means her eldest ; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a - year , not the smallest objection was made against Edward ' s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost ; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future , beyond the ten thousand pounds , which had been given with Fanny .
But though Mrs . Ferrars DID come to see them , and always treated them with the make - believe of decent affection , they were never insulted by her real favour and preference .
He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement ; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both , he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter .
Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted , which could only be removed by another half hour ' s discourse with himself .
His attendance was by this means secured , and the rest followed in course .
What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son , might have puzzled many people to find out ; and what Robert had done to succeed to it , might have puzzled them still more .
But so it was .
1 : 1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth .
1 : 12 And the earth brought forth grass , and herb yielding seed after his kind , and the tree yielding fruit , whose seed was in itself , after his kind : and God saw that it was good .
1 : 20 And God said , Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life , and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven .
1 : 23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day .
1 : 30 And to every beast of the earth , and to every fowl of the air , and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth , wherein there is life , I have given every green herb for meat : and it was so .
And the evening and the morning were the sixth day .
2 : 8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden ; and there he put the man whom he had formed .
2 : 25 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not ashamed .
And he said unto the woman , Yea , hath God said , Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden ?
4 : 21 And his brother ' s name was Jubal : he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ .
4 : 22 And Zillah , she also bare Tubalcain , an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron : and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah .
5 : 3 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years , and begat a son in his own likeness , and after his image ; and called his name Seth : 5 : 4 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years : and he begat sons and daughters : 5 : 5 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years : and he died .
5 : 12 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel : 5 : 13 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years , and begat sons and daughters : 5 : 14 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years : and he died .
6 : 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD .
6 : 9 These are the generations of Noah : Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations , and Noah walked with God .
6 : 12 And God looked upon the earth , and , behold , it was corrupt ; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth .
6 : 13 And God said unto Noah , The end of all flesh is come before me ; for the earth is filled with violence through them ; and , behold , I will destroy them with the earth .
6 : 20 Of fowls after their kind , and of cattle after their kind , of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind , two of every sort shall come unto thee , to keep them alive .
7 : 8 Of clean beasts , and of beasts that are not clean , and of fowls , and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth , 7 : 9 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark , the male and the female , as God had commanded Noah .
7 : 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah ' s life , in the second month , the seventeenth day of the month , the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up , and the windows of heaven were opened .
7 : 17 And the flood was forty days upon the earth ; and the waters increased , and bare up the ark , and it was lift up above the earth .
8 : 1 And God remembered Noah , and every living thing , and all the cattle that was with him in the ark : and God made a wind to pass over the earth , and the waters asswaged ; 8 : 2 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped , and the rain from heaven was restrained ; 8 : 3 And the waters returned from off the earth continually : and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated .
8 : 20 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD ; and took of every clean beast , and of every clean fowl , and offered burnt offerings on the altar .
9 : 3 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things .
9 : 6 Whoso sheddeth man ' s blood , by man shall his blood be shed : for in the image of God made he man .
10 : 5 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands ; every one after his tongue , after their families , in their nations .
10 : 13 And Mizraim begat Ludim , and Anamim , and Lehabim , and Naphtuhim , 10 : 14 And Pathrusim , and Casluhim , ( out of whom came Philistim ,) and Caphtorim .
10 : 15 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born , and Heth , 10 : 16 And the Jebusite , and the Amorite , and the Girgasite , 10 : 17 And the Hivite , and the Arkite , and the Sinite , 10 : 18 And the Arvadite , and the Zemarite , and the Hamathite : and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad .
10 : 20 These are the sons of Ham , after their families , after their tongues , in their countries , and in their nations .
10 : 24 And Arphaxad begat Salah ; and Salah begat Eber .
10 : 31 These are the sons of Shem , after their families , after their tongues , in their lands , after their nations .
11 : 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel ; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth : and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth .
11 : 20 And Reu lived two and thirty years , and begat Serug : 11 : 21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years , and begat sons and daughters .
11 : 29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives : the name of Abram ' s wife was Sarai ; and the name of Nahor ' s wife , Milcah , the daughter of Haran , the father of Milcah , and the father of Iscah .
11 : 30 But Sarai was barren ; she had no child .
12 : 8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel , and pitched his tent , having Bethel on the west , and Hai on the east : and there he builded an altar unto the LORD , and called upon the name of the LORD .
12 : 19 Why saidst thou , She is my sister ?
13 : 10 And Lot lifted up his eyes , and beheld all the plain of Jordan , that it was well watered every where , before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah , even as the garden of the LORD , like the land of Egypt , as thou comest unto Zoar .
14 : 18 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine : and he was the priest of the most high God .
15 : 3 And Abram said , Behold , to me thou hast given no seed : and , lo , one born in my house is mine heir .
15 : 6 And he believed in the LORD ; and he counted it to him for righteousness .
15 : 12 And when the sun was going down , a deep sleep fell upon Abram ; and , lo , an horror of great darkness fell upon him .
16 : 1 Now Sarai Abram ' s wife bare him no children : and she had an handmaid , an Egyptian , whose name was Hagar .
And she said , I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai .
16 : 14 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi ; behold , it is between Kadesh and Bered .
17 : 1 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine , the LORD appeared to Abram , and said unto him , I am the Almighty God ; walk before me , and be thou perfect .
17 : 2 And I will make my covenant between me and thee , and will multiply thee exceedingly .
17 : 12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you , every man child in your generations , he that is born in the house , or bought with money of any stranger , which is not of thy seed .
17 : 23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son , and all that were born in his house , and all that were bought with his money , every male among the men of Abraham ' s house ; and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day , as God had said unto him .
17 : 24 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine , when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin .
18 : 1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre : and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day ; 18 : 2 And he lift up his eyes and looked , and , lo , three men stood by him : and when he saw them , he ran to meet them from the tent door , and bowed himself toward the ground , 18 : 3 And said , My LORD , if now I have found favour in thy sight , pass not away , I pray thee , from thy servant : 18 : 4 Let a little water , I pray you , be fetched , and wash your feet , and rest yourselves under the tree : 18 : 5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that ye shall pass on : for therefore are ye come to your servant .
18 : 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah , and said , Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal , knead it , and make cakes upon the hearth .
18 : 23 And Abraham drew near , and said , Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked ?
18 : 25 That be far from thee to do after this manner , to slay the righteous with the wicked : and that the righteous should be as the wicked , that be far from thee : Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right ?
18 : 33 And the LORD went his way , as soon as he had left communing with Abraham : and Abraham returned unto his place .
19 : 6 And Lot went out at the door unto them , and shut the door after him , 19 : 7 And said , I pray you , brethren , do not so wickedly .
19 : 9 And they said , Stand back .
And they said again , This one fellow came in to sojourn , and he will needs be a judge : now will we deal worse with thee , than with them .
19 : 22 Haste thee , escape thither ; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither .
19 : 36 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father .
20 : 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night , and said to him , Behold , thou art but a dead man , for the woman which thou hast taken ; for she is a man ' s wife .
thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done .
20 : 14 And Abimelech took sheep , and oxen , and menservants , and womenservants , and gave them unto Abraham , and restored him Sarah his wife .
21 : 1 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said , and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken .
21 : 17 And God heard the voice of the lad ; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven , and said unto her , What aileth thee , Hagar ?
21 : 20 And God was with the lad ; and he grew , and dwelt in the wilderness , and became an archer .
21 : 32 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba : then Abimelech rose up , and Phichol the chief captain of his host , and they returned into the land of the Philistines .
22 : 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes , and saw the place afar off .
22 : 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh : as it is said to this day , In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen .
bury therefore thy dead .
24 : 5 And the servant said unto him , Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land : must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest ?
24 : 7 The LORD God of heaven , which took me from my father ' s house , and from the land of my kindred , and which spake unto me , and that sware unto me , saying , Unto thy seed will I give this land ; he shall send his angel before thee , and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence .
24 : 16 And the damsel was very fair to look upon , a virgin , neither had any man known her : and she went down to the well , and filled her pitcher , and came up .
24 : 20 And she hasted , and emptied her pitcher into the trough , and ran again unto the well to draw water , and drew for all his camels .
24 : 25 She said moreover unto him , We have both straw and provender enough , and room to lodge in .
24 : 27 And he said , Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham , who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth : I being in the way , the LORD led me to the house of my master ' s brethren .
24 : 37 And my master made me swear , saying , Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites , in whose land I dwell : 24 : 38 But thou shalt go unto my father ' s house , and to my kindred , and take a wife unto my son .
24 : 46 And she made haste , and let down her pitcher from her shoulder , and said , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : so I drank , and she made the camels drink also .
24 : 66 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done .
24 : 67 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah ' s tent , and took Rebekah , and she became his wife ; and he loved her : and Isaac was comforted after his mother ' s death .
25 : 5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac .
25 : 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham , that God blessed his son Isaac ; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi .
25 : 19 And these are the generations of Isaac , Abraham ' s son : Abraham begat Isaac : 25 : 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife , the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram , the sister to Laban the Syrian .
26 : 9 And Abimelech called Isaac , and said , Behold , of a surety she is thy wife ; and how saidst thou , She is my sister ?
26 : 12 Then Isaac sowed in that land , and received in the same year an hundredfold : and the LORD blessed him .
26 : 22 And he removed from thence , and digged another well ; and for that they strove not : and he called the name of it Rehoboth ; and he said , For now the LORD hath made room for us , and we shall be fruitful in the land .
26 : 30 And he made them a feast , and they did eat and drink .
27 : 8 Now therefore , my son , obey my voice according to that which I command thee .
And he said , I am thy son , thy firstborn Esau .
27 : 36 And he said , Is not he rightly named Jacob ?
And Esau lifted up his voice , and wept .
28 : 3 And God Almighty bless thee , and make thee fruitful , and multiply thee , that thou mayest be a multitude of people ; 28 : 4 And give thee the blessing of Abraham , to thee , and to thy seed with thee ; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger , which God gave unto Abraham .
28 : 13 And , behold , the LORD stood above it , and said , I am the LORD God of Abraham thy father , and the God of Isaac : the land whereon thou liest , to thee will I give it , and to thy seed ; 28 : 14 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth , and thou shalt spread abroad to the west , and to the east , and to the north , and to the south : and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed .
this is none other but the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven .
And they said , He is well : and , behold , Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep .
And he told Laban all these things .
29 : 14 And Laban said to him , Surely thou art my bone and my flesh .
29 : 24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid .
wherefore then hast thou beguiled me ?
30 : 7 And Bilhah Rachel ' s maid conceived again , and bare Jacob a second son .
30 : 8 And Rachel said , With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister , and I have prevailed : and she called his name Naphtali .
30 : 11 And Leah said , A troop cometh : and she called his name Gad .
30 : 19 And Leah conceived again , and bare Jacob the sixth son .
30 : 28 And he said , Appoint me thy wages , and I will give it .
30 : 29 And he said unto him , Thou knowest how I have served thee , and how thy cattle was with me .
30 : 37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar , and of the hazel and chesnut tree ; and pilled white strakes in them , and made the white appear which was in the rods .
30 : 39 And the flocks conceived before the rods , and brought forth cattle ringstraked , speckled , and spotted .
31 : 4 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock , 31 : 5 And said unto them , I see your father ' s countenance , that it is not toward me as before ; but the God of my father hath been with me .
31 : 12 And he said , Lift up now thine eyes , and see , all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked , speckled , and grisled : for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee .
31 : 13 I am the God of Bethel , where thou anointedst the pillar , and where thou vowedst a vow unto me : now arise , get thee out from this land , and return unto the land of thy kindred .
31 : 31 And Jacob answered and said to Laban , Because I was afraid : for I said , Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me .
31 : 36 And Jacob was wroth , and chode with Laban : and Jacob answered and said to Laban , What is my trespass ?
set it here before my brethren and thy brethren , that they may judge betwixt us both .
31 : 44 Now therefore come thou , let us make a covenant , I and thou ; and let it be for a witness between me and thee .
31 : 45 And Jacob took a stone , and set it up for a pillar .
31 : 46 And Jacob said unto his brethren , Gather stones ; and they took stones , and made an heap : and they did eat there upon the heap .
32 : 1 And Jacob went on his way , and the angels of God met him .
32 : 17 And he commanded the foremost , saying , When Esau my brother meeteth thee , and asketh thee , saying , Whose art thou ?
And he said , Jacob .
And he blessed him there .
34 : 3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob , and he loved the damsel , and spake kindly unto the damsel .
34 : 23 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of their ' s be our ' s ?
34 : 26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword , and took Dinah out of Shechem ' s house , and went out .
34 : 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain , and spoiled the city , because they had defiled their sister .
34 : 30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi , Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land , among the Canaanites and the Perizzites : and I being few in number , they shall gather themselves together against me , and slay me ; and I shall be destroyed , I and my house .
35 : 11 And God said unto him , I am God Almighty : be fruitful and multiply ; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee , and kings shall come out of thy loins ; 35 : 12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac , to thee I will give it , and to thy seed after thee will I give the land .
35 : 20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave : that is the pillar of Rachel ' s grave unto this day .
36 : 8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir : Esau is Edom .
36 : 19 These are the sons of Esau , who is Edom , and these are their dukes .
36 : 22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam ; and Lotan ' s sister was Timna .
36 : 31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom , before there reigned any king over the children of Israel .
36 : 35 And Husham died , and Hadad the son of Bedad , who smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
36 : 40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau , according to their families , after their places , by their names ; duke Timnah , duke Alvah , duke Jetheth , 36 : 41 Duke Aholibamah , duke Elah , duke Pinon , 36 : 42 Duke Kenaz , duke Teman , duke Mibzar , 36 : 43 Duke Magdiel , duke Iram : these be the dukes of Edom , according to their habitations in the land of their possession : he is Esau the father of the Edomites .
37 : 5 And Joseph dreamed a dream , and he told it his brethren : and they hated him yet the more .
or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us ?
come , and I will send thee unto them .
And he said to him , Here am I .
37 : 15 And a certain man found him , and , behold , he was wandering in the field : and the man asked him , saying , What seekest thou ?
37 : 18 And when they saw him afar off , even before he came near unto them , they conspired against him to slay him .
37 : 21 And Reuben heard it , and he delivered him out of their hands ; and said , Let us not kill him .
37 : 27 Come , and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites , and let not our hand be upon him ; for he is our brother and our flesh .
38 : 24 And it came to pass about three months after , that it was told Judah , saying , Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot ; and also , behold , she is with child by whoredom .
38 : 26 And Judah acknowledged them , and said , She hath been more righteous than I ; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son .
38 : 28 And it came to pass , when she travailed , that the one put out his hand : and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread , saying , This came out first .
39 : 3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him , and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand .
39 : 4 And Joseph found grace in his sight , and he served him : and he made him overseer over his house , and all that he had he put into his hand .
39 : 23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand ; because the LORD was with him , and that which he did , the LORD made it to prosper .
40 : 5 And they dreamed a dream both of them , each man his dream in one night , each man according to the interpretation of his dream , the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt , which were bound in the prison .
40 : 6 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning , and looked upon them , and , behold , they were sad .
40 : 9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph , and said to him , In my dream , behold , a vine was before me ; 40 : 10 And in the vine were three branches : and it was as though it budded , and her blossoms shot forth ; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes : 40 : 11 And Pharaoh ' s cup was in my hand : and I took the grapes , and pressed them into Pharaoh ' s cup , and I gave the cup into Pharaoh ' s hand .
41 : 9 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh , saying , I do remember my faults this day : 41 : 10 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants , and put me in ward in the captain of the guard ' s house , both me and the chief baker : 41 : 11 And we dreamed a dream in one night , I and he ; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream .
41 : 13 And it came to pass , as he interpreted to us , so it was ; me he restored unto mine office , and him he hanged .
41 : 34 Let Pharaoh do this , and let him appoint officers over the land , and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years .
41 : 38 And Pharaoh said unto his servants , Can we find such a one as this is , a man in whom the Spirit of God is ?
41 : 46 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt .
41 : 54 And the seven years of dearth began to come , according as Joseph had said : and the dearth was in all lands ; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread .
And they said , From the land of Canaan to buy food .
42 : 16 Send one of you , and let him fetch your brother , and ye shall be kept in prison , that your words may be proved , whether there be any truth in you : or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies .
42 : 21 And they said one to another , We are verily guilty concerning our brother , in that we saw the anguish of his soul , when he besought us , and we would not hear ; therefore is this distress come upon us .
42 : 23 And they knew not that Joseph understood them ; for he spake unto them by an interpreter .
42 : 26 And they laded their asses with the corn , and departed thence .
42 : 29 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan , and told him all that befell unto them ; saying , 42 : 30 The man , who is the lord of the land , spake roughly to us , and took us for spies of the country .
43 : 2 And it came to pass , when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt , their father said unto them , Go again , buy us a little food .
43 : 8 And Judah said unto Israel his father , Send the lad with me , and we will arise and go ; that we may live , and not die , both we , and thou , and also our little ones .
43 : 15 And the men took that present , and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin ; and rose up , and went down to Egypt , and stood before Joseph .
43 : 18 And the men were afraid , because they were brought into Joseph ' s house ; and they said , Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in ; that he may seek occasion against us , and fall upon us , and take us for bondmen , and our asses .
43 : 24 And the man brought the men into Joseph ' s house , and gave them water , and they washed their feet ; and he gave their asses provender .
43 : 27 And he asked them of their welfare , and said , Is your father well , the old man of whom ye spake ?
43 : 29 And he lifted up his eyes , and saw his brother Benjamin , his mother ' s son , and said , Is this your younger brother , of whom ye spake unto me ?
44 : 6 And he overtook them , and he spake unto them these same words .
44 : 9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found , both let him die , and we also will be my lord ' s bondmen .
wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine ?
or how shall we clear ourselves ?
44 : 19 My lord asked his servants , saying , Have ye a father , or a brother ?
44 : 20 And we said unto my lord , We have a father , an old man , and a child of his old age , a little one ; and his brother is dead , and he alone is left of his mother , and his father loveth him .
44 : 22 And we said unto my lord , The lad cannot leave his father : for if he should leave his father , his father would die .
45 : 1 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him ; and he cried , Cause every man to go out from me .
45 : 5 Now therefore be not grieved , nor angry with yourselves , that ye sold me hither : for God did send me before you to preserve life .
45 : 16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh ' s house , saying , Joseph ' s brethren are come : and it pleased Pharaoh well , and his servants .
46 : 10 And the sons of Simeon ; Jemuel , and Jamin , and Ohad , and Jachin , and Zohar , and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman .
46 : 14 And the sons of Zebulun ; Sered , and Elon , and Jahleel .
46 : 18 These are the sons of Zilpah , whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter , and these she bare unto Jacob , even sixteen souls .
46 : 19 The sons of Rachel Jacob ' s wife ; Joseph , and Benjamin .
47 : 11 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren , and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt , in the best of the land , in the land of Rameses , as Pharaoh had commanded .
for the money faileth .
47 : 17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph : and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses , and for the flocks , and for the cattle of the herds , and for the asses : and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year .
47 : 18 When that year was ended , they came unto him the second year , and said unto him , We will not hide it from my lord , how that our money is spent ; my lord also hath our herds of cattle ; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord , but our bodies , and our lands : 47 : 19 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes , both we and our land ?
buy us and our land for bread , and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh : and give us seed , that we may live , and not die , that the land be not desolate .
47 : 24 And it shall come to pass in the increase , that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh , and four parts shall be your own , for seed of the field , and for your food , and for them of your households , and for food for your little ones .
And he said , I will do as thou hast said .
48 : 11 And Israel said unto Joseph , I had not thought to see thy face : and , lo , God hath shewed me also thy seed .
48 : 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand , and laid it upon Ephraim ' s head , who was the younger , and his left hand upon Manasseh ' s head , guiding his hands wittingly ; for Manasseh was the firstborn .
48 : 19 And his father refused , and said , I know it , my son , I know it : he also shall become a people , and he also shall be great : but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he , and his seed shall become a multitude of nations .
49 : 1 And Jacob called unto his sons , and said , Gather yourselves together , that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days .
49 : 13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea ; and he shall be for an haven of ships ; and his border shall be unto Zidon .
49 : 16 Dan shall judge his people , as one of the tribes of Israel .
49 : 32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth .
50 : 9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen : and it was a very great company .
50 : 16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph , saying , Thy father did command before he died , saying , 50 : 17 So shall ye say unto Joseph , Forgive , I pray thee now , the trespass of thy brethren , and their sin ; for they did unto thee evil : and now , we pray thee , forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father .
50 : 20 But as for you , ye thought evil against me ; but God meant it unto good , to bring to pass , as it is this day , to save much people alive .
50 : 25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you , and ye shall carry up my bones from hence .
1 : 2 Reuben , Simeon , Levi , and Judah , 1 : 3 Issachar , Zebulun , and Benjamin , 1 : 4 Dan , and Naphtali , Gad , and Asher .
1 : 8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt , which knew not Joseph .
1 : 15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives , of which the name of the one was Shiphrah , and the name of the other Puah : 1 : 16 And he said , When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women , and see them upon the stools ; if it be a son , then ye shall kill him : but if it be a daughter , then she shall live .
2 : 2 And the woman conceived , and bare a son : and when she saw him that he was a goodly child , she hid him three months .
2 : 3 And when she could not longer hide him , she took for him an ark of bulrushes , and daubed it with slime and with pitch , and put the child therein ; and she laid it in the flags by the river ' s brink .
2 : 10 And the child grew , and she brought him unto Pharaoh ' s daughter , and he became her son .
2 : 12 And he looked this way and that way , and when he saw that there was no man , he slew the Egyptian , and hid him in the sand .
2 : 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing , he sought to slay Moses .
2 : 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man : and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter .
2 : 24 And God heard their groaning , and God remembered his covenant with Abraham , with Isaac , and with Jacob .
3 : 3 And Moses said , I will now turn aside , and see this great sight , why the bush is not burnt .
3 : 4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see , God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , Moses , Moses .
3 : 9 Now therefore , behold , the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me : and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them .
what shall I say unto them ?
3 : 14 And God said unto Moses , I AM THAT I AM : and he said , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I AM hath sent me unto you .
3 : 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice : and thou shalt come , thou and the elders of Israel , unto the king of Egypt , and ye shall say unto him , The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us : and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God .
4 : 6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him , Put now thine hand into thy bosom .
4 : 7 And he said , Put thine hand into thy bosom again .
4 : 9 And it shall come to pass , if they will not believe also these two signs , neither hearken unto thy voice , that thou shalt take of the water of the river , and pour it upon the dry land : and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land .
4 : 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt : and Moses took the rod of God in his hand .
4 : 29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel : 4 : 30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses , and did the signs in the sight of the people .
4 : 31 And the people believed : and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel , and that he had looked upon their affliction , then they bowed their heads and worshipped .
5 : 14 And the officers of the children of Israel , which Pharaoh ' s taskmasters had set over them , were beaten , and demanded , Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day , as heretofore ?
5 : 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case , after it was said , Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task .
5 : 20 And they met Moses and Aaron , who stood in the way , as they came forth from Pharaoh : 5 : 21 And they said unto them , The LORD look upon you , and judge ; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh , and in the eyes of his servants , to put a sword in their hand to slay us .
6 : 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations ; Gershon , and Kohath , and Merari : and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years .
6 : 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father ' s sister to wife ; and she bare him Aaron and Moses : and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years .
6 : 28 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt , 6 : 29 That the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , I am the LORD : speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee .
7 : 10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh , and they did so as the LORD had commanded : and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh , and before his servants , and it became a serpent .
7 : 24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river .
8 : 7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments , and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt .
8 : 9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh , Glory over me : when shall I intreat for thee , and for thy servants , and for thy people , to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses , that they may remain in the river only ?
8 : 10 And he said , To morrow .
And he said , Be it according to thy word : that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God .
8 : 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses ; and the frogs died out of the houses , out of the villages , and out of the fields .
8 : 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh , This is the finger of God : and Pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , and he hearkened not unto them ; as the LORD had said .
9 : 13 And the LORD said unto Moses , Rise up early in the morning , and stand before Pharaoh , and say unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews , Let my people go , that they may serve me .
9 : 30 But as for thee and thy servants , I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God .
let the men go , that they may serve the LORD their God : knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed ?
10 : 27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh ' s heart , and he would not let them go .
10 : 28 And Pharaoh said unto him , Get thee from me , take heed to thyself , see my face no more ; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die .
11 : 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt , such as there was none like it , nor shall be like it any more .
11 : 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me , and bow down themselves unto me , saying , Get thee out , and all the people that follow thee : and after that I will go out .
And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger .
12 : 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish , a male of the first year : ye shall take it out from the sheep , or from the goats : 12 : 6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month : and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening .
12 : 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread ; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses : for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day , that soul shall be cut off from Israel .
12 : 20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened ; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread .
12 : 45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof .
13 : 3 And Moses said unto the people , Remember this day , in which ye came out from Egypt , out of the house of bondage ; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place : there shall no leavened bread be eaten .
13 : 9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand , and for a memorial between thine eyes , that the LORD ' s law may be in thy mouth : for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt .
13 : 14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come , saying , What is this ?
13 : 17 And it came to pass , when Pharaoh had let the people go , that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines , although that was near ; for God said , Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war , and they return to Egypt : 13 : 18 But God led the people about , through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea : and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt .
14 : 14 The LORD shall fight for you , and ye shall hold your peace .
14 : 15 And the LORD said unto Moses , Wherefore criest thou unto me ?
15 : 13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed : thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation .
16 : 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness : 16 : 3 And the children of Israel said unto them , Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt , when we sat by the flesh pots , and when we did eat bread to the full ; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger .
16 : 8 And Moses said , This shall be , when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat , and in the morning bread to the full ; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him : and what are we ?
16 : 19 And Moses said , Let no man leave of it till the morning .
16 : 28 And the LORD said unto Moses , How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws ?
16 : 32 And Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD commandeth , Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations ; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness , when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt .
17 : 2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses , and said , Give us water that we may drink .
17 : 6 Behold , I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb ; and thou shalt smite the rock , and there shall come water out of it , that the people may drink .
17 : 7 And he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the LORD , saying , Is the LORD among us , or not ?
17 : 15 And Moses built an altar , and called the name of it Jehovahnissi : 17 : 16 For he said , Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation .
18 : 13 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Moses sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening .
These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel .
19 : 14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people , and sanctified the people ; and they washed their clothes .

21 : 29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past , and it hath been testified to his owner , and he hath not kept him in , but that he hath killed a man or a woman ; the ox shall be stoned , and his owner also shall be put to death .
22 : 1 If a man shall steal an ox , or a sheep , and kill it , or sell it ; he shall restore five oxen for an ox , and four sheep for a sheep .

22 : 9 For all manner of trespass , whether it be for ox , for ass , for sheep , for raiment , or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his , the cause of both parties shall come before the judges ; and whom the judges shall condemn , he shall pay double unto his neighbour .

34 : 31 And Moses called unto them ; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him : and Moses talked with them .
34 : 33 And till Moses had done speaking with them , he put a vail on his face .
And he came out , and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded .
34 : 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses , that the skin of Moses ' face shone : and Moses put the vail upon his face again , until he went in to speak with him .
35 : 20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses .
35 : 25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands , and brought that which they had spun , both of blue , and of purple , and of scarlet , and of fine linen .
35 : 34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach , both he , and Aholiab , the son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan .

36 : 9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : the curtains were all of one size .
36 : 31 And he made bars of shittim wood ; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle , 36 : 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle , and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward .
36 : 35 And he made a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen : with cherubims made he it of cunning work .
36 : 37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen , of needlework ; 36 : 38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks : and he overlaid their chapiters and their fillets with gold : but their five sockets were of brass .
37 : 4 And he made staves of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold .
37 : 7 And he made two cherubims of gold , beaten out of one piece made he them , on the two ends of the mercy seat ; 37 : 8 One cherub on the end on this side , and another cherub on the other end on that side : out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two ends thereof .
37 : 16 And he made the vessels which were upon the table , his dishes , and his spoons , and his bowls , and his covers to cover withal , of pure gold .
37 : 24 Of a talent of pure gold made he it , and all the vessels thereof .
38 : 1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood : five cubits was the length thereof , and five cubits the breadth thereof ; it was foursquare ; and three cubits the height thereof .
38 : 4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it .
39 : 16 And they made two ouches of gold , and two gold rings ; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate .
39 : 18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches , and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod , before it .
39 : 24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and twined linen .
39 : 30 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold , and wrote upon it a writing , like to the engravings of a signet , HOLINESS TO THE LORD .
39 : 42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses , so the children of Israel made all the work .
39 : 43 And Moses did look upon all the work , and , behold , they had done it as the LORD had commanded , even so had they done it : and Moses blessed them .
40 : 14 And thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats : 40 : 15 And thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest ' s office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations .
40 : 20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark , and set the staves on the ark , and put the mercy seat above upon the ark : 40 : 21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle , and set up the vail of the covering , and covered the ark of the testimony ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
40 : 25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
40 : 29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation , and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
40 : 35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation , because the cloud abode thereon , and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle .
1 : 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron ' s sons , shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the altar .
2 : 6 Thou shalt part it in pieces , and pour oil thereon : it is a meat offering .
2 : 7 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan , it shall be made of fine flour with oil .
3 : 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 4 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is on them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
3 : 9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; the fat thereof , and the whole rump , it shall he take off hard by the backbone ; and the fat that covereth the inwards , and all the fat that is upon the inwards , 3 : 10 And the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , which is by the flanks , and the caul above the liver , with the kidneys , it shall he take away .
3 : 12 And if his offering be a goat , then he shall offer it before the LORD .
4 : 11 And the skin of the bullock , and all his flesh , with his head , and with his legs , and his inwards , and his dung , 4 : 12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place , where the ashes are poured out , and burn him on the wood with fire : where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt .
4 : 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock ' s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation : 4 : 17 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood , and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD , even before the vail .
4 : 19 And he shall take all his fat from him , and burn it upon the altar .
4 : 20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering , so shall he do with this : and the priest shall make an atonement for them , and it shall be forgiven them .
4 : 22 When a ruler hath sinned , and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done , and is guilty ; 4 : 23 Or if his sin , wherein he hath sinned , come to his knowledge ; he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a male without blemish : 4 : 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat , and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD : it is a sin offering .
4 : 34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger , and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering , and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar : 4 : 35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof , as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings ; and the priest shall burn them upon the altar , according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD : and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed , and it shall be forgiven him .
5 : 11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves , or two young pigeons , then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering ; he shall put no oil upon it , neither shall he put any frankincense thereon : for it is a sin offering .
I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings made by fire ; it is most holy , as is the sin offering , and as the trespass offering .
6 : 18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it .
6 : 21 In a pan it shall be made with oil ; and when it is baken , thou shalt bring it in : and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD .
6 : 26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it : in the holy place shall it be eaten , in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation .
7 : 8 And the priest that offereth any man ' s burnt offering , even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered .
7 : 10 And every meat offering , mingled with oil , and dry , shall all the sons of Aaron have , one as much as another .
7 : 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar : but the breast shall be Aaron ' s and his sons '.
7 : 32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings .
7 : 33 He among the sons of Aaron , that offereth the blood of the peace offerings , and the fat , shall have the right shoulder for his part .
7 : 35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron , and of the anointing of his sons , out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest ' s office ; 7 : 36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel , in the day that he anointed them , by a statute for ever throughout their generations .
8 : 12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron ' s head , and anointed him , to sanctify him .
8 : 18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering : and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram .
8 : 19 And he killed it ; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about .
8 : 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water ; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar : it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour , and an offering made by fire unto the LORD ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 25 And he took the fat , and the rump , and all the fat that was upon the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and their fat , and the right shoulder : 8 : 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread , that was before the LORD , he took one unleavened cake , and a cake of oiled bread , and one wafer , and put them on the fat , and upon the right shoulder : 8 : 27 And he put all upon Aaron ' s hands , and upon his sons ' hands , and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD .
8 : 29 And Moses took the breast , and waved it for a wave offering before the LORD : for of the ram of consecration it was Moses ' part ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire .
9 : 6 And Moses said , This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do : and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you .
9 : 16 And he brought the burnt offering , and offered it according to the manner .
9 : 18 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings , which was for the people : and Aaron ' s sons presented unto him the blood , which he sprinkled upon the altar round about , 9 : 19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram , the rump , and that which covereth the inwards , and the kidneys , and the caul above the liver : 9 : 20 And they put the fat upon the breasts , and he burnt the fat upon the altar : 9 : 21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD ; as Moses commanded .
9 : 24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat : which when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces .
10 : 2 And there went out fire from the LORD , and devoured them , and they died before the LORD .
10 : 3 Then Moses said unto Aaron , This is it that the LORD spake , saying , I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me , and before all the people I will be glorified .
10 : 8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron , saying , 10 : 9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink , thou , nor thy sons with thee , when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation , lest ye die : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations : 10 : 10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy , and between unclean and clean ; 10 : 11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses .
10 : 15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat , to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD ; and it shall be thine , and thy sons ' with thee , by a statute for ever ; as the LORD hath commanded .
11 : 13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray , 11 : 14 And the vulture , and the kite after his kind ; 11 : 15 Every raven after his kind ; 11 : 16 And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind , 11 : 17 And the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl , 11 : 18 And the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle , 11 : 19 And the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
11 : 29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind , 11 : 30 And the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole .
11 : 33 And every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
12 : 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised .
12 : 4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days ; she shall touch no hallowed thing , nor come into the sanctuary , until the days of her purifying be fulfilled .
13 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron , saying , 13 : 2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising , a scab , or bright spot , and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy ; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest , or unto one of his sons the priests : 13 : 3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh : and when the hair in the plague is turned white , and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh , it is a plague of leprosy : and the priest shall look on him , and pronounce him unclean .
13 : 9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man , then he shall be brought unto the priest ; 13 : 10 And the priest shall see him : and , behold , if the rising be white in the skin , and it have turned the hair white , and there be quick raw flesh in the rising ; 13 : 11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh , and the priest shall pronounce him unclean , and shall not shut him up : for he is unclean .
13 : 23 But if the bright spot stay in his place , and spread not , it is a burning boil ; and the priest shall pronounce him clean .
13 : 45 And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , Unclean , unclean .
13 : 46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled ; he is unclean : he shall dwell alone ; without the camp shall his habitation be .
14 : 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes ; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes .
14 : 48 And if the priest shall come in , and look upon it , and , behold , the plague hath not spread in the house , after the house was plaistered : then the priest shall pronounce the house clean , because the plague is healed .
14 : 54 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy , and scall , 14 : 55 And for the leprosy of a garment , and of a house , 14 : 56 And for a rising , and for a scab , and for a bright spot : 14 : 57 To teach when it is unclean , and when it is clean : this is the law of leprosy .
15 : 4 Every bed , whereon he lieth that hath the issue , is unclean : and every thing , whereon he sitteth , shall be unclean .
15 : 18 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of copulation , they shall both bathe themselves in water , and be unclean until the even .
15 : 31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness ; that they die not in their uncleanness , when they defile my tabernacle that is among them .
16 : 18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD , and make an atonement for it ; and shall take of the blood of the bullock , and of the blood of the goat , and put it upon the horns of the altar round about .
16 : 25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar .
16 : 26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes , and bathe his flesh in water , and afterward come into the camp .
And he did as the LORD commanded Moses .
17 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 17 : 2 Speak unto Aaron , and unto his sons , and unto all the children of Israel , and say unto them ; This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded , saying , 17 : 3 What man soever there be of the house of Israel , that killeth an ox , or lamb , or goat , in the camp , or that killeth it out of the camp , 17 : 4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD ; blood shall be imputed unto that man ; he hath shed blood ; and that man shall be cut off from among his people : 17 : 5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices , which they offer in the open field , even that they may bring them unto the LORD , unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , unto the priest , and offer them for peace offerings unto the LORD .
17 : 10 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel , or of the strangers that sojourn among you , that eateth any manner of blood ; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood , and will cut him off from among his people .
17 : 12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel , No soul of you shall eat blood , neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood .
18 : 4 Ye shall do my judgments , and keep mine ordinances , to walk therein : I am the LORD your God .
18 : 5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes , and my judgments : which if a man do , he shall live in them : I am the LORD .
18 : 7 The nakedness of thy father , or the nakedness of thy mother , shalt thou not uncover : she is thy mother ; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness .
18 : 13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother ' s sister : for she is thy mother ' s near kinswoman .
18 : 16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother ' s wife : it is thy brother ' s nakedness .
19 : 3 Ye shall fear every man his mother , and his father , and keep my sabbaths : I am the LORD your God .
19 : 4 Turn ye not unto idols , nor make to yourselves molten gods : I am the LORD your God .
19 : 6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it , and on the morrow : and if ought remain until the third day , it shall be burnt in the fire .
19 : 11 Ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another .
19 : 13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour , neither rob him : the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the morning .
19 : 33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land , ye shall not vex him .
20 : 6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits , and after wizards , to go a whoring after them , I will even set my face against that soul , and will cut him off from among his people .
20 : 22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes , and all my judgments , and do them : that the land , whither I bring you to dwell therein , spue you not out .
21 : 6 They shall be holy unto their God , and not profane the name of their God : for the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and the bread of their God , they do offer : therefore they shall be holy .
21 : 8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore ; for he offereth the bread of thy God : he shall be holy unto thee : for I the LORD , which sanctify you , am holy .
21 : 9 And the daughter of any priest , if she profane herself by playing the whore , she profaneth her father : she shall be burnt with fire .
22 : 13 But if the priest ' s daughter be a widow , or divorced , and have no child , and is returned unto her father ' s house , as in her youth , she shall eat of her father ' s meat : but there shall be no stranger eat thereof .
22 : 15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel , which they offer unto the LORD ; 22 : 16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass , when they eat their holy things : for I the LORD do sanctify them .
23 : 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 23 : 10 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land which I give unto you , and shall reap the harvest thereof , then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest : 23 : 11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD , to be accepted for you : on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it .
23 : 21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day , that it may be an holy convocation unto you : ye shall do no servile work therein : it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations .
23 : 25 Ye shall do no servile work therein : but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
23 : 29 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day , he shall be cut off from among his people .
23 : 41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year .
24 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 24 : 2 Command the children of Israel , that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light , to cause the lamps to burn continually .
24 : 3 Without the vail of the testimony , in the tabernacle of the congregation , shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually : it shall be a statute for ever in your generations .
24 : 9 And it shall be Aaron ' s and his sons '; and they shall eat it in the holy place : for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute .
25 : 6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you ; for thee , and for thy servant , and for thy maid , and for thy hired servant , and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee .
25 : 8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee , seven times seven years ; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years .
25 : 10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year , and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof : it shall be a jubile unto you ; and ye shall return every man unto his possession , and ye shall return every man unto his family .
25 : 14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour , or buyest ought of thy neighbour ' s hand , ye shall not oppress one another : 25 : 15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour , and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee : 25 : 16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof , and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it : for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee .
25 : 26 And if the man have none to redeem it , and himself be able to redeem it ; 25 : 27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof , and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it ; that he may return unto his possession .
25 : 30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year , then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations : it shall not go out in the jubile .
25 : 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country : they may be redeemed , and they shall go out in the jubile .
25 : 32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites , and the houses of the cities of their possession , may the Levites redeem at any time .
25 : 35 And if thy brother be waxen poor , and fallen in decay with thee ; then thou shalt relieve him : yea , though he be a stranger , or a sojourner ; that he may live with thee .
25 : 52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile , then he shall count with him , and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption .
26 : 7 And ye shall chase your enemies , and they shall fall before you by the sword .
26 : 12 And I will walk among you , and will be your God , and ye shall be my people .
26 : 25 And I will bring a sword upon you , that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant : and when ye are gathered together within your cities , I will send the pestilence among you ; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy .
27 : 14 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD , then the priest shall estimate it , whether it be good or bad : as the priest shall estimate it , so shall it stand .
27 : 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house , then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it , and it shall be his .
27 : 17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile , according to thy estimation it shall stand .

These shall first set forth .
2 : 14 Then the tribe of Gad : and the captain of the sons of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel .

3 : 18 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families ; Libni , and Shimei .
3 : 21 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites , and the family of the Shimites : these are the families of the Gershonites .
3 : 25 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle , and the tent , the covering thereof , and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation , 3 : 26 And the hangings of the court , and the curtain for the door of the court , which is by the tabernacle , and by the altar round about , and the cords of it for all the service thereof .

4 : 7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue , and put thereon the dishes , and the spoons , and the bowls , and covers to cover withal : and the continual bread shall be thereon : 4 : 8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet , and cover the same with a covering of badgers ' skins , and shall put in the staves thereof .
4 : 31 And this is the charge of their burden , according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation ; the boards of the tabernacle , and the bars thereof , and the pillars thereof , and sockets thereof , 4 : 32 And the pillars of the court round about , and their sockets , and their pins , and their cords , with all their instruments , and with all their service : and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden .

6 : 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons , to the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : 6 : 11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , and make an atonement for him , for that he sinned by the dead , and shall hallow his head that same day .
6 : 12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation , and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering : but the days that were before shall be lost , because his separation was defiled .
7 : 11 And the LORD said unto Moses , They shall offer their offering , each prince on his day , for the dedicating of the altar .
7 : 48 On the seventh day Elishama the son of Ammihud , prince of the children of Ephraim , offered : 7 : 49 His offering was one silver charger , the weight whereof was an hundred and thirty shekels , one silver bowl of seventy shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering : 7 : 50 One golden spoon of ten shekels , full of incense : 7 : 51 One young bullock , one ram , one lamb of the first year , for a burnt offering : 7 : 52 One kid of the goats for a sin offering : 7 : 53 And for a sacrifice of peace offerings , two oxen , five rams , five he goats , five lambs of the first year : this was the offering of Elishama the son of Ammihud .
8 : 4 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold , unto the shaft thereof , unto the flowers thereof , was beaten work : according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses , so he made the candlestick .
8 : 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks : and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering , and the other for a burnt offering , unto the LORD , to make an atonement for the Levites .
8 : 22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron , and before his sons : as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did they unto them .
9 : 13 But the man that is clean , and is not in a journey , and forbeareth to keep the passover , even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people : because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season , that man shall bear his sin .

10 : 30 And he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred .
10 : 31 And he said , Leave us not , I pray thee ; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes .
have I begotten them , that thou shouldest say unto me , Carry them in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the sucking child , unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers ?
11 : 15 And if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness .

13 : 26 And they went and came to Moses , and to Aaron , and to all the congregation of the children of Israel , unto the wilderness of Paran , to Kadesh ; and brought back word unto them , and unto all the congregation , and shewed them the fruit of the land .
14 : 3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land , to fall by the sword , that our wives and our children should be a prey ?
14 : 12 I will smite them with the pestilence , and disinherit them , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they .
14 : 31 But your little ones , which ye said should be a prey , them will I bring in , and they shall know the land which ye have despised .
14 : 40 And they rose up early in the morning , and gat them up into the top of the mountain , saying , Lo , we be here , and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised : for we have sinned .
14 : 44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and Moses , departed not out of the camp .
14 : 45 Then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah .
15 : 7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine , for a sweet savour unto the LORD .

15 : 16 One law and one manner shall be for you , and for the stranger that sojourneth with you .
15 : 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 18 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye come into the land whither I bring you , 15 : 19 Then it shall be , that , when ye eat of the bread of the land , ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD .
15 : 22 And if ye have erred , and not observed all these commandments , which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses , 15 : 23 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses , from the day that the LORD commanded Moses , and henceforward among your generations ; 15 : 24 Then it shall be , if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation , that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering , for a sweet savour unto the LORD , with his meat offering , and his drink offering , according to the manner , and one kid of the goats for a sin offering .
15 : 27 And if any soul sin through ignorance , then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering .
15 : 31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD , and hath broken his commandment , that soul shall utterly be cut off ; his iniquity shall be upon him .
16 : 14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men ?

17 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that the man ' s rod , whom I shall choose , shall blossom : and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel , whereby they murmur against you .
17 : 6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel , and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece , for each prince one , according to their fathers ' houses , even twelve rods : and the rod of Aaron was among their rods .
18 : 11 And this is thine ; the heave offering of their gift , with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel : I have given them unto thee , and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee , by a statute for ever : every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it .
18 : 14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine .
18 : 16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem , according to thine estimation , for the money of five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary , which is twenty gerahs .
19 : 17 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin , and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel : 19 : 18 And a clean person shall take hyssop , and dip it in the water , and sprinkle it upon the tent , and upon all the vessels , and upon the persons that were there , and upon him that touched a bone , or one slain , or one dead , or a grave : 19 : 19 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day , and on the seventh day : and on the seventh day he shall purify himself , and wash his clothes , and bathe himself in water , and shall be clean at even .
19 : 21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them , that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes ; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even .
20 : 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock , and he said unto them , Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ?
20 : 19 And the children of Israel said unto him , We will go by the high way : and if I and my cattle drink of thy water , then I will pay for it : I will only , without doing anything else , go through on my feet .
20 : 22 And the children of Israel , even the whole congregation , journeyed from Kadesh , and came unto mount Hor .
20 : 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto mount Hor : 20 : 26 And strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son : and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people , and shall die there .
21 : 14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD , What he did in the Red sea , and in the brooks of Arnon , 21 : 15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar , and lieth upon the border of Moab .
21 : 16 And from thence they went to Beer : that is the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses , Gather the people together , and I will give them water .
21 : 27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say , Come into Heshbon , let the city of Sihon be built and prepared : 21 : 28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon , a flame from the city of Sihon : it hath consumed Ar of Moab , and the lords of the high places of Arnon .
thou art undone , O people of Chemosh : he hath given his sons that escaped , and his daughters , into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites .
21 : 34 And the LORD said unto Moses , Fear him not : for I have delivered him into thy hand , and all his people , and his land ; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites , which dwelt at Heshbon .
21 : 35 So they smote him , and his sons , and all his people , until there was none left him alive : and they possessed his land .
22 : 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people , because they were many : and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel .
22 : 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand ; and they came unto Balaam , and spake unto him the words of Balak .
22 : 10 And Balaam said unto God , Balak the son of Zippor , king of Moab , hath sent unto me , saying , 22 : 11 Behold , there is a people come out of Egypt , which covereth the face of the earth : come now , curse me them ; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them , and drive them out .
22 : 14 And the princes of Moab rose up , and they went unto Balak , and said , Balaam refuseth to come with us .
22 : 20 And God came unto Balaam at night , and said unto him , If the men come to call thee , rise up , and go with them ; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee , that shalt thou do .
22 : 24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards , a wall being on this side , and a wall on that side .
22 : 25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD , she thrust herself unto the wall , and crushed Balaam ' s foot against the wall : and he smote her again .
22 : 40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep , and sent to Balaam , and to the princes that were with him .
or how shall I defy , whom the LORD hath not defied ?
23 : 18 And he took up his parable , and said , Rise up , Balak , and hear ; hearken unto me , thou son of Zippor : 23 : 19 God is not a man , that he should lie ; neither the son of man , that he should repent : hath he said , and shall he not do it ?
23 : 22 God brought them out of Egypt ; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn .
24 : 1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel , he went not , as at other times , to seek for enchantments , but he set his face toward the wilderness .
Blessed is he that blesseth thee , and cursed is he that curseth thee .
24 : 10 And Balak ' s anger was kindled against Balaam , and he smote his hands together : and Balak said unto Balaam , I called thee to curse mine enemies , and , behold , thou hast altogether blessed them these three times .
24 : 14 And now , behold , I go unto my people : come therefore , and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days .
24 : 15 And he took up his parable , and said , Balaam the son of Beor hath said , and the man whose eyes are open hath said : 24 : 16 He hath said , which heard the words of God , and knew the knowledge of the most High , which saw the vision of the Almighty , falling into a trance , but having his eyes open : 24 : 17 I shall see him , but not now : I shall behold him , but not nigh : there shall come a Star out of Jacob , and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel , and shall smite the corners of Moab , and destroy all the children of Sheth .
25 : 3 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor : and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel .
25 : 7 And when Phinehas , the son of Eleazar , the son of Aaron the priest , saw it , he rose up from among the congregation , and took a javelin in his hand ; 25 : 8 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent , and thrust both of them through , the man of Israel , and the woman through her belly .
26 : 5 Reuben , the eldest son of Israel : the children of Reuben ; Hanoch , of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites : of Pallu , the family of the Palluites : 26 : 6 Of Hezron , the family of the Hezronites : of Carmi , the family of the Carmites .
This is that Dathan and Abiram , which were famous in the congregation , who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah , when they strove against the LORD : 26 : 10 And the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up together with Korah , when that company died , what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men : and they became a sign .
26 : 22 These are the families of Judah according to those that were numbered of them , threescore and sixteen thousand and five hundred .

These are the sons of Joseph after their families .
26 : 42 These are the sons of Dan after their families : of Shuham , the family of the Shuhamites .
26 : 46 And the name of the daughter of Asher was Sarah .
And Kohath begat Amram .
26 : 61 And Nadab and Abihu died , when they offered strange fire before the LORD .
26 : 62 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand , all males from a month old and upward : for they were not numbered among the children of Israel , because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel .
26 : 64 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered , when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai .
26 : 65 For the LORD had said of them , They shall surely die in the wilderness .
27 : 4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family , because he hath no son ?
Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father .
28 : 4 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning , and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even ; 28 : 5 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering , mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil .
28 : 6 It is a continual burnt offering , which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
28 : 26 Also in the day of the firstfruits , when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD , after your weeks be out , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : 28 : 27 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , one ram , seven lambs of the first year ; 28 : 28 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals unto one bullock , two tenth deals unto one ram , 28 : 29 A several tenth deal unto one lamb , throughout the seven lambs ; 28 : 30 And one kid of the goats , to make an atonement for you .
29 : 7 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy convocation ; and ye shall afflict your souls : ye shall not do any work therein : 29 : 8 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet savour ; one young bullock , one ram , and seven lambs of the first year ; they shall be unto you without blemish : 29 : 9 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals to a bullock , and two tenth deals to one ram , 29 : 10 A several tenth deal for one lamb , throughout the seven lambs : 29 : 11 One kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the sin offering of atonement , and the continual burnt offering , and the meat offering of it , and their drink offerings .

31 : 6 And Moses sent them to the war , a thousand of every tribe , them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest , to the war , with the holy instruments , and the trumpets to blow in his hand .
31 : 13 And Moses , and Eleazar the priest , and all the princes of the congregation , went forth to meet them without the camp .
31 : 30 And of the children of Israel ' s half , thou shalt take one portion of fifty , of the persons , of the beeves , of the asses , and of the flocks , of all manner of beasts , and give them unto the Levites , which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD .
32 : 8 Thus did your fathers , when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land .
32 : 10 And the LORD ' s anger was kindled the same time , and he sware , saying , 32 : 11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt , from twenty years old and upward , shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob ; because they have not wholly followed me : 32 : 12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite , and Joshua the son of Nun : for they have wholly followed the LORD .
32 : 18 We will not return unto our houses , until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance .
32 : 32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan , that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours .
32 : 33 And Moses gave unto them , even to the children of Gad , and to the children of Reuben , and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph , the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites , and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan , the land , with the cities thereof in the coasts , even the cities of the country round about .
33 : 1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel , which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron .
33 : 2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD : and these are their journeys according to their goings out .
33 : 4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn , which the LORD had smitten among them : upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments .
33 : 5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses , and pitched in Succoth .
33 : 12 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin , and encamped in Dophkah .
33 : 18 And they departed from Hazeroth , and pitched in Rithmah .

33 : 24 And they removed from mount Shapher , and encamped in Haradah .
33 : 42 And they departed from Zalmonah , and pitched in Punon .
33 : 48 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim , and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho .
34 : 7 And this shall be your north border : from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor : 34 : 8 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath ; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad : 34 : 9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron , and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan : this shall be your north border .
34 : 10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham : 34 : 11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah , on the east side of Ain ; and the border shall descend , and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward : 34 : 12 And the border shall go down to Jordan , and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea : this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about .
34 : 13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel , saying , This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot , which the LORD commanded to give unto the nine tribes , and to the half tribe : 34 : 14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their fathers , and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers , have received their inheritance ; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance : 34 : 15 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward , toward the sunrising .
34 : 23 The prince of the children of Joseph , for the tribe of the children of Manasseh , Hanniel the son of Ephod .
34 : 24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim , Kemuel the son of Shiphtan .
34 : 25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun , Elizaphan the son of Parnach .
35 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho , saying , 35 : 2 Command the children of Israel , that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in ; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them .
35 : 13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge .
35 : 15 These six cities shall be a refuge , both for the children of Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them : that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .
35 : 33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are : for blood it defileth the land : and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein , but by the blood of him that shed it .
36 : 10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses , so did the daughters of Zelophehad : 36 : 11 For Mahlah , Tirzah , and Hoglah , and Milcah , and Noah , the daughters of Zelophehad , were married unto their father ' s brothers ' sons : 36 : 12 And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph , and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father .
1 : 17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment ; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man ; for the judgment is God ' s : and the cause that is too hard for you , bring it unto me , and I will hear it .
1 : 28 Whither shall we go up ?
our brethren have discouraged our heart , saying , The people is greater and taller than we ; the cities are great and walled up to heaven ; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there .
1 : 37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes , saying , Thou also shalt not go in thither .
1 : 42 And the LORD said unto me , Say unto them .
2 : 10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past , a people great , and many , and tall , as the Anakims ; 2 : 11 Which also were accounted giants , as the Anakims ; but the Moabites called them Emims .
2 : 15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them , to destroy them from among the host , until they were consumed .
2 : 31 And the LORD said unto me , Behold , I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee : begin to possess , that thou mayest inherit his land .
3 : 7 But all the cattle , and the spoil of the cities , we took for a prey to ourselves .
3 : 12 And this land , which we possessed at that time , from Aroer , which is by the river Arnon , and half mount Gilead , and the cities thereof , gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites .
3 : 13 And the rest of Gilead , and all Bashan , being the kingdom of Og , gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh ; all the region of Argob , with all Bashan , which was called the land of giants .
3 : 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time , saying , Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings : so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest .
4 : 6 Keep therefore and do them ; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations , which shall hear all these statutes , and say , Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people .
4 : 12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire : ye heard the voice of the words , but saw no similitude ; only ye heard a voice .
4 : 32 For ask now of the days that are past , which were before thee , since the day that God created man upon the earth , and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other , whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is , or hath been heard like it ?
4 : 36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice , that he might instruct thee : and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire ; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire .
4 : 37 And because he loved thy fathers , therefore he chose their seed after them , and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt ; 4 : 38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art , to bring thee in , to give thee their land for an inheritance , as it is this day .
4 : 46 On this side Jordan , in the valley over against Bethpeor , in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites , who dwelt at Heshbon , whom Moses and the children of Israel smote , after they were come forth out of Egypt : 4 : 47 And they possessed his land , and the land of Og king of Bashan , two kings of the Amorites , which were on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ; 4 : 48 From Aroer , which is by the bank of the river Arnon , even unto mount Sion , which is Hermon , 4 : 49 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward , even unto the sea of the plain , under the springs of Pisgah .
5 : 4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire , 5 : 5 ( I stood between the LORD and you at that time , to shew you the word of the LORD : for ye were afraid by reason of the fire , and went not up into the mount ;) saying , 5 : 6 I am the LORD thy God , which brought thee out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage .
5 : 12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it , as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee .
And he wrote them in two tables of stone , and delivered them unto me .
5 : 25 Now therefore why should we die ?
5 : 28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words , when ye spake unto me ; and the LORD said unto me , I have heard the voice of the words of this people , which they have spoken unto thee : they have well said all that they have spoken .
6 : 3 Hear therefore , O Israel , and observe to do it ; that it may be well with thee , and that ye may increase mightily , as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee , in the land that floweth with milk and honey .
7 : 5 But thus shall ye deal with them ; ye shall destroy their altars , and break down their images , and cut down their groves , and burn their graven images with fire .
7 : 7 The LORD did not set his love upon you , nor choose you , because ye were more in number than any people ; for ye were the fewest of all people : 7 : 8 But because the LORD loved you , and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers , hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand , and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen , from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt .
7 : 9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God , he is God , the faithful God , which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations ; 7 : 10 And repayeth them that hate him to their face , to destroy them : he will not be slack to him that hateth him , he will repay him to his face .
7 : 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass , if ye hearken to these judgments , and keep , and do them , that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers : 7 : 13 And he will love thee , and bless thee , and multiply thee : he will also bless the fruit of thy womb , and the fruit of thy land , thy corn , and thy wine , and thine oil , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep , in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee .
7 : 24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand , and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven : there shall no man be able to stand before thee , until thou have destroyed them .
7 : 25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire : thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them , nor take it unto thee , lest thou be snared therin : for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God .
9 : 6 Understand therefore , that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness ; for thou art a stiffnecked people .
9 : 17 And I took the two tables , and cast them out of my two hands , and brake them before your eyes .
9 : 18 And I fell down before the LORD , as at the first , forty days and forty nights : I did neither eat bread , nor drink water , because of all your sins which ye sinned , in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger .
9 : 21 And I took your sin , the calf which ye had made , and burnt it with fire , and stamped it , and ground it very small , even until it was as small as dust : and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount .
10 : 1 At that time the LORD said unto me , Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first , and come up unto me into the mount , and make thee an ark of wood .
10 : 2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest , and thou shalt put them in the ark .
10 : 7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah ; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath , a land of rivers of waters .
10 : 8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi , to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD , to stand before the LORD to minister unto him , and to bless in his name , unto this day .
10 : 14 Behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD ' s thy God , the earth also , with all that therein is .
11 : 2 And know ye this day : for I speak not with your children which have not known , and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God , his greatness , his mighty hand , and his stretched out arm , 11 : 3 And his miracles , and his acts , which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt , and unto all his land ; 11 : 4 And what he did unto the army of Egypt , unto their horses , and to their chariots ; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you , and how the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day ; 11 : 5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness , until ye came into this place ; 11 : 6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab , the son of Reuben : how the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed them up , and their households , and their tents , and all the substance that was in their possession , in the midst of all Israel : 11 : 7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did .
11 : 22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you , to do them , to love the LORD your God , to walk in all his ways , and to cleave unto him ; 11 : 23 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you , and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves .
11 : 30 Are they not on the other side Jordan , by the way where the sun goeth down , in the land of the Canaanites , which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal , beside the plains of Moreh ?
11 : 32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day .
12 : 1 These are the statutes and judgments , which ye shall observe to do in the land , which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it , all the days that ye live upon the earth .
12 : 2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places , wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods , upon the high mountains , and upon the hills , and under every green tree : 12 : 3 And ye shall overthrow their altars , and break their pillars , and burn their groves with fire ; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods , and destroy the names of them out of that place .
12 : 10 But when ye go over Jordan , and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit , and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about , so that ye dwell in safety ; 12 : 11 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there ; thither shall ye bring all that I command you ; your burnt offerings , and your sacrifices , your tithes , and the heave offering of your hand , and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD : 12 : 12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God , ye , and your sons , and your daughters , and your menservants , and your maidservants , and the Levite that is within your gates ; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you .
12 : 25 Thou shalt not eat it ; that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the LORD .
12 : 29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee , whither thou goest to possess them , and thou succeedest them , and dwellest in their land ; 12 : 30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them , after that they be destroyed from before thee ; and that thou enquire not after their gods , saying , How did these nations serve their gods ?
So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee .
13 : 11 And all Israel shall hear , and fear , and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you .
14 : 1 Ye are the children of the LORD your God : ye shall not cut yourselves , nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead .
14 : 12 But these are they of which ye shall not eat : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray , 14 : 13 And the glede , and the kite , and the vulture after his kind , 14 : 14 And every raven after his kind , 14 : 15 And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind , 14 : 16 The little owl , and the great owl , and the swan , 14 : 17 And the pelican , and the gier eagle , and the cormorant , 14 : 18 And the stork , and the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
14 : 23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God , in the place which he shall choose to place his name there , the tithe of thy corn , of thy wine , and of thine oil , and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks ; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always .
14 : 28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year , and shalt lay it up within thy gates : 14 : 29 And the Levite , ( because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee ,) and the stranger , and the fatherless , and the widow , which are within thy gates , shall come , and shall eat and be satisfied ; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest .
15 : 15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee : therefore I command thee this thing to day .
15 : 21 And if there be any blemish therein , as if it be lame , or blind , or have any ill blemish , thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God .
15 : 23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof ; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water .
16 : 1 Observe the month of Abib , and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God : for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night .
16 : 8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread : and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God : thou shalt do no work therein .
16 : 18 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , throughout thy tribes : and they shall judge the people with just judgment .
17 : 2 If there be found among you , within any of thy gates which the LORD thy God giveth thee , man or woman , that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God , in transgressing his covenant , 17 : 3 And hath gone and served other gods , and worshipped them , either the sun , or moon , or any of the host of heaven , which I have not commanded ; 17 : 4 And it be told thee , and thou hast heard of it , and enquired diligently , and , behold , it be true , and the thing certain , that such abomination is wrought in Israel : 17 : 5 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman , which have committed that wicked thing , unto thy gates , even that man or that woman , and shalt stone them with stones , till they die .
17 : 7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death , and afterward the hands of all the people .
18 : 13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God .
18 : 17 And the LORD said unto me , They have well spoken that which they have spoken .
18 : 18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren , like unto thee , and will put my words in his mouth ; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him .
19 : 3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way , and divide the coasts of thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit , into three parts , that every slayer may flee thither .
19 : 4 And this is the case of the slayer , which shall flee thither , that he may live : Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly , whom he hated not in time past ; 19 : 5 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood , and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree , and the head slippeth from the helve , and lighteth upon his neighbour , that he die ; he shall flee unto one of those cities , and live : 19 : 6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer , while his heart is hot , and overtake him , because the way is long , and slay him ; whereas he was not worthy of death , inasmuch as he hated him not in time past .
20 : 1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies , and seest horses , and chariots , and a people more than thou , be not afraid of them : for the LORD thy God is with thee , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt .
20 : 2 And it shall be , when ye are come nigh unto the battle , that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people , 20 : 3 And shall say unto them , Hear , O Israel , ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies : let not your hearts faint , fear not , and do not tremble , neither be ye terrified because of them ; 20 : 4 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you , to fight for you against your enemies , to save you .
let him go and return unto his house , lest he die in the battle , and another man take her .
let him go and return unto his house , lest his brethren ' s heart faint as well as his heart .
20 : 10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it , then proclaim peace unto it .
20 : 16 But of the cities of these people , which the LORD thy God doth give thee for an inheritance , thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth : 20 : 17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them ; namely , the Hittites , and the Amorites , the Canaanites , and the Perizzites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee : 20 : 18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations , which they have done unto their gods ; so should ye sin against the LORD your God .
21 : 1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it , lying in the field , and it be not known who hath slain him : 21 : 2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth , and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain : 21 : 3 And it shall be , that the city which is next unto the slain man , even the elders of that city shall take an heifer , which hath not been wrought with , and which hath not drawn in the yoke ; 21 : 4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley , which is neither eared nor sown , and shall strike off the heifer ' s neck there in the valley : 21 : 5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near ; for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him , and to bless in the name of the LORD ; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried : 21 : 6 And all the elders of that city , that are next unto the slain man , shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley : 21 : 7 And they shall answer and say , Our hands have not shed this blood , neither have our eyes seen it .
And the blood shall be forgiven them .
22 : 2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee , or if thou know him not , then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house , and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it , and thou shalt restore it to him again .
22 : 8 When thou buildest a new house , then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof , that thou bring not blood upon thine house , if any man fall from thence .
22 : 10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together .
22 : 22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband , then they shall both of them die , both the man that lay with the woman , and the woman : so shalt thou put away evil from Israel .
23 : 9 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies , then keep thee from every wicked thing .
23 : 25 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour , then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand ; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour ' s standing corn .
24 : 6 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge : for he taketh a man ' s life to pledge .
24 : 8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy , that thou observe diligently , and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you : as I commanded them , so ye shall observe to do .
24 : 10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing , thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge .
24 : 17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger , nor of the fatherless ; nor take a widow ' s raiment to pledge : 24 : 18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt , and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence : therefore I command thee to do this thing .
25 : 11 When men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him , and putteth forth her hand , and taketh him by the secrets : 25 : 12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand , thine eye shall not pity her .
25 : 16 For all that do such things , and all that do unrighteously , are an abomination unto the LORD thy God .
26 : 4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand , and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God .
And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God , and worship before the LORD thy God : 26 : 11 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee , and unto thine house , thou , and the Levite , and the stranger that is among you .
27 : 1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people , saying , Keep all the commandments which I command you this day .
27 : 10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God , and do his commandments and his statutes , which I command thee this day .
And all the people shall say , Amen .
And all the people shall say , Amen .
27 : 24 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly .
28 : 13 And the LORD shall make thee the head , and not the tail ; and thou shalt be above only , and thou shalt not be beneath ; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God , which I command thee this day , to observe and to do them : 28 : 14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day , to the right hand , or to the left , to go after other gods to serve them .
28 : 18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body , and the fruit of thy land , the increase of thy kine , and the flocks of thy sheep .
28 : 21 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee , until he have consumed thee from off the land , whither thou goest to possess it .
28 : 23 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass , and the earth that is under thee shall be iron .
28 : 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife , and another man shall lie with her : thou shalt build an house , and thou shalt not dwell therein : thou shalt plant a vineyard , and shalt not gather the grapes thereof .
28 : 35 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees , and in the legs , with a sore botch that cannot be healed , from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head .
28 : 38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field , and shalt gather but little in ; for the locust shall consume it .
28 : 40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts , but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil ; for thine olive shall cast his fruit .
28 : 44 He shall lend to thee , and thou shalt not lend to him : he shall be the head , and thou shalt be the tail .
28 : 49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far , from the end of the earth , as swift as the eagle flieth ; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand ; 28 : 50 A nation of fierce countenance , which shall not regard the person of the old , nor shew favour to the young : 28 : 51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle , and the fruit of thy land , until thou be destroyed : which also shall not leave thee either corn , wine , or oil , or the increase of thy kine , or flocks of thy sheep , until he have destroyed thee .
28 : 52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates , until thy high and fenced walls come down , wherein thou trustedst , throughout all thy land : and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land , which the LORD thy God hath given thee .
28 : 60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt , which thou wast afraid of ; and they shall cleave unto thee .
28 : 62 And ye shall be left few in number , whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude ; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God .
28 : 64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people , from the one end of the earth even unto the other ; and there thou shalt serve other gods , which neither thou nor thy fathers have known , even wood and stone .
29 : 10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God ; your captains of your tribes , your elders , and your officers , with all the men of Israel , 29 : 11 Your little ones , your wives , and thy stranger that is in thy camp , from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water : 29 : 12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God , and into his oath , which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day : 29 : 13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself , and that he may be unto thee a God , as he hath said unto thee , and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob .
29 : 14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath ; 29 : 15 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God , and also with him that is not here with us this day : 29 : 16 ( For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt ; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by ; 29 : 17 And ye have seen their abominations , and their idols , wood and stone , silver and gold , which were among them :) 29 : 18 Lest there should be among you man , or woman , or family , or tribe , whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God , to go and serve the gods of these nations ; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood ; 29 : 19 And it come to pass , when he heareth the words of this curse , that he bless himself in his heart , saying , I shall have peace , though I walk in the imagination of mine heart , to add drunkenness to thirst : 29 : 20 The LORD will not spare him , but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man , and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him , and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven .
29 : 25 Then men shall say , Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers , which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt : 29 : 26 For they went and served other gods , and worshipped them , gods whom they knew not , and whom he had not given unto them : 29 : 27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land , to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book : 29 : 28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger , and in wrath , and in great indignation , and cast them into another land , as it is this day .
29 : 29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God : but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever , that we may do all the words of this law .
31 : 6 Be strong and of a good courage , fear not , nor be afraid of them : for the LORD thy God , he it is that doth go with thee ; he will not fail thee , nor forsake thee .
31 : 8 And the LORD , he it is that doth go before thee ; he will be with thee , he will not fail thee , neither forsake thee : fear not , neither be dismayed .
31 : 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers , that floweth with milk and honey ; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves , and waxen fat ; then will they turn unto other gods , and serve them , and provoke me , and break my covenant .
31 : 21 And it shall come to pass , when many evils and troubles are befallen them , that this song shall testify against them as a witness ; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed : for I know their imagination which they go about , even now , before I have brought them into the land which I sware .
31 : 22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day , and taught it the children of Israel .
32 : 15 But Jeshurun waxed fat , and kicked : thou art waxen fat , thou art grown thick , thou art covered with fatness ; then he forsook God which made him , and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation .
32 : 29 O that they were wise , that they understood this , that they would consider their latter end !
32 : 31 For their rock is not as our Rock , even our enemies themselves being judges .
32 : 39 See now that I , even I , am he , and there is no god with me : I kill , and I make alive ; I wound , and I heal : neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand .
32 : 40 For I lift up my hand to heaven , and say , I live for ever .
32 : 41 If I whet my glittering sword , and mine hand take hold on judgment ; I will render vengeance to mine enemies , and will reward them that hate me .
32 : 45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel : 32 : 46 And he said unto them , Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day , which ye shall command your children to observe to do , all the words of this law .
32 : 48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day , saying , 32 : 49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim , unto mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; and behold the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession : 32 : 50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people ; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor , and was gathered unto his people : 32 : 51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh , in the wilderness of Zin ; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel .
33 : 1 And this is the blessing , wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death .
33 : 17 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock , and his horns are like the horns of unicorns : with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth : and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim , and they are the thousands of Manasseh .
33 : 18 And of Zebulun he said , Rejoice , Zebulun , in thy going out ; and , Issachar , in thy tents .
33 : 27 The eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are the everlasting arms : and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee ; and shall say , Destroy them .
34 : 1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , to the top of Pisgah , that is over against Jericho .
1 : 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river , the river Euphrates , all the land of the Hittites , and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun , shall be your coast .
1 : 7 Only be thou strong and very courageous , that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law , which Moses my servant commanded thee : turn not from it to the right hand or to the left , that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest .
Be strong and of a good courage ; be not afraid , neither be thou dismayed : for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest .
1 : 14 Your wives , your little ones , and your cattle , shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan ; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed , all the mighty men of valour , and help them ; 1 : 15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest , as he hath given you , and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them : then ye shall return unto the land of your possession , and enjoy it , which Moses the LORD ' s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising .
2 : 1 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly , saying , Go view the land , even Jericho .
And they went , and came into an harlot ' s house , named Rahab , and lodged there .
2 : 4 And the woman took the two men , and hid them , and said thus , There came men unto me , but I wist not whence they were : 2 : 5 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate , when it was dark , that the men went out : whither the men went I wot not : pursue after them quickly ; for ye shall overtake them .
2 : 11 And as soon as we had heard these things , our hearts did melt , neither did there remain any more courage in any man , because of you : for the LORD your God , he is God in heaven above , and in earth beneath .
2 : 14 And the men answered her , Our life for yours , if ye utter not this our business .
2 : 20 And if thou utter this our business , then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear .
2 : 22 And they went , and came unto the mountain , and abode there three days , until the pursuers were returned : and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way , but found them not .
3 : 4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it , about two thousand cubits by measure : come not near unto it , that ye may know the way by which ye must go : for ye have not passed this way heretofore .
And they took up the ark of the covenant , and went before the people .
3 : 11 Behold , the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan .
3 : 17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan , and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground , until all the people were passed clean over Jordan .
4 : 8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded , and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan , as the LORD spake unto Joshua , according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel , and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged , and laid them down there .
4 : 11 And it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over , that the ark of the LORD passed over , and the priests , in the presence of the people .
4 : 12 And the children of Reuben , and the children of Gad , and half the tribe of Manasseh , passed over armed before the children of Israel , as Moses spake unto them : 4 : 13 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle , to the plains of Jericho .
5 : 5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised : but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt , them they had not circumcised .
5 : 9 And the LORD said unto Joshua , This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you .
Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day .
5 : 13 And it came to pass , when Joshua was by Jericho , that he lifted up his eyes and looked , and , behold , there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand : and Joshua went unto him , and said unto him , Art thou for us , or for our adversaries ?
6 : 11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city , going about it once : and they came into the camp , and lodged in the camp .
6 : 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day , that they rose early about the dawning of the day , and compassed the city after the same manner seven times : only on that day they compassed the city seven times .
6 : 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time , when the priests blew with the trumpets , Joshua said unto the people , Shout ; for the LORD hath given you the city .
6 : 21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city , both man and woman , young and old , and ox , and sheep , and ass , with the edge of the sword .
6 : 25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive , and her father ' s household , and all that she had ; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day ; because she hid the messengers , which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho .
7 : 14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes : and it shall be , that the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families thereof ; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households ; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man .
7 : 15 And it shall be , that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire , he and all that he hath : because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD , and because he hath wrought folly in Israel .
7 : 20 And Achan answered Joshua , and said , Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel , and thus and thus have I done : 7 : 21 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment , and two hundred shekels of silver , and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight , then I coveted them , and took them ; and , behold , they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent , and the silver under it .
7 : 23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent , and brought them unto Joshua , and unto all the children of Israel , and laid them out before the LORD .
So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger .
8 : 17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel , that went not out after Israel : and they left the city open , and pursued after Israel .
8 : 23 And the king of Ai they took alive , and brought him to Joshua .
8 : 24 And it came to pass , when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field , in the wilderness wherein they chased them , and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword , until they were consumed , that all the Israelites returned unto Ai , and smote it with the edge of the sword .
8 : 27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves , according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua .
9 : 8 And they said unto Joshua , We are thy servants .
9 : 17 And the children of Israel journeyed , and came unto their cities on the third day .
9 : 18 And the children of Israel smote them not , because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel .
9 : 23 Now therefore ye are cursed , and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen , and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God .
9 : 26 And so did he unto them , and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel , that they slew them not .
So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven , and hasted not to go down about a whole day .
10 : 16 But these five kings fled , and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah .
10 : 27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun , that Joshua commanded , and they took them down off the trees , and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid , and laid great stones in the cave ' s mouth , which remain until this very day .
10 : 28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof he utterly destroyed , them , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain : and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho .
10 : 29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah , and all Israel with him , unto Libnah , and fought against Libnah : 10 : 30 And the LORD delivered it also , and the king thereof , into the hand of Israel ; and he smote it with the edge of the sword , and all the souls that were therein ; he let none remain in it ; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho .
10 : 38 And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , to Debir ; and fought against it : 10 : 39 And he took it , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof ; and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining : as he had done to Hebron , so he did to Debir , and to the king thereof ; as he had done also to Libnah , and to her king .
10 : 40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills , and of the south , and of the vale , and of the springs , and all their kings : he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the LORD God of Israel commanded .
10 : 43 And Joshua returned , and all Israel with him , unto the camp to Gilgal .
11 : 21 And at that time came Joshua , and cut off the Anakims from the mountains , from Hebron , from Debir , from Anab , and from all the mountains of Judah , and from all the mountains of Israel : Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities .
11 : 22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel : only in Gaza , in Gath , and in Ashdod , there remained .
11 : 23 So Joshua took the whole land , according to all that the LORD said unto Moses ; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes .
12 : 6 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite : and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a possession unto the Reubenites , and the Gadites , and the half tribe of Manasseh .
13 : 7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes , and the half tribe of Manasseh , 13 : 8 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance , which Moses gave them , beyond Jordan eastward , even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them ; 13 : 9 From Aroer , that is upon the bank of the river Arnon , and the city that is in the midst of the river , and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon ; 13 : 10 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites , which reigned in Heshbon , unto the border of the children of Ammon ; 13 : 11 And Gilead , and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites , and all mount Hermon , and all Bashan unto Salcah ; 13 : 12 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan , which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei , who remained of the remnant of the giants : for these did Moses smite , and cast them out .
13 : 14 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance ; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance , as he said unto them .
13 : 15 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families .
13 : 22 Balaam also the son of Beor , the soothsayer , did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them .
14 : 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan : but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them .
14 : 11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me : as my strength was then , even so is my strength now , for war , both to go out , and to come in .
And the land had rest from war .
And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan : 15 : 6 And the border went up to Bethhogla , and passed along by the north of Betharabah ; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben : 15 : 7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor , and so northward , looking toward Gilgal , that is before the going up to Adummim , which is on the south side of the river : and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh , and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel : 15 : 8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite ; the same is Jerusalem : and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward , which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward : 15 : 9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah , and went out to the cities of mount Ephron ; and the border was drawn to Baalah , which is Kirjathjearim : 15 : 10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir , and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim , which is Chesalon , on the north side , and went down to Bethshemesh , and passed on to Timnah : 15 : 11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward : and the border was drawn to Shicron , and passed along to mount Baalah , and went out unto Jabneel ; and the goings out of the border were at the sea .
15 : 14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak , Sheshai , and Ahiman , and Talmai , the children of Anak .
16 : 10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer : but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day , and serve under tribute .
17 : 1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh ; for he was the firstborn of Joseph ; to wit , for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh , the father of Gilead : because he was a man of war , therefore he had Gilead and Bashan .
17 : 15 And Joshua answered them , If thou be a great people , then get thee up to the wood country , and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants , if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee .
18 : 14 And the border was drawn thence , and compassed the corner of the sea southward , from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward ; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal , which is Kirjathjearim , a city of the children of Judah : this was the west quarter .
This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin , by the coasts thereof round about , according to their families .
18 : 21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho , and Bethhoglah , and the valley of Keziz , 18 : 22 And Betharabah , and Zemaraim , and Bethel , 18 : 23 And Avim , and Pharah , and Ophrah , 18 : 24 And Chepharhaammonai , and Ophni , and Gaba ; twelve cities with their villages : 18 : 25 Gibeon , and Ramah , and Beeroth , 18 : 26 And Mizpeh , and Chephirah , and Mozah , 18 : 27 And Rekem , and Irpeel , and Taralah , 18 : 28 And Zelah , Eleph , and Jebusi , which is Jerusalem , Gibeath , and Kirjath ; fourteen cities with their villages .
This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families .
19 : 16 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according to their families , these cities with their villages .
19 : 24 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families .
So they made an end of dividing the country .
20 : 6 And he shall dwell in that city , until he stand before the congregation for judgment , and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days : then shall the slayer return , and come unto his own city , and unto his own house , unto the city from whence he fled .
20 : 9 These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel , and for the stranger that sojourneth among them , that whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither , and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood , until he stood before the congregation .
21 : 5 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim , and out of the tribe of Dan , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh , ten cities .
21 : 9 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah , and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon , these cities which are here mentioned by name .
21 : 20 And the families of the children of Kohath , the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath , even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim .
21 : 28 And out of the tribe of Issachar , Kishon with her suburbs , Dabareh with her suburbs , 21 : 29 Jarmuth with her suburbs , Engannim with her suburbs ; four cities .
21 : 34 And unto the families of the children of Merari , the rest of the Levites , out of the tribe of Zebulun , Jokneam with her suburbs , and Kartah with her suburbs , 21 : 35 Dimnah with her suburbs , Nahalal with her suburbs ; four cities .
21 : 36 And out of the tribe of Reuben , Bezer with her suburbs , and Jahazah with her suburbs , 21 : 37 Kedemoth with her suburbs , and Mephaath with her suburbs ; four cities .
22 : 9 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned , and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh , which is in the land of Canaan , to go unto the country of Gilead , to the land of their possession , whereof they were possessed , according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
22 : 19 Notwithstanding , if the land of your possession be unclean , then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD , wherein the LORD ' s tabernacle dwelleth , and take possession among us : but rebel not against the LORD , nor rebel against us , in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God .
22 : 21 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered , and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel , 22 : 22 The LORD God of gods , the LORD God of gods , he knoweth , and Israel he shall know ; if it be in rebellion , or if in transgression against the LORD , ( save us not this day ,) 22 : 23 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD , or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering , or if to offer peace offerings thereon , let the LORD himself require it ; 22 : 24 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing , saying , In time to come your children might speak unto our children , saying , What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel ?
22 : 30 And when Phinehas the priest , and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were with him , heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake , it pleased them .
23 : 2 And Joshua called for all Israel , and for their elders , and for their heads , and for their judges , and for their officers , and said unto them , I am old and stricken in age : 23 : 3 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you ; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you .
23 : 9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong : but as for you , no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day .
23 : 10 One man of you shall chase a thousand : for the LORD your God , he it is that fighteth for you , as he hath promised you .
23 : 16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God , which he commanded you , and have gone and served other gods , and bowed yourselves to them ; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you , and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you .
24 : 4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau : and I gave unto Esau mount Seir , to possess it ; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt .
24 : 11 And you went over Jordan , and came unto Jericho : and the men of Jericho fought against you , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Girgashites , the Hivites , and the Jebusites ; and I delivered them into your hand .
24 : 21 And the people said unto Joshua , Nay ; but we will serve the LORD .
24 : 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God , and took a great stone , and set it up there under an oak , that was by the sanctuary of the LORD .
The Book of Judges
1 : 1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass , that the children of Israel asked the LORD , saying , Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first , to fight against them ?
2 : 3 Wherefore I also said , I will not drive them out from before you ; but they shall be as thorns in your sides , and their gods shall be a snare unto you .
2 : 10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers : and there arose another generation after them , which knew not the LORD , nor yet the works which he had done for Israel .
2 : 14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel , and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them , and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about , so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies .
2 : 16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges , which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them .
2 : 17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges , but they went a whoring after other gods , and bowed themselves unto them : they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in , obeying the commandments of the LORD ; but they did not so .
3 : 1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left , to prove Israel by them , even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan ; 3 : 2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know , to teach them war , at the least such as before knew nothing thereof ; 3 : 3 Namely , five lords of the Philistines , and all the Canaanites , and the Sidonians , and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon , from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath .
3 : 10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he judged Israel , and went out to war : and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand ; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim .
3 : 18 And when he had made an end to offer the present , he sent away the people that bare the present .
And he arose out of his seat .
3 : 21 And Ehud put forth his left hand , and took the dagger from his right thigh , and thrust it into his belly : 3 : 22 And the haft also went in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade , so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly ; and the dirt came out .
3 : 28 And he said unto them , Follow after me : for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand .
4 : 10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh ; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet : and Deborah went up with him .
4 : 19 And he said unto her , Give me , I pray thee , a little water to drink ; for I am thirsty .
5 : 15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah ; even Issachar , and also Barak : he was sent on foot into the valley .
For the divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart .
For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of heart .
5 : 24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be , blessed shall she be above women in the tent .
5 : 29 Her wise ladies answered her , yea , she returned answer to herself , 5 : 30 Have they not sped ?
have they not divided the prey ; to every man a damsel or two ; to Sisera a prey of divers colours , a prey of divers colours of needlework , of divers colours of needlework on both sides , meet for the necks of them that take the spoil ?
And the land had rest forty years .
6 : 1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years .
6 : 2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel : and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains , and caves , and strong holds .
6 : 3 And so it was , when Israel had sown , that the Midianites came up , and the Amalekites , and the children of the east , even they came up against them ; 6 : 4 And they encamped against them , and destroyed the increase of the earth , till thou come unto Gaza , and left no sustenance for Israel , neither sheep , nor ox , nor ass .
6 : 7 And it came to pass , when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites , 6 : 8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel , which said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I brought you up from Egypt , and brought you forth out of the house of bondage ; 6 : 9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians , and out of the hand of all that oppressed you , and drave them out from before you , and gave you their land ; 6 : 10 And I said unto you , I am the LORD your God ; fear not the gods of the Amorites , in whose land ye dwell : but ye have not obeyed my voice .
6 : 16 And the LORD said unto him , Surely I will be with thee , and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man .
6 : 17 And he said unto him , If now I have found grace in thy sight , then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me .
6 : 32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal , saying , Let Baal plead against him , because he hath thrown down his altar .
6 : 34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon , and he blew a trumpet ; and Abiezer was gathered after him .
And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand ; and there remained ten thousand .
7 : 9 And it came to pass the same night , that the LORD said unto him , Arise , get thee down unto the host ; for I have delivered it into thine hand .
7 : 12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude ; and their camels were without number , as the sand by the sea side for multitude .
8 : 10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor , and their hosts with them , about fifteen thousand men , all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east : for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword .
8 : 16 And he took the elders of the city , and thorns of the wilderness and briers , and with them he taught the men of Succoth .
And they answered , As thou art , so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king .
8 : 34 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God , who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side : 8 : 35 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal , namely , Gideon , according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel .
9 : 5 And he went unto his father ' s house at Ophrah , and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal , being threescore and ten persons , upon one stone : notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left ; for he hid himself .
9 : 10 And the trees said to the fig tree , Come thou , and reign over us .
9 : 28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said , Who is Abimelech , and who is Shechem , that we should serve him ?
9 : 46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that , they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith .
9 : 55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead , they departed every man unto his place .
10 : 8 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel : eighteen years , all the children of Israel that were on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites , which is in Gilead .
10 : 13 Yet ye have forsaken me , and served other gods : wherefore I will deliver you no more .
10 : 18 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another , What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon ?
11 : 1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour , and he was the son of an harlot : and Gilead begat Jephthah .
why therefore did ye not recover them within that time ?
11 : 29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah , and he passed over Gilead , and Manasseh , and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead , and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon .
11 : 30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD , and said , If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands , 11 : 31 Then it shall be , that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me , when I return in peace from the children of Ammon , shall surely be the LORD ' s , and I will offer it up for a burnt offering .
11 : 35 And it came to pass , when he saw her , that he rent his clothes , and said , Alas , my daughter !
11 : 36 And she said unto him , My father , if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD , do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth ; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies , even of the children of Ammon .
we will burn thine house upon thee with fire .
If he said , Nay ; 12 : 6 Then said they unto him , Say now Shibboleth : and he said Sibboleth : for he could not frame to pronounce it right .
Then they took him , and slew him at the passages of Jordan : and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand .
12 : 15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died , and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim , in the mount of the Amalekites .
13 : 4 Now therefore beware , I pray thee , and drink not wine nor strong drink , and eat not any unclean thing : 13 : 5 For , lo , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and no razor shall come on his head : for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb : and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines .
13 : 6 Then the woman came and told her husband , saying , A man of God came unto me , and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God , very terrible : but I asked him not whence he was , neither told he me his name : 13 : 7 But he said unto me , Behold , thou shalt conceive , and bear a son ; and now drink no wine nor strong drink , neither eat any unclean thing : for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death .
And he said , I am .
13 : 13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah , Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware .
For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD .
13 : 18 And the angel of the LORD said unto him , Why askest thou thus after my name , seeing it is secret ?
13 : 20 For it came to pass , when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar , that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar .
And Manoah and his wife looked on it , and fell on their faces to the ground .
14 : 3 Then his father and his mother said unto him , Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren , or among all my people , that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines ?
And what is stronger than a lion ?
14 : 20 But Samson ' s wife was given to his companion , whom he had used as his friend .
15 : 5 And when he had set the brands on fire , he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines , and burnt up both the shocks , and also the standing corn , with the vineyards and olives .
15 : 8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter : and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam .
what is this that thou hast done unto us ?
15 : 13 And they spake unto him , saying , No ; but we will bind thee fast , and deliver thee into their hand : but surely we will not kill thee .
And they bound him with two new cords , and brought him up from the rock .
15 : 19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw , and there came water thereout ; and when he had drunk , his spirit came again , and he revived : wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore , which is in Lehi unto this day .
16 : 6 And Delilah said to Samson , Tell me , I pray thee , wherein thy great strength lieth , and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee .
And he brake the withs , as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire .
16 : 20 And she said , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
16 : 22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven .
And they called for Samson out of the prison house ; and he made them sport : and they set him between the pillars .
16 : 30 And Samson said , Let me die with the Philistines .
17 : 7 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah , who was a Levite , and he sojourned there .
17 : 10 And Micah said unto him , Dwell with me , and be unto me a father and a priest , and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year , and a suit of apparel , and thy victuals .
18 : 8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol : and their brethren said unto them , What say ye ?
And they turned their faces , and said unto Micah , What aileth thee , that thou comest with such a company ?
18 : 24 And he said , Ye have taken away my gods which I made , and the priest , and ye are gone away : and what have I more ?
18 : 27 And they took the things which Micah had made , and the priest which he had , and came unto Laish , unto a people that were at quiet and secure : and they smote them with the edge of the sword , and burnt the city with fire .
19 : 5 And it came to pass on the fourth day , when they arose early in the morning , that he rose up to depart : and the damsel ' s father said unto his son in law , Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread , and afterward go your way .
And they tarried until afternoon , and they did eat both of them .
19 : 13 And he said unto his servant , Come , and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night , in Gibeah , or in Ramah .
19 : 18 And he said unto him , We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim ; from thence am I : and I went to Bethlehemjudah , but I am now going to the house of the LORD ; and there is no man that receiveth me to house .
19 : 25 But the men would not hearken to him : so the man took his concubine , and brought her forth unto them ; and they knew her , and abused her all the night until the morning : and when the day began to spring , they let her go .
But none answered .
20 : 21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah , and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men .
And the LORD said , Go up against him .
20 : 33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place , and put themselves in array at Baaltamar : and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places , even out of the meadows of Gibeah .
20 : 42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness ; but the battle overtook them ; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them .
21 : 5 And the children of Israel said , Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD ?
1 : 9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest , each of you in the house of her husband .
1 : 18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her , then she left speaking unto her .
1 : 20 And she said unto them , Call me not Naomi , call me Mara : for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me .
2 : 10 Then she fell on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , and said unto him , Why have I found grace in thine eyes , that thou shouldest take knowledge of me , seeing I am a stranger ?
2 : 12 The LORD recompense thy work , and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel , under whose wings thou art come to trust .
And she sat beside the reapers : and he reached her parched corn , and she did eat , and was sufficed , and left .
2 : 23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest ; and dwelt with her mother in law .
3 : 1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her , My daughter , shall I not seek rest for thee , that it may be well with thee ?
3 : 5 And she said unto her , All that thou sayest unto me I will do .
3 : 7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk , and his heart was merry , he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn : and she came softly , and uncovered his feet , and laid her down .
3 : 11 And now , my daughter , fear not ; I will do to thee all that thou requirest : for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman .
4 : 5 Then said Boaz , What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi , thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of the dead , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance .
4 : 9 And Boaz said unto the elders , and unto all the people , Ye are witnesses this day , that I have bought all that was Elimelech ' s , and all that was Chilion ' s and Mahlon ' s , of the hand of Naomi .
4 : 10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess , the wife of Mahlon , have I purchased to be my wife , to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance , that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren , and from the gate of his place : ye are witnesses this day .
The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah , which two did build the house of Israel : and do thou worthily in Ephratah , and be famous in Bethlehem : 4 : 12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez , whom Tamar bare unto Judah , of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman .
4 : 17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name , saying , There is a son born to Naomi ; and they called his name Obed : he is the father of Jesse , the father of David .
And the two sons of Eli , Hophni and Phinehas , the priests of the LORD , were there .
am not I better to thee than ten sons ?
1 : 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh , and after they had drunk .
1 : 15 And Hannah answered and said , No , my lord , I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit : I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink , but have poured out my soul before the LORD .
1 : 16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial : for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto .
1 : 18 And she said , Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight .
1 : 25 And they slew a bullock , and brought the child to Eli .
2 : 5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread ; and they that were hungry ceased : so that the barren hath born seven ; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble .
2 : 10 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces ; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them : the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth ; and he shall give strength unto his king , and exalt the horn of his anointed .
And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest .
2 : 15 Also before they burnt the fat , the priest ' s servant came , and said to the man that sacrificed , Give flesh to roast for the priest ; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee , but raw .
2 : 20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife , and said , The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD .
And the child Samuel grew before the LORD .
2 : 23 And he said unto them , Why do ye such things ?
for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people .
and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel ?
3 : 5 And he ran unto Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou calledst me .
And he went and lay down .
And he arose and went to Eli , and said , Here am I ; for thou didst call me .
3 : 9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel , Go , lie down : and it shall be , if he call thee , that thou shalt say , Speak , LORD ; for thy servant heareth .
3 : 13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth ; because his sons made themselves vile , and he restrained them not .
3 : 16 Then Eli called Samuel , and said , Samuel , my son .
And he answered , Here am I .
3 : 20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD .
3 : 21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh : for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD .
4 : 1 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel .
And they said , Woe unto us !
4 : 15 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old ; and his eyes were dim , that he could not see .
And he had judged Israel forty years .
5 : 1 And the Philistines took the ark of God , and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod .
5 : 2 When the Philistines took the ark of God , they brought it into the house of Dagon , and set it by Dagon .
5 : 3 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD .
And they took Dagon , and set him in his place again .
6 : 5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods , and images of your mice that mar the land ; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel : peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you , and from off your gods , and from off your land .
6 : 10 And the men did so ; and took two milch kine , and tied them to the cart , and shut up their calves at home : 6 : 11 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart , and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods .
6 : 13 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley : and they lifted up their eyes , and saw the ark , and rejoiced to see it .
6 : 19 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh , because they had looked into the ark of the LORD , even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men : and the people lamented , because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter .
7 : 3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel , saying , If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts , then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you , and prepare your hearts unto the LORD , and serve him only : and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines .
8 : 1 And it came to pass , when Samuel was old , that he made his sons judges over Israel .
8 : 18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the LORD will not hear you in that day .
8 : 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people , and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD .
9 : 3 And the asses of Kish Saul ' s father were lost .
9 : 7 Then said Saul to his servant , But , behold , if we go , what shall we bring the man ?
9 : 8 And the servant answered Saul again , and said , Behold , I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver : that will I give to the man of God , to tell us our way .
Is it not on thee , and on all thy father ' s house ?
9 : 23 And Samuel said unto the cook , Bring the portion which I gave thee , of which I said unto thee , Set it by thee .
9 : 24 And the cook took up the shoulder , and that which was upon it , and set it before Saul .
9 : 25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city , Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house .
And Saul arose , and they went out both of them , he and Samuel , abroad .
10 : 3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence , and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor , and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel , one carrying three kids , and another carrying three loaves of bread , and another carrying a bottle of wine : 10 : 4 And they will salute thee , and give thee two loaves of bread ; which thou shalt receive of their hands .
10 : 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying , he came to the high place .
10 : 16 And Saul said unto his uncle , He told us plainly that the asses were found .
10 : 20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near , the tribe of Benjamin was taken .
10 : 22 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further , if the man should yet come thither .
And all the people shouted , and said , God save the king .
And they despised him , and brought no presents .
12 : 8 When Jacob was come into Egypt , and your fathers cried unto the LORD , then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron , which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt , and made them dwell in this place .
12 : 10 And they cried unto the LORD , and said , We have sinned , because we have forsaken the LORD , and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth : but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies , and we will serve thee .
12 : 18 So Samuel called unto the LORD ; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day : and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel .
13 : 8 And he tarried seven days , according to the set time that Samuel had appointed : but Samuel came not to Gilgal ; and the people were scattered from him .
And Saul numbered the people that were present with him , about six hundred men .
13 : 21 Yet they had a file for the mattocks , and for the coulters , and for the forks , and for the axes , and to sharpen the goads .
14 : 1 Now it came to pass upon a day , that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over to the Philistines ' garrison , that is on the other side .
14 : 6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour , Come , and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised : it may be that the LORD will work for us : for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few .
14 : 8 Then said Jonathan , Behold , we will pass over unto these men , and we will discover ourselves unto them .
For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel .
14 : 30 How much more , if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found ?
14 : 37 And Saul asked counsel of God , Shall I go down after the Philistines ?
14 : 39 For , as the LORD liveth , which saveth Israel , though it be in Jonathan my son , he shall surely die .
14 : 41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel , Give a perfect lot .
14 : 51 And Kish was the father of Saul ; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel .
15 : 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
15 : 10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel , saying , 15 : 11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hath not performed my commandments .
15 : 16 Then Samuel said unto Saul , Stay , and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night .
15 : 19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the LORD ?
Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams .
15 : 28 And Samuel said unto him , The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbour of thine , that is better than thou .
And Agag came unto him delicately .
15 : 33 And Samuel said , As the sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women .
And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal .
And the LORD said , Take an heifer with thee , and say , I am come to sacrifice to the LORD .
16 : 6 And it came to pass , when they were come , that he looked on Eliab , and said , Surely the LORD ' s anointed is before him .
16 : 9 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by .
And he said , Neither hath the LORD chosen this .
Now he was ruddy , and withal of a beautiful countenance , and goodly to look to .
16 : 17 And Saul said unto his servants , Provide me now a man that can play well , and bring him to me .
16 : 19 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse , and said , Send me David thy son , which is with the sheep .
16 : 20 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread , and a bottle of wine , and a kid , and sent them by David his son unto Saul .
17 : 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together , and pitched by the valley of Elah , and set the battle in array against the Philistines .
17 : 6 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs , and a target of brass between his shoulders .
17 : 7 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver ' s beam ; and his spear ' s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron : and one bearing a shield went before him .
17 : 8 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel , and said unto them , Why are ye come out to set your battle in array ?
for who is this uncircumcised Philistine , that he should defy the armies of the living God ?
17 : 27 And the people answered him after this manner , saying , So shall it be done to the man that killeth him .
17 : 28 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men ; and Eliab ' s anger was kindled against David , and he said , Why camest thou down hither ?
and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness ?
17 : 37 David said moreover , The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion , and out of the paw of the bear , he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine .
17 : 38 And Saul armed David with his armour , and he put an helmet of brass upon his head ; also he armed him with a coat of mail .
And David put them off him .
17 : 40 And he took his staff in his hand , and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook , and put them in a shepherd ' s bag which he had , even in a scrip ; and his sling was in his hand : and he drew near to the Philistine .
17 : 42 And when the Philistine looked about , and saw David , he disdained him : for he was but a youth , and ruddy , and of a fair countenance .
17 : 51 Therefore David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of the sheath thereof , and slew him , and cut off his head therewith .
17 : 52 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose , and shouted , and pursued the Philistines , until thou come to the valley , and to the gates of Ekron .
17 : 54 And David took the head of the Philistine , and brought it to Jerusalem ; but he put his armour in his tent .
17 : 57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine , Abner took him , and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand .
18 : 3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant , because he loved him as his own soul .
18 : 7 And the women answered one another as they played , and said , Saul hath slain his thousands , and David his ten thousands .
18 : 13 Therefore Saul removed him from him , and made him his captain over a thousand ; and he went out and came in before the people .
18 : 15 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely , he was afraid of him .
But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines .
19 : 7 And Jonathan called David , and Jonathan shewed him all those things .
19 : 14 And when Saul sent messengers to take David , she said , He is sick .
And Michal answered Saul , He said unto me , Let me go ; why should I kill thee ?
20 : 6 If thy father at all miss me , then say , David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city : for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family .
or what if thy father answer thee roughly ?
20 : 22 But if I say thus unto the young man , Behold , the arrows are beyond thee ; go thy way : for the LORD hath sent thee away .
20 : 27 And it came to pass on the morrow , which was the second day of the month , that David ' s place was empty : and Saul said unto Jonathan his son , Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat , neither yesterday , nor to day ?
20 : 32 And Jonathan answered Saul his father , and said unto him , Wherefore shall he be slain ?
21 : 1 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest : and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David , and said unto him , Why art thou alone , and no man with thee ?
give me five loaves of bread in mine hand , or what there is present .
21 : 4 And the priest answered David , and said , There is no common bread under mine hand , but there is hallowed bread ; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women .
21 : 10 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul , and went to Achish the king of Gath .
21 : 13 And he changed his behaviour before them , and feigned himself mad in their hands , and scrabbled on the doors of the gate , and let his spittle fall down upon his beard .
21 : 15 Have I need of mad men , that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence ?
22 : 4 And he brought them before the king of Moab : and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold .
22 : 11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest , the son of Ahitub , and all his father ' s house , the priests that were in Nob : and they came all of them to the king .
22 : 13 And Saul said unto him , Why have ye conspired against me , thou and the son of Jesse , in that thou hast given him bread , and a sword , and hast enquired of God for him , that he should rise against me , to lie in wait , as at this day ?
22 : 19 And Nob , the city of the priests , smote he with the edge of the sword , both men and women , children and sucklings , and oxen , and asses , and sheep , with the edge of the sword .
22 : 22 And David said unto Abiathar , I knew it that day , when Doeg the Edomite was there , that he would surely tell Saul : I have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father ' s house .
23 : 4 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again .
23 : 18 And they two made a covenant before the LORD : and David abode in the wood , and Jonathan went to his house .
24 : 6 And he said unto his men , The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master , the LORD ' s anointed , to stretch forth mine hand against him , seeing he is the anointed of the LORD .
But Saul rose up out of the cave , and went on his way .
And when Saul looked behind him , David stooped with his face to the earth , and bowed himself .
And David arose , and went down to the wilderness of Paran .
And they girded on every man his sword ; and David also girded on his sword : and there went up after David about four hundred men ; and two hundred abode by the stuff .
But she told not her husband Nabal .
25 : 41 And she arose , and bowed herself on her face to the earth , and said , Behold , let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord .
26 : 8 Then said Abishai to David , God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day : now therefore let me smite him , I pray thee , with the spear even to the earth at once , and I will not smite him the second time .
26 : 10 David said furthermore , As the LORD liveth , the LORD shall smite him ; or his day shall come to die ; or he shall descend into battle , and perish .
26 : 11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD ' s anointed : but , I pray thee , take thou now the spear that is at his bolster , and the cruse of water , and let us go .
26 : 15 And David said to Abner , Art not thou a valiant man ?
As the LORD liveth , ye are worthy to die , because ye have not kept your master , the LORD ' s anointed .
26 : 20 Now therefore , let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD : for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea , as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains .
27 : 3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath , he and his men , every man with his household , even David with his two wives , Ahinoam the Jezreelitess , and Abigail the Carmelitess , Nabal ' s wife .
And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits , and the wizards , out of the land .
for thou art Saul .
28 : 15 And Samuel said to Saul , Why hast thou disquieted me , to bring me up ?
28 : 17 And the LORD hath done to him , as he spake by me : for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand , and given it to thy neighbour , even to David : 28 : 18 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD , nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek , therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day .
28 : 21 And the woman came unto Saul , and saw that he was sore troubled , and said unto him , Behold , thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice , and I have put my life in my hand , and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me .
But his servants , together with the woman , compelled him ; and he hearkened unto their voice .
Then they rose up , and went away that night .
And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines , Is not this David , the servant of Saul the king of Israel , which hath been with me these days , or these years , and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day ?
30 : 4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept , until they had no more power to weep .
And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David .
30 : 8 And David enquired at the LORD , saying , Shall I pursue after this troop ?
30 : 13 And David said unto him , To whom belongest thou ?
30 : 23 Then said David , Ye shall not do so , my brethren , with that which the LORD hath given us , who hath preserved us , and delivered the company that came against us into our hand .
And I answered him , I am an Amalekite .
1 : 9 He said unto me again , Stand , I pray thee , upon me , and slay me : for anguish is come upon me , because my life is yet whole in me .
And he smote him that he died .
1 : 17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son : 1 : 18 ( Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow : behold , it is written in the book of Jasher .
1 : 23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives , and in their death they were not divided : they were swifter than eagles , they were stronger than lions .
O Jonathan , thou wast slain in thine high places .
And they told David , saying , That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul .
2 : 5 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead , and said unto them , Blessed be ye of the LORD , that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord , even unto Saul , and have buried him .
2 : 11 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months .
2 : 18 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there , Joab , and Abishai , and Asahel : and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe .
But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him .
2 : 22 And Abner said again to Asahel , Turn thee aside from following me : wherefore should I smite thee to the ground ?
how long shall it be then , ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren ?
2 : 27 And Joab said , As God liveth , unless thou hadst spoken , surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother .
2 : 32 And they took up Asahel , and buried him in the sepulchre of his father , which was in Bethlehem .
And Joab and his men went all night , and they came to Hebron at break of day .
3 : 24 Then Joab came to the king , and said , What hast thou done ?
3 : 25 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner , that he came to deceive thee , and to know thy going out and thy coming in , and to know all that thou doest .
3 : 38 And the king said unto his servants , Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?
4 : 6 And they came thither into the midst of the house , as though they would have fetched wheat ; and they smote him under the fifth rib : and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped .
4 : 9 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother , the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , and said unto them , As the LORD liveth , who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity , 4 : 10 When one told me , saying , Behold , Saul is dead , thinking to have brought good tidings , I took hold of him , and slew him in Ziklag , who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings : 4 : 11 How much more , when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed ?
But they took the head of Ishbosheth , and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron .
5 : 8 And David said on that day , Whosoever getteth up to the gutter , and smiteth the Jebusites , and the lame and the blind that are hated of David ' s soul , he shall be chief and captain .
Wherefore they said , The blind and the lame shall not come into the house .
5 : 13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem , after he was come from Hebron : and there were yet sons and daughters born to David .
5 : 19 And David enquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go up to the Philistines ?
5 : 20 And David came to Baalperazim , and David smote them there , and said , The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me , as the breach of waters .
5 : 21 And there they left their images , and David and his men burned them .
5 : 25 And David did so , as the LORD had commanded him ; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer .
6 : 3 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart , and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah : and Uzzah and Ahio , the sons of Abinadab , drave the new cart .
6 : 5 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood , even on harps , and on psalteries , and on timbrels , and on cornets , and on cymbals .
6 : 8 And David was displeased , because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah : and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day .
6 : 9 And David was afraid of the LORD that day , and said , How shall the ark of the LORD come to me ?
6 : 13 And it was so , that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces , he sacrificed oxen and fatlings .
for thou , Lord GOD , knowest thy servant .
8 : 2 And he smote Moab , and measured them with a line , casting them down to the ground ; even with two lines measured he to put to death , and with one full line to keep alive .
8 : 3 David smote also Hadadezer , the son of Rehob , king of Zobah , as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates .
8 : 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus : and the Syrians became servants to David , and brought gifts .
8 : 8 And from Betah , and from Berothai , cities of Hadadezer , king David took exceeding much brass .
And Ziba said unto the king , Behold , he is in the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , in Lodebar .
9 : 7 And David said unto him , Fear not : for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father ' s sake , and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father ; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually .
9 : 13 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem : for he did eat continually at the king ' s table ; and was lame on both his feet .
10 : 1 And it came to pass after this , that the king of the children of Ammon died , and Hanun his son reigned in his stead .
10 : 5 When they told it unto David , he sent to meet them , because the men were greatly ashamed : and the king said , Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown , and then return .
10 : 11 And he said , If the Syrians be too strong for me , then thou shalt help me : but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee , then I will come and help thee .
10 : 18 And the Syrians fled before Israel ; and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians , and forty thousand horsemen , and smote Shobach the captain of their host , who died there .
10 : 19 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel , they made peace with Israel , and served them .
So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more .
11 : 1 And it came to pass , after the year was expired , at the time when kings go forth to battle , that David sent Joab , and his servants with him , and all Israel ; and they destroyed the children of Ammon , and besieged Rabbah .
11 : 7 And when Uriah was come unto him , David demanded of him how Joab did , and how the people did , and how the war prospered .
11 : 8 And David said to Uriah , Go down to thy house , and wash thy feet .
11 : 9 But Uriah slept at the door of the king ' s house with all the servants of his lord , and went not down to his house .
did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall , that he died in Thebez ?
11 : 27 And when the mourning was past , David sent and fetched her to his house , and she became his wife , and bare him a son .
But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD .
12 : 2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds : 12 : 3 But the poor man had nothing , save one little ewe lamb , which he had bought and nourished up : and it grew up together with him , and with his children ; it did eat of his own meat , and drank of his own cup , and lay in his bosom , and was unto him as a daughter .
12 : 5 And David ' s anger was greatly kindled against the man ; and he said to Nathan , As the LORD liveth , the man that hath done this thing shall surely die : 12 : 6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold , because he did this thing , and because he had no pity .
12 : 7 And Nathan said to David , Thou art the man .
Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I anointed thee king over Israel , and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul ; 12 : 8 And I gave thee thy master ' s house , and thy master ' s wives into thy bosom , and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah ; and if that had been too little , I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things .
12 : 9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD , to do evil in his sight ?
12 : 10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house ; because thou hast despised me , and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife .
12 : 21 Then said his servants unto him , What thing is this that thou hast done ?
13 : 10 And Amnon said unto Tamar , Bring the meat into the chamber , that I may eat of thine hand .
13 : 16 And she said unto him , There is no cause : this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me .
So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom ' s house .
13 : 25 And the king said to Absalom , Nay , my son , let us not all now go , lest we be chargeable unto thee .
And the king said unto him , Why should he go with thee ?
13 : 32 And Jonadab , the son of Shimeah David ' s brother , answered and said , Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king ' s sons ; for Amnon only is dead : for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar .
13 : 34 But Absalom fled .
14 : 6 And thy handmaid had two sons , and they two strove together in the field , and there was none to part them , but the one smote the other , and slew him .
14 : 7 And , behold , the whole family is risen against thine handmaid , and they said , Deliver him that smote his brother , that we may kill him , for the life of his brother whom he slew ; and we will destroy the heir also : and so they shall quench my coal which is left , and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth .
14 : 33 So Joab came to the king , and told him : and when he had called for Absalom , he came to the king , and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king : and the king kissed Absalom .
15 : 1 And it came to pass after this , that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses , and fifty men to run before him .
15 : 3 And Absalom said unto him , See , thy matters are good and right ; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee .
15 : 16 And the king went forth , and all his household after him .
16 : 2 And the king said unto Ziba , What meanest thou by these ?
And Ziba said , The asses be for the king ' s household to ride on ; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat ; and the wine , that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink .
16 : 5 And when king David came to Bahurim , behold , thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul , whose name was Shimei , the son of Gera : he came forth , and cursed still as he came .
16 : 10 And the king said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah ?
16 : 12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction , and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day .
16 : 19 And again , whom should I serve ?
as I have served in thy father ' s presence , so will I be in thy presence .
17 : 11 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee , from Dan even to Beersheba , as the sand that is by the sea for multitude ; and that thou go to battle in thine own person .
17 : 15 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests , Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel ; and thus and thus have I counselled .
17 : 23 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed , he saddled his ass , and arose , and gat him home to his house , to his city , and put his household in order , and hanged himself , and died , and was buried in the sepulchre of his father .
17 : 26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead .
17 : 27 And it came to pass , when David was come to Mahanaim , that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon , and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar , and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim , 17 : 28 Brought beds , and basons , and earthen vessels , and wheat , and barley , and flour , and parched corn , and beans , and lentiles , and parched pulse , 17 : 29 And honey , and butter , and sheep , and cheese of kine , for David , and for the people that were with him , to eat : for they said , The people is hungry , and weary , and thirsty , in the wilderness .
And the king said unto the people , I will surely go forth with you myself also .
18 : 4 And the king said unto them , What seemeth you best I will do .
18 : 16 And Joab blew the trumpet , and the people returned from pursuing after Israel : for Joab held back the people .
18 : 24 And David sat between the two gates : and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall , and lifted up his eyes , and looked , and behold a man running alone .
18 : 30 And the king said unto him , Turn aside , and stand here .
19 : 7 Now therefore arise , go forth , and speak comfortably unto thy servants : for I swear by the LORD , if thou go not forth , there will not tarry one with thee this night : and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now .
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ?
19 : 17 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him , and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul , and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him ; and they went over Jordan before the king .
19 : 22 And David said , What have I to do with you , ye sons of Zeruiah , that ye should this day be adversaries unto me ?
And the king sware unto him .
19 : 37 Let thy servant , I pray thee , turn back again , that I may die in mine own city , and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother .
But behold thy servant Chimham ; let him go over with my lord the king ; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee .
19 : 39 And all the people went over Jordan .
have we eaten at all of the king ' s cost ?
19 : 43 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah , and said , We have ten parts in the king , and we have also more right in David than ye : why then did ye despise us , that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king ?
And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel .
So they were shut up unto the day of their death , living in widowhood .
20 : 5 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah : but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him .
20 : 16 Then cried a wise woman out of the city , Hear , hear ; say , I pray you , unto Joab , Come near hither , that I may speak with thee .
20 : 21 The matter is not so : but a man of mount Ephraim , Sheba the son of Bichri by name , hath lifted up his hand against the king , even against David : deliver him only , and I will depart from the city .
And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri , and cast it out to Joab .
21 : 11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah , the concubine of Saul , had done .
21 : 16 And Ishbibenob , which was of the sons of the giant , the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight , he being girded with a new sword , thought to have slain David .
22 : 1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies , and out of the hand of Saul : 22 : 2 And he said , The LORD is my rock , and my fortress , and my deliverer ; 22 : 3 The God of my rock ; in him will I trust : he is my shield , and the horn of my salvation , my high tower , and my refuge , my saviour ; thou savest me from violence .
22 : 4 I will call on the LORD , who is worthy to be praised : so shall I be saved from mine enemies .
22 : 11 And he rode upon a cherub , and did fly : and he was seen upon the wings of the wind .
22 : 12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him , dark waters , and thick clouds of the skies .
22 : 16 And the channels of the sea appeared , the foundations of the world were discovered , at the rebuking of the LORD , at the blast of the breath of his nostrils .
22 : 21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness : according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me .
22 : 23 For all his judgments were before me : and as for his statutes , I did not depart from them .
22 : 28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save : but thine eyes are upon the haughty , that thou mayest bring them down .
22 : 29 For thou art my lamp , O LORD : and the LORD will lighten my darkness .
22 : 30 For by thee I have run through a troop : by my God have I leaped over a wall .
22 : 34 He maketh my feet like hinds ' feet : and setteth me upon my high places .
22 : 51 He is the tower of salvation for his king : and sheweth mercy to his anointed , unto David , and to his seed for evermore .
David the son of Jesse said , and the man who was raised up on high , the anointed of the God of Jacob , and the sweet psalmist of Israel , said , 23 : 2 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me , and his word was in my tongue .
23 : 5 Although my house be not so with God ; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant , ordered in all things , and sure : for this is all my salvation , and all my desire , although he make it not to grow .
And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop , where was a piece of ground full of lentiles : and the people fled from the Philistines .
therefore he would not drink it .
therefore he was their captain : howbeit he attained not unto the first three .
23 : 23 He was more honourable than the thirty , but he attained not to the first three .
24 : 3 And Joab said unto the king , Now the LORD thy God add unto the people , how many soever they be , an hundredfold , and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it : but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing ?
And David said unto the LORD , I have sinned greatly in that I have done : and now , I beseech thee , O LORD , take away the iniquity of thy servant ; for I have done very foolishly .
24 : 13 So Gad came to David , and told him , and said unto him , Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land ?
now advise , and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me .
24 : 17 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people , and said , Lo , I have sinned , and I have done wickedly : but these sheep , what have they done ?
24 : 21 And Araunah said , Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant ?
And David said , To buy the threshingfloor of thee , to build an altar unto the LORD , that the plague may be stayed from the people .
24 : 22 And Araunah said unto David , Let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him : behold , here be oxen for burnt sacrifice , and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood .
The Third Book of the Kings
1 : 18 And now , behold , Adonijah reigneth ; and now , my lord the king , thou knowest it not : 1 : 19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance , and hath called all the sons of the king , and Abiathar the priest , and Joab the captain of the host : but Solomon thy servant hath he not called .
1 : 22 And , lo , while she yet talked with the king , Nathan the prophet also came in .
1 : 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king , and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant , who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him ?
1 : 28 Then king David answered and said , Call me Bathsheba .
And they came before the king .
1 : 35 Then ye shall come up after him , that he may come and sit upon my throne ; for he shall be king in my stead : and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah .
This is the noise that ye have heard .
1 : 53 So king Solomon sent , and they brought him down from the altar .
2 : 5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me , and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel , unto Abner the son of Ner , and unto Amasa the son of Jether , whom he slew , and shed the blood of war in peace , and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins , and in his shoes that were on his feet .
2 : 6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom , and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace .
2 : 8 And , behold , thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera , a Benjamite of Bahurim , which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim : but he came down to meet me at Jordan , and I sware to him by the LORD , saying , I will not put thee to death with the sword .
2 : 17 And he said , Speak , I pray thee , unto Solomon the king , ( for he will not say thee nay ,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife .
2 : 20 Then she said , I desire one small petition of thee ; I pray thee , say me not nay .
And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD , and caught hold on the horns of the altar .
Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , saying , Go , fall upon him .
And Benaiah brought the king word again , saying , Thus said Joab , and thus he answered me .
2 : 31 And the king said unto him , Do as he hath said , and fall upon him , and bury him ; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood , which Joab shed , from me , and from the house of my father .
2 : 37 For it shall be , that on the day thou goest out , and passest over the brook Kidron , thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die : thy blood shall be upon thine own head .
2 : 44 The king said moreover to Shimei , Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to , that thou didst to David my father : therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head ; 2 : 45 And king Solomon shall be blessed , and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever .
3 : 6 And Solomon said , Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy , according as he walked before thee in truth , and in righteousness , and in uprightness of heart with thee ; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness , that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne , as it is this day .
3 : 14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways , to keep my statutes and my commandments , as thy father David did walk , then I will lengthen thy days .
4 : 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines , and unto the border of Egypt : they brought presents , and served Solomon all the days of his life .
4 : 22 And Solomon ' s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour , and threescore measures of meal , 4 : 23 Ten fat oxen , and twenty oxen out of the pastures , and an hundred sheep , beside harts , and roebucks , and fallowdeer , and fatted fowl .
4 : 26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen .
5 : 5 And , behold , I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God , as the LORD spake unto David my father , saying , Thy son , whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room , he shall build an house unto my name .
5 : 6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon ; and my servants shall be with thy servants : and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint : for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians .
5 : 9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea : and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me , and will cause them to be discharged there , and thou shalt receive them : and thou shalt accomplish my desire , in giving food for my household .
6 : 4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights .
6 : 7 And the house , when it was in building , was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither : so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house , while it was in building .
6 : 10 And then he built chambers against all the house , five cubits high : and they rested on the house with timber of cedar .
6 : 18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers : all was cedar ; there was no stone seen .
6 : 23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree , each ten cubits high .
6 : 29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , within and without .
6 : 35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers : and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work .
7 : 5 And all the doors and posts were square , with the windows : and light was against light in three ranks .
7 : 8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch , which was of the like work .
7 : 10 And the foundation was of costly stones , even great stones , stones of ten cubits , and stones of eight cubits .
7 : 28 And the work of the bases was on this manner : they had borders , and the borders were between the ledges : 7 : 29 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions , oxen , and cherubims : and upon the ledges there was a base above : and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work .
8 : 4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD , and the tabernacle of the congregation , and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle , even those did the priests and the Levites bring up .
8 : 9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone , which Moses put there at Horeb , when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel , when they came out of the land of Egypt .
8 : 25 Therefore now , LORD God of Israel , keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him , saying , There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel ; so that thy children take heed to their way , that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me .
behold , the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house that I have builded ?
8 : 35 When heaven is shut up , and there is no rain , because they have sinned against thee ; if they pray toward this place , and confess thy name , and turn from their sin , when thou afflictest them : 8 : 36 Then hear thou in heaven , and forgive the sin of thy servants , and of thy people Israel , that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk , and give rain upon thy land , which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance .
9 : 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him ; and they pleased him not .
10 : 4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon ' s wisdom , and the house that he had built , 10 : 5 And the meat of his table , and the sitting of his servants , and the attendance of his ministers , and their apparel , and his cupbearers , and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD ; there was no more spirit in her .
10 : 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon , to hear his wisdom , which God had put in his heart .
10 : 25 And they brought every man his present , vessels of silver , and vessels of gold , and garments , and armour , and spices , horses , and mules , a rate year by year .
10 : 28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt , and linen yarn : the king ' s merchants received the linen yarn at a price .
10 : 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , did they bring them out by their means .
11 : 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD , and went not fully after the LORD , as did David his father .
11 : 9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon , because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel , which had appeared unto him twice , 11 : 10 And had commanded him concerning this thing , that he should not go after other gods : but he kept not that which the LORD commanded .
11 : 37 And I will take thee , and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth , and shalt be king over Israel .
12 : 17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah , Rehoboam reigned over them .
12 : 20 And it came to pass , when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again , that they sent and called him unto the congregation , and made him king over all Israel : there was none that followed the house of David , but the tribe of Judah only .
12 : 21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem , he assembled all the house of Judah , with the tribe of Benjamin , an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men , which were warriors , to fight against the house of Israel , to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon .
So did he in Bethel , sacrificing unto the calves that he had made : and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made .
12 : 33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month , even in the month which he had devised of his own heart ; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel : and he offered upon the altar , and burnt incense .
13 : 3 And he gave a sign the same day , saying , This is the sign which the LORD hath spoken ; Behold , the altar shall be rent , and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out .
And his hand , which he put forth against him , dried up , so that he could not pull it in again to him .
13 : 8 And the man of God said unto the king , If thou wilt give me half thine house , I will not go in with thee , neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place : 13 : 9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD , saying , Eat no bread , nor drink water , nor turn again by the same way that thou camest .
For his sons had seen what way the man of God went , which came from Judah .
And he said , I am .
But he lied unto him .
13 : 23 And it came to pass , after he had eaten bread , and after he had drunk , that he saddled for him the ass , to wit , for the prophet whom he had brought back .
13 : 24 And when he was gone , a lion met him by the way , and slew him : and his carcase was cast in the way , and the ass stood by it , the lion also stood by the carcase .
And they saddled him .
13 : 34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam , even to cut it off , and to destroy it from off the face of the earth .
for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings .
even now .
Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign , and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem , the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel , to put his name there .
14 : 22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD , and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed , above all that their fathers had done .
14 : 23 For they also built them high places , and images , and groves , on every high hill , and under every green tree .
14 : 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields , and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard , which kept the door of the king ' s house .
14 : 28 And it was so , when the king went into the house of the LORD , that the guard bare them , and brought them back into the guard chamber .
and his mother ' s name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
15 : 10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem .
And his mother ' s name was Maachah , the daughter of Abishalom .
15 : 13 And also Maachah his mother , even her he removed from being queen , because she had made an idol in a grove ; and Asa destroyed her idol , and burnt it by the brook Kidron .
15 : 17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah , and built Ramah , that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
15 : 24 And Asa slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father : and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead .
15 : 26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin .
15 : 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him , and reigned in his stead .
16 : 5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha , and what he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
16 : 7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha , and against his house , even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD , in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands , in being like the house of Jeroboam ; and because he killed him .
16 : 12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha , according to the word of the LORD , which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet .
16 : 19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD , in walking in the way of Jeroboam , and in his sin which he did , to make Israel to sin .
17 : 1 And Elijah the Tishbite , who was of the inhabitants of Gilead , said unto Ahab , As the LORD God of Israel liveth , before whom I stand , there shall not be dew nor rain these years , but according to my word .
17 : 12 And she said , As the LORD thy God liveth , I have not a cake , but an handful of meal in a barrel , and a little oil in a cruse : and , behold , I am gathering two sticks , that I may go in and dress it for me and my son , that we may eat it , and die .
17 : 14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel , The barrel of meal shall not waste , neither shall the cruse of oil fail , until the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth .
17 : 17 And it came to pass after these things , that the son of the woman , the mistress of the house , fell sick ; and his sickness was so sore , that there was no breath left in him .
17 : 19 And he said unto her , Give me thy son .
17 : 20 And he cried unto the LORD , and said , O LORD my God , hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn , by slaying her son ?
17 : 21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times , and cried unto the LORD , and said , O LORD my God , I pray thee , let this child ' s soul come into him again .
17 : 22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah ; and the soul of the child came into him again , and he revived .
And there was a sore famine in Samaria .
18 : 17 And it came to pass , when Ahab saw Elijah , that Ahab said unto him , Art thou he that troubleth Israel ?
18 : 18 And he answered , I have not troubled Israel ; but thou , and thy father ' s house , in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD , and thou hast followed Baalim .
And the people answered him not a word .
And all the people answered and said , It is well spoken .
And they leaped upon the altar which was made .
18 : 27 And it came to pass at noon , that Elijah mocked them , and said , Cry aloud : for he is a god ; either he is talking , or he is pursuing , or he is in a journey , or peradventure he sleepeth , and must be awaked .
18 : 30 And Elijah said unto all the people , Come near unto me .
And all the people came near unto him .
18 : 35 And the water ran round about the altar ; and he filled the trench also with water .
18 : 39 And when all the people saw it , they fell on their faces : and they said , The LORD , he is the God ; the LORD , he is the God .
And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel ; and he cast himself down upon the earth , and put his face between his knees , 18 : 43 And said to his servant , Go up now , look toward the sea .
And he went up , and looked , and said , There is nothing .
18 : 44 And it came to pass at the seventh time , that he said , Behold , there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea , like a man ' s hand .
19 : 7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time , and touched him , and said , Arise and eat ; because the journey is too great for thee .
19 : 20 And he left the oxen , and ran after Elijah , and said , Let me , I pray thee , kiss my father and my mother , and then I will follow thee .
20 : 2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city , and said unto him , Thus saith Benhadad , 20 : 3 Thy silver and thy gold is mine ; thy wives also and thy children , even the goodliest , are mine .
20 : 13 And , behold , there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel , saying , Thus saith the LORD , Hast thou seen all this great multitude ?
20 : 14 And Ahab said , By whom ?
And he said , Thus saith the LORD , Even by the young men of the princes of the provinces .
Then he said , Who shall order the battle ?
And he answered , Thou .
20 : 16 And they went out at noon .
20 : 27 And the children of Israel were numbered , and were all present , and went against them : and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids ; but the Syrians filled the country .
And he said , Is he yet alive ?
21 : 6 And he said unto her , Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite , and said unto him , Give me thy vineyard for money ; or else , if it please thee , I will give thee another vineyard for it : and he answered , I will not give thee my vineyard .
21 : 7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him , Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel ?
21 : 14 Then they sent to Jezebel , saying , Naboth is stoned , and is dead .
21 : 21 Behold , I will bring evil upon thee , and will take away thy posterity , and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel , 21 : 22 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah , for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger , and made Israel to sin .
21 : 24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat ; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat .
22 : 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne , having put on their robes , in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria ; and all the prophets prophesied before them .
And he answered him , Go , and prosper : for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king .
And he said , Thou shalt persude him , and prevail also : go forth , and do so .
22 : 32 And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , Surely it is the king of Israel .
22 : 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun , saying , Every man to his city , and every man to his own country .
22 : 40 So Ahab slept with his fathers ; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead .
22 : 41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel .
And his mother ' s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
And he went up to him : and , behold , he sat on the top of an hill .
And there came down fire from heaven , and consumed him and his fifty .
And he answered and said unto him , O man of God , thus hath the king said , Come down quickly .
1 : 18 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
And he said , Yea , I know it ; hold ye your peace .
And he saw him no more : and he took hold of his own clothes , and rent them in two pieces .
and when he also had smitten the waters , they parted hither and thither : and Elisha went over .
2 : 16 And they said unto him , Behold now , there be with thy servants fifty strong men ; let them go , we pray thee , and seek thy master : lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up , and cast him upon some mountain , or into some valley .
2 : 17 And when they urged him till he was ashamed , he said , Send .
2 : 22 So the waters were healed unto this day , according to the saying of Elisha which he spake .
3 : 5 But it came to pass , when Ahab was dead , that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel .
3 : 11 But Jehoshaphat said , Is there not here a prophet of the LORD , that we may enquire of the LORD by him ?
So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him .
3 : 15 But now bring me a minstrel .
4 : 2 And Elisha said unto her , What shall I do for thee ?
tell me , what hast thou in the house ?
4 : 3 Then he said , Go , borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours , even empty vessels ; borrow not a few .
And he said , Go , sell the oil , and pay thy debt , and live thou and thy children of the rest .
And so it was , that as oft as he passed by , he turned in thither to eat bread .
4 : 9 And she said unto her husband , Behold now , I perceive that this is an holy man of God , which passeth by us continually .
4 : 15 And he said , Call her .
4 : 25 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel .
is it well with the child ?
And she answered , It is well : 4 : 27 And when she came to the man of God to the hill , she caught him by the feet : but Gehazi came near to thrust her away .
4 : 33 He went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed unto the LORD .
4 : 39 And one went out into the field to gather herbs , and found a wild vine , and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full , and came and shred them into the pot of pottage : for they knew them not .
And there was no harm in the pot .
4 : 43 And his servitor said , What , should I set this before an hundred men ?
5 : 9 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot , and stood at the door of the house of Elisha .
5 : 11 But Naaman was wroth , and went away , and said , Behold , I thought , He will surely come out to me , and stand , and call on the name of the LORD his God , and strike his hand over the place , and recover the leper .
So he turned and went away in a rage .
So he departed from him a little way .
5 : 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman .
6 : 2 Let us go , we pray thee , unto Jordan , and take thence every man a beam , and let us make us a place there , where we may dwell .
6 : 3 And one said , Be content , I pray thee , and go with thy servants .
6 : 6 And the man of God said , Where fell it ?
And he put out his hand , and took it .
6 : 8 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel , and took counsel with his servants , saying , In such and such a place shall be my camp .
6 : 18 And when they came down to him , Elisha prayed unto the LORD , and said , Smite this people , I pray thee , with blindness .
6 : 25 And there was a great famine in Samaria : and , behold , they besieged it , until an ass ' s head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver , and the fourth part of a cab of dove ' s dung for five pieces of silver .
out of the barnfloor , or out of the winepress ?
7 : 1 Then Elisha said , Hear ye the word of the LORD ; Thus saith the LORD , To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , in the gate of Samaria .
7 : 15 And they went after them unto Jordan : and , lo , all the way was full of garments and vessels , which the Syrians had cast away in their haste .
And the messengers returned , and told the king .
So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel , and two measures of barley for a shekel , according to the word of the LORD .
And he said , Behold , thou shalt see it with thine eyes , but shalt not eat thereof .
So the king appointed unto her a certain officer , saying , Restore all that was hers , and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land , even until now .
8 : 10 And Elisha said unto him , Go , say unto him , Thou mayest certainly recover : howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die .
8 : 22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day .
8 : 28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead ; and the Syrians wounded Joram .
8 : 29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah , when he fought against Hazael king of Syria .
9 : 4 So the young man , even the young man the prophet , went to Ramothgilead .
And Jehu said , Unto which of all us ?
9 : 8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish : and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall , and him that is shut up and left in Israel : 9 : 9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah : 9 : 10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel , and there shall be none to bury her .
9 : 11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord : and one said unto him , Is all well ?
And he said , Thus and thus spake he to me , saying , Thus saith the LORD , I have anointed thee king over Israel .
) And Jehu said , If it be your minds , then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel .
And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram .
9 : 18 So there went one on horseback to meet him , and said , Thus saith the king , Is it peace ?
9 : 19 Then he sent out a second on horseback , which came to them , and said , Thus saith the king , Is it peace ?
9 : 24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength , and smote Jehoram between his arms , and the arrow went out at his heart , and he sunk down in his chariot .
And they did so at the going up to Gur , which is by Ibleam .
And he fled to Megiddo , and died there .
9 : 31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate , she said , Had Zimri peace , who slew his master ?
9 : 33 And he said , Throw her down .
So they threw her down : and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall , and on the horses : and he trode her under foot .
9 : 35 And they went to bury her : but they found no more of her than the skull , and the feet , and the palms of her hands .
10 : 5 And he that was over the house , and he that was over the city , the elders also , and the bringers up of the children , sent to Jehu , saying , We are thy servants , and will do all that thou shalt bid us ; we will not make any king : do thou that which is good in thine eyes .
10 : 6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them , saying , If ye be mine , and if ye will hearken unto my voice , take ye the heads of the men your master ' s sons , and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time .
10 : 8 And there came a messenger , and told him , saying , They have brought the heads of the king ' s sons .
And he said , Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning .
If it be , give me thine hand .
And they came into the house of Baal ; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another .
10 : 24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings , Jehu appointed fourscore men without , and said , If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape , he that letteth him go , his life shall be for the life of him .
And they smote them with the edge of the sword ; and the guard and the captains cast them out , and went to the city of the house of Baal .
And Athaliah did reign over the land .
11 : 11 And the guard stood , every man with his weapons in his hand , round about the king , from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple , along by the altar and the temple .
For the priest had said , Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD .
12 : 4 And Jehoash said to the priests , All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD , even the money of every one that passeth the account , the money that every man is set at , and all the money that cometh into any man ' s heart to bring into the house of the LORD , 12 : 5 Let the priests take it to them , every man of his acquaintance : and let them repair the breaches of the house , wheresoever any breach shall be found .
12 : 16 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD : it was the priests '.
13 : 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz , and all that he did , and his might , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
13 : 9 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers ; and they buried him in Samaria : and Joash his son reigned in his stead .
And he took unto him bow and arrows .
13 : 17 And he said , Open the window eastward .
And he shot .
And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year .
13 : 24 So Hazael king of Syria died ; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead .
14 : 2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem .
14 : 23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria , and reigned forty and one years .
14 : 29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers , even with the kings of Israel ; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead .
15 : 1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign .
And his mother ' s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem .
15 : 6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah , and all that he did , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah ?
15 : 9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his fathers had done : he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin .
15 : 16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah , and all that were therein , and the coasts thereof from Tirzah : because they opened not to him , therefore he smote it ; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up .
15 : 22 And Menahem slept with his fathers ; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead .
He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD .
16 : 5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war : and they besieged Ahaz , but could not overcome him .
16 : 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria , saying , I am thy servant and thy son : come up , and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria , and out of the hand of the king of Israel , which rise up against me .
16 : 13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering , and poured his drink offering , and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings , upon the altar .
16 : 20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers , and was buried with his fathers in the city of David : and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead .
17 : 16 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God , and made them molten images , even two calves , and made a grove , and worshipped all the host of heaven , and served Baal .
17 : 21 For he rent Israel from the house of David ; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king : and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD , and made them sin a great sin .
17 : 25 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there , that they feared not the LORD : therefore the LORD sent lions among them , which slew some of them .
17 : 30 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth , and the men of Cuth made Nergal , and the men of Hamath made Ashima , 17 : 31 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak , and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech , the gods of Sepharvaim .
18 : 10 And at the end of three years they took it : even in the sixth year of Hezekiah , that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel , Samaria was taken .
18 : 18 And when they had called to the king , there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah , which was over the household , and Shebna the scribe , and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder .
18 : 35 Who are they among all the gods of the countries , that have delivered their country out of mine hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand ?
19 : 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God ; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left .
19 : 9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia , Behold , he is come out to fight against thee : he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah , saying , 19 : 10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah , saying , Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee , saying , Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria .
19 : 11 Behold , thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands , by destroying them utterly : and shalt thou be delivered ?
19 : 13 Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arpad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , of Hena , and Ivah ?
19 : 20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , That which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard .
19 : 26 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power , they were dismayed and confounded ; they were as the grass of the field , and as the green herb , as the grass on the house tops , and as corn blasted before it be grown up .
19 : 29 And this shall be a sign unto thee , Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves , and in the second year that which springeth of the same ; and in the third year sow ye , and reap , and plant vineyards , and eat the fruits thereof .
19 : 30 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward , and bear fruit upward .
19 : 37 And it came to pass , as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god , that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword : and they escaped into the land of Armenia .
And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Set thine house in order ; for thou shalt die , and not live .
And Hezekiah wept sore .
20 : 13 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them , and shewed them all the house of his precious things , the silver , and the gold , and the spices , and the precious ointment , and all the house of his armour , and all that was found in his treasures : there was nothing in his house , nor in all his dominion , that Hezekiah shewed them not .
And Hezekiah said , They are come from a far country , even from Babylon .
21 : 10 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets , saying , 21 : 11 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations , and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did , which were before him , and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols : 21 : 12 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Behold , I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah , that whosoever heareth of it , both his ears shall tingle .
21 : 20 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as his father Manasseh did .
22 : 3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , the son of Meshullam , the scribe , to the house of the LORD , saying , 22 : 4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest , that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD , which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people : 22 : 5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work , that have the oversight of the house of the LORD : and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD , to repair the breaches of the house , 22 : 6 Unto carpenters , and builders , and masons , and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house .
22 : 14 So Hilkiah the priest , and Ahikam , and Achbor , and Shaphan , and Asahiah , went unto Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah , the son of Harhas , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college ;) and they communed with her .
22 : 18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD , thus shall ye say to him , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , As touching the words which thou hast heard ; 22 : 19 Because thine heart was tender , and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD , when thou heardest what I spake against this place , and against the inhabitants thereof , that they should become a desolation and a curse , and hast rent thy clothes , and wept before me ; I also have heard thee , saith the LORD .
23 : 1 And the king sent , and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem .
23 : 9 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem , but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren .
23 : 15 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel , and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin , had made , both that altar and the high place he brake down , and burned the high place , and stamped it small to powder , and burned the grove .
23 : 22 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel , nor in all the days of the kings of Israel , nor of the kings of Judah ; 23 : 23 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah , wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem .
23 : 29 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates : and king Josiah went against him ; and he slew him at Megiddo , when he had seen him .
24 : 1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up , and Jehoiakim became his servant three years : then he turned and rebelled against him .
24 : 3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah , to remove them out of his sight , for the sins of Manasseh , according to all that he did ; 24 : 4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed : for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood ; which the LORD would not pardon .
And his mother ' s name was Hamutal , the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
25 : 1 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign , in the tenth month , in the tenth day of the month , that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came , he , and all his host , against Jerusalem , and pitched against it ; and they built forts against it round about .
25 : 5 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king , and overtook him in the plains of Jericho : and all his army were scattered from him .
25 : 12 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen .
25 : 23 And when all the captains of the armies , they and their men , heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor , there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and Johanan the son of Careah , and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite , and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite , they and their men .
1 : 1 Adam , Sheth , Enosh , 1 : 2 Kenan , Mahalaleel , Jered , 1 : 3 Henoch , Methuselah , Lamech , 1 : 4 Noah , Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
These are the sons of Ishmael .
1 : 34 And Abraham begat Isaac .
1 : 35 The sons of Esau ; Eliphaz , Reuel , and Jeush , and Jaalam , and Korah .
1 : 36 The sons of Eliphaz ; Teman , and Omar , Zephi , and Gatam , Kenaz , and Timna , and Amalek .
1 : 37 The sons of Reuel ; Nahath , Zerah , Shammah , and Mizzah .
1 : 38 And the sons of Seir ; Lotan , and Shobal , and Zibeon , and Anah , and Dishon , and Ezar , and Dishan .
1 : 46 And when Husham was dead , Hadad the son of Bedad , which smote Midian in the field of Moab , reigned in his stead : and the name of his city was Avith .
1 : 49 And when Shaul was dead , Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead .
All the sons of Judah were five .
And the sons of Zeruiah ; Abishai , and Joab , and Asahel , three .
2 : 21 And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the father of Gilead , whom he married when he was threescore years old ; and she bare him Segub .
2 : 26 Jerahmeel had also another wife , whose name was Atarah ; she was the mother of Onam .
2 : 35 And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife ; and she bare him Attai .
2 : 42 Now the sons of Caleb the brother of Jerahmeel were , Mesha his firstborn , which was the father of Ziph ; and the sons of Mareshah the father of Hebron .
2 : 43 And the sons of Hebron ; Korah , and Tappuah , and Rekem , and Shema .
2 : 44 And Shema begat Raham , the father of Jorkoam : and Rekem begat Shammai .
2 : 45 And the son of Shammai was Maon : and Maon was the father of Bethzur .
2 : 47 And the sons of Jahdai ; Regem , and Jotham , and Gesham , and Pelet , and Ephah , and Shaaph .
3 : 1 Now these were the sons of David , which were born unto him in Hebron ; the firstborn Amnon , of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess ; the second Daniel , of Abigail the Carmelitess : 3 : 2 The third , Absalom the son of Maachah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur : the fourth , Adonijah the son of Haggith : 3 : 3 The fifth , Shephatiah of Abital : the sixth , Ithream by Eglah his wife .
3 : 9 These were all the sons of David , beside the sons of the concubines , and Tamar their sister .
4 : 5 And Ashur the father of Tekoa had two wives , Helah and Naarah .
And these are the sons of Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh , which Mered took .
4 : 20 And the sons of Shimon were , Amnon , and Rinnah , Benhanan , and Tilon .
4 : 21 The sons of Shelah the son of Judah were , Er the father of Lecah , and Laadah the father of Mareshah , and the families of the house of them that wrought fine linen , of the house of Ashbea , 4 : 22 And Jokim , and the men of Chozeba , and Joash , and Saraph , who had the dominion in Moab , and Jashubilehem .
4 : 26 And the sons of Mishma ; Hamuel his son , Zacchur his son , Shimei his son .
4 : 28 And they dwelt at Beersheba , and Moladah , and Hazarshual , 4 : 29 And at Bilhah , and at Ezem , and at Tolad , 4 : 30 And at Bethuel , and at Hormah , and at Ziklag , 4 : 31 And at Bethmarcaboth , and Hazarsusim , and at Bethbirei , and at Shaaraim .
5 : 22 For there fell down many slain , because the war was of God .
5 : 23 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land : they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir , and unto mount Hermon .
5 : 25 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers , and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land , whom God destroyed before them .
6 : 1 The sons of Levi ; Gershon , Kohath , and Merari .
And these are the families of the Levites according to their fathers .
6 : 25 And the sons of Elkanah ; Amasai , and Ahimoth .
6 : 32 And they ministered before the dwelling place of the tabernacle of the congregation with singing , until Solomon had built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem : and then they waited on their office according to their order .
6 : 44 And their brethren the sons of Merari stood on the left hand : Ethan the son of Kishi , the son of Abdi , the son of Malluch , 6 : 45 The son of Hashabiah , the son of Amaziah , the son of Hilkiah , 6 : 46 The son of Amzi , the son of Bani , the son of Shamer , 6 : 47 The son of Mahli , the son of Mushi , the son of Merari , the son of Levi .
6 : 54 Now these are their dwelling places throughout their castles in their coasts , of the sons of Aaron , of the families of the Kohathites : for theirs was the lot .
6 : 57 And to the sons of Aaron they gave the cities of Judah , namely , Hebron , the city of refuge , and Libnah with her suburbs , and Jattir , and Eshtemoa , with their suburbs , 6 : 58 And Hilen with her suburbs , Debir with her suburbs , 6 : 59 And Ashan with her suburbs , and Bethshemesh with her suburbs : 6 : 60 And out of the tribe of Benjamin ; Geba with her suburbs , and Alemeth with her suburbs , and Anathoth with her suburbs .
6 : 71 Unto the sons of Gershom were given out of the family of the half tribe of Manasseh , Golan in Bashan with her suburbs , and Ashtaroth with her suburbs : 6 : 72 And out of the tribe of Issachar ; Kedesh with her suburbs , Daberath with her suburbs , 6 : 73 And Ramoth with her suburbs , and Anem with her suburbs : 6 : 74 And out of the tribe of Asher ; Mashal with her suburbs , and Abdon with her suburbs , 6 : 75 And Hukok with her suburbs , and Rehob with her suburbs : 6 : 76 And out of the tribe of Naphtali ; Kedesh in Galilee with her suburbs , and Hammon with her suburbs , and Kirjathaim with her suburbs .
7 : 2 And the sons of Tola ; Uzzi , and Rephaiah , and Jeriel , and Jahmai , and Jibsam , and Shemuel , heads of their father ' s house , to wit , of Tola : they were valiant men of might in their generations ; whose number was in the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred .
7 : 4 And with them , by their generations , after the house of their fathers , were bands of soldiers for war , six and thirty thousand men : for they had many wives and sons .
7 : 6 The sons of Benjamin ; Bela , and Becher , and Jediael , three .
7 : 7 And the sons of Bela ; Ezbon , and Uzzi , and Uzziel , and Jerimoth , and Iri , five ; heads of the house of their fathers , mighty men of valour ; and were reckoned by their genealogies twenty and two thousand and thirty and four .
7 : 9 And the number of them , after their genealogy by their generations , heads of the house of their fathers , mighty men of valour , was twenty thousand and two hundred .
7 : 14 The sons of Manasseh ; Ashriel , whom she bare : ( but his concubine the Aramitess bare Machir the father of Gilead : 7 : 15 And Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim , whose sister ' s name was Maachah ;) and the name of the second was Zelophehad : and Zelophehad had daughters .
7 : 22 And Ephraim their father mourned many days , and his brethren came to comfort him .
7 : 23 And when he went in to his wife , she conceived , and bare a son , and he called his name Beriah , because it went evil with his house .
7 : 31 And the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel , who is the father of Birzavith .
7 : 33 And the sons of Japhlet ; Pasach , and Bimhal , and Ashvath .
7 : 34 And the sons of Shamer ; Ahi , and Rohgah , Jehubbah , and Aram .
And the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men .
8 : 1 Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn , Ashbel the second , and Aharah the third , 8 : 2 Nohah the fourth , and Rapha the fifth .
These were his sons , heads of the fathers .
And these also dwelt with their brethren in Jerusalem , over against them .
All these are of the sons of Benjamin .
9 : 14 And of the Levites ; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub , the son of Azrikam , the son of Hashabiah , of the sons of Merari ; 9 : 15 And Bakbakkar , Heresh , and Galal , and Mattaniah the son of Micah , the son of Zichri , the son of Asaph ; 9 : 16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah , the son of Galal , the son of Jeduthun , and Berechiah the son of Asa , the son of Elkanah , that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites .
9 : 20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past , and the LORD was with him .
9 : 23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD , namely , the house of the tabernacle , by wards .
9 : 25 And their brethren , which were in their villages , were to come after seven days from time to time with them .
9 : 39 And Ner begat Kish ; and Kish begat Saul ; and Saul begat Jonathan , and Malchishua , and Abinadab , and Eshbaal .
10 : 1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel ; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines , and fell down slain in mount Gilboa .
So Saul took a sword , and fell upon it .
10 : 8 And it came to pass on the morrow , when the Philistines came to strip the slain , that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa .
12 : 1 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag , while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish : and they were among the mighty men , helpers of the war .
12 : 4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite , a mighty man among the thirty , and over the thirty ; and Jeremiah , and Jahaziel , and Johanan , and Josabad the Gederathite , 12 : 5 Eluzai , and Jerimoth , and Bealiah , and Shemariah , and Shephatiah the Haruphite , 12 : 6 Elkanah , and Jesiah , and Azareel , and Joezer , and Jashobeam , the Korhites , 12 : 7 And Joelah , and Zebadiah , the sons of Jeroham of Gedor .
12 : 14 These were of the sons of Gad , captains of the host : one of the least was over an hundred , and the greatest over a thousand .
12 : 15 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month , when it had overflown all his banks ; and they put to flight all them of the valleys , both toward the east , and toward the west .
12 : 16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David .
12 : 20 As he went to Ziklag , there fell to him of Manasseh , Adnah , and Jozabad , and Jediael , and Michael , and Jozabad , and Elihu , and Zilthai , captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh .
12 : 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred .
12 : 29 And of the children of Benjamin , the kindred of Saul , three thousand : for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul .
13 : 2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel , If it seem good unto you , and that it be of the LORD our God , let us send abroad unto our brethren every where , that are left in all the land of Israel , and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs , that they may gather themselves unto us : 13 : 3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us : for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul .
14 : 8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel , all the Philistines went up to seek David .
And David heard of it , and went out against them .
14 : 9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim .
14 : 13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley .
14 : 15 And it shall be , when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees , that then thou shalt go out to battle : for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines .
14 : 16 David therefore did as God commanded him : and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer .
15 : 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel ; and of his brethren , Asaph the son of Berechiah ; and of the sons of Merari their brethren , Ethan the son of Kushaiah ; 15 : 18 And with them their brethren of the second degree , Zechariah , Ben , and Jaaziel , and Shemiramoth , and Jehiel , and Unni , Eliab , and Benaiah , and Maaseiah , and Mattithiah , and Elipheleh , and Mikneiah , and Obededom , and Jeiel , the porters .
15 : 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting , and with sound of the cornet , and with trumpets , and with cymbals , making a noise with psalteries and harps .
16 : 34 O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
16 : 36 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever .
Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house .
17 : 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes , O God ; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant ' s house for a great while to come , and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree , O LORD God .
17 : 18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant ?
17 : 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever ; and thou , LORD , becamest their God .
18 : 2 And he smote Moab ; and the Moabites became David ' s servants , and brought gifts .
18 : 6 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus ; and the Syrians became David ' s servants , and brought gifts .
18 : 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer , and brought them to Jerusalem .
18 : 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand .
Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went .
19 : 1 Now it came to pass after this , that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died , and his son reigned in his stead .
So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun , to comfort him .
19 : 4 Wherefore Hanun took David ' s servants , and shaved them , and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks , and sent them away .
19 : 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots , and the king of Maachah and his people ; who came and pitched before Medeba .
19 : 8 And when David heard of it , he sent Joab , and all the host of the mighty men .
19 : 17 And it was told David ; and he gathered all Israel , and passed over Jordan , and came upon them , and set the battle in array against them .
20 : 6 And yet again there was war at Gath , where was a man of great stature , whose fingers and toes were four and twenty , six on each hand , and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant .
20 : 8 These were born unto the giant in Gath ; and they fell by the hand of David , and by the hand of his servants .
21 : 5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David .
21 : 9 And the LORD spake unto Gad , David ' s seer , saying , 21 : 10 Go and tell David , saying , Thus saith the LORD , I offer thee three things : choose thee one of them , that I may do it unto thee .
Now Ornan was threshing wheat .
22 : 1 Then David said , This is the house of the LORD God , and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel .
So David prepared abundantly before his death .
22 : 12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding , and give thee charge concerning Israel , that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God .
23 : 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel , with the priests and the Levites .
23 : 3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward : and their number by their polls , man by man , was thirty and eight thousand .
These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan .
23 : 12 The sons of Kohath ; Amram , Izhar , Hebron , and Uzziel , four .
23 : 14 Now concerning Moses the man of God , his sons were named of the tribe of Levi .
23 : 19 Of the sons of Hebron ; Jeriah the first , Amariah the second , Jahaziel the third , and Jekameam the fourth .
The sons of Mahli ; Eleazar , and Kish .
24 : 1 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron .
25 : 1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph , and of Heman , and of Jeduthun , who should prophesy with harps , with psalteries , and with cymbals : and the number of the workmen according to their service was : 25 : 2 Of the sons of Asaph ; Zaccur , and Joseph , and Nethaniah , and Asarelah , the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph , which prophesied according to the order of the king .
25 : 3 Of Jeduthun : the sons of Jeduthun ; Gedaliah , and Zeri , and Jeshaiah , Hashabiah , and Mattithiah , six , under the hands of their father Jeduthun , who prophesied with a harp , to give thanks and to praise the LORD .
25 : 4 Of Heman : the sons of Heman : Bukkiah , Mattaniah , Uzziel , Shebuel , and Jerimoth , Hananiah , Hanani , Eliathah , Giddalti , and Romamtiezer , Joshbekashah , Mallothi , Hothir , and Mahazioth : 25 : 5 All these were the sons of Heman the king ' s seer in the words of God , to lift up the horn .
26 : 2 And the sons of Meshelemiah were , Zechariah the firstborn , Jediael the second , Zebadiah the third , Jathniel the fourth , 26 : 3 Elam the fifth , Jehohanan the sixth , Elioenai the seventh .
26 : 7 The sons of Shemaiah ; Othni , and Rephael , and Obed , Elzabad , whose brethren were strong men , Elihu , and Semachiah .
26 : 16 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward , with the gate Shallecheth , by the causeway of the going up , ward against ward .
26 : 18 At Parbar westward , four at the causeway , and two at Parbar .
26 : 25 And his brethren by Eliezer ; Rehabiah his son , and Jeshaiah his son , and Joram his son , and Zichri his son , and Shelomith his son .
27 : 10 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite , of the children of Ephraim : and in his course were twenty and four thousand .
27 : 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number , but he finished not , because there fell wrath for it against Israel ; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David .
All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David ' s .
And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD ?
29 : 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years ; seven years reigned he in Hebron , and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
1 : 15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones , and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance .
2 : 10 And , behold , I will give to thy servants , the hewers that cut timber , twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat , and twenty thousand measures of barley , and twenty thousand baths of wine , and twenty thousand baths of oil .
3 : 9 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold .
And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold .
3 : 10 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work , and overlaid them with gold .
3 : 11 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long : one wing of the one cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was likewise five cubits , reaching to the wing of the other cherub .
3 : 12 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits , reaching to the wall of the house : and the other wing was five cubits also , joining to the wing of the other cherub .
3 : 16 And he made chains , as in the oracle , and put them on the heads of the pillars ; and made an hundred pomegranates , and put them on the chains .
4 : 2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim , round in compass , and five cubits the height thereof ; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about .
4 : 3 And under it was the similitude of oxen , which did compass it round about : ten in a cubit , compassing the sea round about .
4 : 14 He made also bases , and lavers made he upon the bases ; 4 : 15 One sea , and twelve oxen under it .
4 : 17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them , in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah .
5 : 6 Also king Solomon , and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark , sacrificed sheep and oxen , which could not be told nor numbered for multitude .
5 : 11 And it came to pass , when the priests were come out of the holy place : ( for all the priests that were present were sanctified , and did not then wait by course : 5 : 12 Also the Levites which were the singers , all of them of Asaph , of Heman , of Jeduthun , with their sons and their brethren , being arrayed in white linen , having cymbals and psalteries and harps , stood at the east end of the altar , and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets :) 5 : 13 It came even to pass , as the trumpeters and singers were as one , to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD ; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever : that then the house was filled with a cloud , even the house of the LORD ; 5 : 14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud : for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God .
6 : 18 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth ?
behold , heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee ; how much less this house which I have built !
6 : 22 If a man sin against his neighbour , and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear , and the oath come before thine altar in this house ; 6 : 23 Then hear thou from heaven , and do , and judge thy servants , by requiting the wicked , by recompensing his way upon his own head ; and by justifying the righteous , by giving him according to his righteousness .
6 : 24 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy , because they have sinned against thee ; and shall return and confess thy name , and pray and make supplication before thee in this house ; 6 : 25 Then hear thou from the heavens , and forgive the sin of thy people Israel , and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers .
7 : 3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down , and the glory of the LORD upon the house , they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement , and worshipped , and praised the LORD , saying , For he is good ; for his mercy endureth for ever .
7 : 4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD .
7 : 10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents , glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David , and to Solomon , and to Israel his people .
7 : 22 And it shall be answered , Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers , which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt , and laid hold on other gods , and worshipped them , and served them : therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them .
8 : 7 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Hivites , and the Jebusites , which were not of Israel , 8 : 8 But of their children , who were left after them in the land , whom the children of Israel consumed not , them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day .
8 : 10 And these were the chief of king Solomon ' s officers , even two hundred and fifty , that bare rule over the people .
So the house of the LORD was perfected .
9 : 2 And Solomon told her all her questions : and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not .
9 : 5 And she said to the king , It was a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts , and of thy wisdom : 9 : 6 Howbeit I believed not their words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me : for thou exceedest the fame that I heard .
9 : 13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold ; 9 : 14 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought .
9 : 15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold : six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target .
9 : 23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon , to hear his wisdom , that God had put in his heart .
9 : 25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen ; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
9 : 29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon , first and last , are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet , and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite , and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat ?
10 : 3 And they sent and called him .
10 : 8 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him , and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him , that stood before him .
10 : 19 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day .
11 : 13 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts .
11 : 16 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem , to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers .
11 : 21 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines : ( for he took eighteen wives , and threescore concubines ; and begat twenty and eight sons , and threescore daughters .
12 : 2 And it came to pass , that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , because they had transgressed against the LORD , 12 : 3 With twelve hundred chariots , and threescore thousand horsemen : and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt ; the Lubims , the Sukkiims , and the Ethiopians .
12 : 6 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves ; and they said , The LORD is righteous .
12 : 7 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves , the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah , saying , They have humbled themselves ; therefore I will not destroy them , but I will grant them some deliverance ; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak .
And his mother ' s name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
13 : 9 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD , the sons of Aaron , and the Levites , and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands ?
13 : 10 But as for us , the LORD is our God , and we have not forsaken him ; and the priests , which minister unto the LORD , are the sons of Aaron , and the Levites wait upon their business : 13 : 11 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense : the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table ; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof , to burn every evening : for we keep the charge of the LORD our God ; but ye have forsaken him .
13 : 21 But Abijah waxed mighty , and married fourteen wives , and begat twenty and two sons , and sixteen daughters .
14 : 2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God : 14 : 3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods , and the high places , and brake down the images , and cut down the groves : 14 : 4 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers , and to do the law and the commandment .
14 : 7 Therefore he said unto Judah , Let us build these cities , and make about them walls , and towers , gates , and bars , while the land is yet before us ; because we have sought the LORD our God , we have sought him , and he hath given us rest on every side .
15 : 3 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God , and without a teaching priest , and without law .
15 : 19 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa .
16 : 1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah , and built Ramah , to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah .
16 : 6 Then Asa the king took all Judah ; and they carried away the stones of Ramah , and the timber thereof , wherewith Baasha was building ; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah .
18 : 2 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria .
18 : 5 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men , and said unto them , Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle , or shall I forbear ?
And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so .
18 : 15 And the king said to him , How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD ?
18 : 16 Then he said , I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains , as sheep that have no shepherd : and the LORD said , These have no master ; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace .
18 : 18 Again he said , Therefore hear the word of the LORD ; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne , and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left .
18 : 24 And Micaiah said , Behold , thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself .
So the king of Israel disguised himself ; and they went to the battle .
18 : 33 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : therefore he said to his chariot man , Turn thine hand , that thou mayest carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
therefore is wrath upon thee from before the LORD .
19 : 3 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee , in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land , and hast prepared thine heart to seek God .
20 : 22 And when they began to sing and to praise , the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon , Moab , and mount Seir , which were come against Judah ; and they were smitten .
20 : 30 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet : for his God gave him rest round about .
And his mother ' s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi .
20 : 33 Howbeit the high places were not taken away : for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers .
21 : 3 And their father gave them great gifts of silver , and of gold , and of precious things , with fenced cities in Judah : but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram ; because he was the firstborn .
So Jehoshabeath , the daughter of king Jehoram , the wife of Jehoiada the priest , ( for she was the sister of Ahaziah ,) hid him from Athaliah , so that she slew him not .
23 : 1 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself , and took the captains of hundreds , Azariah the son of Jeroham , and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan , and Azariah the son of Obed , and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah , and Elishaphat the son of Zichri , into covenant with him .
23 : 6 But let none come into the house of the LORD , save the priests , and they that minister of the Levites ; they shall go in , for they are holy : but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD .
23 : 10 And he set all the people , every man having his weapon in his hand , from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple , along by the altar and the temple , by the king round about .
23 : 16 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him , and between all the people , and between the king , that they should be the LORD ' s people .
23 : 17 Then all the people went to the house of Baal , and brake it down , and brake his altars and his images in pieces , and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars .
23 : 21 And all the people of the land rejoiced : and the city was quiet , after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword .
His mother ' s name also was Zibiah of Beersheba .
24 : 4 And it came to pass after this , that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD .
24 : 8 And at the king ' s commandment they made a chest , and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD .
24 : 11 Now it came to pass , that at what time the chest was brought unto the king ' s office by the hand of the Levites , and when they saw that there was much money , the king ' s scribe and the high priest ' s officer came and emptied the chest , and took it , and carried it to his place again .
Thus they did day by day , and gathered money in abundance .
24 : 16 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings , because he had done good in Israel , both toward God , and toward his house .
And when he died , he said , The LORD look upon it , and require it .
24 : 25 And when they were departed from him , ( for they left him in great diseases ,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest , and slew him on his bed , and he died : and they buried him in the city of David , but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings .
25 : 1 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem .
25 : 13 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back , that they should not go with him to battle , fell upon the cities of Judah , from Samaria even unto Bethhoron , and smote three thousand of them , and took much spoil .
forbear ; why shouldest thou be smitten ?
25 : 24 And he took all the gold and the silver , and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom , and the treasures of the king ' s house , the hostages also , and returned to Samaria .
His mother ' s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem .
26 : 10 Also he built towers in the desert , and digged many wells : for he had much cattle , both in the low country , and in the plains : husbandmen also , and vine dressers in the mountains , and in Carmel : for he loved husbandry .
26 : 17 And Azariah the priest went in after him , and with him fourscore priests of the LORD , that were valiant men : 26 : 18 And they withstood Uzziah the king , and said unto him , It appertaineth not unto thee , Uzziah , to burn incense unto the LORD , but to the priests the sons of Aaron , that are consecrated to burn incense : go out of the sanctuary ; for thou hast trespassed ; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God .
27 : 5 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites , and prevailed against them .
27 : 6 So Jotham became mighty , because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God .
27 : 7 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham , and all his wars , and his ways , lo , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah .
27 : 8 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
28 : 9 But a prophet of the LORD was there , whose name was Oded : and he went out before the host that came to Samaria , and said unto them , Behold , because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah , he hath delivered them into your hand , and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven .
28 : 10 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you : but are there not with you , even with you , sins against the LORD your God ?
28 : 14 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation .
28 : 21 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD , and out of the house of the king , and of the princes , and gave it unto the king of Assyria : but he helped him not .
29 : 1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old , and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem .
29 : 7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch , and put out the lamps , and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel .
29 : 19 Moreover all the vessels , which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression , have we prepared and sanctified , and , behold , they are before the altar of the LORD .
29 : 21 And they brought seven bullocks , and seven rams , and seven lambs , and seven he goats , for a sin offering for the kingdom , and for the sanctuary , and for Judah .
29 : 31 Then Hezekiah answered and said , Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD , come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD .
29 : 32 And the number of the burnt offerings , which the congregation brought , was threescore and ten bullocks , an hundred rams , and two hundred lambs : all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD .
30 : 2 For the king had taken counsel , and his princes , and all the congregation in Jerusalem , to keep the passover in the second month .
30 : 4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation .
30 : 10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun : but they laughed them to scorn , and mocked them .
30 : 21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness : and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day , singing with loud instruments unto the LORD .
30 : 24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep ; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep : and a great number of priests sanctified themselves .
30 : 25 And all the congregation of Judah , with the priests and the Levites , and all the congregation that came out of Israel , and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel , and that dwelt in Judah , rejoiced .
31 : 10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him , and said , Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD , we have had enough to eat , and have left plenty : for the LORD hath blessed his people ; and that which is left is this great store .
31 : 15 And next him were Eden , and Miniamin , and Jeshua , and Shemaiah , Amariah , and Shecaniah , in the cities of the priests , in their set office , to give to their brethren by courses , as well to the great as to the small : 31 : 16 Beside their genealogy of males , from three years old and upward , even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD , his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses ; 31 : 17 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers , and the Levites from twenty years old and upward , in their charges by their courses ; 31 : 18 And to the genealogy of all their little ones , their wives , and their sons , and their daughters , through all the congregation : for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness : 31 : 19 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests , which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities , in every several city , the men that were expressed by name , to give portions to all the males among the priests , and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites .
32 : 1 After these things , and the establishment thereof , Sennacherib king of Assyria came , and entered into Judah , and encamped against the fenced cities , and thought to win them for himself .
32 : 12 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars , and commanded Judah and Jerusalem , saying , Ye shall worship before one altar , and burn incense upon it ?
32 : 14 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed , that could deliver his people out of mine hand , that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand ?
So he returned with shame of face to his own land .
32 : 26 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart , both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah .
32 : 31 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon , who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land , God left him , to try him , that he might know all that was in his heart .
32 : 33 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers , and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David : and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death .
33 : 11 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria , which took Manasseh among the thorns , and bound him with fetters , and carried him to Babylon .
33 : 18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh , and his prayer unto his God , and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel .
33 : 20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers , and they buried him in his own house : and Amon his son reigned in his stead .
34 : 3 For in the eighth year of his reign , while he was yet young , he began to seek after the God of David his father : and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places , and the groves , and the carved images , and the molten images .
34 : 8 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign , when he had purged the land , and the house , he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah , and Maaseiah the governor of the city , and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder , to repair the house of the LORD his God .
34 : 13 Also they were over the bearers of burdens , and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service : and of the Levites there were scribes , and officers , and porters .
34 : 14 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD , Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD given by Moses .
34 : 17 And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD , and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers , and to the hand of the workmen .
34 : 22 And Hilkiah , and they that the king had appointed , went to Huldah the prophetess , the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath , the son of Hasrah , keeper of the wardrobe ; ( now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college :) and they spake to her to that effect .
34 : 31 And the king stood in his place , and made a covenant before the LORD , to walk after the LORD , and to keep his commandments , and his testimonies , and his statutes , with all his heart , and with all his soul , to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book .
35 : 6 So kill the passover , and sanctify yourselves , and prepare your brethren , that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses .
35 : 8 And his princes gave willingly unto the people , to the priests , and to the Levites : Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel , rulers of the house of God , gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen .
35 : 9 Conaniah also , and Shemaiah and Nethaneel , his brethren , and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad , chief of the Levites , gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle , and five hundred oxen .
35 : 12 And they removed the burnt offerings , that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people , to offer unto the LORD , as it is written in the book of Moses .
35 : 24 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot , and put him in the second chariot that he had ; and they brought him to Jerusalem , and he died , and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers .
And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother , and carried him to Egypt .
36 : 17 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees , who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary , and had no compassion upon young man or maiden , old man , or him that stooped for age : he gave them all into his hand .
1 : 1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia , that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled , the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia , that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom , and put it also in writing , saying , 1 : 2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia , The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth ; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem , which is in Judah .
his God be with him , and let him go up to Jerusalem , which is in Judah , and build the house of the LORD God of Israel , ( he is the God ,) which is in Jerusalem .
2 : 6 The children of Pahathmoab , of the children of Jeshua and Joab , two thousand eight hundred and twelve .
2 : 18 The children of Jorah , an hundred and twelve .
2 : 25 The children of Kirjatharim , Chephirah , and Beeroth , seven hundred and forty and three .
2 : 26 The children of Ramah and Gaba , six hundred twenty and one .
2 : 27 The men of Michmas , an hundred twenty and two .
2 : 29 The children of Nebo , fifty and two .
2 : 31 The children of the other Elam , a thousand two hundred fifty and four .
2 : 34 The children of Jericho , three hundred forty and five .
2 : 36 The priests : the children of Jedaiah , of the house of Jeshua , nine hundred seventy and three .
2 : 38 The children of Pashur , a thousand two hundred forty and seven .
2 : 40 The Levites : the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel , of the children of Hodaviah , seventy and four .
2 : 61 And of the children of the priests : the children of Habaiah , the children of Koz , the children of Barzillai ; which took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite , and was called after their name : 2 : 62 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but they were not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
3 : 11 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD ; because he is good , for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel .
4 : 4 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah , and troubled them in building , 4 : 5 And hired counsellors against them , to frustrate their purpose , all the days of Cyrus king of Persia , even until the reign of Darius king of Persia .
4 : 18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me .
4 : 22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this : why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings ?
5 : 12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath , he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , the Chaldean , who destroyed this house , and carried the people away into Babylon .
5 : 17 Now therefore , if it seem good to the king , let there be search made in the king ' s treasure house , which is there at Babylon , whether it be so , that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem , and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter .
6 : 6 Now therefore , Tatnai , governor beyond the river , Shetharboznai , and your companions the Apharsachites , which are beyond the river , be ye far from thence : 6 : 7 Let the work of this house of God alone ; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place .
6 : 8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God : that of the king ' s goods , even of the tribute beyond the river , forthwith expenses be given unto these men , that they be not hindered .
6 : 20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together , all of them were pure , and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity , and for their brethren the priests , and for themselves .
7 : 24 Also we certify you , that touching any of the priests and Levites , singers , porters , Nethinims , or ministers of this house of God , it shall not be lawful to impose toll , tribute , or custom , upon them .
8 : 5 Of the sons of Shechaniah ; the son of Jahaziel , and with him three hundred males .
8 : 6 Of the sons also of Adin ; Ebed the son of Jonathan , and with him fifty males .
8 : 8 And of the sons of Shephatiah ; Zebadiah the son of Michael , and with him fourscore males .
8 : 9 Of the sons of Joab ; Obadiah the son of Jehiel , and with him two hundred and eighteen males .
8 : 16 Then sent I for Eliezer , for Ariel , for Shemaiah , and for Elnathan , and for Jarib , and for Elnathan , and for Nathan , and for Zechariah , and for Meshullam , chief men ; also for Joiarib , and for Elnathan , men of understanding .
8 : 31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month , to go unto Jerusalem : and the hand of our God was upon us , and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy , and of such as lay in wait by the way .
9 : 1 Now when these things were done , the princes came to me , saying , The people of Israel , and the priests , and the Levites , have not separated themselves from the people of the lands , doing according to their abominations , even of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Perizzites , the Jebusites , the Ammonites , the Moabites , the Egyptians , and the Amorites .
9 : 2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves , and for their sons : so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands : yea , the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass .
9 : 9 For we were bondmen ; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage , but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia , to give us a reviving , to set up the house of our God , and to repair the desolations thereof , and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem .
9 : 12 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons , neither take their daughters unto your sons , nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever : that ye may be strong , and eat the good of the land , and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever .
10 : 1 Now when Ezra had prayed , and when he had confessed , weeping and casting himself down before the house of God , there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children : for the people wept very sore .
10 : 14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand , and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times , and with them the elders of every city , and the judges thereof , until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us .
10 : 21 And of the sons of Harim ; Maaseiah , and Elijah , and Shemaiah , and Jehiel , and Uzziah .
10 : 22 And of the sons of Pashur ; Elioenai , Maaseiah , Ishmael , Nethaneel , Jozabad , and Elasah .
10 : 25 Moreover of Israel : of the sons of Parosh ; Ramiah , and Jeziah , and Malchiah , and Miamin , and Eleazar , and Malchijah , and Benaiah .
10 : 27 And of the sons of Zattu ; Elioenai , Eliashib , Mattaniah , and Jeremoth , and Zabad , and Aziza .
10 : 33 Of the sons of Hashum ; Mattenai , Mattathah , Zabad , Eliphelet , Jeremai , Manasseh , and Shimei .
10 : 34 Of the sons of Bani ; Maadai , Amram , and Uel , 10 : 35 Benaiah , Bedeiah , Chelluh , 10 : 36 Vaniah , Meremoth , Eliashib , 10 : 37 Mattaniah , Mattenai , and Jaasau , 10 : 38 And Bani , and Binnui , Shimei , 10 : 39 And Shelemiah , and Nathan , and Adaiah , 10 : 40 Machnadebai , Shashai , Sharai , 10 : 41 Azareel , and Shelemiah , Shemariah , 10 : 42 Shallum , Amariah , and Joseph .
1 : 7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee , and have not kept the commandments , nor the statutes , nor the judgments , which thou commandedst thy servant Moses .
1 : 11 O LORD , I beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servants , who desire to fear thy name : and prosper , I pray thee , thy servant this day , and grant him mercy in the sight of this man .
2 : 11 So I came to Jerusalem , and was there three days .
2 : 17 Then said I unto them , Ye see the distress that we are in , how Jerusalem lieth waste , and the gates thereof are burned with fire : come , and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem , that we be no more a reproach .
And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri .
3 : 13 The valley gate repaired Hanun , and the inhabitants of Zanoah ; they built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof , and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate .
3 : 16 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk , the ruler of the half part of Bethzur , unto the place over against the sepulchres of David , and to the pool that was made , and unto the house of the mighty .
3 : 21 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece , from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib .
After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by his house .
3 : 26 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel , unto the place over against the water gate toward the east , and the tower that lieth out .
3 : 31 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith ' s son unto the place of the Nethinims , and of the merchants , over against the gate Miphkad , and to the going up of the corner .
will they make an end in a day ?
4 : 3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him , and he said , Even that which they build , if a fox go up , he shall even break down their stone wall .
4 : 11 And our adversaries said , They shall not know , neither see , till we come in the midst among them , and slay them , and cause the work to cease .
4 : 17 They which builded on the wall , and they that bare burdens , with those that laded , every one with one of his hands wrought in the work , and with the other hand held a weapon .
And he that sounded the trumpet was by me .
4 : 22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people , Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem , that in the night they may be a guard to us , and labour on the day .
5 : 7 Then I consulted with myself , and I rebuked the nobles , and the rulers , and said unto them , Ye exact usury , every one of his brother .
5 : 17 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers , beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us .
5 : 18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep ; also fowls were prepared for me , and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine : yet for all this required not I the bread of the governor , because the bondage was heavy upon this people .
6 : 17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah , and the letters of Tobiah came unto them .
7 : 4 Now the city was large and great : but the people were few therein , and the houses were not builded .
The number , I say , of the men of the people of Israel was this ; 7 : 8 The children of Parosh , two thousand an hundred seventy and two .
7 : 15 The children of Binnui , six hundred forty and eight .
7 : 23 The children of Bezai , three hundred twenty and four .
7 : 25 The children of Gibeon , ninety and five .
7 : 31 The men of Michmas , an hundred and twenty and two .
7 : 33 The men of the other Nebo , fifty and two .
7 : 44 The singers : the children of Asaph , an hundred forty and eight .
7 : 45 The porters : the children of Shallum , the children of Ater , the children of Talmon , the children of Akkub , the children of Hatita , the children of Shobai , an hundred thirty and eight .
7 : 62 The children of Delaiah , the children of Tobiah , the children of Nekoda , six hundred forty and two .
7 : 66 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore , 7 : 67 Beside their manservants and their maidservants , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women .
The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold , fifty basons , five hundred and thirty priests ' garments .
8 : 4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood , which they had made for the purpose ; and beside him stood Mattithiah , and Shema , and Anaiah , and Urijah , and Hilkiah , and Maaseiah , on his right hand ; and on his left hand , Pedaiah , and Mishael , and Malchiah , and Hashum , and Hashbadana , Zechariah , and Meshullam .
8 : 18 Also day by day , from the first day unto the last day , he read in the book of the law of God .
9 : 7 Thou art the LORD the God , who didst choose Abram , and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees , and gavest him the name of Abraham ; 9 : 8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee , and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites , the Hittites , the Amorites , and the Perizzites , and the Jebusites , and the Girgashites , to give it , I say , to his seed , and hast performed thy words ; for thou art righteous : 9 : 9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt , and heardest their cry by the Red sea ; 9 : 10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh , and on all his servants , and on all the people of his land : for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them .
So didst thou get thee a name , as it is this day .
9 : 13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai , and spakest with them from heaven , and gavest them right judgments , and true laws , good statutes and commandments : 9 : 14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath , and commandedst them precepts , statutes , and laws , by the hand of Moses thy servant : 9 : 15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger , and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst , and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them .
9 : 24 So the children went in and possessed the land , and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land , the Canaanites , and gavest them into their hands , with their kings , and the people of the land , that they might do with them as they would .
9 : 27 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies , who vexed them : and in the time of their trouble , when they cried unto thee , thou heardest them from heaven ; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours , who saved them out of the hand of their enemies .
9 : 30 Yet many years didst thou forbear them , and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets : yet would they not give ear : therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands .
10 : 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn , of the new wine , and the oil , unto the chambers , where are the vessels of the sanctuary , and the priests that minister , and the porters , and the singers : and we will not forsake the house of our God .
11 : 11 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah , the son of Meshullam , the son of Zadok , the son of Meraioth , the son of Ahitub , was the ruler of the house of God .
11 : 21 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel : and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims .
11 : 22 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani , the son of Hashabiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Micha .
Of the sons of Asaph , the singers were over the business of the house of God .
11 : 23 For it was the king ' s commandment concerning them , that a certain portion should be for the singers , due for every day .
11 : 36 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah , and in Benjamin .
12 : 9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni , their brethren , were over against them in the watches .
12 : 24 And the chief of the Levites : Hashabiah , Sherebiah , and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel , with their brethren over against them , to praise and to give thanks , according to the commandment of David the man of God , ward over against ward .
12 : 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves , and purified the people , and the gates , and the wall .
12 : 37 And at the fountain gate , which was over against them , they went up by the stairs of the city of David , at the going up of the wall , above the house of David , even unto the water gate eastward .
12 : 38 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them , and I after them , and the half of the people upon the wall , from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall ; 12 : 39 And from above the gate of Ephraim , and above the old gate , and above the fish gate , and the tower of Hananeel , and the tower of Meah , even unto the sheep gate : and they stood still in the prison gate .
12 : 47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel , and in the days of Nehemiah , gave the portions of the singers and the porters , every day his portion : and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites ; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron .
13 : 4 And before this , Eliashib the priest , having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God , was allied unto Tobiah : 13 : 5 And he had prepared for him a great chamber , where aforetime they laid the meat offerings , the frankincense , and the vessels , and the tithes of the corn , the new wine , and the oil , which was commanded to be given to the Levites , and the singers , and the porters ; and the offerings of the priests .
13 : 20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice .
13 : 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves , and that they should come and keep the gates , to sanctify the sabbath day .
1 : 9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus .
2 : 1 After these things , when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased , he remembered Vashti , and what she had done , and what was decreed against her .
2 : 11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women ' s house , to know how Esther did , and what should become of her .
And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her .
2 : 22 And the thing was known to Mordecai , who told it unto Esther the queen ; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai ' s name .
3 : 2 And all the king ' s servants , that were in the king ' s gate , bowed , and reverenced Haman : for the king had so commanded concerning him .
But Mordecai bowed not , nor did him reverence .
3 : 8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus , There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom ; and their laws are diverse from all people ; neither keep they the king ' s laws : therefore it is not for the king ' s profit to suffer them .
3 : 10 And the king took his ring from his hand , and gave it unto Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite , the Jews ' enemy .
3 : 11 And the king said unto Haman , The silver is given to thee , the people also , to do with them as it seemeth good to thee .
3 : 14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , that they should be ready against that day .
4 : 5 Then called Esther for Hatach , one of the king ' s chamberlains , whom he had appointed to attend upon her , and gave him a commandment to Mordecai , to know what it was , and why it was .
4 : 14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time , then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place ; but thou and thy father ' s house shall be destroyed : and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this ?
5 : 6 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine , What is thy petition ?
5 : 7 Then answered Esther , and said , My petition and my request is ; 5 : 8 If I have found favour in the sight of the king , and if it please the king to grant my petition , and to perform my request , let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them , and I will do to morrow as the king hath said .
5 : 9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart : but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king ' s gate , that he stood not up , nor moved for him , he was full of indignation against Mordecai .
5 : 11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches , and the multitude of his children , and all the things wherein the king had promoted him , and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king .
6 : 11 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse , and arrayed Mordecai , and brought him on horseback through the street of the city , and proclaimed before him , Thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour .
But Haman hasted to his house mourning , and having his head covered .
6 : 13 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him .
7 : 5 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the queen , Who is he , and where is he , that durst presume in his heart to do so ?
Then was the king ' s wrath pacified .
8 : 2 And the king took off his ring , which he had taken from Haman , and gave it unto Mordecai .
or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred ?
8 : 13 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people , and that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies .
and it shall be granted thee : or what is thy request further ?
9 : 14 And the king commanded it so to be done : and the decree was given at Shushan ; and they hanged Haman ' s ten sons .
9 : 19 Therefore the Jews of the villages , that dwelt in the unwalled towns , made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting , and a good day , and of sending portions one to another .
9 : 23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun , and as Mordecai had written unto them ; 9 : 24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha , the Agagite , the enemy of all the Jews , had devised against the Jews to destroy them , and had cast Pur , that is , the lot , to consume them , and to destroy them ; 9 : 25 But when Esther came before the king , he commanded by letters that his wicked device , which he devised against the Jews , should return upon his own head , and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows .
Therefore for all the words of this letter , and of that which they had seen concerning this matter , and which had come unto them , 9 : 27 The Jews ordained , and took upon them , and upon their seed , and upon all such as joined themselves unto them , so as it should not fail , that they would keep these two days according to their writing , and according to their appointed time every year ; 9 : 28 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation , every family , every province , and every city ; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews , nor the memorial of them perish from their seed .
9 : 32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim ; and it was written in the book .
1 : 4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses , every one his day ; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them .
1 : 11 But put forth thine hand now , and touch all that he hath , and he will curse thee to thy face .
2 : 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD .
and still he holdeth fast his integrity , although thou movedst me against him , to destroy him without cause .
2 : 6 And the LORD said unto Satan , Behold , he is in thine hand ; but save his life .
2 : 7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD , and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown .
2 : 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal ; and he sat down among the ashes .
2 : 10 But he said unto her , Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh .
In all this did not Job sin with his lips .
3 : 2 And Job spake , and said , 3 : 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born , and the night in which it was said , There is a man child conceived .
3 : 19 The small and great are there ; and the servant is free from his master .
3 : 23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid , and whom God hath hedged in ?
4 : 6 Is not this thy fear , thy confidence , thy hope , and the uprightness of thy ways ?
4 : 7 Remember , I pray thee , who ever perished , being innocent ?
4 : 15 Then a spirit passed before my face ; the hair of my flesh stood up : 4 : 16 It stood still , but I could not discern the form thereof : an image was before mine eyes , there was silence , and I heard a voice , saying , 4 : 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God ?
4 : 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening : they perish for ever without any regarding it .
5 : 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man , and envy slayeth the silly one .
5 : 8 I would seek unto God , and unto God would I commit my cause : 5 : 9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable ; marvellous things without number : 5 : 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth , and sendeth waters upon the fields : 5 : 11 To set up on high those that be low ; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety .
5 : 21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue : neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh .
5 : 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great , and thine offspring as the grass of the earth .
or loweth the ox over his fodder ?
or is my flesh of brass ?
6 : 22 Did I say , Bring unto me ?
or , Give a reward for me of your substance ?
6 : 29 Return , I pray you , let it not be iniquity ; yea , return again , my righteousness is in it .
cannot my taste discern perverse things ?
7 : 2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow , and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work : 7 : 3 So am I made to possess months of vanity , and wearisome nights are appointed to me .
7 : 18 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning , and try him every moment ?
can the flag grow without water ?
8 : 13 So are the paths of all that forget God ; and the hypocrite ' s hope shall perish : 8 : 14 Whose hope shall be cut off , and whose trust shall be a spider ' s web .
8 : 18 If he destroy him from his place , then it shall deny him , saying , I have not seen thee .
9 : 11 Lo , he goeth by me , and I see him not : he passeth on also , but I perceive him not .
9 : 16 If I had called , and he had answered me ; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice .
9 : 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest , and multiplieth my wounds without cause .
9 : 19 If I speak of strength , lo , he is strong : and if of judgment , who shall set me a time to plead ?
9 : 23 If the scourge slay suddenly , he will laugh at the trial of the innocent .
9 : 34 Let him take his rod away from me , and let not his fear terrify me : 9 : 35 Then would I speak , and not fear him ; but it is not so with me .
10 : 5 Are thy days as the days of man ?
Oh that I had given up the ghost , and no eye had seen me !
cease then , and let me alone , that I may take comfort a little , 10 : 21 Before I go whence I shall not return , even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death ; 10 : 22 A land of darkness , as darkness itself ; and of the shadow of death , without any order , and where the light is as darkness .
Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth .
11 : 7 Canst thou by searching find out God ?
deeper than hell ; what canst thou know ?
11 : 12 For vain men would be wise , though man be born like a wild ass ' s colt .
12 : 7 But ask now the beasts , and they shall teach thee ; and the fowls of the air , and they shall tell thee : 12 : 8 Or speak to the earth , and it shall teach thee : and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee .
12 : 16 With him is strength and wisdom : the deceived and the deceiver are his .
12 : 19 He leadeth princes away spoiled , and overthroweth the mighty .
12 : 24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth , and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way .
13 : 9 Is it good that he should search you out ?
and his dread fall upon you ?
13 : 21 Withdraw thine hand far from me : and let not thy dread make me afraid .
13 : 26 For thou writest bitter things against me , and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth .
14 : 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth , and the stock thereof die in the ground ; 14 : 9 Yet through the scent of water it will bud , and bring forth boughs like a plant .
14 : 13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave , that thou wouldest keep me secret , until thy wrath be past , that thou wouldest appoint me a set time , and remember me !
14 : 16 For now thou numberest my steps : dost thou not watch over my sin ?
14 : 20 Thou prevailest for ever against him , and he passeth : thou changest his countenance , and sendest him away .
14 : 21 His sons come to honour , and he knoweth it not ; and they are brought low , but he perceiveth it not of them .
15 : 11 Are the consolations of God small with thee ?
is there any secret thing with thee ?
15 : 16 How much more abominable and filthy is man , which drinketh iniquity like water ?
15 : 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine , and shall cast off his flower as the olive .
16 : 9 He teareth me in his wrath , who hateth me : he gnasheth upon me with his teeth ; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me .
17 : 2 Are there not mockers with me ?
17 : 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way , and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger .
and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
18 : 5 Yea , the light of the wicked shall be put out , and the spark of his fire shall not shine .
19 : 4 And be it indeed that I have erred , mine error remaineth with myself .
19 : 8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass , and he hath set darkness in my paths .
19 : 11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me , and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies .
oh that they were printed in a book !
20 : 3 I have heard the check of my reproach , and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer .
20 : 9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more ; neither shall his place any more behold him .
20 : 10 His children shall seek to please the poor , and his hands shall restore their goods .
20 : 19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor ; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not ; 20 : 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly , he shall not save of that which he desired .
20 : 21 There shall none of his meat be left ; therefore shall no man look for his goods .
21 : 9 Their houses are safe from fear , neither is the rod of God upon them .
and how oft cometh their destruction upon them !
21 : 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him , when the number of his months is cut off in the midst ?
21 : 22 Shall any teach God knowledge ?
22 : 3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty , that thou art righteous ?
or is it gain to him , that thou makest thy ways perfect ?
22 : 16 Which were cut down out of time , whose foundation was overflown with a flood : 22 : 17 Which said unto God , Depart from us : and what can the Almighty do for them ?
No ; but he would put strength in me .
24 : 25 And if it be not so now , who will make me a liar , and make my speech nothing worth ?
25 : 6 How much less man , that is a worm ?
26 : 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens ; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent .
but the thunder of his power who can understand ?
27 : 5 God forbid that I should justify you : till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me .
27 : 9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him ?
27 : 10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty ?
28 : 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing ; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light .
28 : 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof ; neither is it found in the land of the living .
28 : 14 The depth saith , It is not in me : and the sea saith , It is not with me .
29 : 22 After my words they spake not again ; and my speech dropped upon them .
29 : 23 And they waited for me as for the rain ; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain .
30 : 16 And now my soul is poured out upon me ; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me .
30 : 23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death , and to the house appointed for all living .
30 : 30 My skin is black upon me , and my bones are burned with heat .
31 : 11 For this is an heinous crime ; yea , it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges .
and when he visiteth , what shall I answer him ?
and did not one fashion us in the womb ?
31 : 16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire , or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail ; 31 : 17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone , and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof ; 31 : 18 ( For from my youth he was brought up with me , as with a father , and I have guided her from my mother ' s womb ;) 31 : 19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing , or any poor without covering ; 31 : 20 If his loins have not blessed me , and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep ; 31 : 21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless , when I saw my help in the gate : 31 : 22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade , and mine arm be broken from the bone .
31 : 35 Oh that one would hear me !
behold , my desire is , that the Almighty would answer me , and that mine adversary had written a book .
31 : 37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps ; as a prince would I go near unto him .
32 : 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken , because they were elder than he .
32 : 10 Therefore I said , Hearken to me ; I also will shew mine opinion .
33 : 1 Wherefore , Job , I pray thee , hear my speeches , and hearken to all my words .
33 : 3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart : and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly .
33 : 4 The spirit of God hath made me , and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life .
33 : 8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing , and I have heard the voice of thy words , saying , 33 : 9 I am clean without transgression , I am innocent ; neither is there iniquity in me .
33 : 15 In a dream , in a vision of the night , when deep sleep falleth upon men , in slumberings upon the bed ; 33 : 16 Then he openeth the ears of men , and sealeth their instruction , 33 : 17 That he may withdraw man from his purpose , and hide pride from man .
33 : 21 His flesh is consumed away , that it cannot be seen ; and his bones that were not seen stick out .
33 : 27 He looketh upon men , and if any say , I have sinned , and perverted that which was right , and it profited me not ; 33 : 28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit , and his life shall see the light .
34 : 16 If now thou hast understanding , hear this : hearken to the voice of my words .
34 : 20 In a moment shall they die , and the people shall be troubled at midnight , and pass away : and the mighty shall be taken away without hand .
34 : 23 For he will not lay upon man more than right ; that he should enter into judgment with God .
34 : 24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number , and set others in their stead .
34 : 25 Therefore he knoweth their works , and he overturneth them in the night , so that they are destroyed .
or what receiveth he of thine hand ?
35 : 12 There they cry , but none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil men .
36 : 1 Elihu also proceeded , and said , 36 : 2 Suffer me a little , and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God ' s behalf .
36 : 5 Behold , God is mighty , and despiseth not any : he is mighty in strength and wisdom .
36 : 8 And if they be bound in fetters , and be holden in cords of affliction ; 36 : 9 Then he sheweth them their work , and their transgressions that they have exceeded .
no , not gold , nor all the forces of strength .
36 : 21 Take heed , regard not iniquity : for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction .
36 : 25 Every man may see it ; man may behold it afar off .
36 : 27 For he maketh small the drops of water : they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof : 36 : 28 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly .
36 : 31 For by them judgeth he the people ; he giveth meat in abundance .
37 : 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice , and the sound that goeth out of his mouth .
37 : 8 Then the beasts go into dens , and remain in their places .
37 : 13 He causeth it to come , whether for correction , or for his land , or for mercy .
38 : 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ?
38 : 12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days ; and caused the dayspring to know his place ; 38 : 13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth , that the wicked might be shaken out of it ?
38 : 30 The waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
38 : 34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds , that abundance of waters may cover thee ?
38 : 39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion ?
or knowest thou the time when they bring forth ?
39 : 3 They bow themselves , they bring forth their young ones , they cast out their sorrows .
39 : 13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks ?
the glory of his nostrils is terrible .
39 : 22 He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword .
40 : 9 Hast thou an arm like God ?
40 : 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee .
40 : 18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass ; his bones are like bars of iron .
40 : 19 He is the chief of the ways of God : he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him .
40 : 22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow ; the willows of the brook compass him about .
40 : 23 Behold , he drinketh up a river , and hasteth not : he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth .
40 : 24 He taketh it with his eyes : his nose pierceth through snares .
41 : 5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird ?
shall they part him among the merchants ?
41 : 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons ?
41 : 8 Lay thine hand upon him , remember the battle , do no more .
41 : 11 Who hath prevented me , that I should repay him ?
41 : 21 His breath kindleth coals , and a flame goeth out of his mouth .
42 : 7 And it was so , that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job , the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite , My wrath is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends : for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right , as my servant Job hath .
The Book of Psalms
2 : 7 I will declare the decree : the LORD hath said unto me , Thou art my Son ; this day have I begotten thee .
2 : 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron ; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter ' s vessel .
Selah .
4 : 3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself : the LORD will hear when I call unto him .
4 : 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart , more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased .
5 : 1 Give ear to my words , O LORD , consider my meditation .
5 : 4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness : neither shall evil dwell with thee .
5 : 9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth ; their inward part is very wickedness ; their throat is an open sepulchre ; they flatter with their tongue .
6 : 4 Return , O LORD , deliver my soul : oh save me for thy mercies ' sake .
6 : 8 Depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity ; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping .
7 : 1 O LORD my God , in thee do I put my trust : save me from all them that persecute me , and deliver me :
7 : 3 O LORD my God , If I have done this ; if there be iniquity in my hands ;
7 : 6 Arise , O LORD , in thine anger , lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies : and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded .
7 : 8 The LORD shall judge the people : judge me , O LORD , according to my righteousness , and according to mine integrity that is in me .
7 : 14 Behold , he travaileth with iniquity , and hath conceived mischief , and brought forth falsehood .
7 : 15 He made a pit , and digged it , and is fallen into the ditch which he made .
8 : 1 O LORD , our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth !
8 : 9 O LORD our Lord , how excellent is thy name in all the earth !
9 : 6 O thou enemy , destructions are come to a perpetual end : and thou hast destroyed cities ; their memorial is perished with them .
9 : 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee : for thou , LORD , hast not forsaken them that seek thee .
9 : 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell , and all the nations that forget God .
why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble ?
10 : 6 He hath said in his heart , I shall not be moved : for I shall never be in adversity .
10 : 14 Thou hast seen it ; for thou beholdest mischief and spite , to requite it with thy hand : the poor committeth himself unto thee ; thou art the helper of the fatherless .
10 : 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed , that the man of the earth may no more oppress .
12 : 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour : with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak .
12 : 4 Who have said , With our tongue will we prevail ; our lips are our own : who is lord over us ?
12 : 8 The wicked walk on every side , when the vilest men are exalted .
for ever ?
13 : 4 Lest mine enemy say , I have prevailed against him ; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved .
14 : 3 They are all gone aside , they are all together become filthy : there is none that doeth good , no , not one .
14 : 5 There were they in great fear : for God is in the generation of the righteous .
when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people , Jacob shall rejoice , and Israel shall be glad .
15 : 1 Lord , who shall abide in thy tabernacle ?
15 : 3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue , nor doeth evil to his neighbour , nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour .
16 : 2 O my soul , thou hast said unto the LORD , Thou art my Lord : my goodness extendeth not to thee ;
16 : 9 Therefore my heart is glad , and my glory rejoiceth : my flesh also shall rest in hope .
17 : 1 Hear the right , O LORD , attend unto my cry , give ear unto my prayer , that goeth not out of feigned lips .
17 : 10 They are inclosed in their own fat : with their mouth they speak proudly .
18 : 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD , and cried unto my God : he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came before him , even into his ears .
18 : 9 He bowed the heavens also , and came down : and darkness was under his feet .
18 : 23 I was also upright before him , and I kept myself from mine iniquity .
18 : 28 For thou wilt light my candle : the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness .
18 : 30 As for God , his way is perfect : the word of the LORD is tried : he is a buckler to all those that trust in him .
18 : 41 They cried , but there was none to save them : even unto the LORD , but he answered them not .
18 : 45 The strangers shall fade away , and be afraid out of their close places .
18 : 48 He delivereth me from mine enemies : yea , thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me : thou hast delivered me from the violent man .
19 : 3 There is no speech nor language , where their voice is not heard .
19 : 5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber , and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race .
19 : 8 The statutes of the LORD are right , rejoicing the heart : the commandment of the LORD is pure , enlightening the eyes .
20 : 9 Save , LORD : let the king hear us when we call .
21 : 6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever : thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance .
22 : 2 O my God , I cry in the day time , but thou hearest not ; and in the night season , and am not silent .
22 : 3 But thou art holy , O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel .
22 : 4 Our fathers trusted in thee : they trusted , and thou didst deliver them .
22 : 13 They gaped upon me with their mouths , as a ravening and a roaring lion .
22 : 15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd ; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws ; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death .
22 : 16 For dogs have compassed me : the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me : they pierced my hands and my feet .
22 : 20 Deliver my soul from the sword ; my darling from the power of the dog .
22 : 24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted ; neither hath he hid his face from him ; but when he cried unto him , he heard .
22 : 29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship : all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him : and none can keep alive his own soul .
22 : 30 A seed shall serve him ; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation .
24 : 8 Who is this King of glory ?
The LORD of hosts , he is the King of glory .
25 : 2 O my God , I trust in thee : let me not be ashamed , let not mine enemies triumph over me .
25 : 5 Lead me in thy truth , and teach me : for thou art the God of my salvation ; on thee do I wait all the day .
25 : 9 The meek will he guide in judgment : and the meek will he teach his way .
25 : 17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged : O bring thou me out of my distresses .
26 : 11 But as for me , I will walk in mine integrity : redeem me , and be merciful unto me .
27 : 4 One thing have I desired of the LORD , that will I seek after ; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life , to behold the beauty of the LORD , and to enquire in his temple .
27 : 8 When thou saidst , Seek ye my face ; my heart said unto thee , Thy face , LORD , will I seek .
27 : 11 Teach me thy way , O LORD , and lead me in a plain path , because of mine enemies .
27 : 12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies : for false witnesses are risen up against me , and such as breathe out cruelty .
27 : 13 I had fainted , unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living .
27 : 14 Wait on the LORD : be of good courage , and he shall strengthen thine heart : wait , I say , on the LORD .
28 : 5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD , nor the operation of his hands , he shall destroy them , and not build them up .
29 : 5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars ; yea , the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon .
30 : 1 I will extol thee , O LORD ; for thou hast lifted me up , and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me .
Shall the dust praise thee ?
31 : 8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy : thou hast set my feet in a large room .
31 : 11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies , but especially among my neighbours , and a fear to mine acquaintance : they that did see me without fled from me .
31 : 14 But I trusted in thee , O LORD : I said , Thou art my God .
31 : 23 O love the LORD , all ye his saints : for the LORD preserveth the faithful , and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer .
Selah .
33 : 13 The LORD looketh from heaven ; he beholdeth all the sons of men .
34 : 5 They looked unto him , and were lightened : and their faces were not ashamed .
34 : 9 O fear the LORD , ye his saints : for there is no want to them that fear him .
35 : 3 Draw out also the spear , and stop the way against them that persecute me : say unto my soul , I am thy salvation .
35 : 7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit , which without cause they have digged for my soul .
35 : 13 But as for me , when they were sick , my clothing was sackcloth : I humbled my soul with fasting ; and my prayer returned into mine own bosom .
35 : 15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced , and gathered themselves together : yea , the abjects gathered themselves together against me , and I knew it not ; they did tear me , and ceased not :
35 : 24 Judge me , O LORD my God , according to thy righteousness ; and let them not rejoice over me .
36 : 2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes , until his iniquity be found to be hateful .
therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings .
37 : 5 Commit thy way unto the LORD ; trust also in him ; and he shall bring it to pass .
37 : 24 Though he fall , he shall not be utterly cast down : for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand .
37 : 25 I have been young , and now am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread .
37 : 28 For the LORD loveth judgment , and forsaketh not his saints ; they are preserved for ever : but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off .
37 : 36 Yet he passed away , and , lo , he was not : yea , I sought him , but he could not be found .
37 : 38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together : the end of the wicked shall be cut off .
39 : 9 I was dumb , I opened not my mouth ; because thou didst it .
40 : 2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit , out of the miry clay , and set my feet upon a rock , and established my goings .
40 : 8 I delight to do thy will , O my God : yea , thy law is within my heart .
40 : 10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart ; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation : I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation .
40 : 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : let such as love thy salvation say continually , The LORD be magnified .
41 : 4 I said , LORD , be merciful unto me : heal my soul ; for I have sinned against thee .
42 : 6 O my God , my soul is cast down within me : therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan , and of the Hermonites , from the hill Mizar .
42 : 9 I will say unto God my rock , Why hast thou forgotten me ?
44 : 7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies , and hast put them to shame that hated us .
44 : 13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us .
44 : 22 Yea , for thy sake are we killed all the day long ; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter .
arise , cast us not off for ever .
44 : 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face , and forgettest our affliction and our oppression ?
45 : 6 Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre .
46 : 4 There is a river , the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God , the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High .
47 : 7 For God is the King of all the earth : sing ye praises with understanding .
48 : 5 They saw it , and so they marvelled ; they were troubled , and hasted away .
48 : 13 Mark ye well her bulwarks , consider her palaces ; that ye may tell it to the generation following .
49 : 11 Their inward thought is , that their houses shall continue for ever , and their dwelling places to all generations ; they call their lands after their own names .
49 : 14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave ; death shall feed on them ; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning ; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling .
49 : 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave : for he shall receive me .
50 : 1 The mighty God , even the LORD , hath spoken , and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof .
50 : 5 Gather my saints together unto me ; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice .
50 : 11 I know all the fowls of the mountains : and the wild beasts of the field are mine .
50 : 12 If I were hungry , I would not tell thee : for the world is mine , and the fulness thereof .
50 : 19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil , and thy tongue frameth deceit .
50 : 22 Now consider this , ye that forget God , lest I tear you in pieces , and there be none to deliver .
51 : 1 Have mercy upon me , O God , according to thy lovingkindness : according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions .
51 : 5 Behold , I was shapen in iniquity ; and in sin did my mother conceive me .
51 : 10 Create in me a clean heart , O God ; and renew a right spirit within me .
51 : 14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness , O God , thou God of my salvation : and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness .
53 : 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there were any that did understand , that did seek God .
54 : 6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee : I will praise thy name , O LORD ; for it is good .
55 : 12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me ; then I could have borne it : neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me ; then I would have hid myself from him :
55 : 19 God shall hear , and afflict them , even he that abideth of old .
Because they have no changes , therefore they fear not God .
56 : 1 Be merciful unto me , O God : for man would swallow me up ; he fighting daily oppresseth me .
56 : 12 Thy vows are upon me , O God : I will render praises unto thee .
God shall send forth his mercy and his truth .
57 : 4 My soul is among lions : and I lie even among them that are set on fire , even the sons of men , whose teeth are spears and arrows , and their tongue a sharp sword .
58 : 5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers , charming never so wisely .
59 : 6 They return at evening : they make a noise like a dog , and go round about the city .
60 : 5 That thy beloved may be delivered ; save with thy right hand , and hear me .
60 : 6 God hath spoken in his holiness ; I will rejoice , I will divide Shechem , and mete out the valley of Succoth .
who will lead me into Edom ?
62 : 1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God : from him cometh my salvation .
63 : 1 O God , thou art my God ; early will I seek thee : my soul thirsteth for thee , my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land , where no water is ;
63 : 10 They shall fall by the sword : they shall be a portion for foxes .
63 : 11 But the king shall rejoice in God ; every one that sweareth by him shall glory : but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped .
64 : 1 Hear my voice , O God , in my prayer : preserve my life from fear of the enemy .
64 : 4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect : suddenly do they shoot at him , and fear not .
64 : 8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves : all that see them shall flee away .
64 : 9 And all men shall fear , and shall declare the work of God ; for they shall wisely consider of his doing .
66 : 10 For thou , O God , hast proved us : thou hast tried us , as silver is tried .
66 : 11 Thou broughtest us into the net ; thou laidst affliction upon our loins .
66 : 12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads ; we went through fire and through water : but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place .
66 : 18 If I regard iniquity in my heart , the Lord will not hear me :
66 : 20 Blessed be God , which hath not turned away my prayer , nor his mercy from me .
67 : 4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy : for thou shalt judge the people righteously , and govern the nations upon earth .
67 : 5 Let the people praise thee , O God ; let all the people praise thee .
68 : 2 As smoke is driven away , so drive them away : as wax melteth before the fire , so let the wicked perish at the presence of God .
68 : 8 The earth shook , the heavens also dropped at the presence of God : even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God , the God of Israel .
68 : 15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan ; an high hill as the hill of Bashan .
68 : 19 Blessed be the Lord , who daily loadeth us with benefits , even the God of our salvation .
68 : 24 They have seen thy goings , O God ; even the goings of my God , my King , in the sanctuary .
68 : 25 The singers went before , the players on instruments followed after ; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels .
68 : 27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler , the princes of Judah and their council , the princes of Zebulun , and the princes of Naphtali .
68 : 35 O God , thou art terrible out of thy holy places : the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people .
69 : 6 Let not them that wait on thee , O Lord GOD of hosts , be ashamed for my sake : let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake , O God of Israel .
69 : 22 Let their table become a snare before them : and that which should have been for their welfare , let it become a trap .
70 : 3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say , Aha , aha .
71 : 3 Be thou my strong habitation , whereunto I may continually resort : thou hast given commandment to save me ; for thou art my rock and my fortress .
71 : 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age ; forsake me not when my strength faileth .
71 : 11 Saying , God hath forsaken him : persecute and take him ; for there is none to deliver him .
71 : 17 O God , thou hast taught me from my youth : and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works .
71 : 21 Thou shalt increase my greatness , and comfort me on every side .
71 : 24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long : for they are confounded , for they are brought unto shame , that seek my hurt .
72 : 8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth .
72 : 16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains ; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon : and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth .
73 : 6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain ; violence covereth them as a garment .
73 : 9 They set their mouth against the heavens , and their tongue walketh through the earth .
73 : 14 For all the day long have I been plagued , and chastened every morning .
73 : 18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places : thou castedst them down into destruction .
they are utterly consumed with terrors .
and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee .
74 : 2 Remember thy congregation , which thou hast purchased of old ; the rod of thine inheritance , which thou hast redeemed ; this mount Zion , wherein thou hast dwelt .
74 : 5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees .
74 : 23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies : the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually .
75 : 2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly .
75 : 10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off ; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted .
76 : 5 The stouthearted are spoiled , they have slept their sleep : and none of the men of might have found their hands .
Selah .
77 : 2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord : my sore ran in the night , and ceased not : my soul refused to be comforted .
77 : 3 I remembered God , and was troubled : I complained , and my spirit was overwhelmed .
Selah .
77 : 16 The waters saw thee , O God , the waters saw thee ; they were afraid : the depths also were troubled .
77 : 18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven : the lightnings lightened the world : the earth trembled and shook .
77 : 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron .
78 : 1 Give ear , O my people , to my law : incline your ears to the words of my mouth .
78 : 3 Which we have heard and known , and our fathers have told us .
78 : 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud , and all the night with a light of fire .
78 : 21 Therefore the LORD heard this , and was wroth : so a fire was kindled against Jacob , and anger also came up against Israel ;
78 : 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat , and had given them of the corn of heaven .
78 : 25 Man did eat angels ' food : he sent them meat to the full .
78 : 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven : and by his power he brought in the south wind .
78 : 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust , and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea :
78 : 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller , and their labour unto the locust .
78 : 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh , the tent which he placed among men ;
78 : 63 The fire consumed their young men ; and their maidens were not given to marriage .
wilt thou be angry for ever ?
80 : 9 Thou preparedst room before it , and didst cause it to take deep root , and it filled the land .
81 : 9 There shall no strange god be in thee ; neither shalt thou worship any strange god .
81 : 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice ; and Israel would none of me .
83 : 3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people , and consulted against thy hidden ones .
83 : 4 They have said , Come , and let us cut them off from being a nation ; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance .
Selah .
84 : 5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee ; in whose heart are the ways of them .
I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of wickedness .
84 : 12 O LORD of hosts , blessed is the man that trusteth in thee .
85 : 12 Yea , the LORD shall give that which is good ; and our land shall yield her increase .
86 : 7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee : for thou wilt answer me .
86 : 8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee , O Lord ; neither are there any works like unto thy works .
86 : 9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee , O Lord ; and shall glorify thy name .
86 : 14 O God , the proud are risen against me , and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul ; and have not set thee before them .
87 : 1 His foundation is in the holy mountains .
87 : 2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob .
Selah .
88 : 5 Free among the dead , like the slain that lie in the grave , whom thou rememberest no more : and they are cut off from thy hand .
Selah .
shall the dead arise and praise thee ?
why hidest thou thy face from me ?
89 : 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen , I have sworn unto David my servant ,
Selah .
who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD ?
89 : 15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound : they shall walk , O LORD , in the light of thy countenance .
89 : 17 For thou art the glory of their strength : and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted .
89 : 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him ; nor the son of wickedness afflict him .
89 : 25 I will set his hand also in the sea , and his right hand in the rivers .
89 : 28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore , and my covenant shall stand fast with him .
89 : 30 If his children forsake my law , and walk not in my judgments ;
89 : 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod , and their iniquity with stripes .
89 : 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him , nor suffer my faithfulness to fail .
Selah .
89 : 52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore .
Amen , and Amen .
90 : 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath : we spend our years as a tale that is told .
90 : 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger ?
94 : 1 O Lord God , to whom vengeance belongeth ; O God , to whom vengeance belongeth , shew thyself .
94 : 9 He that planted the ear , shall he not hear ?
94 : 17 Unless the LORD had been my help , my soul had almost dwelt in silence .
94 : 19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul .
94 : 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee , which frameth mischief by a law ?
94 : 23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity , and shall cut them off in their own wickedness ; yea , the LORD our God shall cut them off .
95 : 2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving , and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms .
95 : 7 For he is our God ; and we are the people of his pasture , and the sheep of his hand .
95 : 9 When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my work .
96 : 5 For all the gods of the nations are idols : but the LORD made the heavens .
96 : 10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth : the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved : he shall judge the people righteously .
97 : 2 Clouds and darkness are round about him : righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne .
97 : 10 Ye that love the LORD , hate evil : he preserveth the souls of his saints ; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked .
98 : 2 The LORD hath made known his salvation : his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen .
98 : 4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD , all the earth : make a loud noise , and rejoice , and sing praise .
99 : 5 Exalt ye the LORD our God , and worship at his footstool ; for he is holy .
99 : 9 Exalt the LORD our God , and worship at his holy hill ; for the LORD our God is holy .
100 : 5 For the LORD is good ; his mercy is everlasting ; and his truth endureth to all generations .
101 : 1 I will sing of mercy and judgment : unto thee , O LORD , will I sing .
101 : 2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way .
O when wilt thou come unto me ?
101 : 4 A froward heart shall depart from me : I will not know a wicked person .
102 : 13 Thou shalt arise , and have mercy upon Zion : for the time to favour her , yea , the set time , is come .
102 : 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner ; to loose those that are appointed to death ;
102 : 27 But thou art the same , and thy years shall have no end .
103 : 13 Like as a father pitieth his children , so the LORD pitieth them that fear him .
104 : 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains .
104 : 18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats ; and the rocks for the conies .
in wisdom hast thou made them all : the earth is full of thy riches .
104 : 27 These wait all upon thee ; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season .
104 : 32 He looketh on the earth , and it trembleth : he toucheth the hills , and they smoke .
104 : 34 My meditation of him shall be sweet : I will be glad in the LORD .
Bless thou the LORD , O my soul .
105 : 1 O give thanks unto the LORD ; call upon his name : make known his deeds among the people .
105 : 9 Which covenant he made with Abraham , and his oath unto Isaac ;
105 : 19 Until the time that his word came : the word of the LORD tried him .
105 : 28 He sent darkness , and made it dark ; and they rebelled not against his word .
105 : 45 That they might observe his statutes , and keep his laws .
106 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
106 : 37 Yea , they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils ,
107 : 8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
107 : 17 Fools because of their transgression , and because of their iniquities , are afflicted .
107 : 32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people , and praise him in the assembly of the elders .
107 : 35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water , and dry ground into watersprings .
107 : 41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction , and maketh him families like a flock .
107 : 42 The righteous shall see it , and rejoice : and all iniquity shall stop her mouth .
108 : 3 I will praise thee , O LORD , among the people : and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations .
108 : 4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens : and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds .
108 : 8 Gilead is mine ; Manasseh is mine ; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head ; Judah is my lawgiver ;
108 : 9 Moab is my washpot ; over Edom will I cast out my shoe ; over Philistia will I triumph .
108 : 10 Who will bring me into the strong city ?
109 : 7 When he shall be judged , let him be condemned : and let his prayer become sin .
109 : 17 As he loved cursing , so let it come unto him : as he delighted not in blessing , so let it be far from him .
109 : 21 But do thou for me , O GOD the Lord , for thy name ' s sake : because thy mercy is good , deliver thou me .
109 : 23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth : I am tossed up and down as the locust .
109 : 30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth ; yea , I will praise him among the multitude .
110 : 7 He shall drink of the brook in the way : therefore shall he lift up the head .
I will praise the LORD with my whole heart , in the assembly of the upright , and in the congregation .
112 : 9 He hath dispersed , he hath given to the poor ; his righteousness endureth for ever ; his horn shall be exalted with honour .
Praise ye the LORD .
114 : 4 The mountains skipped like rams , and the little hills like lambs .
115 : 7 They have hands , but they handle not : feet have they , but they walk not : neither speak they through their throat .
115 : 12 The LORD hath been mindful of us : he will bless us ; he will bless the house of Israel ; he will bless the house of Aaron .
116 : 3 The sorrows of death compassed me , and the pains of hell gat hold upon me : I found trouble and sorrow .
116 : 13 I will take the cup of salvation , and call upon the name of the LORD .
118 : 18 The LORD hath chastened me sore : but he hath not given me over unto death .
118 : 23 This is the LORD ' s doing ; it is marvellous in our eyes .
118 : 27 God is the LORD , which hath shewed us light : bind the sacrifice with cords , even unto the horns of the altar .
118 : 28 Thou art my God , and I will praise thee : thou art my God , I will exalt thee .
119 : 4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently .
119 : 10 With my whole heart have I sought thee : O let me not wander from thy commandments .
119 : 23 Princes also did sit and speak against me : but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes .
119 : 26 I have declared my ways , and thou heardest me : teach me thy statutes .
119 : 29 Remove from me the way of lying : and grant me thy law graciously .
119 : 35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments ; for therein do I delight .
119 : 37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity ; and quicken thou me in thy way .
119 : 38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant , who is devoted to thy fear .
119 : 41 Let thy mercies come also unto me , O LORD , even thy salvation , according to thy word .
119 : 42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me : for I trust in thy word .
119 : 69 The proud have forged a lie against me : but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart .
119 : 75 I know , O LORD , that thy judgments are right , and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me .
119 : 80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes ; that I be not ashamed .
119 : 84 How many are the days of thy servant ?
when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me ?
119 : 92 Unless thy law had been my delights , I should then have perished in mine affliction .
119 : 95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me : but I will consider thy testimonies .
119 : 97 O how I love thy law !
119 : 117 Hold thou me up , and I shall be safe : and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually .
119 : 118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes : for their deceit is falsehood .
119 : 131 I opened my mouth , and panted : for I longed for thy commandments .
119 : 151 Thou art near , O LORD ; and all thy commandments are truth .
119 : 156 Great are thy tender mercies , O LORD : quicken me according to thy judgments .
120 : 5 Woe is me , that I sojourn in Mesech , that I dwell in the tents of Kedar !
120 : 7 I am for peace : but when I speak , they are for war .
122 : 2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates , O Jerusalem .
122 : 3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together :
123 : 4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease , and with the contempt of the proud .
124 : 5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul .
125 : 1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion , which cannot be removed , but abideth for ever .
125 : 5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways , the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity : but peace shall be upon Israel .
126 : 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter , and our tongue with singing : then said they among the heathen , The LORD hath done great things for them .
126 : 6 He that goeth forth and weepeth , bearing precious seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
127 : 2 It is vain for you to rise up early , to sit up late , to eat the bread of sorrows : for so he giveth his beloved sleep .
127 : 4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man ; so are children of the youth .
128 : 1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD ; that walketh in his ways .
129 : 6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops , which withereth afore it groweth up :
130 : 7 Let Israel hope in the LORD : for with the LORD there is mercy , and with him is plenteous redemption .
132 : 4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes , or slumber to mine eyelids ,
132 : 14 This is my rest for ever : here will I dwell ; for I have desired it .
134 : 3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion .
135 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
135 : 9 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee , O Egypt , upon Pharaoh , and upon all his servants .
135 : 20 Bless the LORD , O house of Levi : ye that fear the LORD , bless the LORD .
136 : 3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords : for his mercy endureth for ever .
136 : 12 With a strong hand , and with a stretched out arm : for his mercy endureth for ever .
136 : 23 Who remembered us in our low estate : for his mercy endureth for ever :
136 : 25 Who giveth food to all flesh : for his mercy endureth for ever .
137 : 1 By the rivers of Babylon , there we sat down , yea , we wept , when we remembered Zion .
138 : 3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me , and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul .
138 : 4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee , O LORD , when they hear the words of thy mouth .
138 : 8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me : thy mercy , O LORD , endureth for ever : forsake not the works of thine own hands .
or whither shall I flee from thy presence ?
139 : 18 If I should count them , they are more in number than the sand : when I awake , I am still with thee .
140 : 3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent ; adders ' poison is under their lips .
140 : 9 As for the head of those that compass me about , let the mischief of their own lips cover them .
140 : 11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth : evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him .
141 : 2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense ; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice .
141 : 9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me , and the gins of the workers of iniquity .
143 : 2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant : for in thy sight shall no man living be justified .
143 : 7 Hear me speedily , O LORD : my spirit faileth : hide not thy face from me , lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit .
143 : 11 Quicken me , O LORD , for thy name ' s sake : for thy righteousness ' sake bring my soul out of trouble .
144 : 5 Bow thy heavens , O LORD , and come down : touch the mountains , and they shall smoke .
144 : 11 Rid me , and deliver me from the hand of strange children , whose mouth speaketh vanity , and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood :
144 : 14 That our oxen may be strong to labour ; that there be no breaking in , nor going out ; that there be no complaining in our streets .
145 : 9 The LORD is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works .
145 : 12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts , and the glorious majesty of his kingdom .
145 : 18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him , to all that call upon him in truth .
145 : 19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him : he also will hear their cry , and will save them .
146 : 3 Put not your trust in princes , nor in the son of man , in whom there is no help .
146 : 9 The LORD preserveth the strangers ; he relieveth the fatherless and widow : but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down .
147 : 7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving ; sing praise upon the harp unto our God :
147 : 20 He hath not dealt so with any nation : and as for his judgments , they have not known them .
148 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
148 : 3 Praise ye him , sun and moon : praise him , all ye stars of light .
148 : 4 Praise him , ye heavens of heavens , and ye waters that be above the heavens .
150 : 6 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD .
The Proverbs

8 : 19 My fruit is better than gold , yea , than fine gold ; and my revenue than choice silver .
8 : 24 When there were no depths , I was brought forth ; when there were no fountains abounding with water .
8 : 32 Now therefore hearken unto me , O ye children : for blessed are they that keep my ways .
8 : 36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul : all they that hate me love death .
9 : 3 She hath sent forth her maidens : she crieth upon the highest places of the city , 9 : 4 Whoso is simple , let him turn in hither : as for him that wanteth understanding , she saith to him , 9 : 5 Come , eat of my bread , and drink of the wine which I have mingled .

12 : 19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever : but a lying tongue is but for a moment .
12 : 25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop : but a good word maketh it glad .
12 : 27 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting : but the substance of a diligent man is precious .

15 : 18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife : but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife .
15 : 28 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer : but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things .
15 : 31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise .
16 : 14 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death : but a wise man will pacify it .
16 : 33 The lot is cast into the lap ; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD .
18 : 5 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked , to overthrow the righteous in judgment .
18 : 8 The words of a talebearer are as wounds , and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly .
19 : 11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger ; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression .
19 : 12 The king ' s wrath is as the roaring of a lion ; but his favour is as dew upon the grass .
19 : 15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep ; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger .
19 : 21 There are many devices in a man ' s heart ; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD , that shall stand .
20 : 1 Wine is a mocker , strong drink is raging : and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise .
20 : 2 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion : whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul .
20 : 3 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife : but every fool will be meddling .
20 : 11 Even a child is known by his doings , whether his work be pure , and whether it be right .
20 : 23 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD ; and a false balance is not good .
20 : 27 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD , searching all the inward parts of the belly .
20 : 30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil : so do stripes the inward parts of the belly .
21 : 7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them ; because they refuse to do judgment .
21 : 11 When the scorner is punished , the simple is made wise : and when the wise is instructed , he receiveth knowledge .
21 : 27 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination : how much more , when he bringeth it with a wicked mind ?
22 : 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches , and he that giveth to the rich , shall surely come to want .
23 : 13 Withhold not correction from the child : for if thou beatest him with the rod , he shall not die .
23 : 18 For surely there is an end ; and thine expectation shall not be cut off .
who hath babbling ?
23 : 31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red , when it giveth his colour in the cup , when it moveth itself aright .
24 : 2 For their heart studieth destruction , and their lips talk of mischief .
24 : 8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person .
24 : 17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth , and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth : 24 : 18 Lest the LORD see it , and it displease him , and he turn away his wrath from him .
24 : 29 Say not , I will do so to him as he hath done to me : I will render to the man according to his work .
24 : 32 Then I saw , and considered it well : I looked upon it , and received instruction .
25 : 12 As an earring of gold , and an ornament of fine gold , so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear .

27 : 1 Boast not thyself of to morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth .
27 : 11 My son , be wise , and make my heart glad , that I may answer him that reproacheth me .
27 : 12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil , and hideth himself ; but the simple pass on , and are punished .
27 : 17 Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend .
27 : 24 For riches are not for ever : and doth the crown endure to every generation ?
27 : 25 The hay appeareth , and the tender grass sheweth itself , and herbs of the mountains are gathered .
28 : 1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth : but the righteous are bold as a lion .
28 : 18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved : but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once .
28 : 22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye , and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him .
28 : 23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue .
28 : 26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool : but whoso walketh wisely , he shall be delivered .
29 : 1 He , that being often reproved hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .
29 : 8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare : but wise men turn away wrath .
29 : 9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man , whether he rage or laugh , there is no rest .
29 : 16 When the wicked are multiplied , transgression increaseth : but the righteous shall see their fall .
29 : 17 Correct thy son , and he shall give thee rest ; yea , he shall give delight unto thy soul .
29 : 18 Where there is no vision , the people perish : but he that keepeth the law , happy is he .
29 : 20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words ?
there is more hope of a fool than of him .
29 : 26 Many seek the ruler ' s favour ; but every man ' s judgment cometh from the LORD .
30 : 5 Every word of God is pure : he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him .
31 : 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
1 : 10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said , See , this is new ?
it hath been already of old time , which was before us .
Then I said in my heart , that this also is vanity .
2 : 18 Yea , I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun : because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me .
This also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
3 : 16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment , that wickedness was there ; and the place of righteousness , that iniquity was there .
3 : 21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward , and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth ?
4 : 13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king , who will no more be admonished .
5 : 1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God , and be more ready to hear , than to give the sacrifice of fools : for they consider not that they do evil .
5 : 9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all : the king himself is served by the field .
5 : 20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life ; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart .
6 : 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun , and it is common among men : 6 : 2 A man to whom God hath given riches , wealth , and honour , so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth , yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof , but a stranger eateth it : this is vanity , and it is an evil disease .
6 : 6 Yea , though he live a thousand years twice told , yet hath he seen no good : do not all go to one place ?
6 : 12 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life , all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow ?
7 : 3 Sorrow is better than laughter : for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better .
7 : 10 Say not thou , What is the cause that the former days were better than these ?
7 : 16 Be not righteous over much ; neither make thyself over wise : why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?
7 : 21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken ; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee : 7 : 22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others .
7 : 29 Lo , this only have I found , that God hath made man upright ; but they have sought out many inventions .
8 : 2 I counsel thee to keep the king ' s commandment , and that in regard of the oath of God .
8 : 4 Where the word of a king is , there is power : and who may say unto him , What doest thou ?
8 : 11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily , therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil .
9 : 7 Go thy way , eat thy bread with joy , and drink thy wine with a merry heart ; for God now accepteth thy works .
9 : 17 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools .
10 : 7 I have seen servants upon horses , and princes walking as servants upon the earth .
10 : 15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them , because he knoweth not how to go to the city .
11 : 6 In the morning sow thy seed , and in the evening withhold not thine hand : for thou knowest not whether shall prosper , either this or that , or whether they both shall be alike good .
1 : 1 The song of songs , which is Solomon ' s .
1 : 7 Tell me , O thou whom my soul loveth , where thou feedest , where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon : for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions ?
1 : 10 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels , thy neck with chains of gold .
1 : 13 A bundle of myrrh is my well - beloved unto me ; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts .
1 : 17 The beams of our house are cedar , and our rafters of fir .
2 : 2 As the lily among thorns , so is my love among the daughters .
2 : 10 My beloved spake , and said unto me , Rise up , my love , my fair one , and come away .
2 : 17 Until the day break , and the shadows flee away , turn , my beloved , and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether .
3 : 1 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth : I sought him , but I found him not .
3 : 7 Behold his bed , which is Solomon ' s ; threescore valiant men are about it , of the valiant of Israel .
4 : 3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet , and thy speech is comely : thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks .
4 : 5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins , which feed among the lilies .
4 : 9 Thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my spouse ; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes , with one chain of thy neck .
5 : 15 His legs are as pillars of marble , set upon sockets of fine gold : his countenance is as Lebanon , excellent as the cedars .
6 : 5 Turn away thine eyes from me , for they have overcome me : thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead .
6 : 13 Return , return , O Shulamite ; return , return , that we may look upon thee .
7 : 2 Thy navel is like a round goblet , which wanteth not liquor : thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies .
7 : 3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins .
8 : 5 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness , leaning upon her beloved ?
8 : 12 My vineyard , which is mine , is before me : thou , O Solomon , must have a thousand , and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred .
1 : 4 Ah sinful nation , a people laden with iniquity , a seed of evildoers , children that are corrupters : they have forsaken the LORD , they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger , they are gone away backward .
1 : 10 Hear the word of the LORD , ye rulers of Sodom ; give ear unto the law of our God , ye people of Gomorrah .
1 : 14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth : they are a trouble unto me ; I am weary to bear them .
1 : 16 Wash you , make you clean ; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes ; cease to do evil ; 1 : 17 Learn to do well ; seek judgment , relieve the oppressed , judge the fatherless , plead for the widow .
1 : 22 Thy silver is become dross , thy wine mixed with water : 1 : 23 Thy princes are rebellious , and companions of thieves : every one loveth gifts , and followeth after rewards : they judge not the fatherless , neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them .
1 : 27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment , and her converts with righteousness .
1 : 31 And the strong shall be as tow , and the maker of it as a spark , and they shall both burn together , and none shall quench them .
2 : 10 Enter into the rock , and hide thee in the dust , for fear of the LORD , and for the glory of his majesty .
2 : 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down , and the haughtiness of men shall be made low : and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day .
2 : 20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver , and his idols of gold , which they made each one for himself to worship , to the moles and to the bats ; 2 : 21 To go into the clefts of the rocks , and into the tops of the ragged rocks , for fear of the LORD , and for the glory of his majesty , when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth .
it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his hands shall be given him .
3 : 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword , and thy mighty in the war .
5 : 17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner , and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat .
5 : 30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea : and if one look unto the land , behold darkness and sorrow , and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof .
for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips , and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips : for mine eyes have seen the King , the LORD of hosts .
6 : 9 And he said , Go , and tell this people , Hear ye indeed , but understand not ; and see ye indeed , but perceive not .
7 : 12 But Ahaz said , I will not ask , neither will I tempt the LORD .
7 : 13 And he said , Hear ye now , O house of David ; Is it a small thing for you to weary men , but will ye weary my God also ?
7 : 21 And it shall come to pass in that day , that a man shall nourish a young cow , and two sheep ; 7 : 22 And it shall come to pass , for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter : for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land .
8 : 2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record , Uriah the priest , and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah .
8 : 13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself ; and let him be your fear , and let him be your dread .
for the living to the dead ?
9 : 5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise , and garments rolled in blood ; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire .
9 : 17 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men , neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows : for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer , and every mouth speaketh folly .
For all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
9 : 20 And he shall snatch on the right hand , and be hungry ; and he shall eat on the left hand , and they shall not be satisfied : they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm : 9 : 21 Manasseh , Ephraim ; and Ephraim , Manasseh : and they together shall be against Judah .
10 : 6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation , and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge , to take the spoil , and to take the prey , and to tread them down like the mire of the streets .
10 : 13 For he saith , By the strength of my hand I have done it , and by my wisdom ; for I am prudent : and I have removed the bounds of the people , and have robbed their treasures , and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man : 10 : 14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people : and as one gathereth eggs that are left , have I gathered all the earth ; and there was none that moved the wing , or opened the mouth , or peeped .
10 : 23 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption , even determined , in the midst of all the land .
10 : 30 Lift up thy voice , O daughter of Gallim : cause it to be heard unto Laish , O poor Anathoth .
10 : 32 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day : he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion , the hill of Jerusalem .
11 : 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain : for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD , as the waters cover the sea .
11 : 11 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people , which shall be left , from Assyria , and from Egypt , and from Pathros , and from Cush , and from Elam , and from Shinar , and from Hamath , and from the islands of the sea .
12 : 1 And in that day thou shalt say , O LORD , I will praise thee : though thou wast angry with me , thine anger is turned away , and thou comfortedst me .
14 : 10 All they shall speak and say unto thee , Art thou also become weak as we ?
14 : 29 Rejoice not thou , whole Palestina , because the rod of him that smote thee is broken : for out of the serpent ' s root shall come forth a cockatrice , and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent .
That the LORD hath founded Zion , and the poor of his people shall trust in it .
16 : 9 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah : I will water thee with my tears , O Heshbon , and Elealeh : for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen .
16 : 10 And gladness is taken away , and joy out of the plentiful field ; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing , neither shall there be shouting : the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses ; I have made their vintage shouting to cease .
16 : 12 And it shall come to pass , when it is seen that Moab is weary on the high place , that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray ; but he shall not prevail .
17 : 2 The cities of Aroer are forsaken : they shall be for flocks , which shall lie down , and none shall make them afraid .
17 : 6 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it , as the shaking of an olive tree , two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough , four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof , saith the LORD God of Israel .
17 : 7 At that day shall a man look to his Maker , and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel .
17 : 8 And he shall not look to the altars , the work of his hands , neither shall respect that which his fingers have made , either the groves , or the images .
17 : 13 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters : but God shall rebuke them , and they shall flee far off , and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind , and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind .
Behold , the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud , and shall come into Egypt : and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence , and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it .
19 : 14 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof : and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof , as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit .
20 : 1 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod , ( when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him ,) and fought against Ashdod , and took it ; 20 : 2 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz , saying , Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins , and put off thy shoe from thy foot .
21 : 3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain : pangs have taken hold upon me , as the pangs of a woman that travaileth : I was bowed down at the hearing of it ; I was dismayed at the seeing of it .
In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge , O ye travelling companies of Dedanim .
21 : 16 For thus hath the LORD said unto me , Within a year , according to the years of an hireling , and all the glory of Kedar shall fail : 21 : 17 And the residue of the number of archers , the mighty men of the children of Kedar , shall be diminished : for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it .
22 : 3 All thy rulers are fled together , they are bound by the archers : all that are found in thee are bound together , which have fled from far .
22 : 6 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen , and Kir uncovered the shield .
22 : 10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem , and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall .
22 : 14 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts , Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die , saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
23 : 12 And he said , Thou shalt no more rejoice , O thou oppressed virgin , daughter of Zidon : arise , pass over to Chittim ; there also shalt thou have no rest .
23 : 16 Take an harp , go about the city , thou harlot that hast been forgotten ; make sweet melody , sing many songs , that thou mayest be remembered .
24 : 9 They shall not drink wine with a song ; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it .
24 : 13 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people , there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree , and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done .
But I said , My leanness , my leanness , woe unto me !
24 : 19 The earth is utterly broken down , the earth is clean dissolved , the earth is moved exceedingly .
25 : 9 And it shall be said in that day , Lo , this is our God ; we have waited for him , and he will save us : this is the LORD ; we have waited for him , we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation .
25 : 10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest , and Moab shall be trodden down under him , even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill .
25 : 11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them , as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim : and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands .
26 : 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked , yet will he not learn righteousness : in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly , and will not behold the majesty of the LORD .
26 : 13 O LORD our God , other lords beside thee have had dominion over us : but by thee only will we make mention of thy name .
26 : 20 Come , my people , enter thou into thy chambers , and shut thy doors about thee : hide thyself as it were for a little moment , until the indignation be overpast .
27 : 7 Hath he smitten him , as he smote those that smote him ?
28 : 5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory , and for a diadem of beauty , unto the residue of his people , 28 : 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment , and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate .
28 : 17 Judgment also will I lay to the line , and righteousness to the plummet : and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies , and the waters shall overflow the hiding place .
28 : 22 Now therefore be ye not mockers , lest your bands be made strong : for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption , even determined upon the whole earth .
28 : 26 For his God doth instruct him to discretion , and doth teach him .
29 : 7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel , even all that fight against her and her munition , and that distress her , shall be as a dream of a night vision .
29 : 24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding , and they that murmured shall learn doctrine .
30 : 5 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them , nor be an help nor profit , but a shame , and also a reproach .
30 : 6 The burden of the beasts of the south : into the land of trouble and anguish , from whence come the young and old lion , the viper and fiery flying serpent , they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses , and their treasures upon the bunches of camels , to a people that shall not profit them .
30 : 7 For the Egyptians shall help in vain , and to no purpose : therefore have I cried concerning this , Their strength is to sit still .
30 : 17 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one ; at the rebuke of five shall ye flee : till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain , and as an ensign on an hill .
30 : 18 And therefore will the LORD wait , that he may be gracious unto you , and therefore will he be exalted , that he may have mercy upon you : for the LORD is a God of judgment : blessed are all they that wait for him .
30 : 22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver , and the ornament of thy molten images of gold : thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth ; thou shalt say unto it , Get thee hence .
30 : 25 And there shall be upon every high mountain , and upon every high hill , rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter , when the towers fall .
30 : 32 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass , which the LORD shall lay upon him , it shall be with tabrets and harps : and in battles of shaking will he fight with it .
32 : 7 The instruments also of the churl are evil : he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words , even when the needy speaketh right .
32 : 8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things ; and by liberal things shall he stand .
32 : 10 Many days and years shall ye be troubled , ye careless women : for the vintage shall fail , the gathering shall not come .
32 : 11 Tremble , ye women that are at ease ; be troubled , ye careless ones : strip you , and make you bare , and gird sackcloth upon your loins .
32 : 20 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters , that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass .
33 : 11 Ye shall conceive chaff , ye shall bring forth stubble : your breath , as fire , shall devour you .
Where is the scribe ?
where is he that counted the towers ?
34 : 5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven : behold , it shall come down upon Idumea , and upon the people of my curse , to judgment .
34 : 7 And the unicorns shall come down with them , and the bullocks with the bulls ; and their land shall be soaked with blood , and their dust made fat with fatness .
34 : 13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces , nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof : and it shall be an habitation of dragons , and a court for owls .
34 : 16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD , and read : no one of these shall fail , none shall want her mate : for my mouth it hath commanded , and his spirit it hath gathered them .
35 : 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened , and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped .
35 : 6 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart , and the tongue of the dumb sing : for in the wilderness shall waters break out , and streams in the desert .
36 : 7 But if thou say to me , We trust in the LORD our God : is it not he , whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away , and said to Judah and to Jerusalem , Ye shall worship before this altar ?
hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall , that they may eat their own dung , and drink their own piss with you ?
36 : 20 Who are they among all the gods of these lands , that have delivered their land out of my hand , that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand ?
37 : 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh , whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God , and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left .
37 : 8 So Rabshakeh returned , and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah : for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish .
37 : 15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD , saying , 37 : 16 O LORD of hosts , God of Israel , that dwellest between the cherubims , thou art the God , even thou alone , of all the kingdoms of the earth : thou hast made heaven and earth .
37 : 17 Incline thine ear , O LORD , and hear ; open thine eyes , O LORD , and see : and hear all the words of Sennacherib , which hath sent to reproach the living God .
37 : 21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah , saying , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria : 37 : 22 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him ; The virgin , the daughter of Zion , hath despised thee , and laughed thee to scorn ; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee .
38 : 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death .
38 : 4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah , saying , 38 : 5 Go , and say to Hezekiah , Thus saith the LORD , the God of David thy father , I have heard thy prayer , I have seen thy tears : behold , I will add unto thy days fifteen years .
So the sun returned ten degrees , by which degrees it was gone down .
38 : 17 Behold , for peace I had great bitterness : but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption : for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back .
38 : 19 The living , the living , he shall praise thee , as I do this day : the father to the children shall make known thy truth .
38 : 22 Hezekiah also had said , What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD ?
39 : 1 At that time Merodachbaladan , the son of Baladan , king of Babylon , sent letters and a present to Hezekiah : for he had heard that he had been sick , and was recovered .
39 : 7 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee , which thou shalt beget , shall they take away ; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon .
40 : 1 Comfort ye , comfort ye my people , saith your God .
All flesh is grass , and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field : 40 : 7 The grass withereth , the flower fadeth : because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it : surely the people is grass .
40 : 8 The grass withereth , the flower fadeth : but the word of our God shall stand for ever .
40 : 11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd : he shall gather the lambs with his arm , and carry them in his bosom , and shall gently lead those that are with young .
40 : 12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand , and meted out heaven with the span , and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure , and weighed the mountains in scales , and the hills in a balance ?
or what likeness will ye compare unto him ?
I the LORD , the first , and with the last ; I am he .
41 : 5 The isles saw it , and feared ; the ends of the earth were afraid , drew near , and came .
41 : 11 Behold , all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded : they shall be as nothing ; and they that strive with thee shall perish .
41 : 12 Thou shalt seek them , and shalt not find them , even them that contended with thee : they that war against thee shall be as nothing , and as a thing of nought .
41 : 21 Produce your cause , saith the LORD ; bring forth your strong reasons , saith the King of Jacob .
41 : 23 Shew the things that are to come hereafter , that we may know that ye are gods : yea , do good , or do evil , that we may be dismayed , and behold it together .
yea , there is none that sheweth , yea , there is none that declareth , yea , there is none that heareth your words .
did not the LORD , he against whom we have sinned ?
43 : 5 Fear not : for I am with thee : I will bring thy seed from the east , and gather thee from the west ; 43 : 6 I will say to the north , Give up ; and to the south , Keep not back : bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth ; 43 : 7 Even every one that is called by my name : for I have created him for my glory , I have formed him ; yea , I have made him .
43 : 9 Let all the nations be gathered together , and let the people be assembled : who among them can declare this , and shew us former things ?
let them bring forth their witnesses , that they may be justified : or let them hear , and say , It is truth .
43 : 19 Behold , I will do a new thing ; now it shall spring forth ; shall ye not know it ?
I will even make a way in the wilderness , and rivers in the desert .
43 : 22 But thou hast not called upon me , O Jacob ; but thou hast been weary of me , O Israel .
I have not caused thee to serve with an offering , nor wearied thee with incense .
43 : 26 Put me in remembrance : let us plead together : declare thou , that thou mayest be justified .
yea , there is no God ; I know not any .
44 : 20 He feedeth on ashes : a deceived heart hath turned him aside , that he cannot deliver his soul , nor say , Is there not a lie in my right hand ?
45 : 1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed , to Cyrus , whose right hand I have holden , to subdue nations before him ; and I will loose the loins of kings , to open before him the two leaved gates ; and the gates shall not be shut ; 45 : 2 I will go before thee , and make the crooked places straight : I will break in pieces the gates of brass , and cut in sunder the bars of iron : 45 : 3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness , and hidden riches of secret places , that thou mayest know that I , the LORD , which call thee by thy name , am the God of Israel .
45 : 4 For Jacob my servant ' s sake , and Israel mine elect , I have even called thee by thy name : I have surnamed thee , though thou hast not known me .
45 : 7 I form the light , and create darkness : I make peace , and create evil : I the LORD do all these things .
45 : 20 Assemble yourselves and come ; draw near together , ye that are escaped of the nations : they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image , and pray unto a god that cannot save .
45 : 22 Look unto me , and be ye saved , all the ends of the earth : for I am God , and there is none else .
45 : 23 I have sworn by myself , the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness , and shall not return , That unto me every knee shall bow , every tongue shall swear .
46 : 9 Remember the former things of old : for I am God , and there is none else ; I am God , and there is none like me , 46 : 10 Declaring the end from the beginning , and from ancient times the things that are not yet done , saying , My counsel shall stand , and I will do all my pleasure : 46 : 11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east , the man that executeth my counsel from a far country : yea , I have spoken it , I will also bring it to pass ; I have purposed it , I will also do it .
47 : 10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness : thou hast said , None seeth me .
47 : 15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured , even thy merchants , from thy youth : they shall wander every one to his quarter ; none shall save thee .
48 : 1 Hear ye this , O house of Jacob , which are called by the name of Israel , and are come forth out of the waters of Judah , which swear by the name of the LORD , and make mention of the God of Israel , but not in truth , nor in righteousness .
48 : 3 I have declared the former things from the beginning ; and they went forth out of my mouth , and I shewed them ; I did them suddenly , and they came to pass .
48 : 12 Hearken unto me , O Jacob and Israel , my called ; I am he ; I am the first , I also am the last .
48 : 13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth , and my right hand hath spanned the heavens : when I call unto them , they stand up together .
48 : 16 Come ye near unto me , hear ye this ; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning ; from the time that it was , there am I : and now the Lord GOD , and his Spirit , hath sent me .
then had thy peace been as a river , and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea : 48 : 19 Thy seed also had been as the sand , and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof ; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me .
48 : 22 There is no peace , saith the LORD , unto the wicked .
49 : 2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword ; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me , and made me a polished shaft ; in his quiver hath he hid me ; 49 : 3 And said unto me , Thou art my servant , O Israel , in whom I will be glorified .
As I live , saith the LORD , thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all , as with an ornament , and bind them on thee , as a bride doeth .
49 : 24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty , or the lawful captive delivered ?
49 : 26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh ; and they shall be drunken with their own blood , as with sweet wine : and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer , the mighty One of Jacob .
let us stand together : who is mine adversary ?
51 : 3 For the LORD shall comfort Zion : he will comfort all her waste places ; and he will make her wilderness like Eden , and her desert like the garden of the LORD ; joy and gladness shall be found therein , thanksgiving , and the voice of melody .
51 : 7 Hearken unto me , ye that know righteousness , the people in whose heart is my law ; fear ye not the reproach of men , neither be ye afraid of their revilings .
Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab , and wounded the dragon ?
52 : 3 For thus saith the LORD , Ye have sold yourselves for nought ; and ye shall be redeemed without money .
52 : 4 For thus saith the Lord GOD , My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there ; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause .
52 : 12 For ye shall not go out with haste , nor go by flight : for the LORD will go before you ; and the God of Israel will be your rereward .
53 : 2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant , and as a root out of a dry ground : he hath no form nor comeliness ; and when we shall see him , there is no beauty that we should desire him .
53 : 3 He is despised and rejected of men ; a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief : and we hid as it were our faces from him ; he was despised , and we esteemed him not .
53 : 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment : and who shall declare his generation ?
53 : 9 And he made his grave with the wicked , and with the rich in his death ; because he had done no violence , neither was any deceit in his mouth .
54 : 1 Sing , O barren , thou that didst not bear ; break forth into singing , and cry aloud , thou that didst not travail with child : for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife , saith the LORD .
54 : 12 And I will make thy windows of agates , and thy gates of carbuncles , and all thy borders of pleasant stones .
54 : 14 In righteousness shalt thou be established : thou shalt be far from oppression ; for thou shalt not fear : and from terror ; for it shall not come near thee .
55 : 3 Incline your ear , and come unto me : hear , and your soul shall live ; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you , even the sure mercies of David .
56 : 9 All ye beasts of the field , come to devour , yea , all ye beasts in the forest .
56 : 10 His watchmen are blind : they are all ignorant , they are all dumb dogs , they cannot bark ; sleeping , lying down , loving to slumber .
58 : 2 Yet they seek me daily , and delight to know my ways , as a nation that did righteousness , and forsook not the ordinance of their God : they ask of me the ordinances of justice ; they take delight in approaching to God .
58 : 3 Wherefore have we fasted , say they , and thou seest not ?
wilt thou call this a fast , and an acceptable day to the LORD ?
58 : 8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning , and thine health shall spring forth speedily : and thy righteousness shall go before thee ; the glory of the LORD shall be thy rereward .
59 : 5 They hatch cockatrice ' eggs , and weave the spider ' s web : he that eateth of their eggs dieth , and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper .
59 : 9 Therefore is judgment far from us , neither doth justice overtake us : we wait for light , but behold obscurity ; for brightness , but we walk in darkness .
60 : 3 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light , and kings to the brightness of thy rising .
60 : 11 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually ; they shall not be shut day nor night ; that men may bring unto thee the forces of the Gentiles , and that their kings may be brought .
60 : 13 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee , the fir tree , the pine tree , and the box together , to beautify the place of my sanctuary ; and I will make the place of my feet glorious .
60 : 14 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee ; and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet ; and they shall call thee ; The city of the LORD , The Zion of the Holy One of Israel .
62 : 6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls , O Jerusalem , which shall never hold their peace day nor night : ye that make mention of the LORD , keep not silence , 62 : 7 And give him no rest , till he establish , and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth .
this that is glorious in his apparel , travelling in the greatness of his strength ?
63 : 7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD , and the praises of the LORD , according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us , and the great goodness toward the house of Israel , which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies , and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses .
Return for thy servants ' sake , the tribes of thine inheritance .
65 : 6 Behold , it is written before me : I will not keep silence , but will recompense , even recompense into their bosom , 65 : 7 Your iniquities , and the iniquities of your fathers together , saith the LORD , which have burned incense upon the mountains , and blasphemed me upon the hills : therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom .
65 : 8 Thus saith the LORD , As the new wine is found in the cluster , and one saith , Destroy it not ; for a blessing is in it : so will I do for my servants ' sakes , that I may not destroy them all .
65 : 9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob , and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains : and mine elect shall inherit it , and my servants shall dwell there .
65 : 17 For , behold , I create new heavens and a new earth : and the former shall not be remembered , nor come into mind .
65 : 19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem , and joy in my people : and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her , nor the voice of crying .
Yea , they have chosen their own ways , and their soul delighteth in their abominations .
66 : 5 Hear the word of the LORD , ye that tremble at his word ; Your brethren that hated you , that cast you out for my name ' s sake , said , Let the LORD be glorified : but he shall appear to your joy , and they shall be ashamed .
Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day ?
or shall a nation be born at once ?
for as soon as Zion travailed , she brought forth her children .
66 : 13 As one whom his mother comforteth , so will I comfort you ; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem .
66 : 15 For , behold , the LORD will come with fire , and with his chariots like a whirlwind , to render his anger with fury , and his rebuke with flames of fire .
66 : 18 For I know their works and their thoughts : it shall come , that I will gather all nations and tongues ; and they shall come , and see my glory .
behold , I cannot speak : for I am a child .
1 : 9 Then the LORD put forth his hand , and touched my mouth .
1 : 10 See , I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms , to root out , and to pull down , and to destroy , and to throw down , to build , and to plant .
And I said , I see a rod of an almond tree .
2 : 11 Hath a nation changed their gods , which are yet no gods ?
2 : 19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee , and thy backslidings shall reprove thee : know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter , that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God , and that my fear is not in thee , saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
2 : 20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke , and burst thy bands ; and thou saidst , I will not transgress ; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest , playing the harlot .
2 : 23 How canst thou say , I am not polluted , I have not gone after Baalim ?
2 : 28 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee ?
let them arise , if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble : for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods , O Judah .
yet my people have forgotten me days without number .
thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt , as thou wast ashamed of Assyria .
3 : 12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north , and say , Return , thou backsliding Israel , saith the LORD ; and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you : for I am merciful , saith the LORD , and I will not keep anger for ever .
3 : 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD ; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it , to the name of the LORD , to Jerusalem : neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart .
Behold , we come unto thee ; for thou art the LORD our God .
3 : 24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth ; their flocks and their herds , their sons and their daughters .
4 : 8 For this gird you with sackcloth , lament and howl : for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us .
4 : 14 O Jerusalem , wash thine heart from wickedness , that thou mayest be saved .
4 : 21 How long shall I see the standard , and hear the sound of the trumpet ?
4 : 27 For thus hath the LORD said , The whole land shall be desolate ; yet will I not make a full end .
4 : 29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen ; they shall go into thickets , and climb up upon the rocks : every city shall be forsaken , and not a man dwell therein .
5 : 9 Shall I not visit for these things ?
5 : 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me , saith the LORD .
5 : 14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts , Because ye speak this word , behold , I will make my words in thy mouth fire , and this people wood , and it shall devour them .
5 : 18 Nevertheless in those days , saith the LORD , I will not make a full end with you .
5 : 25 Your iniquities have turned away these things , and your sins have withholden good things from you .
saith the LORD : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
6 : 16 Thus saith the LORD , Stand ye in the ways , and see , and ask for the old paths , where is the good way , and walk therein , and ye shall find rest for your souls .
6 : 25 Go not forth into the field , nor walk by the way ; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side .
7 : 8 Behold , ye trust in lying words , that cannot profit .
7 : 9 Will ye steal , murder , and commit adultery , and swear falsely , and burn incense unto Baal , and walk after other gods whom ye know not ; 7 : 10 And come and stand before me in this house , which is called by my name , and say , We are delivered to do all these abominations ?
7 : 18 The children gather wood , and the fathers kindle the fire , and the women knead their dough , to make cakes to the queen of heaven , and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods , that they may provoke me to anger .
saith the LORD : do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces ?
7 : 21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices , and eat flesh .
7 : 24 But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear , but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart , and went backward , and not forward .
7 : 27 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them ; but they will not hearken to thee : thou shalt also call unto them ; but they will not answer thee .
8 : 5 Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding ?
8 : 6 I hearkened and heard , but they spake not aright : no man repented him of his wickedness , saying , What have I done ?
8 : 18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow , my heart is faint in me .
8 : 21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt ; I am black ; astonishment hath taken hold on me .
saith the LORD : shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this ?
9 : 11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps , and a den of dragons ; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate , without an inhabitant .
we are greatly confounded , because we have forsaken the land , because our dwellings have cast us out .
10 : 4 They deck it with silver and with gold ; they fasten it with nails and with hammers , that it move not .
10 : 7 Who would not fear thee , O King of nations ?
10 : 10 But the LORD is the true God , he is the living God , and an everlasting king : at his wrath the earth shall tremble , and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation .
10 : 11 Thus shall ye say unto them , The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth , even they shall perish from the earth , and from under these heavens .
10 : 12 He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion .
10 : 16 The portion of Jacob is not like them : for he is the former of all things ; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : The LORD of hosts is his name .
10 : 18 For thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once , and will distress them , that they may find it so .
my wound is grievous ; but I said , Truly this is a grief , and I must bear it .
10 : 20 My tabernacle is spoiled , and all my cords are broken : my children are gone forth of me , and they are not : there is none to stretch forth my tent any more , and to set up my curtains .
12 : 5 If thou hast run with the footmen , and they have wearied thee , then how canst thou contend with horses ?
and if in the land of peace , wherein thou trustedst , they wearied thee , then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan ?
13 : 8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 13 : 9 Thus saith the LORD , After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah , and the great pride of Jerusalem .
13 : 12 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word ; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Every bottle shall be filled with wine : and they shall say unto thee , Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine ?
13 : 17 But if ye will not hear it , my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride ; and mine eye shall weep sore , and run down with tears , because the LORD ' s flock is carried away captive .
13 : 19 The cities of the south shall be shut up , and none shall open them : Judah shall be carried away captive all of it , it shall be wholly carried away captive .
then may ye also do good , that are accustomed to do evil .
yet thou , O LORD , art in the midst of us , and we are called by thy name ; leave us not .
14 : 11 Then said the LORD unto me , Pray not for this people for their good .
and if I enter into the city , then behold them that are sick with famine !
or can the heavens give showers ?
15 : 4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth , because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah , for that which he did in Jerusalem .
or who shall bemoan thee ?
15 : 12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel ?
16 : 8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting , to sit with them to eat and to drink .
17 : 11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs , and hatcheth them not ; so he that getteth riches , and not by right , shall leave them in the midst of his days , and at his end shall be a fool .
17 : 12 A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary .
18 : 15 Because my people hath forgotten me , they have burned incense to vanity , and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths , to walk in paths , in a way not cast up ; 18 : 16 To make their land desolate , and a perpetual hissing ; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished , and wag his head .
for they have digged a pit for my soul .
19 : 10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee , 19 : 11 And shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Even so will I break this people and this city , as one breaketh a potter ' s vessel , that cannot be made whole again : and they shall bury them in Tophet , till there be no place to bury .
20 : 8 For since I spake , I cried out , I cried violence and spoil ; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me , and a derision , daily .
Report , say they , and we will report it .
All my familiars watched for my halting , saying , Peradventure he will be enticed , and we shall prevail against him , and we shall take our revenge on him .
22 : 10 Weep ye not for the dead , neither bemoan him : but weep sore for him that goeth away : for he shall return no more , nor see his native country .
22 : 20 Go up to Lebanon , and cry ; and lift up thy voice in Bashan , and cry from the passages : for all thy lovers are destroyed .
22 : 29 O earth , earth , earth , hear the word of the LORD .
23 : 4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them : and they shall fear no more , nor be dismayed , neither shall they be lacking , saith the LORD .
23 : 14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing : they commit adultery , and walk in lies : they strengthen also the hands of evildoers , that none doth return from his wickedness ; they are all of them unto me as Sodom , and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah .
23 : 26 How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies ?
yea , they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart ; 23 : 27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour , as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal .
thou shalt then say unto them , What burden ?
23 : 38 But since ye say , The burden of the LORD ; therefore thus saith the LORD ; Because ye say this word , The burden of the LORD , and I have sent unto you , saying , Ye shall not say , The burden of the LORD ; 23 : 39 Therefore , behold , I , even I , will utterly forget you , and I will forsake you , and the city that I gave you and your fathers , and cast you out of my presence : 23 : 40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you , and a perpetual shame , which shall not be forgotten .
24 : 8 And as the evil figs , which cannot be eaten , they are so evil ; surely thus saith the LORD , So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah , and his princes , and the residue of Jerusalem , that remain in this land , and them that dwell in the land of Egypt : 24 : 9 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt , to be a reproach and a proverb , a taunt and a curse , in all places whither I shall drive them .
25 : 5 They said , Turn ye again now every one from his evil way , and from the evil of your doings , and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever : 25 : 6 And go not after other gods to serve them , and to worship them , and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands ; and I will do you no hurt .
26 : 4 And thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD ; If ye will not hearken to me , to walk in my law , which I have set before you , 26 : 5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets , whom I sent unto you , both rising up early , and sending them , but ye have not hearkened ; 26 : 6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh , and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth .
26 : 16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets ; This man is not worthy to die : for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God .
26 : 20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD , Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjathjearim , who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah .
27 : 7 And all nations shall serve him , and his son , and his son ' s son , until the very time of his land come : and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him .
28 : 7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears , and in the ears of all the people ; 28 : 8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries , and against great kingdoms , of war , and of evil , and of pestilence .
28 : 15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet , Hear now , Hananiah ; The LORD hath not sent thee ; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie .
28 : 17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month .
29 : 24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite , saying , 29 : 25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , saying , Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at Jerusalem , and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest , and to all the priests , saying , 29 : 26 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest , that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD , for every man that is mad , and maketh himself a prophet , that thou shouldest put him in prison , and in the stocks .
29 : 28 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon , saying , This captivity is long : build ye houses , and dwell in them ; and plant gardens , and eat the fruit of them .
30 : 11 For I am with thee , saith the LORD , to save thee : though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee , yet I will not make a full end of thee : but I will correct thee in measure , and will not leave thee altogether unpunished .
30 : 18 Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will bring again the captivity of Jacob ' s tents , and have mercy on his dwellingplaces ; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap , and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof .
32 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar .
32 : 9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle ' s son , that was in Anathoth , and weighed him the money , even seventeen shekels of silver .
32 : 16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah , I prayed unto the LORD , saying , 32 : 17 Ah Lord GOD !
32 : 36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning this city , whereof ye say , It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword , and by the famine , and by the pestilence ; 32 : 37 Behold , I will gather them out of all countries , whither I have driven them in mine anger , and in my fury , and in great wrath ; and I will bring them again unto this place , and I will cause them to dwell safely : 32 : 38 And they shall be my people , and I will be their God : 32 : 39 And I will give them one heart , and one way , that they may fear me for ever , for the good of them , and of their children after them : 32 : 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them , that I will not turn away from them , to do them good ; but I will put my fear in their hearts , that they shall not depart from me .
33 : 6 Behold , I will bring it health and cure , and I will cure them , and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth .
33 : 14 Behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will perform that good thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of Judah .
35 : 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , saying , 35 : 2 Go unto the house of the Rechabites , and speak unto them , and bring them into the house of the LORD , into one of the chambers , and give them wine to drink .
35 : 12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah , saying , 35 : 13 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem , Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words ?
36 : 1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 36 : 2 Take thee a roll of a book , and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel , and against Judah , and against all the nations , from the day I spake unto thee , from the days of Josiah , even unto this day .
36 : 8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him , reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD ' s house .
36 : 9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , in the ninth month , that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem , and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem .
36 : 13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard , when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people .
So Baruch read it in their ears .
And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king , and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king .
38 : 6 Then took they Jeremiah , and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech , that was in the court of the prison : and they let down Jeremiah with cords .
And in the dungeon there was no water , but mire : so Jeremiah sunk in the mire .
38 : 15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah , If I declare it unto thee , wilt thou not surely put me to death ?
38 : 27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah , and asked him : and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded .
So they left off speaking with him ; for the matter was not perceived .
39 : 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah , in the tenth month , came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem , and they besieged it .
39 : 8 And the Chaldeans burned the king ' s house , and the houses of the people , with fire , and brake down the walls of Jerusalem .
39 : 15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah , while he was shut up in the court of the prison , saying , 39 : 16 Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will bring my words upon this city for evil , and not for good ; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee .
If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon , come ; and I will look well unto thee : but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon , forbear : behold , all the land is before thee : whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go , thither go .
40 : 11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab , and among the Ammonites , and in Edom , and that were in all the countries , heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah , and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan ; 40 : 12 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven , and came to the land of Judah , to Gedaliah , unto Mizpah , and gathered wine and summer fruits very much .
40 : 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly saying , Let me go , I pray thee , and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah , and no man shall know it : wherefore should he slay thee , that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered , and the remnant in Judah perish ?
41 : 7 And it was so , when they came into the midst of the city , that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them , and cast them into the midst of the pit , he , and the men that were with him .
41 : 8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael , Slay us not : for we have treasures in the field , of wheat , and of barley , and of oil , and of honey .
42 : 6 Whether it be good , or whether it be evil , we will obey the voice of the LORD our God , to whom we send thee ; that it may be well with us , when we obey the voice of the LORD our God .
42 : 12 And I will shew mercies unto you , that he may have mercy upon you , and cause you to return to your own land .
42 : 17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there ; they shall die by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them .
44 : 13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt , as I have punished Jerusalem , by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence : 44 : 14 So that none of the remnant of Judah , which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall escape or remain , that they should return into the land of Judah , to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there : for none shall return but such as shall escape .
44 : 15 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods , and all the women that stood by , a great multitude , even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt , in Pathros , answered Jeremiah , saying , 44 : 16 As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD , we will not hearken unto thee .
46 : 4 Harness the horses ; and get up , ye horsemen , and stand forth with your helmets ; furbish the spears , and put on the brigandines .
46 : 10 For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts , a day of vengeance , that he may avenge him of his adversaries : and the sword shall devour , and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood : for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates .
46 : 19 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt , furnish thyself to go into captivity : for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant .
48 : 8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city , and no city shall escape : the valley also shall perish , and the plain shall be destroyed , as the LORD hath spoken .
48 : 13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh , as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence .
48 : 28 O ye that dwell in Moab , leave the cities , and dwell in the rock , and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole ' s mouth .
48 : 39 They shall howl , saying , How is it broken down !
how hath Moab turned the back with shame !
48 : 41 Kerioth is taken , and the strong holds are surprised , and the mighty men ' s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs .
49 : 1 Concerning the Ammonites , thus saith the LORD ; Hath Israel no sons ?
hath he no heir ?
49 : 2 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites ; and it shall be a desolate heap , and her daughters shall be burned with fire : then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs , saith the LORD .
that trusted in her treasures , saying , Who shall come unto me ?
49 : 6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon , saith the LORD .
49 : 13 For I have sworn by myself , saith the LORD , that Bozrah shall become a desolation , a reproach , a waste , and a curse ; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes .
49 : 15 For , lo , I will make thee small among the heathen , and despised among men .
Hamath is confounded , and Arpad : for they have heard evil tidings : they are fainthearted ; there is sorrow on the sea ; it cannot be quiet .
49 : 31 Arise , get you up unto the wealthy nation , that dwelleth without care , saith the LORD , which have neither gates nor bars , which dwell alone .
50 : 8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon , and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans , and be as the he goats before the flocks .
50 : 18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Behold , I will punish the king of Babylon and his land , as I have punished the king of Assyria .
50 : 20 In those days , and in that time , saith the LORD , the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for , and there shall be none ; and the sins of Judah , and they shall not be found : for I will pardon them whom I reserve .
50 : 25 The LORD hath opened his armoury , and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation : for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans .
50 : 36 A sword is upon the liars ; and they shall dote : a sword is upon her mighty men ; and they shall be dismayed .
50 : 37 A sword is upon their horses , and upon their chariots , and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her ; and they shall become as women : a sword is upon her treasures ; and they shall be robbed .
51 : 8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed : howl for her ; take balm for her pain , if so be she may be healed .
51 : 13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters , abundant in treasures , thine end is come , and the measure of thy covetousness .
51 : 15 He hath made the earth by his power , he hath established the world by his wisdom , and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding .
51 : 28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes , the captains thereof , and all the rulers thereof , and all the land of his dominion .
51 : 37 And Babylon shall become heaps , a dwellingplace for dragons , an astonishment , and an hissing , without an inhabitant .
51 : 39 In their heat I will make their feasts , and I will make them drunken , that they may rejoice , and sleep a perpetual sleep , and not wake , saith the LORD .
51 : 41 How is Sheshach taken !
51 : 59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah , the son of Maaseiah , when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign .
And this Seraiah was a quiet prince .
51 : 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah , When thou comest to Babylon , and shalt see , and shalt read all these words ; 51 : 62 Then shalt thou say , O LORD , thou hast spoken against this place , to cut it off , that none shall remain in it , neither man nor beast , but that it shall be desolate for ever .
52 : 7 Then the city was broken up , and all the men of war fled , and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls , which was by the king ' s garden ; ( now the Chaldeans were by the city round about :) and they went by the way of the plain .
52 : 22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it ; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits , with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about , all of brass .
The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these .
52 : 24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest , and Zephaniah the second priest , and the three keepers of the door : 52 : 25 He took also out of the city an eunuch , which had the charge of the men of war ; and seven men of them that were near the king ' s person , which were found in the city ; and the principal scribe of the host , who mustered the people of the land ; and threescore men of the people of the land , that were found in the midst of the city .
52 : 27 And the king of Babylon smote them , and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath .
how is she become as a widow !
1 : 3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction , and because of great servitude : she dwelleth among the heathen , she findeth no rest : all her persecutors overtook her between the straits .
1 : 17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands , and there is none to comfort her : the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob , that his adversaries should be round about him : Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them .
1 : 18 The LORD is righteous ; for I have rebelled against his commandment : hear , I pray you , all people , and behold my sorrow : my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity .
2 : 6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle , as if it were of a garden : he hath destroyed his places of the assembly : the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion , and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest .
2 : 10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground , and keep silence : they have cast up dust upon their heads ; they have girded themselves with sackcloth : the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground .
2 : 11 Mine eyes do fail with tears , my bowels are troubled , my liver is poured upon the earth , for the destruction of the daughter of my people ; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city .
2 : 14 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee : and they have not discovered thine iniquity , to turn away thy captivity ; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment .
2 : 17 The LORD hath done that which he had devised ; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old : he hath thrown down , and hath not pitied : and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee , he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries .
3 : 3 Surely against me is he turned ; he turneth his hand against me all the day .
3 : 5 He hath builded against me , and compassed me with gall and travail .
3 : 16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones , he hath covered me with ashes .
3 : 18 And I said , My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD : 3 : 19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery , the wormwood and the gall .
3 : 27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth .
3 : 34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth .
3 : 35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High , 3 : 36 To subvert a man in his cause , the LORD approveth not .
3 : 42 We have transgressed and have rebelled : thou hast not pardoned .
3 : 43 Thou hast covered with anger , and persecuted us : thou hast slain , thou hast not pitied .
3 : 45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people .
3 : 58 O LORD , thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul ; thou hast redeemed my life .
4 : 13 For the sins of her prophets , and the iniquities of her priests , that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her , 4 : 14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets , they have polluted themselves with blood , so that men could not touch their garments .
4 : 15 They cried unto them , Depart ye ; it is unclean ; depart , depart , touch not : when they fled away and wandered , they said among the heathen , They shall no more sojourn there .
5 : 22 But thou hast utterly rejected us ; thou art very wroth against us .
1 : 5 Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures .
1 : 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain , so was the appearance of the brightness round about .
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD .
3 : 1 Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , eat that thou findest ; eat this roll , and go speak unto the house of Israel .
3 : 2 So I opened my mouth , and he caused me to eat that roll .
Then did I eat it ; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness .
Surely , had I sent thee to them , they would have hearkened unto thee .
3 : 7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee ; for they will not hearken unto me : for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted .
3 : 10 Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart , and hear with thine ears .
3 : 13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another , and the noise of the wheels over against them , and a noise of a great rushing .
5 : 4 Then take of them again , and cast them into the midst of the fire , and burn them in the fire ; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel .
5 : 9 And I will do in thee that which I have not done , and whereunto I will not do any more the like , because of all thine abominations .
I the LORD have spoken it .
6 : 12 He that is far off shall die of the pestilence ; and he that is near shall fall by the sword ; and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine : thus will I accomplish my fury upon them .
6 : 14 So will I stretch out my hand upon them , and make the land desolate , yea , more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath , in all their habitations : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
7 : 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 7 : 2 Also , thou son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel ; An end , the end is come upon the four corners of the land .
7 : 4 And mine eye shall not spare thee , neither will I have pity : but I will recompense thy ways upon thee , and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
7 : 7 The morning is come unto thee , O thou that dwellest in the land : the time is come , the day of trouble is near , and not the sounding again of the mountains .
7 : 18 They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth , and horror shall cover them ; and shame shall be upon all faces , and baldness upon all their heads .
7 : 21 And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey , and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil ; and they shall pollute it .
7 : 27 The king shall mourn , and the prince shall be clothed with desolation , and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled : I will do unto them after their way , and according to their deserts will I judge them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
8 : 10 So I went in and saw ; and behold every form of creeping things , and abominable beasts , and all the idols of the house of Israel , pourtrayed upon the wall round about .
And he went in in my sight .
10 : 4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub , and stood over the threshold of the house ; and the house was filled with the cloud , and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD ' s glory .
10 : 9 And when I looked , behold the four wheels by the cherubims , one wheel by one cherub , and another wheel by another cherub : and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone .
10 : 21 Every one had four faces apiece , and every one four wings ; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings .
Then fell I down upon my face , and cried with a loud voice , and said , Ah Lord GOD !
11 : 24 Afterwards the spirit took me up , and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea , to them of the captivity .
So the vision that I had seen went up from me .
12 : 11 Say , I am your sign : like as I have done , so shall it be done unto them : they shall remove and go into captivity .
12 : 23 Tell them therefore , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will make this proverb to cease , and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel ; but say unto them , The days are at hand , and the effect of every vision .
12 : 26 Again the word of the LORD came to me , saying .
13 : 4 O Israel , thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts .
Will ye hunt the souls of my people , and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you ?
13 : 19 And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread , to slay the souls that should not die , and to save the souls alive that should not live , by your lying to my people that hear your lies ?
14 : 7 For every one of the house of Israel , or of the stranger that sojourneth in Israel , which separateth himself from me , and setteth up his idols in his heart , and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face , and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me ; I the LORD will answer him by myself : 14 : 8 And I will set my face against that man , and will make him a sign and a proverb , and I will cut him off from the midst of my people ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
14 : 17 Or if I bring a sword upon that land , and say , Sword , go through the land ; so that I cut off man and beast from it : 14 : 18 Though these three men were in it , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters , but they only shall be delivered themselves .
14 : 19 Or if I send a pestilence into that land , and pour out my fury upon it in blood , to cut off from it man and beast : 14 : 20 Though Noah , Daniel , and Job were in it , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , they shall deliver neither son nor daughter ; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness .
14 : 21 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem , the sword , and the famine , and the noisome beast , and the pestilence , to cut off from it man and beast ?
14 : 22 Yet , behold , therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth , both sons and daughters : behold , they shall come forth unto you , and ye shall see their way and their doings : and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem , even concerning all that I have brought upon it .
15 : 5 Behold , when it was whole , it was meet for no work : how much less shall it be meet yet for any work , when the fire hath devoured it , and it is burned ?
16 : 7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field , and thou hast increased and waxen great , and thou art come to excellent ornaments : thy breasts are fashioned , and thine hair is grown , whereas thou wast naked and bare .
16 : 11 I decked thee also with ornaments , and I put bracelets upon thy hands , and a chain on thy neck .
16 : 19 My meat also which I gave thee , fine flour , and oil , and honey , wherewith I fed thee , thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour : and thus it was , saith the Lord GOD .
16 : 22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth , when thou wast naked and bare , and wast polluted in thy blood .
16 : 25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way , and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred , and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by , and multiplied thy whoredoms .
16 : 41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire , and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women : and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot , and thou also shalt give no hire any more .
16 : 44 Behold , every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee , saying , As is the mother , so is her daughter .
16 : 45 Thou art thy mother ' s daughter , that lotheth her husband and her children ; and thou art the sister of thy sisters , which lothed their husbands and their children : your mother was an Hittite , and your father an Amorite .
16 : 47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways , nor done after their abominations : but , as if that were a very little thing , thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways .
16 : 48 As I live , saith the Lord GOD , Sodom thy sister hath not done , she nor her daughters , as thou hast done , thou and thy daughters .
16 : 51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins ; but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they , and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done .
16 : 56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride , 16 : 57 Before thy wickedness was discovered , as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of Syria , and all that are round about her , the daughters of the Philistines , which despise thee round about .
16 : 62 And I will establish my covenant with thee ; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD : 16 : 63 That thou mayest remember , and be confounded , and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame , when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done , saith the Lord GOD .
shall he escape that doeth such things ?
18 : 1 The word of the LORD came unto me again , saying , 18 : 2 What mean ye , that ye use this proverb concerning the land of Israel , saying , The fathers have eaten sour grapes , and the children ' s teeth are set on edge ?
18 : 4 Behold , all souls are mine ; as the soul of the father , so also the soul of the son is mine : the soul that sinneth , it shall die .
18 : 20 The soul that sinneth , it shall die .
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned : in his trespass that he hath trespassed , and in his sin that he hath sinned , in them shall he die .
18 : 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth , saith the Lord GOD : wherefore turn yourselves , and live ye .
19 : 1 Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel , 19 : 2 And say , What is thy mother ?
19 : 9 And they put him in ward in chains , and brought him to the king of Babylon : they brought him into holds , that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel .
19 : 13 And now she is planted in the wilderness , in a dry and thirsty ground .
19 : 14 And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches , which hath devoured her fruit , so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule .
20 : 4 Wilt thou judge them , son of man , wilt thou judge them ?
20 : 42 And ye shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall bring you into the land of Israel , into the country for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers .
it contemneth the rod of my son , as every tree .
21 : 11 And he hath given it to be furbished , that it may be handled : this sword is sharpened , and it is furbished , to give it into the hand of the slayer .
21 : 20 Appoint a way , that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites , and to Judah in Jerusalem the defenced .
21 : 28 And thou , son of man , prophesy and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites , and concerning their reproach ; even say thou , The sword , the sword is drawn : for the slaughter it is furbished , to consume because of the glittering : 21 : 29 Whiles they see vanity unto thee , whiles they divine a lie unto thee , to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain , of the wicked , whose day is come , when their iniquity shall have an end .
22 : 4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed ; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made ; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near , and art come even unto thy years : therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen , and a mocking to all countries .
22 : 6 Behold , the princes of Israel , every one were in thee to their power to shed blood .
I the LORD have spoken it , and will do it .
22 : 16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen , and thou shalt know that I am the LORD .
22 : 17 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 22 : 18 Son of man , the house of Israel is to me become dross : all they are brass , and tin , and iron , and lead , in the midst of the furnace ; they are even the dross of silver .
22 : 29 The people of the land have used oppression , and exercised robbery , and have vexed the poor and needy : yea , they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully .
23 : 7 Thus she committed her whoredoms with them , with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria , and with all on whom she doted : with all their idols she defiled herself .
23 : 8 Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt : for in her youth they lay with her , and they bruised the breasts of her virginity , and poured their whoredom upon her .
23 : 20 For she doted upon their paramours , whose flesh is as the flesh of asses , and whose issue is like the issue of horses .
23 : 27 Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee , and thy whoredom brought from the land of Egypt : so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them , nor remember Egypt any more .
23 : 43 Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries , Will they now commit whoredoms with her , and she with them ?
23 : 45 And the righteous men , they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses , and after the manner of women that shed blood ; because they are adulteresses , and blood is in their hands .
24 : 20 Then I answered them , The word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 24 : 21 Speak unto the house of Israel , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will profane my sanctuary , the excellency of your strength , the desire of your eyes , and that which your soul pitieth ; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword .
24 : 24 Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign : according to all that he hath done shall ye do : and when this cometh , ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD .
24 : 27 In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped , and thou shalt speak , and be no more dumb : and thou shalt be a sign unto them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
25 : 5 And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels , and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
25 : 17 And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes ; and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall lay my vengeance upon them .
27 : 9 The ancients of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers : all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise .
27 : 16 Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making : they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds , purple , and broidered work , and fine linen , and coral , and agate .
27 : 18 Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making , for the multitude of all riches ; in the wine of Helbon , and white wool .
27 : 21 Arabia , and all the princes of Kedar , they occupied with thee in lambs , and rams , and goats : in these were they thy merchants .
27 : 27 Thy riches , and thy fairs , thy merchandise , thy mariners , and thy pilots , thy calkers , and the occupiers of thy merchandise , and all thy men of war , that are in thee , and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee , shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin .
27 : 33 When thy wares went forth out of the seas , thou filledst many people ; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise .
28 : 1 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 28 : 2 Son of man , say unto the prince of Tyrus , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thine heart is lifted up , and thou hast said , I am a God , I sit in the seat of God , in the midst of the seas ; yet thou art a man , and not God , though thou set thine heart as the heart of God : 28 : 3 Behold , thou art wiser than Daniel ; there is no secret that they can hide from thee : 28 : 4 With thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches , and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures : 28 : 5 By thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches , and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches : 28 : 6 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God ; 28 : 7 Behold , therefore I will bring strangers upon thee , the terrible of the nations : and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom , and they shall defile thy brightness .
28 : 9 Wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee , I am God ?
28 : 18 Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities , by the iniquity of thy traffick ; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee , it shall devour thee , and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee .
28 : 20 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 28 : 21 Son of man , set thy face against Zidon , and prophesy against it , 28 : 22 And say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , O Zidon ; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee : and they shall know that I am the LORD , when I shall have executed judgments in her , and shall be sanctified in her .
28 : 23 For I will send into her pestilence , and blood into her streets ; and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
29 : 1 In the tenth year , in the tenth month , in the twelfth day of the month , the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 29 : 2 Son of man , set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt , and prophesy against him , and against all Egypt : 29 : 3 Speak , and say , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I am against thee , Pharaoh king of Egypt , the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers , which hath said , My river is mine own , and I have made it for myself .
29 : 4 But I will put hooks in thy jaws , and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales , and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers , and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales .
29 : 21 In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth , and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
31 : 1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year , in the third month , in the first day of the month , that the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 31 : 2 Son of man , speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt , and to his multitude ; Whom art thou like in thy greatness ?
31 : 3 Behold , the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches , and with a shadowing shroud , and of an high stature ; and his top was among the thick boughs .
31 : 10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height , and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs , and his heart is lifted up in his height ; 31 : 11 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen ; he shall surely deal with him : I have driven him out for his wickedness .
31 : 12 And strangers , the terrible of the nations , have cut him off , and have left him : upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen , and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land ; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow , and have left him .
32 : 20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword : she is delivered to the sword : draw her and all her multitudes .
32 : 25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword : though their terror was caused in the land of the living , yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit : he is put in the midst of them that be slain .
32 : 26 There is Meshech , Tubal , and all her multitude : her graves are round about him : all of them uncircumcised , slain by the sword , though they caused their terror in the land of the living .
33 : 7 So thou , O son of man , I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel ; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth , and warn them from me .
33 : 9 Nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it ; if he do not turn from his way , he shall die in his iniquity ; but thou hast delivered thy soul .
33 : 21 And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity , in the tenth month , in the fifth day of the month , that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me , saying , The city is smitten .
34 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 34 : 2 Son of man , prophesy against the shepherds of Israel , prophesy , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds ; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves !
34 : 12 As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered ; so will I seek out my sheep , and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day .
34 : 14 I will feed them in a good pasture , and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be : there shall they lie in a good fold , and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel .
34 : 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them ; Behold , I , even I , will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle .
35 : 9 I will make thee perpetual desolations , and thy cities shall not return : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
36 : 12 Yea , I will cause men to walk upon you , even my people Israel ; and they shall possess thee , and thou shalt be their inheritance , and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men .
36 : 18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land , and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it : 36 : 19 And I scattered them among the heathen , and they were dispersed through the countries : according to their way and according to their doings I judged them .
36 : 26 A new heart also will I give you , and a new spirit will I put within you : and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh , and I will give you an heart of flesh .
36 : 38 As the holy flock , as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts ; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men : and they shall know that I am the LORD .
37 : 5 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones ; Behold , I will cause breath to enter into you , and ye shall live : 37 : 6 And I will lay sinews upon you , and will bring up flesh upon you , and cover you with skin , and put breath in you , and ye shall live ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
37 : 19 Say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will take the stick of Joseph , which is in the hand of Ephraim , and the tribes of Israel his fellows , and will put them with him , even with the stick of Judah , and make them one stick , and they shall be one in mine hand .
hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey ?
39 : 15 And the passengers that pass through the land , when any seeth a man ' s bone , then shall he set up a sign by it , till the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog .
39 : 22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God from that day and forward .
39 : 24 According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have I done unto them , and hid my face from them .
40 : 1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity , in the beginning of the year , in the tenth day of the month , in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten , in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me , and brought me thither .
40 : 24 After that he brought me toward the south , and behold a gate toward the south : and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures .
40 : 26 And there were seven steps to go up to it , and the arches thereof were before them : and it had palm trees , one on this side , and another on that side , upon the posts thereof .
40 : 28 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate : and he measured the south gate according to these measures ; 40 : 29 And the little chambers thereof , and the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , according to these measures : and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about : it was fifty cubits long , and five and twenty cubits broad .
40 : 40 And at the side without , as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate , were two tables ; and on the other side , which was at the porch of the gate , were two tables .
40 : 49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits , and the breadth eleven cubits , and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it : and there were pillars by the posts , one on this side , and another on that side .
41 : 1 Afterward he brought me to the temple , and measured the posts , six cubits broad on the one side , and six cubits broad on the other side , which was the breadth of the tabernacle .
41 : 6 And the side chambers were three , one over another , and thirty in order ; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about , that they might have hold , but they had not hold in the wall of the house .
41 : 8 I saw also the height of the house round about : the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits .
41 : 9 The thickness of the wall , which was for the side chamber without , was five cubits : and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within .
41 : 10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side .
41 : 13 So he measured the house , an hundred cubits long ; and the separate place , and the building , with the walls thereof , an hundred cubits long ; 41 : 14 Also the breadth of the face of the house , and of the separate place toward the east , an hundred cubits .
41 : 21 The posts of the temple were squared , and the face of the sanctuary ; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other .
42 : 2 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door , and the breadth was fifty cubits .
42 : 5 Now the upper chambers were shorter : for the galleries were higher than these , than the lower , and than the middlemost of the building .
42 : 10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east , over against the separate place , and over against the building .
42 : 16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
42 : 17 He measured the north side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed round about .
43 : 1 Afterward he brought me to the gate , even the gate that looketh toward the east : 43 : 2 And , behold , the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east : and his voice was like a noise of many waters : and the earth shined with his glory .
43 : 3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw , even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city : and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar ; and I fell upon my face .
43 : 7 And he said unto me , Son of man , the place of my throne , and the place of the soles of my feet , where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever , and my holy name , shall the house of Israel no more defile , neither they , nor their kings , by their whoredom , nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places .
43 : 13 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits : The cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth ; even the bottom shall be a cubit , and the breadth a cubit , and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about shall be a span : and this shall be the higher place of the altar .
43 : 18 And he said unto me , Son of man , thus saith the Lord GOD ; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it , to offer burnt offerings thereon , and to sprinkle blood thereon .
43 : 27 And when these days are expired , it shall be , that upon the eighth day , and so forward , the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar , and your peace offerings ; and I will accept you , saith the Lord GOD .
44 : 5 And the LORD said unto me , Son of man , mark well , and behold with thine eyes , and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD , and all the laws thereof ; and mark well the entering in of the house , with every going forth of the sanctuary .
44 : 15 But the priests the Levites , the sons of Zadok , that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me , they shall come near to me to minister unto me , and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood , saith the Lord GOD : 44 : 16 They shall enter into my sanctuary , and they shall come near to my table , to minister unto me , and they shall keep my charge .
44 : 19 And when they go forth into the utter court , even into the utter court to the people , they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered , and lay them in the holy chambers , and they shall put on other garments ; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments .
44 : 26 And after he is cleansed , they shall reckon unto him seven days .
45 : 7 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion , and of the possession of the city , before the oblation of the holy portion , and before the possession of the city , from the west side westward , and from the east side eastward : and the length shall be over against one of the portions , from the west border unto the east border .
45 : 17 And it shall be the prince ' s part to give burnt offerings , and meat offerings , and drink offerings , in the feasts , and in the new moons , and in the sabbaths , in all solemnities of the house of Israel : he shall prepare the sin offering , and the meat offering , and the burnt offering , and the peace offerings , to make reconciliation for the house of Israel .
45 : 18 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; In the first month , in the first day of the month , thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish , and cleanse the sanctuary : 45 : 19 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering , and put it upon the posts of the house , and upon the four corners of the settle of the altar , and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court .
45 : 22 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering .
46 : 3 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new moons .
46 : 9 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in the solemn feasts , he that entereth in by the way of the north gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate ; and he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of the north gate : he shall not return by the way of the gate whereby he came in , but shall go forth over against it .
46 : 11 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering shall be an ephah to a bullock , and an ephah to a ram , and to the lambs as he is able to give , and an hin of oil to an ephah .
46 : 12 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD , one shall then open him the gate that looketh toward the east , and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings , as he did on the sabbath day : then he shall go forth ; and after his going forth one shall shut the gate .
46 : 16 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons , the inheritance thereof shall be his sons '; it shall be their possession by inheritance .
46 : 19 After he brought me through the entry , which was at the side of the gate , into the holy chambers of the priests , which looked toward the north : and , behold , there was a place on the two sides westward .
47 : 4 Again he measured a thousand , and brought me through the waters ; the waters were to the knees .
47 : 10 And it shall come to pass , that the fishers shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim ; they shall be a place to spread forth nets ; their fish shall be according to their kinds , as the fish of the great sea , exceeding many .
And this is the north side .
47 : 18 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran , and from Damascus , and from Gilead , and from the land of Israel by Jordan , from the border unto the east sea .
47 : 19 And the south side southward , from Tamar even to the waters of strife in Kadesh , the river to the great sea .
48 : 10 And for them , even for the priests , shall be this holy oblation ; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length , and toward the west ten thousand in breadth , and toward the east ten thousand in breadth , and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length : and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof .
48 : 21 And the residue shall be for the prince , on the one side and on the other of the holy oblation , and of the possession of the city , over against the five and twenty thousand of the oblation toward the east border , and westward over against the five and twenty thousand toward the west border , over against the portions for the prince : and it shall be the holy oblation ; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof .
48 : 22 Moreover from the possession of the Levites , and from the possession of the city , being in the midst of that which is the prince ' s , between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin , shall be for the prince .
1 : 1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem , and besieged it .
1 : 6 Now among these were of the children of Judah , Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah : 1 : 7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names : for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar ; and to Hananiah , of Shadrach ; and to Mishael , of Meshach ; and to Azariah , of Abednego .
1 : 11 Then said Daniel to Melzar , whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel , Hananiah , Mishael , and Azariah , 1 : 12 Prove thy servants , I beseech thee , ten days ; and let them give us pulse to eat , and water to drink .
1 : 16 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat , and the wine that they should drink ; and gave them pulse .
1 : 17 As for these four children , God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom : and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams .
2 : 1 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams , wherewith his spirit was troubled , and his sleep brake from him .
2 : 5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans , The thing is gone from me : if ye will not make known unto me the dream , with the interpretation thereof , ye shall be cut in pieces , and your houses shall be made a dunghill .
2 : 14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king ' s guard , which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon : 2 : 15 He answered and said to Arioch the king ' s captain , Why is the decree so hasty from the king ?
2 : 27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king , and said , The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men , the astrologers , the magicians , the soothsayers , shew unto the king ; 2 : 28 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets , and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days .
2 : 35 Then was the iron , the clay , the brass , the silver , and the gold , broken to pieces together , and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors ; and the wind carried them away , that no place was found for them : and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain , and filled the whole earth .
2 : 36 This is the dream ; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king .
2 : 39 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee , and another third kingdom of brass , which shall bear rule over all the earth .
2 : 44 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom , which shall never be destroyed : and the kingdom shall not be left to other people , but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms , and it shall stand for ever .
2 : 45 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands , and that it brake in pieces the iron , the brass , the clay , the silver , and the gold ; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter : and the dream is certain , and the interpretation thereof sure .
2 : 47 The king answered unto Daniel , and said , Of a truth it is , that your God is a God of gods , and a Lord of kings , and a revealer of secrets , seeing thou couldest reveal this secret .
2 : 48 Then the king made Daniel a great man , and gave him many great gifts , and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon , and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon .
3 : 3 Then the princes , the governors , and captains , the judges , the treasurers , the counsellors , the sheriffs , and all the rulers of the provinces , were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up ; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up .
3 : 13 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
3 : 15 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet , flute , harp , sackbut , psaltery , and dulcimer , and all kinds of musick , ye fall down and worship the image which I have made ; well : but if ye worship not , ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace ; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands ?
3 : 22 Therefore because the king ' s commandment was urgent , and the furnace exceeding hot , the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego .
3 : 28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake , and said , Blessed be the God of Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , who hath sent his angel , and delivered his servants that trusted in him , and have changed the king ' s word , and yielded their bodies , that they might not serve nor worship any god , except their own God .
4 : 1 Nebuchadnezzar the king , unto all people , nations , and languages , that dwell in all the earth ; Peace be multiplied unto you .
4 : 2 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me .
his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and his dominion is from generation to generation .
4 : 7 Then came in the magicians , the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers : and I told the dream before them ; but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof .
4 : 13 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed , and , behold , a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven ; 4 : 14 He cried aloud , and said thus , Hew down the tree , and cut off his branches , shake off his leaves , and scatter his fruit : let the beasts get away from under it , and the fowls from his branches : 4 : 15 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth , even with a band of iron and brass , in the tender grass of the field ; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven , and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth : 4 : 16 Let his heart be changed from man ' s , and let a beast ' s heart be given unto him ; and let seven times pass over him .
4 : 18 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen .
4 : 30 The king spake , and said , Is not this great Babylon , that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power , and for the honour of my majesty ?
5 : 4 They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold , and of silver , of brass , of iron , of wood , and of stone .
5 : 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers , the Chaldeans , and the soothsayers .
5 : 26 This is the interpretation of the thing : MENE ; God hath numbered thy kingdom , and finished it .
5 : 27 TEKEL ; Thou art weighed in the balances , and art found wanting .
6 : 12 Then they came near , and spake before the king concerning the king ' s decree ; Hast thou not signed a decree , that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days , save of thee , O king , shall be cast into the den of lions ?
6 : 18 Then the king went to his palace , and passed the night fasting : neither were instruments of musick brought before him : and his sleep went from him .
7 : 3 And four great beasts came up from the sea , diverse one from another .
7 : 19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast , which was diverse from all the others , exceeding dreadful , whose teeth were of iron , and his nails of brass ; which devoured , brake in pieces , and stamped the residue with his feet ; 7 : 20 And of the ten horns that were in his head , and of the other which came up , and before whom three fell ; even of that horn that had eyes , and a mouth that spake very great things , whose look was more stout than his fellows .
8 : 19 And he said , Behold , I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation : for at the time appointed the end shall be .
10 : 8 Therefore I was left alone , and saw this great vision , and there remained no strength in me : for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption , and I retained no strength .
10 : 11 And he said unto me , O Daniel , a man greatly beloved , understand the words that I speak unto thee , and stand upright : for unto thee am I now sent .
10 : 13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days : but , lo , Michael , one of the chief princes , came to help me ; and I remained there with the kings of Persia .
10 : 16 And , behold , one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips : then I opened my mouth , and spake , and said unto him that stood before me , O my lord , by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me , and I have retained no strength .
10 : 17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord ?
11 : 12 And when he hath taken away the multitude , his heart shall be lifted up ; and he shall cast down many ten thousands : but he shall not be strengthened by it .
11 : 15 So the king of the north shall come , and cast up a mount , and take the most fenced cities : and the arms of the south shall not withstand , neither his chosen people , neither shall there be any strength to withstand .
11 : 21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person , to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom : but he shall come in peaceably , and obtain the kingdom by flatteries .
11 : 23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully : for he shall come up , and shall become strong with a small people .
11 : 28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches ; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant ; and he shall do exploits , and return to his own land .
11 : 32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries : but the people that do know their God shall be strong , and do exploits .
11 : 33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many : yet they shall fall by the sword , and by flame , by captivity , and by spoil , many days .
11 : 39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god , whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory : and he shall cause them to rule over many , and shall divide the land for gain .
And the LORD said to Hosea , Go , take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms : for the land hath committed great whoredom , departing from the LORD .
2 : 2 Plead with your mother , plead : for she is not my wife , neither am I her husband : let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight , and her adulteries from between her breasts ; 2 : 3 Lest I strip her naked , and set her as in the day that she was born , and make her as a wilderness , and set her like a dry land , and slay her with thirst .
2 : 4 And I will not have mercy upon her children ; for they be the children of whoredoms .
2 : 12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees , whereof she hath said , These are my rewards that my lovers have given me : and I will make them a forest , and the beasts of the field shall eat them .
2 : 13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim , wherein she burned incense to them , and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels , and she went after her lovers , and forgat me , saith the LORD .
4 : 1 Hear the word of the LORD , ye children of Israel : for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land , because there is no truth , nor mercy , nor knowledge of God in the land .
4 : 8 They eat up the sin of my people , and they set their heart on their iniquity .
4 : 13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains , and burn incense upon the hills , under oaks and poplars and elms , because the shadow thereof is good : therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom , and your spouses shall commit adultery .
5 : 9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke : among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be .
5 : 10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound : therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water .
6 : 11 Also , O Judah , he hath set an harvest for thee , when I returned the captivity of my people .
7 : 1 When I would have healed Israel , then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered , and the wickedness of Samaria : for they commit falsehood ; and the thief cometh in , and the troop of robbers spoileth without .
7 : 2 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness : now their own doings have beset them about ; they are before my face .
7 : 3 They make the king glad with their wickedness , and the princes with their lies .
7 : 4 They are all adulterers , as an oven heated by the baker , who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough , until it be leavened .
7 : 8 Ephraim , he hath mixed himself among the people ; Ephraim is a cake not turned .
7 : 13 Woe unto them !
for they have fled from me : destruction unto them !
8 : 3 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good : the enemy shall pursue him .
8 : 5 Thy calf , O Samaria , hath cast thee off ; mine anger is kindled against them : how long will it be ere they attain to innocency ?
8 : 10 Yea , though they have hired among the nations , now will I gather them , and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes .
9 : 1 Rejoice not , O Israel , for joy , as other people : for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God , thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor .
9 : 2 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them , and the new wine shall fail in her .
9 : 7 The days of visitation are come , the days of recompence are come ; Israel shall know it : the prophet is a fool , the spiritual man is mad , for the multitude of thine iniquity , and the great hatred .
9 : 13 Ephraim , as I saw Tyrus , is planted in a pleasant place : but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer .
give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts .
9 : 17 My God will cast them away , because they did not hearken unto him : and they shall be wanderers among the nations .
10 : 3 For now they shall say , We have no king , because we feared not the LORD ; what then should a king do to us ?
how shall I deliver thee , Israel ?
12 : 10 I have also spoken by the prophets , and I have multiplied visions , and used similitudes , by the ministry of the prophets .
13 : 2 And now they sin more and more , and have made them molten images of their silver , and idols according to their own understanding , all of it the work of the craftsmen : they say of them , Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves .
13 : 4 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt , and thou shalt know no god but me : for there is no saviour beside me .
and thy judges of whom thou saidst , Give me a king and princes ?
Joel
2 : 1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion , and sound an alarm in my holy mountain : let all the inhabitants of the land tremble : for the day of the LORD cometh , for it is nigh at hand ; 2 : 2 A day of darkness and of gloominess , a day of clouds and of thick darkness , as the morning spread upon the mountains : a great people and a strong ; there hath not been ever the like , neither shall be any more after it , even to the years of many generations .
2 : 5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap , like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble , as a strong people set in battle array .
2 : 12 Therefore also now , saith the LORD , turn ye even to me with all your heart , and with fasting , and with weeping , and with mourning : 2 : 13 And rend your heart , and not your garments , and turn unto the LORD your God : for he is gracious and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repenteth him of the evil .
2 : 18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land , and pity his people .
2 : 22 Be not afraid , ye beasts of the field : for the pastures of the wilderness do spring , for the tree beareth her fruit , the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength .
2 : 27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel , and that I am the LORD your God , and none else : and my people shall never be ashamed .
2 : 28 And it shall come to pass afterward , that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh ; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , your old men shall dream dreams , your young men shall see visions : 2 : 29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit .
3 : 18 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the mountains shall drop down new wine , and the hills shall flow with milk , and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters , and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD , and shall water the valley of Shittim .
1 : 6 Thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Gaza , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because they carried away captive the whole captivity , to deliver them up to Edom : 1 : 7 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza , which shall devour the palaces thereof : 1 : 8 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod , and him that holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon , and I will turn mine hand against Ekron : and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish , saith the Lord GOD .
1 : 11 Thus saith the LORD ; For three transgressions of Edom , and for four , I will not turn away the punishment thereof ; because he did pursue his brother with the sword , and did cast off all pity , and his anger did tear perpetually , and he kept his wrath for ever : 1 : 12 But I will send a fire upon Teman , which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah .
Is it not even thus , O ye children of Israel ?
2 : 16 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day , saith the LORD .
3 : 4 Will a lion roar in the forest , when he hath no prey ?
3 : 13 Hear ye , and testify in the house of Jacob , saith the Lord GOD , the God of hosts , 3 : 14 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel : and the horns of the altar shall be cut off , and fall to the ground .
3 : 15 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house ; and the houses of ivory shall perish , and the great houses shall have an end , saith the LORD .
4 : 1 Hear this word , ye kine of Bashan , that are in the mountain of Samaria , which oppress the poor , which crush the needy , which say to their masters , Bring , and let us drink .
4 : 2 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness , that , lo , the days shall come upon you , that he will take you away with hooks , and your posterity with fishhooks .
4 : 4 Come to Bethel , and transgress ; at Gilgal multiply transgression ; and bring your sacrifices every morning , and your tithes after three years : 4 : 5 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven , and proclaim and publish the free offerings : for this liketh you , O ye children of Israel , saith the Lord GOD .
4 : 11 I have overthrown some of you , as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah , and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the LORD .
5 : 10 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate , and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly .
5 : 11 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor , and ye take from him burdens of wheat : ye have built houses of hewn stone , but ye shall not dwell in them ; ye have planted pleasant vineyards , but ye shall not drink wine of them .
to what end is it for you ?
6 : 1 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion , and trust in the mountain of Samaria , which are named chief of the nations , to whom the house of Israel came !
6 : 8 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself , saith the LORD the God of hosts , I abhor the excellency of Jacob , and hate his palaces : therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein .
6 : 9 And it shall come to pass , if there remain ten men in one house , that they shall die .
And I said , A plumbline .
7 : 10 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel , saying , Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel : the land is not able to bear all his words .
9 : 6 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven , and hath founded his troop in the earth ; he that calleth for the waters of the sea , and poureth them out upon the face of the earth : The LORD is his name .
) would they not have stolen till they had enough ?
So they cast lots , and the lot fell upon Jonah .
what is thy country ?
1 : 12 And he said unto them , Take me up , and cast me forth into the sea ; so shall the sea be calm unto you : for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you .
1 : 16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly , and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD , and made vows .
Salvation is of the LORD .
2 : 10 And the LORD spake unto the fish , and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land .
3 : 3 So Jonah arose , and went unto Nineveh , according to the word of the LORD .
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days ' journey .
4 : 5 So Jonah went out of the city , and sat on the east side of the city , and there made him a booth , and sat under it in the shadow , till he might see what would become of the city .
So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd .
4 : 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day , and it smote the gourd that it withered .
And he said , I do well to be angry , even unto death .
4 : 10 Then said the LORD , Thou hast had pity on the gourd , for the which thou hast not laboured , neither madest it grow ; which came up in a night , and perished in a night : 4 : 11 And should not I spare Nineveh , that great city , wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand ; and also much cattle ?
1 : 4 And the mountains shall be molten under him , and the valleys shall be cleft , as wax before the fire , and as the waters that are poured down a steep place .
1 : 5 For the transgression of Jacob is all this , and for the sins of the house of Israel .
are they not Jerusalem ?
1 : 6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field , and as plantings of a vineyard : and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley , and I will discover the foundations thereof .
1 : 13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish , bind the chariot to the swift beast : she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion : for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee .
1 : 15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee , O inhabitant of Mareshah : he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel .
1 : 16 Make thee bald , and poll thee for thy delicate children ; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle ; for they are gone into captivity from thee .
when the morning is light , they practise it , because it is in the power of their hand .
2 : 6 Prophesy ye not , say they to them that prophesy : they shall not prophesy to them , that they shall not take shame .
2 : 8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy : ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war .
2 : 10 Arise ye , and depart ; for this is not your rest : because it is polluted , it shall destroy you , even with a sore destruction .
3 : 2 Who hate the good , and love the evil ; who pluck off their skin from off them , and their flesh from off their bones ; 3 : 3 Who also eat the flesh of my people , and flay their skin from off them ; and they break their bones , and chop them in pieces , as for the pot , and as flesh within the caldron .
3 : 11 The heads thereof judge for reward , and the priests thereof teach for hire , and the prophets thereof divine for money : yet will they lean upon the LORD , and say , Is not the LORD among us ?
4 : 3 And he shall judge among many people , and rebuke strong nations afar off ; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares , and their spears into pruninghooks : nation shall not lift up a sword against nation , neither shall they learn war any more .
4 : 6 In that day , saith the LORD , will I assemble her that halteth , and I will gather her that is driven out , and her that I have afflicted ; 4 : 7 And I will make her that halted a remnant , and her that was cast far off a strong nation : and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth , even for ever .
is thy counsellor perished ?
4 : 10 Be in pain , and labour to bring forth , O daughter of Zion , like a woman in travail : for now shalt thou go forth out of the city , and thou shalt dwell in the field , and thou shalt go even to Babylon ; there shalt thou be delivered ; there the LORD shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies .
4 : 11 Now also many nations are gathered against thee , that say , Let her be defiled , and let our eye look upon Zion .
5 : 4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD , in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God ; and they shall abide : for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth .
5 : 6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword , and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof : thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian , when he cometh into our land , and when he treadeth within our borders .
5 : 7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the LORD , as the showers upon the grass , that tarrieth not for man , nor waiteth for the sons of men .
6 : 7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams , or with ten thousands of rivers of oil ?
7 : 6 For the son dishonoureth the father , the daughter riseth up against her mother , the daughter in law against her mother in law ; a man ' s enemies are the men of his own house .
7 : 8 Rejoice not against me , O mine enemy : when I fall , I shall arise ; when I sit in darkness , the LORD shall be a light unto me .
7 : 10 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it , and shame shall cover her which said unto me , Where is the LORD thy God ?
7 : 11 In the day that thy walls are to be built , in that day shall the decree be far removed .
7 : 14 Feed thy people with thy rod , the flock of thine heritage , which dwell solitarily in the wood , in the midst of Carmel : let them feed in Bashan and Gilead , as in the days of old .
he retaineth not his anger for ever , because he delighteth in mercy .
7 : 19 He will turn again , he will have compassion upon us ; he will subdue our iniquities ; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea .

2 : 9 Take ye the spoil of silver , take the spoil of gold : for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture .
2 : 13 Behold , I am against thee , saith the LORD of hosts , and I will burn her chariots in the smoke , and the sword shall devour thy young lions : and I will cut off thy prey from the earth , and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard .
3 : 1 Woe to the bloody city !
it is all full of lies and robbery ; the prey departeth not ; 3 : 2 The noise of a whip , and the noise of the rattling of the wheels , and of the pransing horses , and of the jumping chariots .
3 : 12 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs : if they be shaken , they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater .
3 : 18 Thy shepherds slumber , O king of Assyria : thy nobles shall dwell in the dust : thy people is scattered upon the mountains , and no man gathereth them .
Habakkuk
2 : 3 For the vision is yet for an appointed time , but at the end it shall speak , and not lie : though it tarry , wait for it ; because it will surely come , it will not tarry .
2 : 8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations , all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee ; because of men ' s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
2 : 10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people , and hast sinned against thy soul .
2 : 17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee , and the spoil of beasts , which made them afraid , because of men ' s blood , and for the violence of the land , of the city , and of all that dwell therein .
3 : 1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth .
Selah .
3 : 7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction : and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble .
was thine anger against the rivers ?
Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers .
Selah .
3 : 17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom , neither shall fruit be in the vines ; the labour of the olive shall fail , and the fields shall yield no meat ; the flock shall be cut off from the fold , and there shall be no herd in the stalls : 3 : 18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD , I will joy in the God of my salvation .
1 : 3 I will consume man and beast ; I will consume the fowls of the heaven , and the fishes of the sea , and the stumbling blocks with the wicked : and I will cut off man from off the land , saith the LORD .
1 : 7 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD : for the day of the LORD is at hand : for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice , he hath bid his guests .
1 : 8 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD ' s sacrifice , that I will punish the princes , and the king ' s children , and all such as are clothed with strange apparel .
1 : 10 And it shall come to pass in that day , saith the LORD , that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate , and an howling from the second , and a great crashing from the hills .
1 : 15 That day is a day of wrath , a day of trouble and distress , a day of wasteness and desolation , a day of darkness and gloominess , a day of clouds and thick darkness , 1 : 16 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities , and against the high towers .
the word of the LORD is against you ; O Canaan , the land of the Philistines , I will even destroy thee , that there shall be no inhabitant .
Haggai
1 : 3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet , saying , 1 : 4 Is it time for you , O ye , to dwell in your cieled houses , and this house lie waste ?
1 : 11 And I called for a drought upon the land , and upon the mountains , and upon the corn , and upon the new wine , and upon the oil , and upon that which the ground bringeth forth , and upon men , and upon cattle , and upon all the labour of the hands .
2 : 4 Yet now be strong , O Zerubbabel , saith the LORD ; and be strong , O Joshua , son of Josedech , the high priest ; and be strong , all ye people of the land , saith the LORD , and work : for I am with you , saith the LORD of hosts : 2 : 5 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt , so my spirit remaineth among you : fear ye not .
2 : 14 Then answered Haggai , and said , So is this people , and so is this nation before me , saith the LORD ; and so is every work of their hands ; and that which they offer there is unclean .
2 : 17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands ; yet ye turned not to me , saith the LORD .
1 : 9 Then said I , O my lord , what are these ?
1 : 12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said , O LORD of hosts , how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah , against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years ?
So they set a fair mitre upon his head , and clothed him with garments .
4 : 2 And said unto me , What seest thou ?
4 : 8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 4 : 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house ; his hands shall also finish it ; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you .
for they shall rejoice , and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven ; they are the eyes of the LORD , which run to and fro through the whole earth .
5 : 6 And I said , What is it ?
6 : 14 And the crowns shall be to Helem , and to Tobijah , and to Jedaiah , and to Hen the son of Zephaniah , for a memorial in the temple of the LORD .
7 : 8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah , saying , 7 : 9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , Execute true judgment , and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother : 7 : 10 And oppress not the widow , nor the fatherless , the stranger , nor the poor ; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart .
Thus the land was desolate after them , that no man passed through nor returned : for they laid the pleasant land desolate .
8 : 11 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days , saith the LORD of hosts .
8 : 18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me , saying , 8 : 19 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The fast of the fourth month , and the fast of the fifth , and the fast of the seventh , and the fast of the tenth , shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness , and cheerful feasts ; therefore love the truth and peace .
9 : 9 Rejoice greatly , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O daughter of Jerusalem : behold , thy King cometh unto thee : he is just , and having salvation ; lowly , and riding upon an ass , and upon a colt the foal of an ass .
corn shall make the young men cheerful , and new wine the maids .
10 : 2 For the idols have spoken vanity , and the diviners have seen a lie , and have told false dreams ; they comfort in vain : therefore they went their way as a flock , they were troubled , because there was no shepherd .
10 : 4 Out of him came forth the corner , out of him the nail , out of him the battle bow , out of him every oppressor together .
11 : 4 Thus saith the LORD my God ; Feed the flock of the slaughter ; 11 : 5 Whose possessors slay them , and hold themselves not guilty : and they that sell them say , Blessed be the LORD ; for I am rich : and their own shepherds pity them not .
11 : 7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter , even you , O poor of the flock .
11 : 14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff , even Bands , that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel .
the sword shall be upon his arm , and upon his right eye : his arm shall be clean dried up , and his right eye shall be utterly darkened .
12 : 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people : all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces , though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it .
12 : 7 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first , that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah .
Then he shall answer , Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends .
14 : 9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth : in that day shall there be one LORD , and his name one .
14 : 10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem : and it shall be lifted up , and inhabited in her place , from Benjamin ' s gate unto the place of the first gate , unto the corner gate , and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king ' s winepresses .
14 : 17 And it shall be , that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King , the LORD of hosts , even upon them shall be no rain .
Malachi
1 : 4 Whereas Edom saith , We are impoverished , but we will return and build the desolate places ; thus saith the LORD of hosts , They shall build , but I will throw down ; and they shall call them , The border of wickedness , and , The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever .
and if I be a master , where is my fear ?
I have no pleasure in you , saith the LORD of hosts , neither will I accept an offering at your hand .
1 : 14 But cursed be the deceiver , which hath in his flock a male , and voweth , and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing : for I am a great King , saith the LORD of hosts , and my name is dreadful among the heathen .
3 : 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD , as in the days of old , and as in former years .
Return unto me , and I will return unto you , saith the LORD of hosts .
In tithes and offerings .
3 : 16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another : and the LORD hearkened , and heard it , and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD , and that thought upon his name .
1 : 2 Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ; 1 : 3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ; 1 : 4 And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ; 1 : 5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ; 1 : 6 And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ; 1 : 7 And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ; 1 : 8 And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ; 1 : 9 And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ; 1 : 10 And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ; 1 : 11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon : 1 : 12 And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ; 1 : 13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ; 1 : 14 And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ; 1 : 15 And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; 1 : 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
1 : 20 But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
2 : 5 And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet , 2 : 6 And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
2 : 16 Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
3 : 1 In those days came John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea , 3 : 2 And saying , Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
3 : 5 Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan , 3 : 6 And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
3 : 7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
3 : 11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance .
3 : 14 But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
4 : 8 Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ; 4 : 9 And saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
4 : 18 And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
5 : 7 Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
5 : 11 Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
5 : 26 Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
5 : 29 And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
5 : 33 Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths : 5 : 34 But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God ' s throne : 5 : 35 Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
6 : 30 Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
6 : 31 Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ?
7 : 10 Or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
7 : 12 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
7 : 15 Beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep ' s clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
7 : 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
7 : 21 Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
8 : 2 And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
8 : 5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him , 8 : 6 And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
8 : 14 And when Jesus was come into Peter ' s house , he saw his wife ' s mother laid , and sick of a fever .
8 : 19 And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
8 : 21 And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
8 : 23 And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
8 : 24 And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
8 : 25 And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
9 : 1 And he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
9 : 3 And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
9 : 11 And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
9 : 20 And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment : 9 : 21 For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
9 : 27 And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou son of David , have mercy on us .
9 : 28 And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ?
They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
9 : 29 Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
9 : 33 And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
10 : 1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
10 : 8 Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
10 : 12 And when ye come into an house , salute it .
10 : 13 And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
10 : 14 And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
10 : 28 And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
10 : 31 Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
10 : 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
11 : 1 And it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows , 11 : 17 And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
11 : 19 The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners .
11 : 27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
11 : 28 Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
11 : 30 For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
12 : 22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
12 : 24 But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
12 : 29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ?
12 : 42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
12 : 45 Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
13 : 3 And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ; 13 : 4 And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up : 13 : 5 Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth : 13 : 6 And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
13 : 11 He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
13 : 18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
13 : 20 But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ; 13 : 21 Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
13 : 23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
13 : 27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ?
13 : 29 But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
13 : 31 Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field : 13 : 32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
13 : 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
13 : 41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ; 13 : 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
13 : 43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father .
13 : 44 Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
13 : 45 Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls : 13 : 46 Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
13 : 49 So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just , 13 : 50 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
13 : 52 Then said he unto them , Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
14 : 15 And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
14 : 16 But Jesus said unto them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
14 : 32 And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
14 : 33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
15 : 5 But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; 15 : 6 And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free .
15 : 12 Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
15 : 34 And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ?
And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
16 : 1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
16 : 17 And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven .
16 : 20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
16 : 27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
17 : 8 And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
17 : 13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
17 : 19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
18 : 7 Woe unto the world because of offences !
for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
18 : 9 And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
18 : 19 Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
18 : 22 Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
18 : 26 The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
18 : 27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
18 : 29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
19 : 8 He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
19 : 9 And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
19 : 10 His disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
19 : 13 Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
19 : 21 Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
19 : 24 And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
20 : 8 So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
20 : 11 And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house , 20 : 12 Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
20 : 20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
20 : 26 But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ; 20 : 27 And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant : 20 : 28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
20 : 32 And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
21 : 3 And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
21 : 11 And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
21 : 17 And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
21 : 18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
And presently the fig tree withered away .
21 : 21 Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
21 : 22 And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
21 : 23 And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ?
and who gave thee this authority ?
21 : 24 And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
21 : 29 He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
21 : 37 But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
22 : 8 Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
22 : 17 Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ?
22 : 25 Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother : 22 : 26 Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
22 : 46 And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
23 : 8 But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your Master , even Christ ; and all ye are brethren .
for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
23 : 16 Woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
23 : 19 Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
23 : 22 And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
23 : 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
23 : 37 O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
23 : 38 Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
24 : 25 Behold , I have told you before .
24 : 28 For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
24 : 40 Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
24 : 41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
24 : 42 Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
24 : 43 But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
24 : 45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
25 : 1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
25 : 2 And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
25 : 22 He also that had received two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents beside them .
25 : 34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world : 25 : 35 For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in : 25 : 36 Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
25 : 37 Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ?
or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
26 : 9 For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
26 : 10 When Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ?
He said unto him , Thou hast said .
26 : 26 And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
26 : 27 And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ; 26 : 28 For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
26 : 42 He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
26 : 50 And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ?
Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
26 : 58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest ' s palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
26 : 63 But Jesus held his peace , And the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
26 : 66 What think ye ?
They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
27 : 3 Then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders , 27 : 4 Saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood .
27 : 18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
27 : 35 And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
27 : 39 And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads , 27 : 40 And saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself .
If thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
27 : 49 The rest said , Let be , let us see whether Elias will come to save him .
27 : 51 And , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ; 27 : 52 And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose , 27 : 53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
27 : 59 And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth , 27 : 60 And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
28 : 2 And , behold , there was a great earthquake : for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , and sat upon it .
28 : 9 And as they went to tell his disciples , behold , Jesus met them , saying , All hail .
28 : 11 Now when they were going , behold , some of the watch came into the city , and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done .
28 : 12 And when they were assembled with the elders , and had taken counsel , they gave large money unto the soldiers , 28 : 13 Saying , Say ye , His disciples came by night , and stole him away while we slept .
1 : 8 I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
1 : 17 And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
1 : 42 And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
1 : 43 And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ; 1 : 44 And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
2 : 1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
2 : 4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
2 : 10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy ,) 2 : 11 I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
2 : 13 And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
3 : 12 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
3 : 34 And he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
4 : 20 And these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
and not to be set on a candlestick ?
4 : 29 But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
4 : 37 And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
4 : 41 And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
5 : 1 And they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
5 : 8 For he said unto him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
5 : 9 And he asked him , What is thy name ?
5 : 10 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
5 : 12 And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
5 : 18 And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
5 : 24 And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
5 : 30 And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
5 : 34 And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
6 : 4 But Jesus , said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
6 : 14 And king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad :) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
6 : 17 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip ' s wife : for he had married her .
6 : 29 And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
6 : 37 He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat .
6 : 43 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
6 : 46 And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
7 : 2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
7 : 3 For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
8 : 5 And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ?
8 : 12 And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ?
8 : 15 And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
8 : 16 And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
8 : 18 Having eyes , see ye not ?
8 : 25 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
8 : 31 And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
9 : 17 And one of the multitude answered and said , Master , I have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ; 9 : 18 And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
how long shall I suffer you ?
9 : 20 And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
9 : 21 And he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ?
9 : 32 But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
10 : 6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
10 : 7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; 10 : 8 And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
10 : 13 And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
10 : 16 And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
10 : 36 And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
10 : 41 And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
10 : 42 But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
11 : 1 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples , 11 : 2 And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
11 : 4 And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
11 : 6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
12 : 1 And he began to speak unto them by parables .
he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
12 : 22 And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
12 : 34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God .
12 : 35 And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ?
12 : 38 And he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces , 12 : 39 And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts : 12 : 40 Which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
13 : 11 But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
13 : 12 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
13 : 13 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
13 : 19 For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
13 : 24 But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , 13 : 25 And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
13 : 28 Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near : 13 : 29 So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
13 : 32 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
13 : 34 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
14 : 4 And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
14 : 6 And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ?
14 : 9 Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
14 : 12 And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
14 : 24 And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
Likewise also said they all .
14 : 32 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
14 : 35 And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
14 : 62 And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
And when he thought thereon , he wept .
behold how many things they witness against thee .
15 : 6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
15 : 11 But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
15 : 12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
15 : 14 Then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ?
And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
15 : 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
15 : 21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
15 : 25 And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
15 : 29 And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , 15 : 30 Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
And they that were crucified with him reviled him .
15 : 33 And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
15 : 39 And when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
15 : 40 There were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ; 15 : 41 ( Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
15 : 42 And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath , 15 : 43 Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
16 : 1 And when the sabbath was past , Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James , and Salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and anoint him .
16 : 2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week , they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun .
16 : 12 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them , as they walked , and went into the country .
16 : 13 And they went and told it unto the residue : neither believed they them .
16 : 15 And he said unto them , Go ye into all the world , and preach the gospel to every creature .
16 : 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe ; In my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; 16 : 18 They shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover .
1 : 1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us , 1 : 2 Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ; 1 : 3 It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus , 1 : 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
1 : 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
1 : 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
1 : 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother ' s womb .
1 : 30 And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God .
And the angel departed from her .
1 : 45 And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
1 : 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
1 : 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
2 : 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David :) 2 : 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
2 : 6 And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
2 : 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
2 : 15 And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
2 : 25 And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
2 : 26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord ' s Christ .
3 : 3 And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ; 3 : 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
3 : 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
3 : 13 And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
3 : 23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli , 3 : 24 Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph , 3 : 25 Which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Amos , which was the son of Naum , which was the son of Esli , which was the son of Nagge , 3 : 26 Which was the son of Maath , which was the son of Mattathias , which was the son of Semei , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Juda , 3 : 27 Which was the son of Joanna , which was the son of Rhesa , which was the son of Zorobabel , which was the son of Salathiel , which was the son of Neri , 3 : 28 Which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Addi , which was the son of Cosam , which was the son of Elmodam , which was the son of Er , 3 : 29 Which was the son of Jose , which was the son of Eliezer , which was the son of Jorim , which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , 3 : 30 Which was the son of Simeon , which was the son of Juda , which was the son of Joseph , which was the son of Jonan , which was the son of Eliakim , 3 : 31 Which was the son of Melea , which was the son of Menan , which was the son of Mattatha , which was the son of Nathan , which was the son of David , 3 : 32 Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson , 3 : 33 Which was the son of Aminadab , which was the son of Aram , which was the son of Esrom , which was the son of Phares , which was the son of Juda , 3 : 34 Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor , 3 : 35 Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala , 3 : 36 Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech , 3 : 37 Which was the son of Mathusala , which was the son of Enoch , which was the son of Jared , which was the son of Maleleel , which was the son of Cainan , 3 : 38 Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
4 : 12 And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
4 : 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
4 : 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
4 : 41 And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God .
5 : 4 Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
5 : 19 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
5 : 33 And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
6 : 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
6 : 13 And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ; 6 : 14 Simon , ( whom he also named Peter ,) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew , 6 : 15 Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes , 6 : 16 And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor .
6 : 17 And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ; 6 : 18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
for ye have received your consolation .
for ye shall mourn and weep .
6 : 26 Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you !
6 : 33 And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ?
6 : 35 But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
6 : 40 The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
7 : 1 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
7 : 10 And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
7 : 13 And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
or look we for another ?
7 : 20 When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ?
or look we for another ?
7 : 25 But what went ye out for to see ?
7 : 29 And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
7 : 32 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
7 : 35 But wisdom is justified of all her children .
7 : 37 And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ' s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment , 7 : 38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
7 : 43 Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most .
7 : 44 And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ?
7 : 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
8 : 6 And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
8 : 9 And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
8 : 17 For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
8 : 18 Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
And they launched forth .
8 : 24 And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish .
And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this !
8 : 27 And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness .
8 : 37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
8 : 50 But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
9 : 6 And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
9 : 27 But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
9 : 29 And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
9 : 37 And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
9 : 39 And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
9 : 57 And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
10 : 5 And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
10 : 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
10 : 18 And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
10 : 19 Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
10 : 23 And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see : 10 : 24 For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
how readest thou ?
10 : 41 And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things : 10 : 42 But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
11 : 9 And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
11 : 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace : 11 : 22 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
11 : 30 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
11 : 31 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
11 : 39 And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
12 : 2 For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
12 : 11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say : 12 : 12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
12 : 22 And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
12 : 33 Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
12 : 34 For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
12 : 37 Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
12 : 50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
12 : 51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ?
13 : 3 I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
13 : 12 And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
13 : 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
13 : 16 And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
13 : 21 It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
13 : 35 Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
14 : 3 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
14 : 4 And they held their peace .
14 : 6 And they could not answer him again to these things .
14 : 7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them .
14 : 10 But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
14 : 15 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
14 : 23 And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
14 : 27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
14 : 29 Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him , 14 : 30 Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
14 : 31 Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
14 : 35 It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out .
15 : 2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
15 : 6 And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
15 : 11 And he said , A certain man had two sons : 15 : 12 And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me .
15 : 20 And he arose , and came to his father .
15 : 29 And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends : 15 : 30 But as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
15 : 31 And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
16 : 4 I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
16 : 7 Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ?
16 : 10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
16 : 12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man ' s , who shall give you that which is your own ?
16 : 24 And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
17 : 4 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
17 : 5 And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
17 : 6 And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
I trow not .
17 : 23 And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
17 : 24 For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
17 : 25 But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
18 : 1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ; 18 : 2 Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man : 18 : 3 And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
18 : 8 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily .
18 : 9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others : 18 : 10 Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
18 : 19 And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ?
18 : 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
18 : 28 Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
18 : 32 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on : 18 : 33 And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
19 : 5 And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
19 : 8 And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord : Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
19 : 24 And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
19 : 45 And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ; 19 : 46 Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him , 19 : 48 And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
20 : 3 And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me : 20 : 4 The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
20 : 16 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others .
And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
20 : 23 But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
20 : 31 And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
20 : 38 For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
20 : 42 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , 20 : 43 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
21 : 16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
21 : 19 In your patience possess ye your souls .
21 : 22 For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
21 : 23 But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days !
21 : 34 And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
21 : 38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
22 : 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
22 : 11 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
22 : 20 Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
22 : 24 And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
22 : 26 But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
is not he that sitteth at meat ?
22 : 33 And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
And he said unto them , It is enough .
22 : 45 And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow , 22 : 46 And said unto them , Why sleep ye ?
22 : 49 When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
22 : 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
22 : 54 Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest ' s house .
And Peter said , Man , I am not .
22 : 59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
22 : 60 And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest .
22 : 61 And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter .
22 : 63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
22 : 70 Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ?
And he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
23 : 21 But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
23 : 32 And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
23 : 45 And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
24 : 6 He is not here , but is risen : remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee , 24 : 7 Saying , The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men , and be crucified , and the third day rise again .
24 : 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel : and beside all this , to day is the third day since these things were done .
24 : 29 But they constrained him , saying , Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent .
24 : 36 And as they thus spake , Jesus himself stood in the midst of them , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
24 : 49 And , behold , I send the promise of my Father upon you : but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem , until ye be endued with power from on high .
1 : 7 The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
1 : 11 He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
1 : 15 John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
1 : 21 And they asked him , What then ?
Art thou Elias ?
that we may give an answer to them that sent us .
1 : 39 He saith unto them , Come and see .
And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
1 : 45 Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
2 : 5 His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
2 : 6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
2 : 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom , 2 : 10 And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
3 : 5 Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
3 : 13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
3 : 16 For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
3 : 32 And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
4 : 1 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John , 4 : 2 ( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples ,) 4 : 3 He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
4 : 4 And he must needs go through Samaria .
4 : 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
4 : 11 The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
4 : 17 The woman answered and said , I have no husband .
4 : 26 Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
4 : 46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine .
And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
5 : 1 After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
5 : 6 When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
5 : 20 For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
5 : 26 For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ; 5 : 27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
5 : 36 But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
5 : 39 Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
5 : 44 How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
6 : 6 And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
6 : 7 Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
6 : 36 But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
6 : 40 And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
6 : 44 No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
6 : 46 Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
6 : 50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
6 : 63 It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
6 : 69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
7 : 7 The world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
7 : 19 Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ?
Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
7 : 31 And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
7 : 33 Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
7 : 37 In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
7 : 39 ( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified .
7 : 48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
8 : 3 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst , 8 : 4 They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
8 : 10 When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ?
8 : 22 Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ?
8 : 28 Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
even because ye cannot hear my word .
8 : 49 Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me .
8 : 50 And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
8 : 58 Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
8 : 59 Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
9 : 3 Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
9 : 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day .
And there was a division among them .
9 : 17 They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ?
9 : 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
9 : 36 He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
9 : 40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , Are we blind also ?
10 : 13 The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
10 : 21 Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil .
Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
10 : 24 Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ?
10 : 30 I and my Father are one .
10 : 32 Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
10 : 42 And many believed on him there .
11 : 9 Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ?
11 : 33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled .
11 : 37 And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
11 : 47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ?
11 : 51 And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ; 11 : 52 And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad .
12 : 10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ; 12 : 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
12 : 23 And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
12 : 28 Father , glorify thy name .
These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
12 : 37 But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him : 12 : 38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ?
12 : 44 Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
12 : 45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
13 : 10 Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
13 : 13 Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
13 : 17 If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
13 : 32 If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
14 : 2 In my Father ' s house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you .
14 : 5 Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
14 : 11 Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
14 : 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
14 : 25 These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
14 : 28 Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you .
If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I .
14 : 29 And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
14 : 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do .
15 : 1 I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman .
15 : 22 If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloak for their sin .
16 : 1 These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended .
16 : 2 They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
16 : 8 And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment : 16 : 9 Of sin , because they believe not on me ; 16 : 10 Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ; 16 : 11 Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
16 : 22 And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
16 : 30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
17 : 6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
17 : 10 And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
17 : 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
17 : 16 They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
17 : 18 As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
17 : 24 Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
17 : 26 And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
18 : 14 Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
18 : 20 Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
18 : 27 Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death : 18 : 32 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
18 : 35 Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ?
And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
18 : 40 Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas .
19 : 6 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
19 : 8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ; 19 : 9 And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ?
But Jesus gave him no answer .
19 : 10 Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ?
knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ?
19 : 27 Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother !
19 : 32 Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
19 : 39 And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
19 : 42 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
20 : 11 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre , 20 : 12 And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
20 : 27 Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
They went forth , and entered into a ship immediately ; and that night they caught nothing .
21 : 4 But when the morning was now come , Jesus stood on the shore : but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus .
21 : 6 And he said unto them , Cast the net on the right side of the ship , and ye shall find .
follow thou me .
21 : 24 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things , and wrote these things : and we know that his testimony is true .
1 : 1 The former treatise have I made , O Theophilus , of all that Jesus began both to do and teach , 1 : 2 Until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen : 1 : 3 To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God : 1 : 4 And , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
1 : 6 When they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel ?
1 : 8 But ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
1 : 9 And when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
1 : 13 And when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
1 : 17 For he was numbered with us , and had obtained part of this ministry .
1 : 23 And they appointed two , Joseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
2 : 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
2 : 30 Therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ; 2 : 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
2 : 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , 2 : 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool .
2 : 46 And they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart , 2 : 47 Praising God , and having favour with all the people .
or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ?
3 : 13 The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
3 : 17 And now , brethren , I wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
3 : 24 Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
4 : 12 Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
4 : 21 So when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
5 : 1 But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession , 5 : 2 And kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ?
why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ?
5 : 7 And it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
And she said , Yea , for so much .
and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man ' s blood upon us .
5 : 41 And they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
6 : 1 And in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
6 : 11 Then they suborned men , which said , We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses , and against God .
6 : 12 And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council , 6 : 13 And set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law : 6 : 14 For we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us .
7 : 7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
7 : 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision : and so Abraham begat Isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs .
7 : 13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph ' s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh .
7 : 19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
7 : 27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
7 : 28 Wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
7 : 36 He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
7 : 41 And they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
7 : 43 Yea , ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
7 : 51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the Holy Ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
7 : 52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ?
and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers : 7 : 53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
And when he had said this , he fell asleep .
) 8 : 17 Then laid they their hands on them , and they received the Holy Ghost .
8 : 24 Then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the LORD for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
8 : 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
8 : 30 And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
9 : 1 And Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest , 9 : 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
9 : 6 And he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ?
9 : 9 And he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink .
And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
9 : 15 But the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel : 9 : 16 For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name ' s sake .
9 : 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
9 : 23 And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him : 9 : 24 But their laying await was known of Saul .
9 : 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
9 : 32 And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
9 : 34 And Peter said unto him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed .
9 : 36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
9 : 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
9 : 40 But Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise .
10 : 7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ; 10 : 8 And when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
10 : 15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
10 : 19 While Peter thought on the vision , the Spirit said unto him , Behold , three men seek thee .
Now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
10 : 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord .
Moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man ' s house : 11 : 13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ; 11 : 14 Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
11 : 15 And as I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
12 : 1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
12 : 8 And the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals .
And he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
But she constantly affirmed that it was even so .
12 : 22 And the people gave a shout , saying , It is the voice of a god , and not of a man .
12 : 23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
13 : 20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
13 : 21 And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
13 : 25 And as John fulfilled his course , he said , Whom think ye that I am ?
But , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose .
13 : 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
13 : 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
And he leaped and walked .
15 : 24 Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment : 15 : 25 It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul , 15 : 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
15 : 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ; 15 : 29 That ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well .
15 : 32 And Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
16 : 5 And so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
16 : 19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers , 16 : 20 And brought them to the magistrates , saying , These men , being Jews , do exceedingly trouble our city , 16 : 21 And teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being Romans .
16 : 23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely : 16 : 24 Who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
16 : 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one ' s bands were loosed .
16 : 31 And they said , Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house .
17 : 8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
17 : 12 Therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
17 : 14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
) 17 : 22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
18 : 3 And because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
18 : 14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth , Gallio said unto the Jews , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , O ye Jews , reason would that I should bear with you : 18 : 15 But if it be a question of words and names , and of your law , look ye to it ; for I will be no judge of such matters .
18 : 24 And a certain Jew named Apollos , born at Alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to Ephesus .
18 : 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
19 : 3 And he said unto them , Unto what then were ye baptized ?
19 : 14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jew , and chief of the priests , which did so .
19 : 21 After these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
19 : 23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
19 : 38 Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
19 : 40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day ' s uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
20 : 11 When he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
20 : 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
20 : 18 And when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons , 20 : 19 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews : 20 : 20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house , 20 : 21 Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
20 : 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
20 : 29 For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
20 : 31 Therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
20 : 34 Yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
21 : 11 And when he was come unto us , he took Paul ' s girdle , and bound his own hands and feet , and said , Thus saith the Holy Ghost , So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle , and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles .
21 : 20 And when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , and said unto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law : 21 : 21 And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
21 : 35 And when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
22 : 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .
And the Lord said unto me , Arise , and go into Damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
22 : 11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
22 : 12 And one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there , 22 : 13 Came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , Brother Saul , receive thy sight .
And the same hour I looked up upon him .
22 : 17 And it came to pass , that , when I was come again to Jerusalem , even while I prayed in the temple , I was in a trance ; 22 : 18 And saw him saying unto me , Make haste , and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
22 : 21 And he said unto me , Depart : for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles .
22 : 23 And as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air , 22 : 24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
23 : 6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees , and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , Men and brethren , I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question .
23 : 12 And when it was day , certain of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
23 : 15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow , as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or ever he come near , are ready to kill him .
23 : 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
23 : 21 But do not thou yield unto them : for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men , which have bound themselves with an oath , that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready , looking for a promise from thee .
24 : 22 And when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter .
24 : 24 And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
25 : 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul , and besought him , 25 : 3 And desired favour against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
25 : 20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
25 : 24 And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
26 : 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God , unto our fathers : 26 : 7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come .
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
And he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest .
26 : 25 But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
26 : 27 King Agrippa , believest thou the prophets ?
26 : 30 And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them : 26 : 31 And when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
27 : 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
27 : 26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island .
27 : 39 And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
28 : 4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand , they said among themselves , No doubt this man is a murderer , whom , though he hath escaped the sea , yet vengeance suffereth not to live .
28 : 19 But when the Jews spake against it , I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar ; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of .
28 : 23 And when they had appointed him a day , there came many to him into his lodging ; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God , persuading them concerning Jesus , both out of the law of Moses , and out of the prophets , from morning till evening .
1 : 1 Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God , 1 : 2 ( Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures ,) 1 : 3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ; 1 : 4 And declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead : 1 : 5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name : 1 : 6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ : 1 : 7 To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse : 1 : 21 Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
2 : 1 Therefore thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoever thou art that judgest : for wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things .
2 : 3 And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
3 : 3 For what if some did not believe ?
whose damnation is just .
4 : 5 But to him that worketh not , but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly , his faith is counted for righteousness .
4 : 22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness .
5 : 6 For when we were yet without strength , in due time Christ died for the ungodly .
5 : 8 But God commendeth his love toward us , in that , while we were yet sinners , Christ died for us .
5 : 12 Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world , and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned : 5 : 13 ( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no law .
5 : 17 For if by one man ' s offence death reigned by one ; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one , Jesus Christ .
) 5 : 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation ; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life .
How shall we , that are dead to sin , live any longer therein ?
6 : 15 What then ?
7 : 3 So then if , while her husband liveth , she be married to another man , she shall be called an adulteress : but if her husband be dead , she is free from that law ; so that she is no adulteress , though she be married to another man .
But sin , that it might appear sin , working death in me by that which is good ; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful .
7 : 18 For I know that in me ( that is , in my flesh ,) dwelleth no good thing : for to will is present with me ; but how to perform that which is good I find not .
8 : 11 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you , he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you .
8 : 24 For we are saved by hope : but hope that is seen is not hope : for what a man seeth , why doth he yet hope for ?
8 : 31 What shall we then say to these things ?
If God be for us , who can be against us ?
It is God that justifieth .
8 : 37 Nay , in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us .
9 : 25 As he saith also in Osee , I will call them my people , which were not my people ; and her beloved , which was not beloved .
9 : 27 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel , Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea , a remnant shall be saved : 9 : 28 For he will finish the work , and cut it short in righteousness : because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth .
The word is nigh thee , even in thy mouth , and in thy heart : that is , the word of faith , which we preach ; 10 : 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus , and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead , thou shalt be saved .
10 : 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness ; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation .
10 : 11 For the scripture saith , Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed .
10 : 17 So then faith cometh by hearing , and hearing by the word of God .
11 : 4 But what saith the answer of God unto him ?
11 : 5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace .
11 : 12 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world , and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles ; how much more their fulness ?
11 : 15 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world , what shall the receiving of them be , but life from the dead ?
11 : 33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God !
11 : 35 Or who hath first given to him , and it shall be recompensed unto him again ?
11 : 36 For of him , and through him , and to him , are all things : to whom be glory for ever .
12 : 1 I beseech you therefore , brethren , by the mercies of God , that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice , holy , acceptable unto God , which is your reasonable service .
12 : 15 Rejoice with them that do rejoice , and weep with them that weep .
Provide things honest in the sight of all men .
14 : 1 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye , but not to doubtful disputations .
14 : 5 One man esteemeth one day above another : another esteemeth every day alike .
14 : 6 He that regardeth the day , regardeth it unto the Lord ; and he that regardeth not the day , to the Lord he doth not regard it .
14 : 7 For none of us liveth to himself , and no man dieth to himself .
14 : 10 But why dost thou judge thy brother ?
14 : 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of : 14 : 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink ; but righteousness , and peace , and joy in the Holy Ghost .
All things indeed are pure ; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence .
14 : 22 Hast thou faith ?
15 : 2 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification .
15 : 10 And again he saith , Rejoice , ye Gentiles , with his people .
15 : 11 And again , Praise the Lord , all ye Gentiles ; and laud him , all ye people .
15 : 12 And again , Esaias saith , There shall be a root of Jesse , and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles ; in him shall the Gentiles trust .
15 : 13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing , that ye may abound in hope , through the power of the Holy Ghost .
15 : 15 Nevertheless , brethren , I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort , as putting you in mind , because of the grace that is given to me of God , 15 : 16 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles , ministering the gospel of God , that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable , being sanctified by the Holy Ghost .
15 : 26 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem .
For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things , their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things .
15 : 29 And I am sure that , when I come unto you , I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ .
Greet them that be of the household of Narcissus , which are in the Lord .
Salute the beloved Persis , which laboured much in the Lord .
16 : 22 I Tertius , who wrote this epistle , salute you in the Lord .
16 : 24 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians
1 : 10 Now I beseech you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that ye all speak the same thing , and that there be no divisions among you ; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment .
1 : 12 Now this I say , that every one of you saith , I am of Paul ; and I of Apollos ; and I of Cephas ; and I of Christ .
was Paul crucified for you ?
1 : 16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas : besides , I know not whether I baptized any other .
where is the scribe ?
2 : 4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man ' s wisdom , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power : 2 : 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God .
2 : 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man , save the spirit of man which is in him ?
2 : 16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord , that he may instruct him ?
3 : 4 For while one saith , I am of Paul ; and another , I am of Apollos ; are ye not carnal ?
3 : 9 For we are labourers together with God : ye are God ' s husbandry , ye are God ' s building .
3 : 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me , as a wise masterbuilder , I have laid the foundation , and another buildeth thereon .
3 : 12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold , silver , precious stones , wood , hay , stubble ; 3 : 13 Every man ' s work shall be made manifest : for the day shall declare it , because it shall be revealed by fire ; and the fire shall try every man ' s work of what sort it is .
For all things are your ' s ; 3 : 22 Whether Paul , or Apollos , or Cephas , or the world , or life , or death , or things present , or things to come ; all are your ' s ; 3 : 23 And ye are Christ ' s ; and Christ is God ' s .
4 : 5 Therefore judge nothing before the time , until the Lord come , who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness , and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts : and then shall every man have praise of God .
4 : 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger , and thirst , and are naked , and are buffeted , and have no certain dwellingplace ; 4 : 12 And labour , working with our own hands : being reviled , we bless ; being persecuted , we suffer it : 4 : 13 Being defamed , we intreat : we are made as the filth of the world , and are the offscouring of all things unto this day .
5 : 11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company , if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator , or covetous , or an idolater , or a railer , or a drunkard , or an extortioner ; with such an one no not to eat .
Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person .
for two , saith he , shall be one flesh .
7 : 8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows , It is good for them if they abide even as I .
7 : 18 Is any man called being circumcised ?
care not for it : but if thou mayest be made free , use it rather .
7 : 26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress , I say , that it is good for a man so to be .
Art thou loosed from a wife ?
He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord , how he may please the Lord : 7 : 33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife .
8 : 7 Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge : for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol ; and their conscience being weak is defiled .
8 : 12 But when ye sin so against the brethren , and wound their weak conscience , ye sin against Christ .
9 : 9 For it is written in the law of Moses , Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn .
9 : 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple ?
9 : 15 But I have used none of these things : neither have I written these things , that it should be so done unto me : for it were better for me to die , than that any man should make my glorying void .
9 : 16 For though I preach the gospel , I have nothing to glory of : for necessity is laid upon me ; yea , woe is unto me , if I preach not the gospel !
9 : 26 I therefore so run , not as uncertainly ; so fight I , not as one that beateth the air : 9 : 27 But I keep under my body , and bring it into subjection : lest that by any means , when I have preached to others , I myself should be a castaway .
10 : 5 But with many of them God was not well pleased : for they were overthrown in the wilderness .
10 : 13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man : but God is faithful , who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able ; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape , that ye may be able to bear it .
10 : 20 But I say , that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice , they sacrifice to devils , and not to God : and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils .
10 : 23 All things are lawful for me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but all things edify not .
11 : 10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels .
11 : 13 Judge in yourselves : is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered ?
11 : 18 For first of all , when ye come together in the church , I hear that there be divisions among you ; and I partly believe it .
11 : 21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper : and one is hungry , and another is drunken .
or despise ye the church of God , and shame them that have not ?
12 : 1 Now concerning spiritual gifts , brethren , I would not have you ignorant .
12 : 5 And there are differences of administrations , but the same Lord .
12 : 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal .
12 : 17 If the whole body were an eye , where were the hearing ?
12 : 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body , as it hath pleased him .
12 : 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand , I have no need of thee : nor again the head to the feet , I have no need of you .
12 : 30 Have all the gifts of healing ?
13 : 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy , and understand all mysteries , and all knowledge ; and though I have all faith , so that I could remove mountains , and have not charity , I am nothing .
13 : 4 Charity suffereth long , and is kind ; charity envieth not ; charity vaunteth not itself , is not puffed up , 13 : 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly , seeketh not her own , is not easily provoked , thinketh no evil ; 13 : 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity , but rejoiceth in the truth ; 13 : 7 Beareth all things , believeth all things , hopeth all things , endureth all things .
13 : 9 For we know in part , and we prophesy in part .
13 : 13 And now abideth faith , hope , charity , these three ; but the greatest of these is charity .
14 : 3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification , and exhortation , and comfort .
14 : 5 I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied : for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues , except he interpret , that the church may receive edifying .
14 : 16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit , how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks , seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest ?
14 : 20 Brethren , be not children in understanding : howbeit in malice be ye children , but in understanding be men .
14 : 23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place , and all speak with tongues , and there come in those that are unlearned , or unbelievers , will they not say that ye are mad ?
when ye come together , every one of you hath a psalm , hath a doctrine , hath a tongue , hath a revelation , hath an interpretation .
14 : 30 If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by , let the first hold his peace .
14 : 36 What ?
15 : 1 Moreover , brethren , I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you , which also ye have received , and wherein ye stand ; 15 : 2 By which also ye are saved , if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you , unless ye have believed in vain .
15 : 7 After that , he was seen of James ; then of all the apostles .
15 : 13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead , then is Christ not risen : 15 : 14 And if Christ be not risen , then is our preaching vain , and your faith is also vain .
15 : 18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished .
15 : 30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour ?
15 : 42 So also is the resurrection of the dead .
It is sown in corruption ; it is raised in incorruption : 15 : 43 It is sown in dishonour ; it is raised in glory : it is sown in weakness ; it is raised in power : 15 : 44 It is sown a natural body ; it is raised a spiritual body .
O grave , where is thy victory ?
15 : 57 But thanks be to God , which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ .
16 : 1 Now concerning the collection for the saints , as I have given order to the churches of Galatia , even so do ye .
16 : 11 Let no man therefore despise him : but conduct him forth in peace , that he may come unto me : for I look for him with the brethren .
16 : 12 As touching our brother Apollos , I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren : but his will was not at all to come at this time ; but he will come when he shall have convenient time .
16 : 17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus : for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied .
Greet ye one another with an holy kiss .
16 : 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you .
1 : 17 When I therefore was thus minded , did I use lightness ?
2 : 7 So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him , and comfort him , lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow .
2 : 14 Now thanks be unto God , which always causeth us to triumph in Christ , and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place .
or need we , as some others , epistles of commendation to you , or letters of commendation from you ?
3 : 15 But even unto this day , when Moses is read , the vail is upon their heart .
4 : 1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry , as we have received mercy , we faint not ; 4 : 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty , not walking in craftiness , nor handling the word of God deceitfully ; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man ' s conscience in the sight of God .
4 : 3 But if our gospel be hid , it is hid to them that are lost : 4 : 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not , lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ , who is the image of God , should shine unto them .
4 : 11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus ' sake , that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh .
5 : 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us ; because we thus judge , that if one died for all , then were all dead : 5 : 15 And that he died for all , that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves , but unto him which died for them , and rose again .
6 : 11 O ye Corinthians , our mouth is open unto you , our heart is enlarged .
and what communion hath light with darkness ?
or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel ?
7 : 1 Having therefore these promises , dearly beloved , let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit , perfecting holiness in the fear of God .
7 : 4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you , great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort , I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation .
7 : 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you , I am not ashamed ; but as we spake all things to you in truth , even so our boasting , which I made before Titus , is found a truth .
7 : 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things .
8 : 22 And we have sent with them our brother , whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things , but now much more diligent , upon the great confidence which I have in you .
8 : 24 Wherefore shew ye to them , and before the churches , the proof of your love , and of our boasting on your behalf .
9 : 6 But this I say , He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly ; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully .
9 : 15 Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift .
11 : 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy : for I have espoused you to one husband , that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ .
11 : 5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles .
11 : 12 But what I do , that I will do , that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion ; that wherein they glory , they may be found even as we .
11 : 13 For such are false apostles , deceitful workers , transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ .
11 : 19 For ye suffer fools gladly , seeing ye yourselves are wise .
11 : 20 For ye suffer , if a man bring you into bondage , if a man devour you , if a man take of you , if a man exalt himself , if a man smite you on the face .
11 : 22 Are they Hebrews ?
so am I .
11 : 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods , once was I stoned , thrice I suffered shipwreck , a night and a day I have been in the deep ; 11 : 26 In journeyings often , in perils of waters , in perils of robbers , in perils by mine own countrymen , in perils by the heathen , in perils in the city , in perils in the wilderness , in perils in the sea , in perils among false brethren ; 11 : 27 In weariness and painfulness , in watchings often , in hunger and thirst , in fastings often , in cold and nakedness .
11 : 28 Beside those things that are without , that which cometh upon me daily , the care of all the churches .
12 : 3 And I knew such a man , ( whether in the body , or out of the body , I cannot tell : God knoweth ;) 12 : 4 How that he was caught up into paradise , and heard unspeakable words , which it is not lawful for a man to utter .
12 : 9 And he said unto me , My grace is sufficient for thee : for my strength is made perfect in weakness .
12 : 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities , in reproaches , in necessities , in persecutions , in distresses for Christ ' s sake : for when I am weak , then am I strong .
12 : 11 I am become a fool in glorying ; ye have compelled me : for I ought to have been commended of you : for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles , though I be nothing .
forgive me this wrong .
12 : 16 But be it so , I did not burden you : nevertheless , being crafty , I caught you with guile .
12 : 17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you ?
Did Titus make a gain of you ?
12 : 19 Again , think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you ?
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Galatians
Amen .
1 : 10 For do I now persuade men , or God ?
or do I seek to please men ?
1 : 12 For I neither received it of man , neither was I taught it , but by the revelation of Jesus Christ .
1 : 20 Now the things which I write unto you , behold , before God , I lie not .
2 : 3 But neither Titus , who was with me , being a Greek , was compelled to be circumcised : 2 : 4 And that because of false brethren unawares brought in , who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus , that they might bring us into bondage : 2 : 5 To whom we gave place by subjection , no , not for an hour ; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you .
2 : 15 We who are Jews by nature , and not sinners of the Gentiles , 2 : 16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law , but by the faith of Jesus Christ , even we have believed in Jesus Christ , that we might be justified by the faith of Christ , and not by the works of the law : for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified .
3 : 4 Have ye suffered so many things in vain ?
if it be yet in vain .
3 : 16 Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made .
He saith not , And to seeds , as of many ; but as of one , And to thy seed , which is Christ .
3 : 21 Is the law then against the promises of God ?
God forbid : for if there had been a law given which could have given life , verily righteousness should have been by the law .
4 : 1 Now I say , That the heir , as long as he is a child , differeth nothing from a servant , though he be lord of all ; 4 : 2 But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father .
4 : 11 I am afraid of you , lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain .
4 : 13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first .
4 : 15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of ?
for I bear you record , that , if it had been possible , ye would have plucked out your own eyes , and have given them to me .
4 : 24 Which things are an allegory : for these are the two covenants ; the one from the mount Sinai , which gendereth to bondage , which is Agar .
4 : 25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia , and answereth to Jerusalem which now is , and is in bondage with her children .
4 : 26 But Jerusalem which is above is free , which is the mother of us all .
Cast out the bondwoman and her son : for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman .
5 : 2 Behold , I Paul say unto you , that if ye be circumcised , Christ shall profit you nothing .
5 : 4 Christ is become of no effect unto you , whosoever of you are justified by the law ; ye are fallen from grace .
5 : 7 Ye did run well ; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth ?
6 : 6 Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things .
6 : 12 As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh , they constrain you to be circumcised ; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ .
6 : 17 From henceforth let no man trouble me : for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus .
1 : 13 In whom ye also trusted , after that ye heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation : in whom also after that ye believed , ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise , 1 : 14 Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession , unto the praise of his glory .
3 : 20 Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think , according to the power that worketh in us , 3 : 21 Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages , world without end .
5 : 13 But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light : for whatsoever doth make manifest is light .
5 : 18 And be not drunk with wine , wherein is excess ; but be filled with the Spirit ; 5 : 19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs , singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord ; 5 : 20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ ; 5 : 21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God .
5 : 24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ , so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing .
5 : 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and shall be joined unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh .
6 : 13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God , that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day , and having done all , to stand .
1 : 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness , which are by Jesus Christ , unto the glory and praise of God .
notwithstanding , every way , whether in pretence , or in truth , Christ is preached ; and I therein do rejoice , yea , and will rejoice .
1 : 22 But if I live in the flesh , this is the fruit of my labour : yet what I shall choose I wot not .
1 : 23 For I am in a strait betwixt two , having a desire to depart , and to be with Christ ; which is far better : 1 : 24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you .
1 : 27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ : that whether I come and see you , or else be absent , I may hear of your affairs , that ye stand fast in one spirit , with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel ; 1 : 28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries : which is to them an evident token of perdition , but to you of salvation , and that of God .
2 : 3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory ; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves .
2 : 13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure .
2 : 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness ; and hold such in reputation : 2 : 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death , not regarding his life , to supply your lack of service toward me .
To write the same things to you , to me indeed is not grievous , but for you it is safe .
3 : 4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh .
3 : 8 Yea doubtless , and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord : for whom I have suffered the loss of all things , and do count them but dung , that I may win Christ , 3 : 9 And be found in him , not having mine own righteousness , which is of the law , but that which is through the faith of Christ , the righteousness which is of God by faith : 3 : 10 That I may know him , and the power of his resurrection , and the fellowship of his sufferings , being made conformable unto his death ; 3 : 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead .
3 : 16 Nevertheless , whereto we have already attained , let us walk by the same rule , let us mind the same thing .
) 3 : 20 For our conversation is in heaven ; from whence also we look for the Saviour , the Lord Jesus Christ : 3 : 21 Who shall change our vile body , that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body , according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself .
4 : 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men .
4 : 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done , that ye did communicate with my affliction .
4 : 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity .
Amen .
4 : 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
Amen .
1 : 19 For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell ; 1 : 20 And , having made peace through the blood of his cross , by him to reconcile all things unto himself ; by him , I say , whether they be things in earth , or things in heaven .
2 : 8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit , after the tradition of men , after the rudiments of the world , and not after Christ .
3 : 1 If ye then be risen with Christ , seek those things which are above , where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God .
3 : 17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus , giving thanks to God and the Father by him .
They shall make known unto you all things which are done here .
4 : 16 And when this epistle is read among you , cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans ; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea .
Grace be with you .
2 : 5 For neither at any time used we flattering words , as ye know , nor a cloke of covetousness ; God is witness : 2 : 6 Nor of men sought we glory , neither of you , nor yet of others , when we might have been burdensome , as the apostles of Christ .
2 : 7 But we were gentle among you , even as a nurse cherisheth her children : 2 : 8 So being affectionately desirous of you , we were willing to have imparted unto you , not the gospel of God only , but also our own souls , because ye were dear unto us .
2 : 14 For ye , brethren , became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus : for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen , even as they have of the Jews : 2 : 15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus , and their own prophets , and have persecuted us ; and they please not God , and are contrary to all men : 2 : 16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved , to fill up their sins alway : for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost .
3 : 5 For this cause , when I could no longer forbear , I sent to know your faith , lest by some means the tempter have tempted you , and our labour be in vain .
3 : 12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another , and toward all men , even as we do toward you : 3 : 13 To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God , even our Father , at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints .
4 : 2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus .
4 : 8 He therefore that despiseth , despiseth not man , but God , who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit .
5 : 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil .
1 : 1 Paul , and Silvanus , and Timotheus , unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ : 1 : 2 Grace unto you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 11 Wherefore also we pray always for you , that our God would count you worthy of this calling , and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness , and the work of faith with power : 1 : 12 That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you , and ye in him , according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ .
2 : 13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you , brethren beloved of the Lord , because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth : 2 : 14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel , to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ .
3 : 10 For even when we were with you , this we commanded you , that if any would not work , neither should he eat .
The Lord be with you all .
3 : 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all .
1 : 18 This charge I commit unto thee , son Timothy , according to the prophecies which went before on thee , that thou by them mightest war a good warfare ; 1 : 19 Holding faith , and a good conscience ; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck : 1 : 20 Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander ; whom I have delivered unto Satan , that they may learn not to blaspheme .
2 : 1 I exhort therefore , that , first of all , supplications , prayers , intercessions , and giving of thanks , be made for all men ; 2 : 2 For kings , and for all that are in authority ; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty .
2 : 9 In like manner also , that women adorn themselves in modest apparel , with shamefacedness and sobriety ; not with broided hair , or gold , or pearls , or costly array ; 2 : 10 But ( which becometh women professing godliness ) with good works .
4 : 1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly , that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to seducing spirits , and doctrines of devils ; 4 : 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy ; having their conscience seared with a hot iron ; 4 : 3 Forbidding to marry , and commanding to abstain from meats , which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth .
4 : 6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things , thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ , nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine , whereunto thou hast attained .
4 : 9 This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation .
4 : 15 Meditate upon these things ; give thyself wholly to them ; that thy profiting may appear to all .
5 : 7 And these things give in charge , that they may be blameless .
5 : 8 But if any provide not for his own , and specially for those of his own house , he hath denied the faith , and is worse than an infidel .
6 : 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain .
6 : 7 For we brought nothing into this world , and it is certain we can carry nothing out .
1 : 12 For the which cause I also suffer these things : nevertheless I am not ashamed : for I know whom I have believed , and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day .
2 : 7 Consider what I say ; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things .
2 : 8 Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel : 2 : 9 Wherein I suffer trouble , as an evil doer , even unto bonds ; but the word of God is not bound .
2 : 20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver , but also of wood and of earth ; and some to honour , and some to dishonour .
2 : 24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive ; but be gentle unto all men , apt to teach , patient , 2 : 25 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves ; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth ; 2 : 26 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil , who are taken captive by him at his will .
3 : 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses , so do these also resist the truth : men of corrupt minds , reprobate concerning the faith .
4 : 18 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work , and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom : to whom be glory for ever and ever .
4 : 22 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit .
3 : 9 But avoid foolish questions , and genealogies , and contentions , and strivings about the law ; for they are unprofitable and vain .
3 : 15 All that are with me salute thee .
1 : 1 Paul , a prisoner of Jesus Christ , and Timothy our brother , unto Philemon our dearly beloved , and fellowlabourer , 1 : 2 And to our beloved Apphia , and Archippus our fellowsoldier , and to the church in thy house : 1 : 3 Grace to you , and peace , from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 8 Wherefore , though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient , 1 : 9 Yet for love ' s sake I rather beseech thee , being such an one as Paul the aged , and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ .
1 : 17 If thou count me therefore a partner , receive him as myself .
1 : 23 There salute thee Epaphras , my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus ; 1 : 24 Marcus , Aristarchus , Demas , Lucas , my fellowlabourers .
And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
But now we see not yet all things put under him .
2 : 9 But we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
2 : 17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
4 : 5 And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest .
4 : 9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
5 : 4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
5 : 7 Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ; 5 : 8 Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ; 5 : 9 And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ; 5 : 10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec .
5 : 14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
6 : 15 And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
7 : 4 Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
7 : 25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
7 : 28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
8 : 1 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ; 8 : 2 A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
9 : 2 For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
10 : 2 For then would they not have ceased to be offered ?
10 : 15 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before , 10 : 16 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ; 10 : 17 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more .
10 : 34 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
10 : 38 Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
11 : 1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
11 : 20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
12 : 5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him : 12 : 6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
12 : 7 If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
12 : 11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
12 : 17 For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
13 : 3 Remember them that are in bonds , as bound with them ; and them which suffer adversity , as being yourselves also in the body .
13 : 7 Remember them which have the rule over you , who have spoken unto you the word of God : whose faith follow , considering the end of their conversation .
13 : 13 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp , bearing his reproach .
13 : 23 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty ; with whom , if he come shortly , I will see you .
13 : 25 Grace be with you all .
Amen .
1 : 9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted : 1 : 10 But the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
1 : 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
3 : 1 My brethren , be not many masters , knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation .
If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
3 : 10 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing .
My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
3 : 18 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
4 : 9 Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
For what is your life ?
5 : 2 Your riches are corrupted , and your garments are motheaten .
5 : 8 Be ye also patient ; stablish your hearts : for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh .
5 : 10 Take , my brethren , the prophets , who have spoken in the name of the Lord , for an example of suffering affliction , and of patience .
5 : 11 Behold , we count them happy which endure .
Is any merry ?
let him call for the elders of the church ; and let them pray over him , anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord : 5 : 15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick , and the Lord shall raise him up ; and if he have committed sins , they shall be forgiven him .
The First Epistle General of Peter
2 : 7 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner , 2 : 8 And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
2 : 11 Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ; 2 : 12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
Love the brotherhood .
Honour the king .
2 : 25 For ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
3 : 1 Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ; 3 : 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
3 : 17 For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
3 : 21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God ,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ : 3 : 22 Who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
4 : 3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries : 4 : 4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you : 4 : 5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
4 : 10 As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
5 : 11 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever .
1 : 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
1 : 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
2 : 21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
3 : 5 For this they willingly are ignorant of , that by the word of God the heavens were of old , and the earth standing out of the water and in the water : 3 : 6 Whereby the world that then was , being overflowed with water , perished : 3 : 7 But the heavens and the earth , which are now , by the same word are kept in store , reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men .
3 : 13 Nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new heavens and a new earth , wherein dwelleth righteousness .
2 : 5 But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
2 : 16 For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
2 : 18 Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
2 : 20 But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
2 : 22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ?
3 : 1 Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
3 : 3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
3 : 10 In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
3 : 13 Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
3 : 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren .
3 : 23 And this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
4 : 2 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God : 4 : 3 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
4 : 14 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
5 : 1 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
5 : 9 If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
5 : 12 He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
5 : 13 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
5 : 21 Little children , keep yourselves from idols .
1 : 8 Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
1 : 10 If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed : 1 : 11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
1 : 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
1 : 10 Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
1 : 10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
1 : 3 Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
1 : 14 His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ; 1 : 15 And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
2 : 1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ; 2 : 2 I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars : 2 : 3 And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name ' s sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
2 : 22 Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
2 : 25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
2 : 26 And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations : 2 : 27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
3 : 3 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent .
3 : 5 He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
4 : 7 And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
5 : 6 And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
6 : 9 And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held : 6 : 10 And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
6 : 15 And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ; 6 : 16 And said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb : 6 : 17 For the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
7 : 4 And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand .
7 : 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
8 : 2 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
9 : 7 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
9 : 8 And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
9 : 11 And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
9 : 17 And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
10 : 4 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
10 : 5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven , 10 : 6 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer : 10 : 7 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
11 : 6 These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
11 : 13 And the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
12 : 5 And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
12 : 6 And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
12 : 7 And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels , 12 : 8 And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
13 : 5 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies ; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months .
13 : 13 And he doeth great wonders , so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men , 13 : 14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast ; saying to them that dwell on the earth , that they should make an image to the beast , which had the wound by a sword , and did live .
14 : 6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven , having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth , and to every nation , and kindred , and tongue , and people , 14 : 7 Saying with a loud voice , Fear God , and give glory to him ; for the hour of his judgment is come : and worship him that made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and the fountains of waters .
14 : 17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven , he also having a sharp sickle .
14 : 18 And another angel came out from the altar , which had power over fire ; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle , saying , Thrust in thy sharp sickle , and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth ; for her grapes are fully ripe .
14 : 20 And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress , even unto the horse bridles , by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs .
15 : 1 And I saw another sign in heaven , great and marvellous , seven angels having the seven last plagues ; for in them is filled up the wrath of God .
15 : 2 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire : and them that had gotten the victory over the beast , and over his image , and over his mark , and over the number of his name , stand on the sea of glass , having the harps of God .
16 : 1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels , Go your ways , and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth .
16 : 8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun ; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire .
16 : 20 And every island fled away , and the mountains were not found .
17 : 3 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness : and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast , full of names of blasphemy , having seven heads and ten horns .
17 : 7 And the angel said unto me , Wherefore didst thou marvel ?
17 : 8 The beast that thou sawest was , and is not ; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit , and go into perdition : and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder , whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world , when they behold the beast that was , and is not , and yet is .
18 : 1 And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven , having great power ; and the earth was lightened with his glory .
18 : 3 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication , and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her , and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies .
18 : 4 And I heard another voice from heaven , saying , Come out of her , my people , that ye be not partakers of her sins , and that ye receive not of her plagues .
for in one hour is thy judgment come .
18 : 14 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee , and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee , and thou shalt find them no more at all .
18 : 17 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought .
And every shipmaster , and all the company in ships , and sailors , and as many as trade by sea , stood afar off , 18 : 18 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning , saying , What city is like unto this great city !
19 : 8 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen , clean and white : for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints .
19 : 9 And he saith unto me , Write , Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb .
19 : 19 And I saw the beast , and the kings of the earth , and their armies , gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse , and against his army .
These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone .
20 : 12 And I saw the dead , small and great , stand before God ; and the books were opened : and another book was opened , which is the book of life : and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books , according to their works .
And he said unto me , Write : for these words are true and faithful .
I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely .
INTRODUCTION
" Pipe a song about a Lamb !
" Drop thy pipe , thy happy pipe ; Sing thy songs of happy cheer :!
" Piper , sit thee down and write In a book , that all may read .
THE SHEPHERD
Little Lamb , who make thee Dost thou know who made thee , Gave thee life , and bid thee feed By the stream and o ' er the mead ; Gave thee clothing of delight , Softest clothing , wolly , bright ; Gave thee such a tender voice , Making all the vales rejoice ?
When I from black and he from white cloud free , And round the tent of God like lambs we joy
"
Then naked and white , all their bags left behind , They rise upon clouds , and sport in the wind ; And the Angel told Tom , if he ' d be a good boy , He ' d have God for his father , and never want joy .
Speak , father , speak to you little boy , Or else I shall be lost .
when the meadows laugh with lively green , And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene , When Mary and Susan and Emily With their sweet round mouths sing " Ha , ha he !
Sleep , sleep , happy child !
Thou His image ever see , Heavenly face that smiles on thee !
DIVINE IMAGE
To Mercy , Pity , Peace , and Love , All pray in their distress , And to these virtues of delight Return their thankfulness .
HOLY THURSDAY
Farewell , green fields and happy grove , Where flocks have ta ' en delight .
"
Now it ' s mute !
Pitying , I dropped a tear : But I saw a glow - worm near , Who replied , " What wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night ?
Can a mother sit and hear An infant groan , an infant fear ?
never can it be !
Oh no !
"
" Selfish father of men !
Cruel , jealous , selfish fear !
And so many children poor ?
It is a land of poverty !
" Sweet sleep , come to me Underneath this tree ; Do father , mother , weep ?
" Lost in desert wild Is your little child .
How can Lyca sleep If her mother weep ?
" Frowning , frowning night , O ' er this desert bright Let thy moon arise , While I close my eyes .
Leopards , tigers , play Round her as she lay ; While the lion old Bowed his mane of gold ,
While the lioness Loosed her slender dress , And naked they conveyed To caves the sleeping maid .
Tired and woe - begone , Hoarse with making moan , Arm in arm , seven days They traced the desert ways .
Smelling to his prey ; But their fears allay When he licks their hands , And silent by them stands .
" Follow me ," he said ; " Weep not for the maid ; In my palace deep , Lyca lies asleep .
" in notes of woe !
" Where are thy father and mother ?
O rose , thou art sick !
The invisible worm , That flies in the night , In the howling storm ,
THE FLY
And I wept both night and day , And he wiped my tears away ; And I wept both day and night , And hid from him my heart ' s delight .
THE TIGER
In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes ?
What the hand dare seize the fire ?
A POISON TREE
And it grew both day and night , Till it bore an apple bright , And my foe beheld it shine , and he knew that it was mine , --
" Nought loves another as itself , Nor venerates another so , Nor is it possible to thought A greater than itself to know .
The Priest sat by and heard the child ; In trembling zeal he seized his hair , He led him by his little coat , And all admired the priestly care .
Once a youthful pair , Filled with softest care , Met in garden bright Where the holy light Had just removed the curtains of the night .
But to go to school in a summer morn , -- Oh it drives all joy away !
Whate ' er is born of mortal birth Must be consumed with the earth , To rise from generation free : Then what have I to do with thee ?
The death of Jesus set me free : Then what have I to do with thee ?
A DIVINE IMAGE
THE BOOK of THEL
Or wilt thou go ask the Mole : Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod ?
THE BOOK of THEL
Like the doves voice , like transient day , like music in the air : Ah !
Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks : For thou shall be clothed in light , and fed with morning manna : Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs To flourish in eternal vales : they why should Thel complain .
Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs Revives the milked cow , & tames the fire - breathing steed .
Descend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel .
The Cloud descended and the Lily bowd her modest head : And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass .
II .
O virgin know ' st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs Where Luvah doth renew his horses : lookst thou on my youth .
Till we arise link ' d in a golden band and never part : But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers .
Dost thou O little cloud ?
art thou but a Worm ?
O beauty of the vales of Har , we live not for ourselves , Thou seest me the meanest thing , and so I am indeed : My bosom of itself is cold , and of itself is dark ,
The daughter of beauty wip ' d her pitying tears with her white veil , And said , Alas !
And all thy moans flew o ' er my roof , but I have call ' d them down : Wilt thou O Queen enter my house , tis given thee to enter , And to return : fear nothing , enter with thy virgin feet .
The Virgin started from her seat , & with a shriek , Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har
There ' s a garden that I ken , Full of little gentlemen ; Little caps of blue they wear , And green ribbons , very fair .
)
By and by she heard another little _tap , tap , tap_ on the window - pane .
" N -- no ," said the little Tulip , " you can ' t come in .
" Who is there ?
We want to come in !
So she opened the door a little wee crack , and in they came .
" I will help you ; I will !
When she remembered this she held herself from sinking , and swayed here and there on the breeze , thinking ,-- thinking .
That rain was the Cloud ' s great deed ; it was her death , too ; but it was also her glory .
Over the whole country - side , as far as the rain fell , a lovely rainbow sprang its arch , and all the brightest rays of heaven made its colours ; it was the last greeting of a love so great that it sacrificed itself .
The little Red Hen was in the farmyard with her chickens , when she found a grain of wheat .
" Not I ," said the Goose .
When the wheat was ripe she said , " Who will take this wheat to the mill ?
"
Cluck !
THE GINGERBREAD MAN
Once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man , and they lived all alone in a little old house .
When the little old woman had rolled him out , and dressed him up , and pinched his gingerbread shoes into shape , she put him in a pan ; then she put the pan in the oven and shut the door ; and she thought , " Now I shall have a little boy of my own .
When it was time for the Gingerbread Boy to be done she opened the oven door and pulled out the pan .
The little old woman and the little old man ran after him as fast as they could , but he just laughed , and shouted ,--
" Run !
And , as the cow chased him , he looked over his shoulder and cried ,--
" You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !
" A cow ,
And , as the horse chased him , he looked over his shoulder and cried ,--
" You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !
When the threshers smelt the Gingerbread Boy , they tried to pick him up , and said , " Don ' t run so fast , little Gingerbread Boy ; you look very good to eat .
" A cow ,
" A little old man ,
" A horse ,
" The fox began to run faster , and the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster , and as he ran he chuckled ,--
When he was a little way from the bank he turned his head , and said , " You are too heavy on my tail , little Gingerbread Boy , I fear I shall let you get wet ; jump on my back .
little Gingerbread Boy , my shoulder is sinking ; jump on my nose , and I can hold you out of water .
" Dear me !
" The next minute he said , " Why , I am half gone !
"
"
And they ran , ran , ran very fast , and the Lion did not catch them that time .
" Oh , Father Jackal , Father Jackal !
Why didn ' t you come before ?
" Indeed , Father Lion ," he said , " we meant to come before ; we knew we ought to come before ; and we wanted to come before ; but every time we started to come , a dreadful great lion came out of the woods and roared at us , and frightened us so that we ran away .
And he is as much bigger than you as you are bigger than I !
Ao !
Ao !
The very first place that the City Mouse took the Country Mouse to see was the kitchen cupboard of the house where he lived .
He ran along the shelf and nibbled at a cheese here , and a bit of butter there , until he saw an especially rich , very delicious - smelling piece of cheese on a queer little stand in a corner .
" That thing is a trap ," said the little City Mouse .
" His mother pushed him about in her sleep , until her slumber became too sound ; then she stopped .
" cried Little Jack Rollaround ; and the little boat sailed faster up the wall , across the ceiling , down the wall , and over the floor .
And Little Jack Rollaround sailed his trundle - bed boat up the beam , through the keyhole , and into the street .
So the good Moon made a light and went along with him , and the little trundle - bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of the village .
" Come along , old Moon , and make a light !
" cried the little boy ; and the trundle - bed went trundling among the trees in the great wood , scaring up the squirrels and startling the little leaves on the trees .
This was too much for the good Moon ; he put out his big light , all at once , and left the sky pitch - black .
" she said .
One day little Brother Rabbit was running along on the sand , lippety , lippety , when he saw the Whale and the Elephant talking together .
This was what they were saying :--
" You are the biggest thing on the land , Brother Elephant ," said the Whale , " and I am the biggest thing in the sea ; if we join together we can rule all the animals in the world , and have our way about everything .
" They won ' t rule me ," he said .
But you are so strong and so obliging , that I venture to trust you will help me out .
"
" Huh !
Little Brother Rabbit tied the rope - end to the Whale , and ran off , lippety , lippety , till he came to the place where the Elephant was .
When you hear that , pull ; pull as hard as you can , for my cow is very heavy .
The reason was , of course , that the Elephant had something solid to brace against , and , beside , as fast as he pulled the rope in a little , he took a turn with it round his trunk !
And they began to pull again .
So that broke up the bargain between them .
It was just half a chicken .
But as soon as it could walk the little Half - Chick showed a most headstrong spirit , worse than any of its brothers .
It would not mind , and it would go wherever it wanted to ; it walked with a funny little hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , and got along pretty fast .
"
" I ' m for seeing the King ," he said ; " this life is too quiet for me .
" Little Half - Chick ," said the Wind , " you are just in time to help me ; if you will brush aside these twigs and leaves , I can get my breath ; help me , quickly !
After a while he came to Madrid and to the palace of the King .
The little Half - Chick cried out ,--
"
In the air he was caught by a breeze and taken up higher than the trees .
He cannot hoppity - kick any more , but he turns slowly round when the wind blows , and keeps his head toward it , to hear what it says .
THE BLACKBERRY - BUSH
" she said , smoothing his soft , honey - coloured hair .
Then the snow will melt again and icy rain will clothe me , and the bitter wind will rattle my bare twigs up and down .
I take the snow and the rain and the cold , and I am not sorry , but glad ; for in my roots I feel warmth and life , and I know that a store of greenness and beauty is shut up safe in my small brown buds .
" Ah !
The little boy comes running to look at me , and cries , " Oh , mamma !
the little blackberry - bush is alive and beautiful and green .
"' A few days more , and I drop the white petals down among the grass , and , lo !
Carefully I hold them up to the sun ; carefully I gather the dew in the summer nights ; slowly they ripen ; they grow larger and redder and darker , and at last they are black , shining , delicious .
Up the airy mountain , Down the rushy glen , We daren ' t go a - hunting For fear of little men .
Wee folk , good folk , Trooping all together ; Green jacket , red cap , And white owl ' s feather !
They have kept her ever since Deep within the lake , On a bed of flag - leaves , Watching till she wake .
Wee folk , good folk , Trooping all together ; Green jacket , red cap , And white owl ' s feather !
Once upon a time , there was a little brown Field Mouse ; and one day he was out in the fields to see what he could find .
" What for ?
"
The little Field Mouse looked all about the room as fast as he could , but he could not see any acorn .
Then he thought he would go back up the tiny stairs to his own home .
But the little door was locked , and the little Red Man had the key .
And every day the little Red Man went away through the tiny door , and did not come back till afternoon .
At last , one day he was in such a hurry that he turned the key before the door was quite latched , which , of course , didn ' t lock it at all .
He went away without noticing ,-- he was in such a hurry .
Many and many a night this old Fox used to lie awake and think to himself how good that little Red Hen would taste if he could once get her in his big kettle and boil her for dinner .
But he couldn ' t catch the little Red Hen , because she was too wise for him .
" Then he took a big bag and slung it over his shoulder , and walked till he came to the little Red Hen ' s house .
So the old Fox hid behind the wood - pile , and as soon as she bent down to get a stick , into the house he slipped , and scurried behind the door .
And as he spun , and spun , and spun , faster , and faster , and faster , the poor little Red Hen got so dizzy watching him that she couldn ' t hold on to the perch .
She dropped off , and the old Fox picked her up and put her in his bag , slung the bag over his shoulder , and started for home , where the kettle was boiling .
But he was so pleased to think of the supper he was going to have that he did not mind that at all .
In went the stone and out came the boiling water , all over the old Fox and the old Fox ' s mother !
There lived out o ' er the hill , In a great din o ' rocks , A crafty , shly , and wicked Ould folly iv a Fox .
"
she was so schared Wid such a wondrous sight , She dropped her apronful of shticks , An ' flew up in a fright ,
Thin she betho ' t hersel ', An ' tuk her schissors out , An ' shnipped a big hole in the bag , So she could look about .
" Have ye the pot a - bilin '?
Epaminondas took it in his fist and held it all crunched up tight , like this , and came along home .
"
When he got home , all the butter Epaminondas had was _on him_ .
" Yes , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
Epaminondas , what you got there ?
" My gracious sakes alive , Epaminondas , you ain ' t got the sense you was born with !
The way to carry a puppy - dog is to take a long piece of string and tie one end of it round the puppy - dog ' s neck and put the puppy - dog on the ground , and take hold of the other end of the string and come along home , like this .
" All right , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
" said his Mammy .
Now I ain ' t gwine tell you any more ways to bring truck home .
The six mince pies sat cooling in a row on the doorstep .
And then ,-- and then ,-- Epaminondas _was_ careful how he stepped on those pies !
But you can guess .
THE BOY WHO CRIED " WOLF !
" Wolf !
But when they got there the boy laughed at them for their pains ; there was no wolf there .
Still another day the boy tried the same trick , and the villagers came running to help and got laughed at again .
The villagers heard him , but they thought it was another mean trick ; no one paid the least attention , or went near him .
Jove sent an eel .
" I will give you a king such as you deserve !
" he said ; and he sent them a Stork .
He was indeed a king worthy of them !
THE SUN AND THE WIND
The old Alligator was hidden away beneath the mud and bulrush leaves , and he couldn ' t see anything .
" So he opened his mouth and let the little Jackal go .
_So_ kind of you to let me go !
He didn ' t see the old Alligator , but he thought to himself , " I think I ' ll not take any chances .
Still , he did not mean to take any chances .
"
"
The old Alligator was so furious that he crawled up on the bank and went after the little Jackal ; but , dear , dear , he couldn ' t catch the little Jackal ; he ran far too fast .
Now the old Alligator found this out , and he made up his mind to have the little Jackal for supper , or to die trying .
So he crept , and crawled , and dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs .
He ran out of the garden like the wind .
Then he crept and crawled inside , and hid himself there in the house , to wait till the little Jackal should come home .
By and by the little Jackal came dancing home , happy and free from care ,-- _but_ looking all around .
what ' s this ?
" How strange that my little House doesn ' t speak to me !
Then he went and gathered firewood , and more firewood , and more firewood ; and he piled it all up solid against the door and round the house ; and then he set fire to it !
"
She was very pretty , and ever so strong ; she could run for miles through the woods and not get tired .
Louisa liked theatricals better than anything .
But better than fun or writing Louisa loved her mother , and by and by , as the little girl began to grow into a big girl , she felt very sad to see her dear mother work so hard .
Every bit of money she earned , except what she had to use , she gave to her dear family .
And so she wrote a story and put all that in it ; she put her dear mother and her wise father in it , and all the little sisters , and besides the jolly times and the plays , she put the sad , hard times in ,-- the work and worry and going without things .
But I think the most beautiful thing about her is what I have been telling you : that she loved her mother so well that she gave her whole life to make her happy .
When she had unkind or dissatisfied thoughts , she tried to get rid of them by playing they were enemies of the kingdom ; and she drove them out with soldiers ; the soldiers were patience , duty , and love .
It used to help Louisa to be good to play this , and I think it may have helped make her the splendid woman she was afterward .
A little kingdom I possess , Where thoughts and feelings dwell , And very hard I find the task Of governing it well ; For passion tempts and troubles me , A wayward will misleads , And selfishness its shadow casts On all my words and deeds .
' Tis seldom Fortune such favour grants As fell to this little maid of France .
No gifts for Piccola !
And full of faith , when at last she woke , She stole to her shoe as the morning broke ; Such sounds of gladness filled all the air , Twas plain St Nicholas had been there !
" she cried , And mother and father must peep inside .
In the far - off land of France , they say , Still do they live to this very day .
It was not until several years later that , in rereading Andersen for other purposes , I came upon the real story of the Little Fir Tree , and read it for myself .
I give this explanation that the reader may know I do not presume to offer the little tale which follows as an " adaptation " of Andersen ' s famous story .
And then the Little Fir Tree began to see life .
But always when they saw the Little Fir Tree they shook their heads and said ,--
" We ' ll take this one ; it is just little enough !
Why was this glory for him ?
It grew dusk , and the Little Fir Tree began to hear strange sounds through the closed doors .
All at once , the doors opened and the two children came in .
Two of the pretty ladies were with them .
Presently one little weak child - voice called out ,--
" It ' s the nicest Christmas tree I ever saw !
"
They made the Israelites slaves .
How could she save him from death ?
So the maiden went , and brought her mother !
Was not that a strange thing ?
The mother kept him until he was old enough to be taken to the princess ' s palace .
Once upon a time there was a dear little girl , whose name was Elsa .
Elsa ' s father and mother worked very hard and became rich .
There were so many things to be done in the house , and she did not know how to do any of them !
" or " How shall I do that ?
Little Elsa cried bitterly when he was gone , for she did not want to make her husband unhappy and cross , and she wanted the house to look nice .
" Oh , dear ," she sobbed , " I wish I could do things right !
Then I could keep the house !
"
As she said the words , a great grey man stood before her ; he was wrapped in a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot ; and he smiled at Elsa .
" Now stretch out your little useless fingers , dear !
Hop , hop !
And so it went , all day .
"
At last there came a day when he had nothing left but one piece of leather , big enough to make one pair of shoes .
There was no sign of anyone having been there .
Happily , he cut them out , and then , as it was late , he left the pieces on the bench , ready to sew in the morning .
No one ever worked so fast as they .
The shoemaker and his wife looked at each other , and said , " How can we thank the little elves who have made us happy and prosperous ?
" I will make the shoes if you will make the coats ," said her husband .
At last they began to dance , and when the clock struck two , they danced quite away , out of the window .
" Certainly ," said the Mouse - deer , " go along .
" I shall go to King Solomon ," said the Otter , " and you shall be punished .
Soon the Mouse - deer was called before King Solomon .
" Send for the Woodpecker ," said King Solomon .
" Yes , your Majesty ," said the Woodpecker , " but I had to .
"
" I put it on , your Majesty ," said the Tortoise , " because I saw the King - crab trailing his three - edged pike .
Then the King - crab was sent for .
" Because , your Majesty ," said the Crayfish , " I saw the Otter coming down to the river to kill my children .
"
I like to lie and wait to see My mother braid her hair .
I love my mother ' s hair .
THE BRAHMIN , THE TIGER , AND THE JACKAL
" Never , Brother Brahmin !
"
" Brother Banyan ," said the Brahmin , eagerly , " does it seem to you right or just that this Tiger should eat me , when I set him free from his cage ?
Now that I am old and weak and cannot work , he leaves me without food or water , to die by the wayside .
"
" Oh , Brother Eagle , Brother Eagle !
Tell us if it seems to you fair that this Tiger should eat me up , when I have just saved him from a frightful cage ?
Yet as often as they find my eyrie , men stone my young and rob my nest and shoot at me with arrows .
Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin !
The poor Brahmin had to remind him , again and again , that they had asked only four .
" he begged .
After a time , they met the little Jackal , coming gaily down the road toward them .
" Cage ?
Do you think ----"
" Oh ," said the little Jackal , " you want my opinion ?
" But I don ' t altogether understand ," said the little Jackal .
" It was this way : I was walking along , and I saw the Tiger ----"
Then I can understand in a jiffy .
"
So the Brahmin , the Tiger , and the little Jackal walked back together to the spot where the cage was .
" Oh , I beg your pardon , Father Tiger ," said the little Jackal , " I really am _so_ stupid ; I cannot _quite_ understand what happened .
" I stood here ," said the Tiger , leaping into the cage , " with my head over my shoulder , so .
" Yes ; but I don ' t see any lock ," said the little Jackal , " does it lock on the outside ?
" Oh , does it , indeed ?
As for you , my friend ," he said to the Tiger , " I think you will wait a good while before you ' ll find anyone to let you out again !
" Your way lies that way , and mine lies this ; good - bye !
"
The little Jackal was , as you know , exceedingly fond of shell - fish , especially of river crabs .
" Indeed I will ," said the Camel , who was very fond of sugar - cane .
The Camel was perfectly willing , so the little Jackal jumped on his back , and the Camel swam across the river , carrying him .
" The idea of your making such a noise , with your shouting and singing !
" said the Camel .
There he stopped , and said ,--
" Oh , Jackal !
" I have the strangest feeling ," said the Camel ,--" I feel as if I must roll over .
"
And the little Jackal was drowned , for his sins , but the Camel came safely home .
The story I am going to tell you is about something that really happened , many years ago .
All their lives now depended on the crops of grain and vegetables which they could raise in the valley .
No farmer ' s garden could have looked better than the great garden of the desert valley .
One day , the men who were watering the crops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the edge of the gardens nearest the mountains .
And still more and more , till it was like an army of black , hopping , crawling crickets , streaming down the side of the mountain to kill the crops .
The men tried to kill the crickets by beating them down , but the numbers were so great that it was like beating at the sea .
They started fires ; they dug trenches and filled them with water ; they ran wildly about in the fields , killing what they could .
The gulls flew overhead , with a shrill chorus of whimpering cries , and then , in a marvellous white cloud of outspread wings and hovering breasts , they settled down over the cultivated ground .
they will strip root and branch !
"
THE NIGHTINGALE
A long , long time ago , as long ago as when there were fairies , there lived an emperor in China , who had a most beautiful palace , all made of crystal .
"
At last it happened that the Emperor came upon a book which said this , and he at once sent for his Chamberlain .
"
"
The Chamberlain went out and asked all the great lords and ladies and pages where the Nightingale could be found , but not one of them had ever heard of him .
So the Chamberlain went back to the Emperor and said , " There is no such person .
"
The Chamberlain asked the maid to take him to the Nightingale ' s home , and many of the lords and ladies followed after .
"
"
She is so pale that I think she has lost her colour for fear of us .
"
And when the courtiers met each other in the halls , one would say " Night ," and the other would say " ingale ," and that was supposed to be conversation .
" Inside was an artificial bird , something like a Nightingale , only it was made of gold , and silver , and rubies , and emeralds , and diamonds .
She had taken the chance , while everybody was listening to the waltz tunes , to fly away through the window to her own greenwood .
" said the lords and ladies .
The people in the court liked her even better than the old Nightingale , because they could all whistle her tunes ,-- which you can ' t do with real nightingales .
They whispered , " _Do you remember this ? _ " " _Do you remember that ? _ " The Emperor remembered so much that he cried out loud , " Oh , bring the great drum !
Make music , so that I may not hear these dreadful whispers !
" But there was nobody there to bring the drum .
" But there was nobody to wind the little gold nightingale up , and of course it could not sing .
"
" said the little grey Nightingale .
" Yes ," said Death ; and the little Nightingale bought the Emperor ' s sceptre for another song .
Stay with me on this little gold perch , and sing to me always !
After the little Nightingale had flown away , the Emperor felt so well and strong that he dressed himself in his royal robes and took his gold sceptre in his hand .
Margery was delighted .
So it was soon agreed that the garden should be the first thing attended to .
It was on the grass plot that the garden was to be .
" What is a salad garden ?
" It is a garden where you have all the things that make nice salad ," said her mother , laughing , for Margery was fond of salads ; " you have lettuce , and endive , and mustard and cress , and parsley , and radishes , and beetroot , and young onions .
" said Margery .
" I wouldn ' t _not_ take care of it for anything !
Two evenings after that , when Margery was called in from her first ramble in the fields , she found the postman at the door .
It was a box , quite a big box , with a label on it that said :--
This one was like a three - cornered platform of wood , with a long , curved , strong rake under it .
It was called a harrow , and it looked like the diagram on the next page .
The man ' s weight kept the harrow steady , and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up , so that it did not stay in ridges .
After the ploughing and harrowing , the man drove off , and Margery ' s father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late afternoons , when he came home from business ; they could not afford too much help , he said , and he had learned to take care of a garden when he was a boy .
Every bit of that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade , and then the clods which were full of grass - roots had to be taken on a fork and shaken , till the earth fell out ; when the grass was thrown to one side .
Margery and her mother helped .
" Now for the seed ," said father .
" she asked .
They planted peas , beans , spinach , carrots , and parsnips .
It is fun to do it .
Then you rake very gently over the surface , with the back of a rake , to even it all off .
He knew very well that the old grass would begin to come through again on such soil , and that it would make terribly hard weeding .
This tramped out a path just wide enough for a person to walk .
Between the flowers and the middle path went the seeds for that wonderful salad garden ; all the things Mrs Brown had named to Margery were there .
They were so tiny that it did not seem possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them .
But they surely would .
To be sure , she knew that the seeds could not sprout in a single night , but she had a feeling that _something_ might happen at any moment .
Tiny green leaves , a whole row of them , were pushing their way through the crust !
But about the third day , while Margery was stooping over the radishes , she saw something very , very small and green , peeping above ground , where the lettuce was planted .
Could it be weeds ?
They don ' t look alike when they are on the table !
Day by day the lettuce grew , and soon the little round leaves were easier to examine ; they certainly were very much like radish leaves .
The next day and the next they grew , until the beet leaves were big enough to see .
Then she looked again .
" Do you suppose we can have planted _all_ radishes ?
For those little beet leaves were almost round , and they grew two on a stem , precisely like the lettuce and the radish ; except for the size , all three rows looked alike .
"
" I think that is interesting ," said Margery .
" Indeed , no ," said father .
" Even some of the trees look like this when they first come through ; you would not think a birch tree could look like a vegetable or a flower , would you ?
"
She enjoyed the company of the Ducks , because she could talk with them to her heart ' s content ; the Tortoise liked to talk .
" But she didn ' t .
The choir was chanting the Latin service , and as the beautiful voices swelled louder , the king noticed one particular verse which seemed to be repeated again and again .
He turned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant , for he knew no Latin .
" and he sneered at the beautiful singing , as he leaned back in his place .
When he awoke the church was dark and still , and he was all alone .
The king on the throne looked at him .
But each time Robert threw back his head and answered , proudly , " I am the king !
At the end of three years , the Pope called the Emperor of Allemaine and the King of Sicily , his brothers , to a great meeting in his city of Rome .
It was Holy Week , and the king and the emperor , with all their trains , went every day to the great services in the cathedral .
Robert of Sicily bowed his head .
" Thou knowest best ," he said , " I only know that I have sinned .
"
He was king .
He did such fine work that the Elector , Prince Johann Wilhelm , ordered a portrait statue of himself , on horseback , to be done in bronze .
He could not look enough , and presently he turned to the artist and shook hands with him , like an old friend .
But at last one of them said , with an air of great frankness , " Indeed , Herr Grupello , the portrait of his Royal Highness is perfect ; but permit me to say that the statue of the horse is not quite so successful : the head is too large ; it is out of proportion .
The Elector assented , and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be built around the statue , so that his assistants could work undisturbed .
Once more the artist summoned the prince and his courtiers , and once more the statue was unveiled .
"
" I am glad they are pleased ," he said , " but the fact is , I have changed nothing !
" Gladly ," said the great fairy ; " choose what I shall give him .
Make him the best prince in the world , I beg you !
I can give him good advice , reprove him when he does wrong , and punish him if he will not punish himself ; I can and will be his best friend , but I cannot make him good unless he wills it .
One night , when he was all alone in his room , a soft and lovely light suddenly shone before him , and a beautiful vision stood at his side .
She was clad in robes of dazzling white , and on her shining hair she wore a wreath of white roses .
"
When he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him .
" said the prince , crossly .
Then he thought he should be perfectly happy , having his own way ; but instead , he grew more unhappy as he grew less good .
" It would be a disgrace to you to have it said that one of your subjects dared disobey you !
" said the courtier .
Prince Cherry went at once to Zelia ' s dungeon , prepared to do this cruel thing .
As his servants left him , to carry out the wicked order , there was a clash , as of thunder , in the room , and then a blinding light .
With horror , the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster .
Prince Cherry had been struck by lightning and killed , was the news , and the five favourite courtiers had struggled to make themselves rulers , but the people had refused them , and offered the crown to Suliman , the good old tutor .
Life was very terrible to the prince , now , but he began to see that he had brought all his sorrow on himself , and he tried to bear it patiently .
The worst to bear was the cruelty of the keeper .
" Good enough !
He killed the tiger and saved the keeper ' s life .
As he crouched at the keeper ' s feet , a voice said , " Good actions never go unrewarded !
But in order to keep the little dog from growing , the queen ordered that he should be fed very little , and that was pretty hard for the poor prince .
He was often half starved , although so much petted .
If you will , I will love you always .
" Ah , Zelia , see what you have done !
" Zelia has broken your spell ," she said to the prince , " as I meant she should , when you were worthy of her love .
The three sons were bitterly disappointed to have all their work for nothing .
"
Now there is something very surprising about this statue : it was the first one that was ever made in America in honour of a woman .
This is her story , and it tells why people made a monument for her .
She was poor , but she was strong , and knew how to work .
But Margaret was .
In the very hardest times that was often all the food the poor children had .
Margaret was so careful and so good at business that , in spite of her giving , she bought more cows and earned more money .
With this , she built a home for orphan babies ; she called it her baby house .
When the people of New Orleans knew that Margaret was dead , they said , " She was a mother to the motherless ; she was a friend to those who had no friends ; she had wisdom greater than schools can teach ; we will not let her memory go from us .
One of the prettiest legends is the story I am going to tell you about the Dagda ' s harp .
The harp was beautiful to look upon , mighty in size , made of rare wood , and ornamented with gold and jewels ; and it had wonderful music in its strings , which only the Dagda could call out .
Then they thought they were safe , and they turned aside into a vacant castle , by the road , and sat down to a banquet , hanging the stolen harp on the wall .
The Dagda , with two or three of his warriors , had followed hard on their track .
And the Dagda took his harp and swept his hand across the strings in three great , solemn chords .
Again the Dagda touched the strings , and this time the magic Music of Mirth leaped from the harp .
THE TAILOR AND THE THREE BEASTS
There was once a tailor in Galway , and he started out on a journey to go to the king ' s court at Dublin .
"
"
"
The tailor went forward next day , and the fox met him .
" God save you ," said the lion .
"
" I ' ll do that for you ," said the tailor .
When the plough was made he put a hole in the beam of it , and got the lion to go in under the plough so that he might see if he was any good as a ploughman .
After this there was only the one giant left , and he never came again until the court was finished .
" I ' ll do a thing now that you will not dare to do ," said the tailor .
He went to the king then , and desired him to send him out his wife and his money , saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not do so immediately .
" They therefore set the fox free .
When the tailor saw them coming , he got out of the coach with his wife , and he sat down on the ground .
"
" No !
They all left him then and returned .
There are many such stories , each different from the other , all showing that the same childlike spirit of inquiry was at work in different places , striving to find an answer to this riddle of nature .
But no one guessed that these were really Giant - Maidens who bore a grudge against all of the race of Odin .
'"
Presently Frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were performing their task diligently .
Now it was early summer - time , and the cuckoo was calling all the day and most of the night .
Presently , as the great stones moved round and round , Frode , who still stood by , heard one chant in a low , sing - song voice ,--
"
So they ground and ground ; and in the middle of the night , being weary , they asked the sea - king if he had not got salt enough .
She stood , light as air , on a great , shining , golden ball , which rolled along with her , swifter than the wind .
As she passed the travellers , she turned her face to them and smiled .
" She has an easy time of it !
"
No , thank you !
" And in an instant he had leaped on the horse , and headed him for the castle of fortune .
" How do you like shank ' s pony ?
Then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride , so he pulled his hat over his eyes , and settled himself for a nap .
That _was_ a sleep !
The donkey was slow , and he was hard to ride , but he was better than nothing ; and gradually the lazy man saw the towers of the castle draw nearer .
Not a step would he budge for all the coaxing and scolding and beating his rider could give .
The lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen , scratched his hands on the stumps , tore his face in the briers , and bumped his knees on the stones .
He would have laid down to sleep again , but he could hear now the howls of hungry wolves in the woods ; that it did not sound pleasant .
It gave him a shudder , and he hesitated ; but at that moment he heard a distant clock strike .
There was still time to reach the castle of fortune , but no more than enough ; so he mounted his new steed and rode on once more .
After a while , however , he pushed his way out of the woods into the open , and there stood the castle , only a little way ahead !
If the man had run for it , he could still have reached the castle , but , instead , he sat still and shouted for a horse .
Eleven !
The clock struck twelve !
And ever afterward she was his friend , helping him not only to happiness for himself , but also showing him how to help others , wherever he went .

"
" Go ," said Saul , " and the Lord be with thee !
And the Philistine came on and drew near to David ; and the man that bore his shield went before him .
And when he was a little way from him , he put his hand in his bag , and took from thence a stone , and put it in his sling , and slung it , and smote the Philistine in the forehead , so that the stone sank into his forehead ; and he fell on his face to the earth .
And David ran , and stood upon the Philistine , and took his sword , and drew it out of its sheath , and slew him with it .
And after the battle , David was taken to the king ' s tent , and made a captain over many men ; and he went no more to his father ' s house , to herd the sheep , but became a man , in the king ' s service .
But when King Saul died , the people chose David for their king , because there was no one so brave , so wise , or so faithful to God .
He restoreth my soul ; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name ' s sake .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
He lived high up on the mountainside in a tiny cave ; his food was roots and acorns , a bit of bread given by a peasant , or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his prayers ; his work was praying , and thinking about God .
But when he came , after a long , tiring walk to the village , and the square , alas !
The hermit stood and looked at him with terror and sadness , for he felt that he was looking at his own soul .
And when he had stopped and the crowd had left , the hermit went and drew the man aside to a place where they could rest ; for he wanted more than anything else on earth to know what the man ' s soul was like , because what it was , his was .
" asked the hermit , painfully .
" When all was dark and still , I stole like a cat to where she lay bound .
" No !
Father , you mock me !
" said the clown .
But when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel ' s answer , the poor clown was transfigured with joy , for he knew that his sins were forgiven .
Together they lived , and worked , and helped the poor .
Then , one day , the wish once more came , to know how his work was growing , and once more he prayed that he might see a being --
He longed greatly to know what the souls of the two women were like , and from their looks he could see only that they were gentle and honest .
To be sure , twice every year , when they killed a sheep for food , they gave half to their poorer neighbours .
Endless , endless ways there are , that only the Heavenly Father sees .
He could only sit and brood , while his young heart swelled and a lump rose in his throat at the thought that he could do nothing .
Was not the Christ Child born on Christmas Day , and did not He send good gifts to men on His birthday ?
But then came the thought , " He will never find us .
But others were up before him , for , to his surprise , he saw a strange gentleman with his mother .
" Rather be grateful to your little son , and to the good Lord to whom he wrote for aid .
" But Gottlieb answered him humbly , " Nay , sir , the Christ Child sent them , for He put the thought in your heart .
Said the Palm , " I will choose my biggest leaf and place it as a fan beside the manger to waft soft air to the Child .
"
Overhead , the blazing sun shone in all his noonday glory .
Ever since the first pink blush of dawn , the modest Dewdrop had gazed fixedly down upon the rich gem , but feared to address a person of such exalted consequence .
" A relative of yours , I presume , Sire ?
Away , sir , pass on !
The _idea_ of placing ME upon the same level -- in the same family , as a low - born , mean , insignificant , utterly valueless ----" Here the Diamond fairly choked for breath .
" the Beetle ventured to interpose , though with a very timid air .
"
" pondered the Beetle as he continued his homeward way .
I
He heard Sammy Jay way off in the distance screaming , " Thief !
" Must be that Chatterer got out of bed the wrong way this morning ," thought he .
He heard the sweet voices of happy little singers , and they were good to hear .
" I ' m going fishing ," said he in his deep grumbly - rumbly voice to no one in particular .
" Yes , Sir , I ' m going fishing .
Who was it ?
Little Joe Otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the Laughing Brook .
" Come and get it .
[ Illustration : " Here ' s your trout , Mr .
The fact is , he was afraid to .
" And while he was wondering , he ate it all up .
"
Of course that wasn ' t nice talk and anything but a nice spirit , but Little Joe Otter ' s temper is sometimes pretty short , especially when he is hungry , and this time he had had no breakfast , you know .
" asked Billy Mink .
" He ' s somewhere up the Laughing Brook .
Billy Mink just had to laugh .
So the two little brown - coated scamps turned down the Laughing Brook , taking the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves .
" He ' s fishing !
When he had eaten the trout he had caught , he moved along to the next little pool .
BUSTER BEAR IS GREATLY PUZZLED
Then he sat down close to the edge of it and didn ' t move .
At the next little pool the same thing happened .
No wonder he felt good !
" It ' s of no use to try to fish here .
I ' ll try the next pool .
It was puzzling .
He looked this way and he looked that way suspiciously , but there was no one to be seen .
I don ' t understand it at all .
" A sudden thought had popped into his head .
"
" You ' re pretty smart , Mr .
The truth is , he thought all the time that he was preventing Buster Bear from getting a breakfast .
But when they discovered that Buster Bear was a fisherman , they made up their minds that something had got to be done .
Now Buster Bear is very smart .
So this morning he only went far enough to make sure that if Little Joe were watching for him , as he was sure he would be , he would see him coming .
Then he went off laughing fit to kill himself .
Little Joe couldn ' t find a word to say .
And Billy Mink , who had been watching , ate the fat trout .
That is the way with Grandfather Frog .
He is very old and very wise .
So did Jerry Muskrat , who had been listening .
Of course this made Little Joe angrier than ever .
He said a lot of unkind things about Buster Bear and about Billy Mink and Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat , because they had laughed at the smartness of Buster .
He may be a bully , because great big people are very apt to be bullies , and though I haven ' t seen him , I guess Buster Bear is big enough from all I have heard , but I don ' t see how he is a thief ," said Grandfather Frog .
" They were no more your fish than mine ," protested Billy Mink .
" growled Little Joe .
" snapped Little Joe .
" What have foolish green flies got to do with my -- I mean _our_ fish ?
You ' re getting foolish in your old age ," retorted Little Joe .
As for all those who live in or along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool , they let Little Joe have his own way in everything .
Grandfather Frog knew it and shook his head very soberly when Little Joe had been disrespectful to him .
It seemed to Little Joe that he never would come .
At last , when he was almost ready to give up , he saw Buster Bear shuffling along towards the Laughing Brook .
" I caught it especially for you .
You see , he is just as fond of fishing as is Little Joe Otter or Billy Mink or Buster Bear .
So he whistled as he tramped along , and his whistle was good to hear .
What ' s this ?
" Somebody _has_ been fishing here , and they have had better luck than I have ," thought he .
Billy sometimes catches more fish than he can eat , but then he usually hides them .
But there is only one thing that can make the hair on the head of Farmer Brown ' s boy rise , and as it isn ' t anger , of course it must be fear .
But he didn ' t , and so he suddenly made up his mind that he didn ' t want to fish any more that day .
Mr . and Mrs . Redwing were there , and Blacky the Crow was sitting in the Big Hickory - tree .
[ Illustration : Reddy glared across the Smiling Pool at Peter .
" Don ' t be too sure of that !
"
Then Blacky the Crow leaned down from his perch in the Big Hickory - tree and looked very hard at Little Joe as he said :
" I don ' t care whether you believe it or not ; it ' s true ," he retorted .
Isn ' t that great news ?
Trust Peter for that !
You see , they had all been afraid of Farmer Brown ' s boy for so long that they were tickled almost to pieces at the very thought of having some one in the Green Forest who could make Farmer Brown ' s boy feel fear as they had felt it .
" Ah wish Brer Bear would go up to Farmer Brown ' s henhouse and scare Farmer Brown ' s boy so that he would keep away from there .
"
" That ' s telling ," said he .
" I want to think it over .
He is one of the smartest and cleverest of all the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest , and all the others know it .
The more exciting it is , the better he likes it .
In the first place he felt very important , and you know Blacky dearly loves to feel important .
On the bank on one side of the Smiling Pool were Peter Rabbit , Jumper the Hare , Danny Meadow Mouse , Johnny Chuck , Jimmy Skunk , Unc ' Billy Possum , Striped Chipmunk and Old Mr . Toad .
" To - morrow morning , very early , Sammy Jay and I will make a great fuss near the edge of the Green Forest .
If he runs away , I will be the first to admit that Buster Bear is as great a hero as some of you seem to think he is .
Right away everybody began to talk at the same time .
Right away Blacky began to scream at the top of his lungs .
Blacky didn ' t know what to make of it .
Now all this time the other little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on .
" he shouted .
It seemed as if Farmer Brown ' s boy never would come out , but at last he did .
Farmer Brown ' s boy took the two pails of milk into the house , then out he came and started straight for the Green Forest .
So at the same time Farmer Brown ' s boy started for the Green Forest , this other listener started towards the place where Blacky and Sammy were making such a racket .
XIII
Now tell me true , _I ' d_ run the best I could .
When Farmer Brown ' s boy came hurrying home from the Laughing Brook without any fish one day and told about the great footprint he had seen in a muddy place on the bank deep in the Green Forest , and had said his was sure that it was the footprint of a Bear , he had been laughed at .
I think you must have imagined it .
Every one was so busy watching Farmer Brown ' s boy that no one saw Buster coming from the other direction .
What was going to happen ?
For a whole minute they stood there face to face , gazing into each other ' s eyes , while everybody watched and waited , and it seemed as if the whole Green Forest was holding its breath .
There was no doubt about it , for with the yell Farmer Brown ' s boy turned and ran for home , as no one ever had seen him run before .
" cried Little Joe Otter , dancing about with excitement .
" You were right , Little Joe !
What do you think they saw ?
]
" Why , why - e - e !
A fallen hero is some one to whom every one has looked up as very brave and then proves to be less brave than he was supposed to be .
But now they had seen Buster Bear and Farmer Brown ' s boy meet face to face ; and while it was true that Farmer Brown ' s boy had run away as fast as ever he could , it was also true that Buster Bear had done the same thing .
They said them among themselves , and some of them even said them to Buster when they met him , or said them so that he would hear them .
He couldn ' t get at them .
And there was no one to help him .
But once in a while a great fear takes possession of him , as when he knows that Shadow the Weasel is looking for him .
What should he do ?
" I ' ll teach you manners !
I ' ll swallow you whole , that ' s what I ' ll do .
" Oh !
And then there was his tail , that funny little tail he is so fond of jerking when he scolds .
It helped him keep his balance and keep from turning over and over .
And suppose you had the habit of talking to yourself .
Then there wouldn ' t be any secret .
There is something that I used to have and don ' t have now .
Ha !
There ought to be some up in the Old Pasture .
If I wasn ' t afraid that some one would see me , I ' d go up there .
Buster sighed .
" I know what I ' ll do !
Now though Buster didn ' t know it , some one had been listening , and that some one was none other than Sammy Jay .
When at last Buster lay down for a nap , Sammy flew away , chuckling to himself .
"
Then he too started for the Old Pasture .
" asked Farmer Brown ' s boy of his mother .
You see , Farmer Brown ' s boy was just beginning to understand something that Peter Rabbit and the other little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest learned almost as soon as they learned to walk ,-- that if you don ' t want to be seen , you mustn ' t be heard .
He waited a minute or two , but heard nothing more .
He isn ' t particular what kind of berries .
Oh , my , no !
They tasted so good that he just had to eat and eat and eat .
Somehow , time is the hardest thing in the world to remember , when you are having a good time .
" Um - m - m , um - m - m ," mumbled Buster Bear with his mouth full , as he moved along to another patch of berries .
Right in front of him was a shiny thing just full of the finest , biggest , bluest berries !
They were real berries , and all he had got to do was to help himself .
Buster gave a little sigh of pure happiness .
He took the pail , but he didn ' t mean to take it .
He threw up his head to listen , and somehow , he never did know just how , the handle of the pail slipped back over his ears and caught there .
It was the voice of Farmer Brown ' s boy .
Of course , that meant that he couldn ' t run away , which was the thing of all things he most wanted to do , for big as he is and strong as he is , Buster is very shy and bashful when human beings are around .
Then there was another yell .
You see Farmer Brown ' s boy had just discovered Buster Bear .
He gave one frightened look at Farmer Brown ' s boy , and then with a mighty " Woof !
And that brings us back to the question , did Buster steal Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s pail ?
XXI
He was so surprised that he almost forgot to keep his wings moving .
Come on !
Come on !
He felt humiliated .
Presently Buster heard light footsteps , and peeping out , he saw Billy Mink and Peter Rabbit and Jumper the Hare and Prickly Porky and Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk .
Of course , Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there .
" I wish I never had thought of berries ," growled Buster to himself .
A temper is a bad , bad thing When once it gets away .
But to have Sammy Jay call everybody within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand .
With a roar of anger Buster Bear charged out of his hiding place .
He roared with all his might !
Those who could climb , climbed .
Then he vented his temper on the tin pail .
" You got no more than you deserve for stealing Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s berries ," said Sammy Jay , who had come back and was looking on from the top of a tree .
" You ought to know , Sammy Jay ," said he .
"
XXIII
When things go wrong in spite of you To smile ' s the best thing you can do -- To smile and say , " I ' m mighty glad They are no worse ; they ' re not so bad !
He had been afraid that they might stupidly kick over the pail and spill the berries , and he had hurried to drive whoever it was away .
It might be worse .
"
" Then he began to laugh , as he thought of how funny Buster Bear had looked with the pail about his neck , and then because , you know he is learning to be a philosopher , he once more repeated , " It might have been worse .
Yes , indeed , it might have been worse .
I never was hungrier in my life .
Guess this Old Pasture is no place for me to - day .
So Farmer Brown ' s boy made his lunch on blueberries and then rather sheepishly he started for home to tell of all the strange things that had happened to him in the Old Pasture .
How brave they ' ll all think me at home !
Down , down , down .
' she said aloud .
' I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth .
Do you think you could manage it ?
' Dinah ' ll miss me very much to - night , I should think !
I wish you were down here with me !
' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ' Do cats eat bats ?
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .
' She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .
However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !
I think I could , if I only know how to begin .
' For , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
I wonder what I should be like then ?
' But it ' s no use now ,' thought poor Alice , ' to pretend to be two people !
' Well , I ' ll eat it ,' said Alice , ' and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I ' ll get into the garden , and I don ' t care which happens !
So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * * *
* * * * * * *
' cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ); ' now I ' m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
' They must go by the carrier ,' she thought ; ' and how funny it ' ll seem , sending presents to one ' s own feet !
HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , ( WITH ALICE ' S LOVE ).
It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .
After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
won ' t she be savage if I ' ve kept her waiting !
' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , ' If you please , sir --' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go .
Ah , THAT ' S the great puzzle !
Besides , SHE ' S she , and I ' m I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling it all is !
I ' ll try if I know all the things I used to know .
Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I ' ll come up : if not , I ' ll stay down here till I ' m somebody else "-- but , oh dear !
'
As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash !
' So she began : ' O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ?
I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse !
' ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother ' s Latin Grammar , ' A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse !
) So she began again : ' Ou est ma chatte ?
' which was the first sentence in her French lesson - book .
The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
' Not like cats !
She is such a dear quiet thing ,' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , ' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she ' s such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon !
' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , ' I ' m afraid I ' ve offended it again !
Do come back again , and we won ' t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don ' t like them !
The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life .
' They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle .
' said the Mouse with an important air , ' are you all ready ?
This is the driest thing I know .
Silence all round , if you please !
' I beg your pardon !
' Not I !
' I thought you did ,' said the Mouse .
' Found WHAT ?
' Found IT ,' the Mouse replied rather crossly : ' of course you know what " it " means .
' I don ' t know the meaning of half those long words , and , what ' s more , I don ' t believe you do either !
There was no ' One , two , three , and away ,' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over .
'
This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him ), while the rest waited in silence .
' But she must have a prize herself , you know ,' said the Mouse .
' Of course ,' the Dodo replied very gravely .
The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back .
" " I ' ll be judge , I ' ll be jury ," Said cunning old Fury : " I ' ll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death .
' said the Mouse to Alice severely .
' I didn ' t mean it !
'
' What a pity it wouldn ' t stay !
' I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do !
'
And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds !
In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story .
The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill
' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves , and she very good - naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .
Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
' He took me for his housemaid ,' she said to herself as she ran .
By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking - glass .
' I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen ,' she said to herself , ' whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I ' ll just see what this bottle does .
And when I grow up , I ' ll write one -- but I ' m grown up now ,' she added in a sorrowful tone ; ' at least there ' s no room to grow up any more HERE .
Oh , I shouldn ' t like THAT !
Alice heard it say to itself ' Then I ' ll go round and get in at the window .
'
' And then a voice she had never heard before , ' Sure then I ' m here !
'
'
' Oh !
' then the Rabbit ' s voice along --' Catch him , you by the hedge !
Tell us all about it !
' So you did , old fellow !
'
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .
It sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .
An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her .
' I don ' t see ,' said the Caterpillar .
' said the Caterpillar contemptuously .
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar ' s making such VERY short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , ' I think , you ought to tell me who YOU are , first .
' Come back !
Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing .
'
'
' What size do you want to be ?
' Oh , I ' m not particular as to size ,' Alice hastily replied ; ' only one doesn ' t like changing so often , you know .
' Are you content now ?
This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again .
The other side of WHAT ?
' What CAN all that green stuff be ?
And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can ' t see you ?
There ' s no pleasing them !
Ugh , Serpent !
' I ' m a -- I ' m a --'
' said the Pigeon .
For a minute or two she stood looking at the house , and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood --( she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish )-- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles .
Then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together .
' There ' s no sort of use in knocking ,' said the Footman , ' and that for two reasons .
' And she opened the door and went in .
' There ' s certainly too much pepper in that soup !
There was certainly too much of it in the air .
Pig !
' I didn ' t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didn ' t know that cats COULD grin .
' Talking of axes ,' said the Duchess , ' chop off her head !
' Oh , don ' t bother ME ,' said the Duchess ; ' I never could abide figures !
'
'
' the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as she spoke .
'
' If you ' re going to turn into a pig , my dear ,' said Alice , seriously , ' I ' ll have nothing more to do with you .
' when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm .
'
' But I don ' t want to go among mad people ,' Alice remarked .
' said Alice .
' To begin with ,' said the Cat , ' a dog ' s not mad .
' I suppose so ,' said Alice .
' Well , then ,' the Cat went on , ' you see , a dog growls when it ' s angry , and wags its tail when it ' s pleased .
' By - the - bye , what became of the baby ?
' Well !
' Have some wine ,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone .
' Come , we shall have some fun now !
' I ' m glad they ' ve begun asking riddles .-- I believe I can guess that ,' she added aloud .
' Then you should say what you mean ,' the March Hare went on .
' said the Hatter .
' sighed the Hatter .
' I told you butter wouldn ' t suit the works !
' he added looking angrily at the March Hare .
' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well ,' the Hatter grumbled : ' you shouldn ' t have put it in with the bread - knife .
' What a funny watch !
'
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled .
'
'
For instance , suppose it were nine o ' clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : you ' d only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
'
How I wonder what you ' re at !
' How dreadfully savage !
'
' Is that the reason so many tea - things are put out here ?
' And they pinched it on both sides at once .
' I wasn ' t asleep ,' he said in a hoarse , feeble voice : ' I heard every word you fellows were saying .
' said the March Hare .
' And be quick about it ,' added the Hatter , ' or you ' ll be asleep again before it ' s done .
Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : ' But why did they live at the bottom of a well ?
'
' Nobody asked YOUR opinion ,' said Alice .
' the Hatter asked triumphantly .
' Alice was beginning very angrily , but the Hatter and the March Hare went ' Sh !
' Alice said very humbly ; ' I won ' t interrupt again .
' said the Dormouse indignantly .
However , he consented to go on .
' Why not ?
' Then you shouldn ' t talk ,' said the Hatter .
' she thought .
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and THEN -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains .
The Queen ' s Croquet - Ground
' YOU ' D better not talk !
' I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded !
' What for ?
The Queen !
There was a sound of many footsteps , and Alice looked round , eager to see the Queen .
After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
' So she stood still where she was , and waited .
'
'
The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed ' Off with her head !
'
' You make me giddy .
' Are their heads off ?
' Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty !
' shouted the Queen .
The soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the question was evidently meant for her .
' Hush !
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet - ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
' or ' Off with her head !
' It ' s no use speaking to it ,' she thought , ' till its ears have come , or at least one of them .
' In another minute the whole head appeared , and then Alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her .
'
' I don ' t like the look of it at all ,' said the King : ' however , it may kiss my hand if it likes .
'
So she went in search of her hedgehog .
The King ' s argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you weren ' t to talk nonsense .
)
The Cat ' s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .
' You can ' t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing !
' When I ' M a Duchess ,' she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful tone though ), ' I won ' t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL .
Soup does very well without -- Maybe it ' s always pepper that makes people hot - tempered ,' she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , ' and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes them bitter -- and -- and barley - sugar and such things that make children sweet - tempered .
' Perhaps it hasn ' t one ,' Alice ventured to remark .
' The game ' s going on rather better now ,' she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little .
' Only mustard isn ' t a bird ,' Alice remarked .
' exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark , ' it ' s a vegetable .
It doesn ' t look like one , but it is .
'
"'
' I make you a present of everything I ' ve said as yet .
'
Alice looked up , and there stood the Queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm .
' Now , I give you fair warning ,' shouted the Queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; ' either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time !
' Let ' s go on with the game ,' the Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet - ground .
' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the King , the Queen , and Alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution .
'
' No ,' said Alice .
' It ' s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from ,' said the Queen .
' said the Queen , ' and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history .
So they went up to the Mock Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing .
' This here young lady ,' said the Gryphon , ' she wants for to know your history , she do .
Alice thought to herself , ' I don ' t see how he can EVEN finish , if he doesn ' t begin .
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying , ' Thank you , sir , for your interesting story ,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
' We called him Tortoise because he taught us ,' said the Mock Turtle angrily : ' really you are very dull !
'
' I never said I didn ' t !
' Hold your tongue !
' said Alice indignantly .
' I only took the regular course .
' inquired Alice .
'
' Well , I can ' t show it you myself ,' the Mock Turtle said : ' I ' m too stiff .
' I never went to him ,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : ' he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say .
' said Alice , in a hurry to change the subject .
'
' Of course it was ,' said the Mock Turtle .
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes .
' Same as if he had a bone in his throat ,' said the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back .
' Two lines !
' Then , you know ,' the Mock Turtle went on , ' you throw the --'
' Turn a somersault in the sea !
' Change lobsters again !
' Back to land again , and that ' s all the first figure ,' said the Mock Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at Alice .
' We can do without lobsters , you know .
Will you , won ' t you , will you , won ' t you , won ' t you join the dance ?
"'
'
' IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES .
' I mean , what makes them so shiny ?
'
'
"'
Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating ' YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM ,' to the Caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath , and said ' That ' s very curious .
Tell her to begin .
'' Tis the voice of the Lobster ; I heard him declare , " You have baked me too brown , I must sugar my hair .
'
' the Mock Turtle persisted .
When the pie was all finished , the Owl , as a boon , Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon : While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl , And concluded the banquet --]
' Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ?
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
' Chorus again !
' was heard in the distance .
' Alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out , ' Silence in the court !
' The Queen of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day : The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts , And took them quite away !
' When did you begin ?
'
' Take off your hat ,' the King said to the Hatter .
' It isn ' t mine ,' said the Hatter .
Here the Queen put on her spectacles , and began staring at the Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted .
' Give your evidence ,' said the King ; ' and don ' t be nervous , or I ' ll have you executed on the spot .
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation , which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her .
' I can hardly breathe .
Go on !
' I didn ' t !
' I ' m a poor man , your Majesty ,' he began .
'
Suppress him !
' Never mind !
' cried Alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury - box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before .
' Nothing ,' said Alice .
' UNimportant , of course , I meant ,' the King hastily said , and went on to himself in an undertone ,
' important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important --' as if he were trying which word sounded best .
' Well , I shan ' t go , at any rate ,' said Alice : ' besides , that ' s not a regular rule : you invented it just now .
' No , they ' re not ,' said the White Rabbit , ' and that ' s the queerest thing about it .
' ( The jury all looked puzzled .
)
)
' he asked .
I gave her one , they gave him two , You gave us three or more ; They all returned from him to you , Though they were mine before .
_I_ don ' t believe there ' s an atom of meaning in it .
"-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM --" you can ' t swim , can you ?
' he said .
' Never !
'
' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice .
' Who cares for you ?
) ' You ' re nothing but a pack of cards !
First , she dreamed of little Alice herself , and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee , and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice , and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister ' s dream .
There was , however , another man on board , so to speak , at the time .
A monk of immense learning and acute intellect he had made himself happy in a little stone hut and a little stony garden in the Balkans , chiefly by writing the most crushing refutations of exposures of certain heresies , the last professors of which had been burnt ( generally by each other ) precisely 1 , 119 years previously .
The heavens are evil , the sky is evil , the stars are evil .
How did my view strike you ?
" Oh !
get on ," cried Lucifer , boisterously .
"
Lucifer exploded with an oath and leapt erect , leaning hard upon the handle that acted as a helm to the vessel .
For the last ten minutes they had been shooting downwards into great cracks and caverns of cloud .
Now , through a sort of purple haze , could be seen comparatively near to them what seemed to be the upper part of a huge , dark orb or sphere , islanded in a sea of cloud .
The Professor ' s eyes were blazing like a maniac ' s .
" What can it be ?
For the clouds that belonged to London had closed over the heads of the voyagers sealing up the entrance of the upper air .
The globe is inevitable .
Away with the thing !
" inquired Michael , meekly .
" That is surely wrong .
The ball should be on top of the cross .
The cross is a mere barbaric prop ; the ball is perfection .
"
"
"
"
" He took this ----"
It is also a perfect allegory of what happens to rationalists like yourself .
Then he began to grow fiercer and more eccentric ; he would batter the crosses by the roadside ; for he lived in a Roman Catholic country .
He was standing smoking , for a moment , in the front of an interminable line of palings , when his eyes were opened .
He broke his furniture because it was made of crosses .
" Ah ," he screamed , " to every man his madness .
" I shall mount up as much as you will .
" Indeed ," said Lucifer , leering over the side of the flying ship .
He was a happy and healthy old gentleman and therefore he was quite careless about it .
And he felt as every man feels in the taut moment of such terror that his chief danger was terror itself ; his only possible strength would be a coolness amounting to carelessness , a carelessness amounting almost to a suicidal swagger .
His one wild chance of coming out safely would be in not too desperately desiring to be safe .
Now he knew the truth that is known to all fighters , and hunters , and climbers of cliffs .
Nor is it ( as the modern idiots would certainly say it is ) a mere numbness or negative paralysis of the powers of grief .
He paused a little , panting in the gallery under the ball , and idly kicked his heels , moving a few yards along it .
He said that he had come in Lucifer ' s ship .
Michael followed him , however , if only out of politeness , down an apparently interminable spiral of staircase .
Michael stepped through it , and the unaccountable man in buttons leapt after him and pinioned him where he stood .
But this was a dome of heaven made by man .
Its stars were not above but far below , like fallen stars still in unbroken constellations ; the dome itself was full of darkness .
He had no notion where or at what level he was .
The lit squares of the shop windows excited him as the young are excited by the lit stage of some promising pantomime .
With that mysterious suddenness of the Cockney mob , a rush was made in the right direction , a dingy office , next to the shop of the potted meat .
I swear I ' d do it again .
I read it half through before I broke the window .
Here they were still at their old bewildering , pardonable , useless quarrels , with so much to be said on both sides , and so little that need be said at all .
" This poor fellow is dotty ," he said good - humouredly to the crowd .
He might have spared his emotion .
He had said the worst thing that could be said ; and it seemed accepted and ignored like the ordinary second best of the politicians .
He was in name and stock a Highlander of the Macdonalds ; but his family took , as was common in such cases , the name of a subordinate sept as a surname , and for all the purposes which could be answered in London , he called himself Evan MacIan .
The common paths of his little village began to climb quite suddenly and seemed resolved to go to heaven .
Like so many men and nations who grow up with nature and the common things , he understood the supernatural before he understood the natural .
He had looked at dim angels standing knee - deep in the grass before he had looked at the grass .
The deeper his memory plunged into the dark house of childhood the nearer and nearer he came to the things that cannot be named .
Our Lady had gone and left the stars by accident .
And Evan himself had been of one piece with his progenitors ; and was not dead with them , but alive in the twentieth century .
He had one shock of sentiment , when he turned that wonderful corner of Fleet Street and saw St . Paul ' s sitting in the sky .
With a smart journalistic instinct characteristic of all his school , the editor of _The Atheist_ had put first in his paper and most prominently in his window an article called " The Mesopotamian Mythology and its Effects on Syriac Folk Lore .
Then followed a paragraph giving other examples of such heroes and Saviours being born of some profligate intercourse between God and mortal .
"
" asked Turnbull , glaring .
" Can you be anything else when you plaster your own house with that God - defying filth ?
A great light like dawn came into Mr . Turnbull ' s face .
Here , after twenty lone years of useless toil , he had his reward .
He bounded to his feet like a boy ; he saw a new youth opening before him .
He looked like a gentleman , and yet , somehow , like a stage gentleman .
)
" ( Loud and prolonged laughter .
)
" You asked me why I broke his window ," said MacIan , with a face of wood .
" Vane continued to gaze at him with a sternness not habitual to him .
" But I am not in the least sorry ," said Evan , " I am very pleased .
It contained exactly twelve sovereigns .
I will fight him like a gentleman ; I will fight him as our fathers fought .
I have only that which the poor have equally with the rich ; which the lonely have equally with the man of many friends .
The magistrate recovered his voice and his presence of mind .
"
" With Mr . Turnbull ," said Vane .
" Might I suggest ," he said , " That I , your worship , can settle to some extent this absurd matter myself .
" You ' re ozone after that fellow .
He stammered out something , he knew not what ; he only guessed it by the answer of the other .
Do I want to fight ?
" Why , you moonstruck scarecrow of superstition , do you think your dirty saints are the only people who can die ?
Night and day I have prayed -- I have longed -- for an atheist revolution -- I have longed to see your blood and ours on the streets .
Let it be yours or mine ?
You damned fool , you said things that might have got us locked up for a year , and shadowed by the coppers for half a decade .
"
" I swear to you , then ," said MacIan , after a pause .
The atheist drew up his head .
It made the pawnbroker ' s half - way down it shine as if it were really that Mountain of Piety that the French poetic instinct has named it ; it made the mean pseudo - French bookshop , next but one to it , a shop packed with dreary indecency , show for a moment a kind of Parisian colour .
But the romance of the eye , which really on this rich evening , clung about the shop , had its main source in the accident of two doors standing open , the front door that opened on the street and a back door that opened on an odd green square of garden , that the sun turned to a square of gold .
For though there are no hard tests for separating the tares and the wheat of any people , one rude but efficient guide is that the nice Jew is called Moses Solomon , and the nasty Jew is called Thornton Percy .
The keeper of the curiosity shop was of the Thornton Percy branch of the chosen people ; he belonged to those Lost Ten Tribes whose industrious object is to lose themselves .
The two Scotchmen were interested in seventeenth - century swords .
" The fact is , Mr . Gordon , we have to place our honour in your hands .
" Why -- er -- yes ," said Gordon .
"
I do believe in liberty .
I am going to die for it , if need be , under that sword on your counter .
But if there is one sight that makes me doubt it it is your foul fat face .
It is hard to believe you were not meant to be ruled like a dog or killed like a cockroach .
Be still , I say , or I kill you where you stand .
MacIan said nothing , but lifting his sword from the counter went out into the sun .
"
" Well , we ' ve taken the only inhabitant into captivity .
And he picked up his sword and made it whistle like a boy ' s wand .
" I beg your pardon ," said MacIan , dryly .
" Be quick !
The blades crossed again with the same sound like song , and the men went to work again with the same white and watchful faces .
Evan , in his impatience , went back a little to his wildness .
" And there isn ' t a damned second to lose either .
With a bound he was beside the little cluster of his clothes and boots that lay on the lawn ; he snatched them up , without waiting to put any of them on ; and tucking his sword under his other arm , went wildly at the wall at the bottom of the garden and swung himself over it .
Price .
"
And just as the red and raging face of a policeman appeared above the wall , Turnbull struck the horse with a terrible cut of the whip and the two went whirling away like a boomerang .
" Mr . MacIan ," he said shortly and civilly .
MacIan leant his white and rather weary face back upon the cushions in order to speak up through the open door .
At first , I felt a little dazed with the vastness of it all .
I used to think all Christians were hypocrites , and I felt quite mildly towards them really .
He did not do what would have first occurred to any ordinary outsider desiring to destroy his tracks .
He kept chiefly to the great roads , so full of hansoms that a wilder pair than they might easily have passed in the press .
"
"
But we , by the queerness of our position , are something much more than either duellists or gentlemen .
IV .
They had satisfied the magistrate , they had tied the tradesman neck and heels , and they had left the police behind .
Hence the complete picture they give of life is of necessity fallacious ; they can only represent what is unusual .
And when a gasping reporter rushed in in the last hours of the evening with the announcement that the two heroes of the Police Court had literally been found fighting in a London back garden , with a shopkeeper bound and gagged in the front of the house , the editors and sub - editors were stricken still as men are by great beatitudes .
Questions were asked about it , and even answered , in the House of Commons .
And a song , consisting of an unimaginable number of verses , in which his name was rhymed with flat iron , the British Lion , sly ' un , dandelion , Spion ( With Kop in the next line ), was sung to crowded houses every night .
Their achievement seemed all the more heroic and divine , because it seemed doubtful whether it was worth doing at all .
Turnbull , as he stared drearily , murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary Swinburne who had intoxicated his youth :
But no disciple ' s tongue can say If thou can ' st take our sins away .
Turnbull shivered again in the sharp morning air .
Frightened exactly as one would be frightened at the sight of a man forty feet high .
Where is that ?
" said MacIan .
Some provisions they had bought last night , at a low public house , in case of undefined contingencies , were tossed about like the materials of an ordinary picnic , here a basket of chocolate , and there a bottle of wine .
And to add to the disorder finally , there were strewn on top of everything , the most disorderly of modern things , newspapers , and more newspapers , and yet again newspapers , the ministers of the modern anarchy .
" There ' s a lot about us ," he said .
" The matter on which you and I are engaged is at this moment really the best copy in England .
"
" Well , what did you expect ?
"
You must listen to me , not merely because I know the country , which you might learn by looking at a map , but because I know the people of the country , whom you could not know by living here thirty years .
For the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us , as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the Dreyfus case .
Therefore , do not imagine , in your innocence , that we have only to melt away among those English hills as a Highland cateran might into your god - forsaken Highland mountains .
Last and most important we must not dream of effecting our -- our final settlement , which will be a thing as famous as the Phoenix Park murders , unless we have made real and precise arrangements for our isolation -- I will not say our safety .
" Yes ?
"
" Very well , then , come on .
" Yes ," replied the Highlander , without lifting his face .
" What the devil are you talking about ?
" asked Turnbull .
" Why , you idiot ," began Turnbull .
"
" One of us will be dead before they come ," said the other , hoarsely , " for this is the hour God meant .
Kindly enlighten my pagan darkness as to what the devil _you_ mean .
" The hour will soon be gone .
" Your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form ," he began , but MacIan broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice .
"
" Or else ?
"
" The Church is not a thing like the Athenaeum Club ," he cried .
And yet you ask me to trust my temperament , my own temperament , which can be turned upside down by two bottles of claret or an attack of the jaundice .
" Stop a moment ," said Turnbull , in the same easy tone , " Even in the very act of saying that you believe this or that , you imply that there is a part of yourself that you trust even if there are many parts which you mistrust .
Evan remained in an unmoved and grave attitude .
No , it is not some trifle that we are fighting about .
" Well , shall we fight now ?
" Yes ," said MacIan , with a sudden contraction of his black brows , " yes , it must be now .
The bright swords crossed , and the first touch of them , travelling down blade and arm , told each combatant that the heart of the other was awakened .
There was a pause , and then MacIan made a movement as if to thrust , and almost at the same moment Turnbull suddenly and calmly dropped his sword .
V . THE PEACEMAKER
As mistaken lovers might watch the inevitable sunset of first love , these men watched the sunset of their first hatred .
Some new and strange thing was rising higher and higher in their hearts like a high sea at night .
The voice was too polite for good manners .
"
In fact , Tolstoy tells us that we shall soon outgrow war , which he says is simply a duel between nations .
But there is no doubt about our having outgrown duelling .
"
"
" said the peacemaker .
" Murder is a sin ," said the immovable Highlander .
I say that murder is a sin , and bloodshed is not , and that there is as much difference between those words as there is between the word ' yes ' and the word ' no '; or rather more difference , for ' yes ' and ' no ', at least , belong to the same category .
Murder is a spiritual incident .
" said the large man , wagging his head .
Now Tolstoy has shown that force is no remedy ; so you see the position in which I am placed .
But it ' s against my principles to call in the police against you , because the police are still on a lower moral plane , so to speak , because , in short , the police undoubtedly sometimes employ force .
Turnbull suddenly gripped his sword and said , shortly , " I see how you are placed quite well , sir .
" I must and will stop this shocking crime ," cried the Tolstoian , crimson in the face .
It is against the principle of love .
" Sir ," he said , " talk about the principle of love as much as you like .
" he said , with a heated face .
" And deny your most sacred dogma ," said MacIan .
Have you ever read _The Quintessence of Ibsenism_ ?
Of course he went very wrong over the war .
I prayed for an angel .
"
" Why should not angels sometimes come to show us the black abyss of evil on whose brink we stand .
"
" I know what you mean ," said Turnbull , grimly .
You may learn , also , that fog of false philosophy .
" What noise is that ?
Between high hedges in Hertfordshire , hedges so high as to create a kind of grove , two men were running .
" Is that a qualification in a family of warriors ?
Rapid movement is essential ," answered MacIan , who never saw a joke in his life .
" Unless what ?
Be quick and quiet .
He suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane .
And the burning evening sky looked down at them through the tangle with red eyes as of an army of goblins .
Turnbull was wholly unaffected by any written or spoken poetry ; his was a powerful and prosaic mind .
But even upon him there came for the moment something out of the earth and the passionate ends of the sky .
" he asked shortly .
" Sir ," he said , " I ought to say something to you .
"
And it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door .
He had a bow tie so big that the two ends showed on each side of his neck like unnatural stunted wings .
" Who are we ?
But within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent , like a monkey ' s .
"
Turnbull continued :
" But that refreshment was preparatory to something which I fear you will find less comprehensible , but on which our minds are entirely fixed , sir .
I know all about the essential requirements of civil order : I have written leading articles about them all my life .
I think He does not exist ; that is where the importance comes in for me .
But this man thinks that He does exist , and thinking that very properly thinks Him more important than anything else .
Are you ?
Are you ?
" Come up to my place ," he said .
You ' re the very men I wanted to see .
I ' ll give you a green smooth lawn and your choice of swords and pistols .
It ' s the only good thing in God ' s world !
I ' ve walked about these damned fields and longed to see somebody cut up and killed and the blood running .
Ha !
" Excuse me ," said MacIan suddenly with the wide - eyed curiosity of a child , " excuse me , but ..."
" Well ?
" said the small fighter , brandishing his wooden weapon .
" cried the little man , tucking his stick under his arm and taking quite suddenly to his heels .
" Come on !
Confound me , I ' ll see both of you eat and then I ' ll see one of you die .
But at length the path after many twists betrayed its purpose and led abruptly up two or three steps to the door of a tiny but very clean cottage .
" Come in !
Whether or no it was better inside it was at least a surprise .
It was like stepping into a chamber in the Arabian Nights .
Evan MacIan came out the next morning into the little garden to a fresh silver day , his long face looking more austere than ever in that cold light , his eyelids a little heavy .
He carried one of the swords .
They were all the more startled because of the still posture in which they found him .
Yet when Turnbull ' s tread broke a twig , he was on his feet in a flash .
"
And he ducked rapidly round the statue to an open space of grass on the other side of it .
" Don ' t you be afraid ," he added , " he can still see us .
" Do you know ," he said , " I think he can see us better this way .
In the stillness MacIan made a sudden movement , unmeaning apparently , and then remained rigid .
" And he bit his forefinger in a kind of fever .
" My philosophy has its higher ecstasies , but perhaps you are hardly worked up to them yet .
From Cornwall to Cape Wrath this county is one horrible , solid block of humanitarianism .
They will defend it on the contemptible ground of commerce or the more contemptible ground of social good .
But do not fancy that you will find one other person who will comprehend a strong man taking the sword in his hand and wiping out his enemy .
I had a Fellowship at Magdalen .
Here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the stars -- a still , continuous violence .
Then MacIan said steadily : " Mr . Turnbull , lend me your sword a moment .
"
Fight , if you ' re so fond of all that filthy philosophy !
"
Then he felt the furious Scotchman coming at him like an express train , doubling his size every second , with eyes as big as windows and a sword as bright as the sun .
Something broke inside him , and he found himself running away , tumbling over his own feet in terror , and crying out as he ran .
Shoo !
"
Up three slanting meadows , down four slanting meadows on the other side , across another road , across a heath of snapping bracken , through a wood , across another road , and to the brink of a big pool , they pursued the flying philosopher .
But when he came to the pool his pace was so precipitate that he could not stop it , and with a kind of lurching stagger , he fell splash into the greasy water .
And Turnbull sat down on the grass and went off into reverberations of laughter .
" Are you ?
"
" I can see it from here .
" I don ' t know the exact name for it ," replied Turnbull .
" Do you really mean to say , MacIan ," he said , " that you fancied that we , the Free - thinkers , that Bradlaugh , or Holyoake , or Ingersoll , believe all that dirty , immoral mysticism about Nature ?
Damn Nature !
" It never occurred to me before ," answered MacIan with tranquillity .
But even the church was scarcely so central and solemn an institution as the large public house , the Valencourt Arms .
And in the Valencourt Arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum ; and beer was drunk with reverence , as it ought to be .
They had long coats down to their heels , and carried under each coat something that looked like a stick .
MacIan , your health !
"
" I am to understand , then ," he said , " that you don ' t believe in nature .
If I flew up to the ceiling ----"
Nay , the supernatural to me is more reasonable than the natural ; for the supernatural is a direct message from God , who is reason .
" That is just the difficulty ," continued MacIan thoughtfully .
A man ' s free will , I heard , was supernatural .
"
Man had authority because he was man .
"
" I know ," said MacIan grimly ; " that man who talked about love , for instance .
"
Turnbull made a humorous grimace ; then he said : " We seem to be talking in a kind of shorthand ; but I won ' t pretend not to understand you .
"
" Well ?
" Go on ," repeated Turnbull ; " what ' s the matter with you ?
" No , I don ' t ," said MacIan , shaking his head .
" What do you mean ?
" I mean him ," repeated MacIan with emphasis .
" He goes out in the early dawn ; he digs or he ploughs a field .
He gave them greeting with the elaborate urbanity of the slightly intoxicated .
" There ' s the church ," he said thickly .
" I mean ," explained MacIan elaborately , " that you think that there should be someone typifying religion , a priest ----"
I know ' un .
What they want in England ?
" They want you ," said MacIan .
" Who says I a ' n ' t got a right to speak ?
" I got a right to speak .
" I say he ' s a man ," said the rustic furiously , stopping and striking his stick on the ground .
He ' s a man .
"
But your Ibsens and your Zolas and your Shaws and your Tolstoys have not even got so far .
They had walked all night .
Their long and changing argument had taken them through districts and landscapes equally changing .
You hold that your heretics and sceptics have helped the world forward and handed on a lamp of progress .
Read them instead of praising them , and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity .
You are a materialist , and you think Bruno a scientific hero .
I should not be at all surprised if , when you counted the scientific investigations and discoveries since the fall of Rome , you found that a great mass of them had been made by monks .
I say that if you want an example of anything which has progressed in the moral world by the same method as science in the material world , by continually adding to without unsettling what was there before , then I say that there _is_ only one example of it .
" With this enormous difference ," said Turnbull , " that however elaborate be the calculations of physical science , their net result can be tested .
" Catholic virtue is often invisible because it is the normal ," answered MacIan .
You say that Christianity is the prop of morals ; but what more do you do ?
You ask whether he is a gentleman , whether he is an M . D .-- anything but that .
"
No , if you really want to know what we mean when we say that Christianity has a special power of virtue , I will tell you .
Only a hundred years have passed and that volcano of revolutionary truth and valour is as cold as the mountains of the moon .
And so it is and so it will be with the ethics which are buzzing down Fleet Street at this instant as I speak .
"
" And suppose I don ' t like him ?
" said Turnbull .
" On my theory the question is rather whether he will like you : or more probably whether he will ever have heard of you .
What , in the name of all the angels and devils , is it except a worship of virginity ?
Then MacIan stopped suddenly and planted his sword - point in the ground like one who plants his tent - pole for the night .
The other did not answer , but his silence seemed somehow solid as assent ; and MacIan went on conversationally .
Neither noticed that both had instinctively stood still before the sign of the fixed and standing sword .
Turnbull ' s mouth twitched in angry humour under his red moustache .
"
" And he plucked his sword - point out of the turf .
But in MacIan ' s soul more formless storms were gathering , and he made a lunge or two so savage as first to surprise and then to enrage his opponent .
MacIan , though much heavier , avoided such an overthrow only by having the quick and incalculable feet of the mountaineer ; but both of them may be said to have leapt off a low cliff when they leapt into the road .
The chauffeur had risen to defend himself .
Turnbull had concealed in him somewhere a fund of common sense and knowledge of the world of which he himself and his best friends were hardly aware .
The man in the middle of the road was shouting in a hoarse and groggy voice that the chauffeur had smashed their car on purpose ; that they must get to the Cri that evening , and that he would jolly well have to take them there .
Another of the rowdies rushed forward booing in idiot excitement , fell over the chauffeur , and , either by accident or design , kicked him as he lay .
" I haven ' t got a stick ," grumbled the disarmed man , and looked vaguely about the ditch .
Turnbull was still engaged in countering and pommelling with the third young man .
At length Turnbull ' s opponent began to back before the battery of his heavy hands , still fighting , for he was the soberest and boldest of the four .
MacIan plucked the struggling and aspiring idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat , and left him swaying unsteadily in the moon .
In that short and strong silence he absorbed the lady from head to foot .
" Oh , that poor , poor man !
"
If you will tell us where you are going , we will see you safely there and say good night .
"
"
Almost at the same instant that the car plucked itself out of the mud and whipped away up the road , the man who had been flung into the ditch rose waveringly to his feet .
It is awful to reflect that , if his remark was valuable , it is quite lost to the world .
The car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes , and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery ; for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say .
Eight hundred yards farther on , Turnbull stood up suddenly in the swaying car .
" he called out , showing his first emotion of that night .
And he leant forward and spoke to the lady in the fur cap .
" The fact is ," he resumed , desperately , " the fact is , we are being chased by the police .
"
The wind whipped back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessitate a new theory of aesthetics touching the line of the cheek - bone ; but the head did not turn .
" You see ," began MacIan , again blunderingly , " this gentleman wrote in his newspaper that Our Lady was a common woman , a bad woman , and so we agreed to fight ; and we were fighting quite a little time ago -- but that was before we saw you .
The young lady driving her car had half turned her face to listen ; and it was not a reverent or a patient face that she showed him .
Her Norman nose was tilted a trifle too high upon the slim stalk of her neck and body .
He had expected the angels to despise him if he were wrong , but not to despise him so much as this .
" The face only answered : " Well , you ought to be more broadminded .
" I don ' t think ," began Turnbull , " that you quite realize ---- Hullo !
hullo -- hullo -- what ' s this ?
We must not incommode the lady .
" she asked , with the same frigid clearness .
" Until they are cured ," said the official .
"
The sergeant was profoundly disquieted from the beginning at the mere idea of arresting anyone in the company of a great lady ; to refuse one of her minor requests was quite beyond his courage .
The police made one rush to follow , and then dropped so grotesque and hopeless a chase .
But still MacIan stood up staring at earth and heaven ; and still the door he had flung open flapped loose like a flag .
Turnbull , after a few minutes of dumb amazement , had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter .
As they came over the hill and down on the other side of it , it is not too much to say that the whole universe of God opened over them and under them , like a thing unfolding to five times its size .
Turnbull had some such feeling , for he spoke for the first time for many hours .
Then she got out with an almost cruel coolness and began pulling off her long gloves and almost whistling .
" he said , quite humbly .
Evan ' s thoughts , that had been piled up to the morning star , abruptly let him down with a crash into the very cellars of the emotional universe .
" I ' m not really ungrateful ," she said ; " it was very good of you to save me from those men .
Or to help some cause or other , which always means bundling people out of crooked houses , in which they ' ve always lived , into straight houses , in which they often die .
And all the time you have inside only the horrid irony of your own empty head and empty heart .
Then , after a pause , as she stared with a rising colour at the glittering sea , she said : " It can ' t be described , and yet I am trying to describe it .
But I may be wrong ; there may be a way out .
" James ," said Evan , speaking like one under strong bodily pain , " I asked for God ' s answer and I have got it -- got it in my vitals .
He knows how weak I am , and that I might forget the peril of the faith , forget the face of Our Lady -- yes , even with your blow upon her cheek .
Therefore , God has tied me by the chain of my worldly place and word , and there is nothing but fighting now .
"
Evan said suddenly : " Will they let me see her in heaven once in a thousand ages ?
" The hand of Heaven is still pointing ," muttered the man of superstition to himself .
After that , there was a rather awkward drop on to a ledge of stone and then the journey was undertaken easily and even elegantly by the remains of an ornamental staircase , such as might have belonged to some long - disused watering - place .
" We are quite safe here ," said Turnbull , and , to the other ' s surprise , flung himself down , sitting on the brown beach .
Do you mind if I light a pipe ?
"
Imaginative life had never so much crowded upon MacIan .
He was in the Palace of Life , of which the very tapestries and curtains were alive .
But now he knew that he was in the closed court of death and that all the gates were sealed .
Then he turned and saluted his enemy once more , and the two stood up and fought till the foam flowed over their knees .
By this time the waves were well up Turnbull ' s thigh , and what was worse , they were beginning to roll and break heavily around them .
What he was going to do he had not even the most glimmering idea ; so he merely kept his grip and swam somehow with one hand .
Then he saw that it was a fisherman ' s boat , and , leaping upward , caught hold of the bow .
* * *
If ever thou gavest hosen and shoon Every night and all , Sit thee down and put them on , And Christ receive thy soul .
At length they came to a pale ribbon of road , edged by a shelf of rough and almost colourless turf ; and a few feet up the slope there stood grey and weather - stained , one of those big wayside crucifixes which are seldom seen except in Catholic countries .
Turnbull snatched at it and found it was the corner of a printed page , very coarsely printed , like a cheap novelette , and just large enough to contain the words : " _et c ' est elle qui_ ----"
" Hurrah !
" Where do you say ?
" cried Turnbull , with a voice like a trumpet , " in the land where things really happen -- _Tout arrive en France_ .
" repeated MacIan , and his eyes awoke again in his head like large lamps lighted .
France , at whose first council table sits the sublime figure of Julian the Apostate .
France that saved the Church and scattered the heresies by the mouths of Bossuet and Massillon .
Here , at least , we shall not be chased and spied on by sickly parsons and greasy policemen , because we wish to put our lives on the game .
" What the devil are you doing here ?
" We are having an affair of honour ," said Turnbull , as if it were the most rational thing in the world .
"
" Not France ?
One or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road .
A SCANDAL IN THE VILLAGE
In the little hamlet of Haroc , in the Isle of St . Loup , there lived a man who -- though living under the English flag -- was absolutely untypical of the French tradition .
He was stout ; he was quite undistinguished ; and he had side - whiskers , worn just a little longer than John Bull ' s .
For it was not convention with him , but solid and manly conviction .
If you had asked him about women , he would have said that one must preserve their domesticity and decorum ; he would have used the stalest words , but he would have in reserve the strongest arguments .
Both the father and the daughter were of the sort that would normally have avoided all observation ; that is , all observation in that extraordinary modern world which calls out everything except strength .
They neither of them believed in themselves ; for that is a decadent weakness .
She left upon ordinary people the impression -- the somewhat irritating impression -- produced by such a person ; it can only be described as the sense of strong water being perpetually poured into some abyss .
She trod firmly as if going somewhere ; she flung her face back as if defying something ; she hardly spoke a cross word , yet there was often battle in her eyes .
The modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to .
The conventions of the Isle of St . Loup were necessarily a compromise or confusion between those of France and England ; and it was vaguely possible for a respectable young lady to have half - attached lovers , in a way that would be impossible to the _bourgeoisie_ of France .
He was a short , prosperous - looking man , whose long , bushy black beard and clumsy black umbrella made him seem both shorter and older than he really was ; but whose big , bold eyes , and step that spurned the ground , gave him an instant character of youth .
But he went to Mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose , or even for a vulgar fascination .
There was about a third of a mile beyond the village of Haroc a large but lonely hotel upon the London or Paris model , but commonly almost entirely empty .
He treated everybody with complete civility and almost in complete silence .
Despite his silence and his dandified dress and whiskers , the island might never have heard of him but for the extraordinary event of which I have spoken , which fell about in the following way :
On one such evening at least no one was in church except the quiet , unconquerable Madeleine , four old women , one fisherman , and , of course , the irrepressible M . Camille Bert .
Madeleine Durand had come to a halt at first in childish wonder , and now , with more than masculine self - control , " I fancy I know your face , sir ," she said , as if to gain time .
There is no man in my dominions so vile as I .
But when I bear you away I shall be doing my first sacrilege , and also my first act of virtue .
Yet though she had not screamed , someone astray in the woods seemed to have heard the struggle .
When it was recognized it was that of Camille , with the black elderly beard and the young ardent eyes .
Now she was startled with a new sanity ; for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of Bert , as if it were a sort of duty , and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile .
" She went on with wide and serious eyes like an animal ' s : " It is not wrong of me to speak to you , because your soul , or anybody ' s soul , matters so much more than what the world says about anybody .
But it wasn ' t that that I meant .
Bert stepped backward with a sort of action she had never seen in him before .
And placid as she was , she made a little gesture of argument , of which the pathos wrung the heart .
I can ' t stand this !
Nor did he , strictly speaking , say it in English .
Bert seemed to crush his teeth together until they broke , and managed to say between them : " And why should you suppose that I shouldn ' t do as you say -- I mean not to do it at all ?
" I hate your priest and I deny your God !
" Because I am a fable also and a mask ," said the man .
The plain truth is ," and here when he came to the plain truth he boggled and blundered as Evan had done in telling it to the girl in the motor - car .
"
And I have come to fight for the fact that there is no God ; it is for that that I have seen this cursed island and your blessed face .
" You touched a bit of bread ," said Turnbull , biting his knuckles .
" You think it is only a bit of bread ," said the girl , and her lips tightened ever so little .
" I know it is only a bit of bread ," said Turnbull , with violence .
" Why , how silly of them ," cried out Madeleine , with quite a schoolgirl gaiety , " why , how silly of them to call _you_ a blasphemer !
"
" You come down here ," continued the lady , with that female emphasis which is so pulverizing in conversation and so feeble at a public meeting , " you and your MacIan come down here and put on false beards or noses in order to fight .
You pretend to be a Catholic commercial traveller from France .
But he had hardly crossed half of that stony quadrangle when a window burst open above him and a head was thrust out , shouting .
The two got a good start up the road before the whole town was awakened behind them ; and half - way up it a similar transformation was seen to take place in Mr . Turnbull ' s singular umbrella .
The two had a long race for the harbour ; but the English police were heavy and the French inhabitants were indifferent .
How he knew he was another gentleman merely by banging into him , must remain a mystery .
" And he shook his head with extraordinary sagacity .
"
The head of the pursuing host was just showing over the top of the hill behind him .
" No , but look here ," said Mr . Wilkinson , enthusiastically running after MacIan and catching him by the sleeve of his coat .
" We are really in the devil of a hurry ," he said , " and if you really have a yacht , the truth is that we would give our ears for it .
" What can it be ?
" Of course , it might be ," answered the other , quite innocently and gravely ; " but I never thought the story about Atlantis was very solidly established .
" What on earth are you talking about ?
" I know what you are really thinking , MacIan ," repeated Turnbull , laughing .
" asked Evan .
" inquired the other , puffing at his cigar .
"
In this primitive and Homeric truce the week passed by ; it consisted almost entirely of eating , drinking , smoking , talking , and occasionally singing .
He had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon .
The consequence of which was that he nearly fell off the rock .
On three sides of this shelly and sandy islet the sea stretched blue and infinite without a speck of land or sail ; the same as Turnbull had first seen it , except that the tide being out it showed a few yards more of slanting sand under the roots of the rocks .
" MacIan ," said Turnbull , in his temperate way , " whatever our eternal interrupted tete - a - tetes have taught us or not taught us , at least we need not fear the charge of fear .
The first sign of life that he did see , however , was something more extraordinary than the largest alligator .
" Over there -- behind that hill ," said the gasping MacIan .
" He put up his black head and grinned at me .
Do you mind waiting here while I go and see for myself ?
"
" asked MacIan , with stern impatience .
The nigger ' s hands and face are a lovely colour -- and the nigger ----" And he was overtaken once more .
"
"
Buck up , old man , this story of ours is a switchback .
XIII .
When the policeman had finished his admirable railway curve , he found a wall of failing sand between him and the pursued .
They had no easy business , however ; for the bottle which they had so innocently sent into the chief gate of Thanet had called to life the police of half a county on their trail .
Then he said : " We are quit of them .
And when at last he lay down on the hard earth , sleep struck him senseless like a hammer .
" They ' ve gone on past us right enough for a good thirty miles ; but now they ' ve found out their mistake , and they ' re coming back .
"
The next moment , however , he had jumped up alive and leaping like a man struck with a shock of cold water , and he was plunging after MacIan along the woodland path .
They had all the advantages that invisibility and silence can add to speed .
Nothing short of a brick wall could have abruptly brought him up .
Somewhat more laboriously but in equal silence the long legs of the Highlander had followed ; and crouching in crucial silence in the cloud of leaves , they saw the whole posse of their pursuers go by and die into the dust and mists of the distance .
In two seconds he had tugged up his chin over the wall like a horizontal bar ; the next he sat astride of it , like a horse of stone .
The nightmare of the stone horse was increased by the white fog , which seemed thicker inside the wall than outside .
Purple and crimson rhododendrons rose arrogantly , like rampant heraldic animals against their burning background of laburnum gold .
MacIan , whose mind was always haunted with such seraphic or titanic parallels , made some such remark to his companion .
" I am afraid we are trespassing .
" Yes , certainly ; the grounds inside the wall really belong to me , and the grounds outside the wall , too .
The police won ' t allow it in the streets -- and then there ' s the County Council -- and in the fields even nothing ' s allowed but posters of pills .
What do you want to fight about ?
" he queried , in a key completely new .
I suggest that if it comes to that we should both have sticks .
He improves on the suggestion and proposes that we should both have steel - pointed sticks .
" Why not ?
"
" Yes , by ----!
"
In my presence !
Then he came back to them more composed and wiping his eyes .
" he cried at last .
You ' ve seen him dance !
" Quite so !
" said the man on one leg , nodding gravely .
So do the sun and stars .
Almost at the same moment another man came walking quickly round the regal clump of rhododendrons .
But in my position one has to meet so many people .
" My dear fellow ," said the man in the straw hat , " these two gentlemen are going to fight a duel of the utmost importance .
Seconds -- yes , seconds ----" and here the speaker was once more shaken with his old malady of laughter .
I am God ; really , they could hardly have better supporters .
" Any place is the right place where they will let us do it .
He wanted to blow up that palace of delusions with dynamite ; and in some wild way , which I will not defend , he tried to do it .
" I ' ve often wanted to meet you ," he resumed , sternly , after a pause , " to hold you accountable for all the idiocy and cruelty of this muddled and meaningless world of yours .
What do you mean by it ?
"
Fifty sailors were drowned off Selsey Bill .
The Highlander did not answer , but stood as if thunderstruck with one long and heavy thought .
" I do not doubt it in the least ," answered MacIan .
I am ready at any instant to restore the Stuarts .
"
" he continued in harsher and harsher accents , forcing the other back towards the flower - beds .
" Don ' t you think ," said the new - comer , with a sort of supercilious entreaty , " that we had better all come into breakfast ?
It is such a mistake to wait for breakfast .
" Quite so ," replied Turnbull , seriously .
" I congratulate you heartily ," answered the other , " I am Doctor Quayle .
"
Turnbull ' s eyes did not move , but he realized that the man in the panama hat had lost all his ease of a landed proprietor and had withdrawn to a distance of thirty yards , where he stood glaring with all the contraction of fear and hatred that can stiffen a cat .
He did not look up , but his comrade and enemy addressed him like one who must free himself of his feelings .
I hope you like the society of this poor devil whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits .
"
For one instant MacIan opened the eyes of battle ; then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said , quite calmly :
"
"
" Why were you wanting to humble a god when you found him in this garden ?
" Granting the man his almighty pretensions , I think he was very modest ," said MacIan .
He expects the universe to turn round him , though he knows he isn ' t the centre .
" Doesn ' t it , by George !
" asked the other .
" Scores of them , I should say ," answered MacIan .
" Fellows who have read medical books or fellows whose fathers and uncles had something hereditary in their heads -- the whole air they breathe is mad .
"
" Oh , dear !
" I will go and fetch him ," said MacIan , calmly ; " I left the poor fellow wandering about by the nasturtium bed .
"
" Quite so ," said MacIan .
" Jackass !
Turnbull caught Evan ' s elbow again with quite another gesture .
"
"
" Oh , yes , sir ," replied the doctor , smiling , " I accept everything that you say .
"
" asked Turnbull , in some surprise .
" I do not regard either of your cases as incurable .
" You never saw us before .
You know nothing about us .
The doctor threw back his head and beard .
"
He went across to the curious mock book - shelves and took down one of the flat mahogany cases .
Evan bent his angry eagle face over it ; yet something blurred it and he could never swear he saw it distinctly .
if all this world I have walked in had been as sane as my mother was .
I will pay the penalty of having enjoyed God in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast .
I will die happy in your madhouse , only because I know what I know .
Let it be granted , then -- MacIan is a mystic ; MacIan is a maniac .
Turnbull slammed the case to , almost smashing it , and said with a burst of savage laughter : " Oh !
Evan gazed at the garden wall , gravely for more than a minute , and then he nodded without a word .
XV .
But the moon is a much simpler thing ; a naked and nursery sort of thing .
He was walking with his face turned up to it in that rather half - witted fashion which might have excused the error of his keepers ; and as he gazed he became aware of something little and lustrous flying close to the lustrous orb , like a bright chip knocked off the moon .
The vessel took one long and sweeping curve across the sky and came nearer and nearer to MacIan , like a steam - engine coming round a bend .
It was of pure white steel , and in the moon it gleamed like the armour of Sir Galahad .
I am the law .
" I suppose you can take me to the war ," he said , and the silent silver figure only bowed its head again .
To say that it rose to the stars is no mere metaphor , for the sky had cleared to that occasional and astonishing transparency in which one can see plainly both stars and moon .
" Yes ," answered the old man , " that which has returned is Stuart and yet older than Stuart .
It is Richard , the last Plantagenet , giving his crown to Bolingbroke as to a common brigand .
" But in England the king enjoys his own again .
"
" I fancy you have seen this place before .
"
The mounted men were not common policemen , but knights with spurs and plume whose smooth and splendid armour glittered like diamond rather than steel .
" The soldier had no business to do that ," said MacIan , sharply .
" The old man was moving as quickly as he could .
" Discipline for society ----" he repeated , very staccato , " more important -- justice to individual ?
" Just as the sight of sin offends God ," said the unknown , " so does the sight of ugliness offend Apollo .
I know that noble orders have bad knights , that good knights have bad tempers , that the Church has rough priests and coarse cardinals ; I have known it ever since I was born .
That is not a church .
"
" That is unfortunate ," said the other , in a quiet but hard voice , " because you are going to see his Majesty .
"
To whom do you appeal ?
" said his companion , sternly .
The being in the prow turned slowly round ; he looked at Evan with eyes which were like two suns , and put his hand to his mouth just too late to hide an awful smile .
" Ah !
" Now I know who you really are .
You are not one of God ' s angels .
It was his head that was his hobby .
Long strips and swirls of tattered and tawny cloud were dragged downward to the west exactly as torn red raiment would be dragged .
And so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red - flowering bushes or of copper beech , and drove them also across the garden , a drift of red leaves , like the leaves of autumn , as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud .
There was a sense in earth and heaven as of everything breaking up , and all the revolutionist in Turnbull rejoiced that it was breaking up .
The trees were breaking up under the wind , even in the tall strength of their bloom : the clouds were breaking up and losing even their large heraldic shapes .
The copper cloud was tumbling down towards the earth , like some gigantic leaf from the copper beeches .
As the thing whirled like a windswept leaf down towards the wall of the garden it was clear that it was some sort of air - ship made of metal , and slapping the air with big broad fins of steel .
While our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment , the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it , seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey , and alighted ( with impossible precision and placidity ) seated on the edge of the wall , over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at Turnbull .
Stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist , he drew a little nearer to the wall and , catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light , could see his face and figure quite plain .
Another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong , handsome , and smiling , with a well - cut profile and a long cloven chin .
" shouted Turnbull .
"
"
"
"
"
" Doesn ' t it seem as if everything were being upset ?
" That is the really fine thing about space .
That is the intoxication of space .
Then , finding his companion still mute , he fell himself into a smiling and motionless meditation , at the end of which he said suddenly :
" Converted me !
I have known him for a month , and I have not retracted a single ----"
Turnbull stood in an attitude which might well have meant pitching the other man out of the flying ship .
" I am an atheist ," he said , in a stifled voice .
The man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude , and said :
"
" I only mean what you mean ," answered the unknown in a temperate voice .
" What was it that you always meant on those million and one nights when you walked outside your Ludgate Hill shop and shook your hand in the air ?
"
The last red anger of the sunset was ended ; the dome of heaven was dark ; the lanes of flaring light in the streets below hardly lit up the base of the building .
But he saw that it was St . Paul ' s Cathedral , and he saw that on the top of it the ball was still standing erect , but the cross was stricken and had fallen sideways .
Many of the insurgents are simple people , and they naturally regard it as a happy omen .
" Quite so ," said Turnbull , in a rather colourless voice .
"
" Don ' t mention it ," said Turnbull .
" he asked .
Underneath whole squares and solid districts were in flames , like prairies or forests on fire .
" You see , these people were much too tired and weak even to join the social war .
" It _does_ seem absurdly simple ," said the man , with a beaming smile , " when one thinks of all the worry and talk about helping a hopeless slave population , when the future obviously was only crying to be rid of them .
Somewhat to the speaker ' s surprise this did not inflame the sensitive sceptic ; he had the air of thinking thoroughly , and then he said : " No , I don ' t think it ' s my friend MacIan that taught me that .
I think I should always have said that I don ' t like this .
" repeated the unknown in a tone quite indescribable .
" They have lives !
" cried his mentor with a sort of idealistic animation .
Can you , as a free - thinker , find any fault in that ?
"
" Yet you applaud tyrannicide ," said the stranger with rationalistic gaiety .
" Put you down -- what do you mean ?
" I have heard about your revolutionary war , and I think on the whole that I would rather be anywhere else .
" I want to be taken to a madhouse ," said Turnbull distinctly , giving the direction with a sort of precision .
" Why ?
" Because I want a little sane and wholesome society ," answered Turnbull .
There was a long and peculiar silence , and then the man driving the flying machine said quite coolly : " I won ' t take you back .
And then Turnbull said equally coolly : " Then I ' ll jump out of the car .
" For I think the devil is a dream , and so are you .
For some incredible moments stars and space and planets seemed to shoot up past him as the sparks fly upward ; and yet in that sickening descent he was full of some unnatural happiness .
He could connect it with no idea except one that half escaped him -- what Evan had said of the difference between Christ and Satan ; that it was by Christ ' s own choice that He descended into hell .
" he exclaimed with a relieved giggle .
"
" The head of the asylum has settled it all ," said Dr . Quayle , still looking down .
" If the head has settled it let the head announce it ," he said .
Turnbull was more impetuous , and opened the door .
At the other end of it was a ponderous and polished desk with an incandescent lamp on it , the light of which was just sufficient to show a slender , well - bred figure in an ordinary medical black frock - coat , whose head , quite silvered with age , was bent over neat piles of notes .
A mixture of mad irony with childish curiosity made them feel quite inclined to see what next twist would be taken by their imbecile luck .
After a little time the glazed corridors began to be lit by electricity .
At last , when they had walked nearly a mile in those white and polished tunnels , they came with quite a shock to the futile finality of a cul - de - sac .
"
Then , when silence had sunk deep and nothing happened for two and a half hours , it suddenly occurred to him that this was the end of his life .
They administered air in secret , but in sufficient doses , as if it were a medicine .
It was a long , narrow parallelogram , which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other ; but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space , like the prow of a ship .
It maddened him to think that two lines came together and pointed at nothing .
After twenty - five days he almost broke his head against it .
This he rent open and instantly saw a light behind ; it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell .
Turnbull was not long in discovering this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum .
" Who is that ?
Then he said with his old gaiety : " I vote we talk a little first ; I don ' t want to murder the first man I have met for ten million years .
" It has been awful .
"
" Oh , no ," said MacIan , and his voice shuddered ; " it was a great deal too exciting .
" You ' d think I was really mad if I told you ," answered Turnbull , bitterly .
" Then I expect it ' s the same as mine ," said the other voice .
" One is , when one is mad ," was the careless reply , " and it had worn a little loose in the socket .
" What is in there ?
One talks trivially of a face like parchment , but this old man ' s face was so wrinkled that it was like a parchment loaded with hieroglyphics .
He digested the discovery for some seconds , sucking his finger , and then he cried , with a crow of laughter : " And that ' s a head come through it .
He had grown to tolerate those dreary and mumbling madmen who trailed themselves about the beautiful asylum gardens .
" Good place .
" he said .
Then he turned to MacIan who was standing close behind him , and whose face , now familiar in all its moods , told him easily that Evan had heard the whole of the strange dialogue .
"
He just points to things and says that they stick out .
" He had a notion that he could help us ," said MacIan moodily , and began to pace towards the other end of his cell .
"
" shouted Turnbull with a sudden and furious energy .
With one bound they were in that cool and cleared landscape , and they found just outside the door the black - clad gentleman with the cloven chin smilingly regarding them ; and his chin seemed to grow longer and longer as he smiled .
" Let them be ," he cried in a voice that cut like a blade of ice ; and not only of ice , but of some awful primordial ice that had never been water .
And with that the Master laughed and swung away from them , almost as if his laugh was a bad thing for people to see .
But the shoulders of the Master only seemed to take on a new and unexpected angle of mockery as he strode away .
" My name is Hutton ," said the short , stout man , " and I am -- well , one of those whose business it is to uphold this establishment .
" My name is Turnbull ," said the other ; " I am one of those whose business it is to tear it to the ground .
" I suppose you think that quite a simple question ," he said .
" I think it a plain question ," said Turnbull , " and one that deserves a plain answer .
" You were shut up just then because it was just during that month that the Master was bringing off his big scheme .
" Heard of all what ?
Insanity , like forgetfulness , is simply a quality which enters more or less into all human beings ; and for practical purposes it is more necessary to know whose mind is really trustworthy than whose has some accidental taint .
In the first village you entered , the village constable would notice that you were not wearing on the left lapel of your coat the small pewter S which is now necessary to any one who walks about beyond asylum bounds or outside asylum hours .
Turnbull gave one stamp upon the gravel , then pulled himself together , and resumed : " But why should your infernal head medicine - man lock us up in separate cells while he was turning England into a madhouse ?
" Well ?
" inquired Turnbull , stamping again .
"
" he asked , abruptly .
"
Both his decisive step and dapper black array marked him out as another medical man , or at least a man in authority , and as he passed Turnbull the latter was aroused by a strong impression of having seen the man somewhere before .
At that moment the man knocked down his own eye - glass with a gesture of annoyance ; Turnbull remembered the gesture , and the truth sprang up solid in front of him .
The magistrate must have been transferred to some other official duties -- to something connected with the inspection of asylums .
" Confound him !
"
Cumberland Vane exploded with a detonation of oaths ; his face was transfigured with fury and contempt , and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with Turnbull .
" But Lord bless us and save us !
" he gasped , at length ; " I ' m not here as an official at all .
" You !
" cried Turnbull with terrible emphasis .
" asked Turnbull .
" Is it really true ," asked Turnbull , " that he has been allowed to buy up and control such a lot ?
" Well ," said Cumberland Vane , airily , " you didn ' t believe in religion , you see -- so we thought you were safe at any rate .
He was shocked out of his idle mood of awe by seeing MacIan break from behind the bushes and run across the lawn with an action he had never seen in the man before , with all his experience of the eccentric humours of this Celt .
" I am mad , Turnbull ," said Evan , with a dead clearness of speech , and leant back against the garden seat .
"
" I know enough about myself ," he said , " to allow for any mood , though it opened heaven or hell .
" What things ?
MacIan lowered his voice .
They sat for some moments in the mellow silence of the evening garden , a silence that was stifling for the sceptic , but utterly empty and final for the man of faith .
At last he broke out again with the words : " Well , anyhow , if I ' m mad , I ' m glad I ' m mad on that .
"
Across the clear space of cold silver and a pale lemon sky which was left by the gap in the ilex - trees there passed a slim , dark figure , a profile and the poise of a dark head like a bird ' s , which really pinned him to his seat with the point of coincidence .
Turnbull ' s tawny eyebrows were pulled together with a peculiar frown of curiosity , and all at once he walked quickly across the lawn .
He saw the sight which either proved him sane or proved the whole universe half - witted ; he saw the man of flesh approach that beautiful phantom , saw their gestures of recognition , and saw them against the sunset joining hands .
"
" I beg your pardon ," said the unhappy young man , rather wildly , " but what I mean is , why are you here in an asylum ?

" I am locked up in the madhouse ," said Evan , with a sort of stiff pride , " because I tried to keep my promise to you .
Then he drew nearer to her , and said in a dry and dreadful voice : " Oh , don ' t condescend to play the fool with such a fool as me .
Are you really locked up here as a patient -- because you helped us to escape ?
Evan flung his big elbow across his forehead and burst into tears .
Mr . James Turnbull continued his botanical researches into the structure of the rhododendron .
Even hollyhocks detained Turnbull but a short time .
" You tried to kill yourself four times for me ," she said , unsteadily , " and I have been chained up as a madwoman for you .
" Then he looked up suddenly , and said : " By the way , what is your name ?
XIX .
As he skirted a low hedge of laurel , an enormously tall young man leapt over it , stood in front of him , and almost fell on his neck as if seeking to embrace him .
"
" And he went off again into mirth as innocent as wedding - bells .
" Well , the fact is ----" began Turnbull again , and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth , for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye - glasses of Dr . Quayle .
Mr . Turnbull made some movement rather of surrender than assent , and the doctor caught it up exquisitely , showing even more of his two front teeth .
" My dear sir ," he said , in a quite affectionate manner , " I do not mind telling you -- you are such a very hopeful case -- you understand so well the scientific point of view ; and I don ' t like to see you bothered by the really hopeless cases .
He keeps on telling everybody "-- and the doctor lowered his voice confidentially --" he tells everybody that two people have taken is yacht .
"
" But this won ' t do , doctor ," said Turnbull , almost tearing his hair , " this really won ' t do .
The man really did lose a ship .
I want to know what all this can possibly mean .
"
I ' ve met the fellow Wilkinson , whose yacht we lost .
"
I don ' t say this is really the end of the world , but it ' s something like that -- it ' s the end of something .
Everything is coming to a point .
" What is the point ?
"
When I saw his eyes and heard his old croaking accent , I knew that it would not really have been right to kill you .
"
I do not say that we have never gone mad , but I say that we are fit to act as keepers to our enemies .
Massacre is wicked even with a provocation , as in the Bartholomew .
Now , by God !
I believe we are the sanest .
If the world has some healthy balance other than God , let the world find it .
Does it stand , or does it stagger ?
It cannot stand by itself ; you know it cannot .
There was a long silence , and then Turnbull said , hesitatingly : " Has it occurred to you that since -- since those two dreams , or whatever they were ----"
" Since then ," went on Turnbull , in the same low voice , " since then we have never even looked for our swords .
" We have found something which we both hate more than we ever hated each other , and I think I know its name .
There is too much talking in this garden ; we intend to close it .
Turnbull seemed to canvass for a few minutes the notion of knocking the Master down , and then fell under the same almost fairy fatalism as his companion .
In some strange way it did seem that the more smoothly they yielded , the more swiftly would events sweep on to some great collision .
They commanded the whole garden and the whole country - side , and could have blown to pieces an army corps .
For he saw a sight which was indeed , as MacIan had said -- either the Day of Judgement or a dream .
There was the Tolstoyan in Jaeger flannel , with the yellow beard that went backward and the foolish nose and eyes that went forward , with the curiosity of a crank .
There was not only Mr . Vane the magistrate , but the clerk of Mr . Vane , the magistrate .
Nothing wild or unfamiliar could have produced upon Turnbull such a nightmare impression as that ring of familiar faces .
" He drew nearer to Madeleine , but still doubtfully and all the more so because she still smiled at him .
" It ' s no good chattering away , Monsieur ," said Hutton , for the Master was silent .
We ' ve got to obey our orders , and so have you .
" A cosy party ," resumed the Master , scornfully , " and yet I believe some of you are in doubt about how we all came together .
"
Working men who betted on the duel were imprisoned for gambling .
"
There is , for instance , a person here of the name of Gordon , formerly the keeper of a curiosity shop .
Another wretched woman has the simple egotistic mania that she has caused the duel .
We have taken in hand every person who professed to have seen such a thing , and proved them all to be unbalanced .
Then he suddenly swung it above his head and sent it at the inquiring doctor with an awful crash which sent one of its wooden legs loose along the floor and crammed the doctor gasping into a corner .
How can it have happened ?
" Then I will tell you ," said Turnbull ; " it happened because some people fancied that a French grocer was as respectable as he looked .
Even as he spoke , as if by confirmation , old Mr . Durand re - entered the smoky room quite placidly , wiping the petroleum from his hands with a handkerchief .
But MacIan had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terrible .
" Not at all -- this is vengeance ," answered Turnbull , quite calmly ; " a thing which is completely healthy .
At the same moment a steel ladder slid down from the opening and struck the floor , and the cleft chin of the mysterious Master was thrust into the opening .
Long after they had clambered into the car , the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smoke - stung crowd below .
Turnbull looked once at Madeleine , and followed .
" Did you ever hear anyone shout for help or shriek with pain in that voice ?
"
" He is singing ," said Turnbull , simply .
In the heart of that white - hot hell he was singing like a bird .
" Then advancing to the fringe of the fire he called out on chance to the invisible singer : " Can you come out ?
"
" Fool , come out and save yourself !
that is not the way ," cried Evan , suddenly .
The towers and domes of the oppressive smoke seemed high and far enough to drown distant planets in a London fog .
As the little singing figure came nearer and nearer , Evan fell on his knees , and after an instant Beatrice followed ; then Madeleine fell on her knees , and after a longer instant Turnbull followed .
Then the little old man went past them singing down that corridor of flames .
For the two bodies , larger every second flying , spread out and sprawling in the fire - light , were the dead bodies of the two doctors whom Professor Lucifer had carried with him -- the weak and sneering Quayle , the cold and clumsy Hutton .
They went with a crash into the thick of the fire .
" They are gone !
The are lost !

These things were there , in their place ; but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place .
And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco , it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected the other shelves that held the specialist ' s library , and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics .
Fate , being in a funny mood , pushed the door open and introduced into those long , strict , sea - flanked apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master .
I ' ve come about that business of the MacNabs .
I have heard , you often help people out of such troubles .
" I hardly understand you ," replied the scientist , with a cold intensity of manner .
The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly , but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement .
She has one daughter , and she lets lodgings , and between her and the daughter , and between her and the lodgers -- well , I dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides .
The dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort , for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door .
There are tales of two voices heard talking in the room ; though , when the door is opened , Todhunter is always found alone .
The great specialist having condescended to the priest ' s simplicity , condescended expansively .
Now the root fact in all history is Race .
There is no stronger case than that of the wild , unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts , of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens .
It is not remarkable that such people , with the sea moaning behind them and the Church ( excuse me again ) droning in front of them , should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events .
Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder .
" Why , what has happened , Maggie ?
" That man Glass has been with him again ; I heard them talking through the door quite plain .
" I heard it through the door .
" But time for what ?
"
"
" Has been largely altered ," said the scientist gravely .
As I have nothing else to do , I will put on my hat and stroll down town with you .
In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the MacNabs ' street : the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the mountaineer , the criminologist with a lounging grace ( which was not without a certain leopard - like swiftness ), and the priest at an energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction .
In the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand , two black , barren - looking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment , and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands similarly spread , and her fierce face in shadow , she was a little like a demon herself .
It has none , which leads me to guess that Mr Glass is bald .
Mr Todhunter , as has been remarked , is a quiet thrifty gentleman , essentially an abstainer .
"
Father Brown , who had been looking dully at the carpet , lifted his round face and said : " What do you mean ?
"
" Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up ," he said , " you all jump to the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up ; and then , I suppose , escaped .
It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus , rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg .
Every one of those knots he has made himself and could loosen himself ; not one of them would have been made by an enemy really trying to pinion him .
"
" ejaculated Brown suddenly , " I wonder if it could possibly be that !
And though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half of Todhunter ' s visage , they did grow conscious of something struggling and intense about the upper part of it .
" Not that , I think ," said Dr Hood ; " the eyes have certainly a singular expression .
"
"
" cried Dr Hood .
" Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter ' s clothes ?
" inquired Mrs MacNab sternly .
But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in at his back window , and been driven away by him with great indignation , was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance , and make us imagine his whole life overshadowed by the silk - hatted spectre of Mr Glass .
He acted as if a troubadour had still a definite social office , like a bishop .
He contrived , in the true tradition of ' Arry at Margate , to look at once startling and commonplace .
He recognized it , above all the dire erection of English holiday array , as the face of an old but forgotten friend name Ezza .
This youth had been a prodigy at college , and European fame was promised him when he was barely fifteen ; but when he appeared in the world he failed , first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue , and then privately for years on end as an actor , a traveller , a commission agent or a journalist .
" Because they are not worth having ," answered Muscari .
" That is why I have become a Futurist -- and a courier .
" inquired the poet , with some eagerness .
" That ' s the man ," answered the courier .
" I ' m stupid enough for that ," said Ezza gloomily .
" But I should suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker , for here he comes .
Mr Harrogate , the great financier , did indeed enter the room , but nobody looked at him .
The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something , as indeed he was .
Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation on this occasion ; and her family had fallen into the easier Continental habit , allowing the stranger Muscari and even the courier Ezza to share their table and their talk .
They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril in the mountain path they were to attempt that week .
The danger was not from rock and avalanche , but from something yet more romantic .
Who is the King of Thieves ?
Men found his fierce proclamations nailed in every mountain village ; his sentinels , gun in hand , in every mountain ravine .
"
But the courier thought it perfectly safe .
" It is perfectly safe ," said the courier contemptuously .
" I know it is dangerous :" he said .
"
" I have had an introduction , but I do not mean to presume on it .
But young Harrogate could not but connect his presence with the mystical fears and warnings of yesterday .
But there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent , amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards , that dragged her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous heavens with wheeling suns .
" And yet rather fruitless ," he admitted ; " if I die tonight I die unmarried and a fool .
"
It was just enough to alter the equilibrium ; the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes over the cliff .
"
" he muttered ; " it can ' t be hers !
" I think I ' m justified ," he said , " till I know a little more .
A very quiet man , very poorly dressed and extremely sunburnt , came out of the bushes and took hold of the horses ' heads .
What do you call yourself ?
"
" I am the King of Thieves , and I welcome you all to my summer palace .
And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready came out of the bushes , and looked towards him for their orders .
"
" Excellent !
Who would not pay triple this sum for another day ' s association with such a domestic circle ?
Muscari , with the illogicality of a lover , admired this filial devotion , and yet was irritated by it .
"
" asked the other sharply .
' Mr Harrogate answered nothing ; so the words must have had some meaning .
But if not , what is this disaster , known both to courier and banker , which hangs over Miss Harrogate ' s head ?
" All my riddles , however , revolve round our bandit chief ," resumed the priest reflectively .
It never could be a fortress .
As the little priest ' s words lengthened and lost themselves in a dull and dreamy sincerity , Muscari , whose animal senses were alert and impatient , heard a new noise in the mountains .
Even for him the sound was as yet very small and faint ; but he could have sworn the evening breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of horses ' hoofs and a distant hallooing .
Then the noises from both quarters seemed to meet on the road above ; branches broke , horses neighed , men cried out .
" A rescue !
Fall on the rear of these ruffians .
The gendarmes are rescuing us ; come , friends , let us rescue the gendarmes !
"
" he said in spirited Italian slang ; " this damned farce will soon be over .
" What do you mean , you shuffler ?
It was more like a town crowd preventing the passage of the police than anything the poet had ever pictured as the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood .
Care enough to marry her and make her a good husband , I mean ?
" Yes ," said the poet quite simply .
"
" Because ," said Father Brown , " her Doom is coming up the road .
The anger of the Italian policeman , which he expressed volubly to Father Brown , was largely mixed with admiration .
This last trick of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented .
I really do believe in those things if I believe in anything .
I am going to Manchester , Liverpool , Leeds , Hull , Huddersfield , Glasgow , Chicago -- in short , to enlightened , energetic , civilized society !
"
" In short ," said Muscari , " to the real Paradise of Thieves .
His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee -- a street which in that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage as the park itself ; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine , interrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street .
The door was opened to them by the doctor ' s old servant , Simon , who might very well have passed for a doctor himself , having a strict suit of black , spectacles , grey hair , and a confidential manner .
With all the gravity of a great physician handling a prescription , Simon handed a letter to M . Armagnac .
I want you to answer him and deal with him .
Before either could complete a sentence , it was evident that the invader had been expelled from the house opposite .
The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn to speak also learn to be silent -- silent as that spy cowering in the house opposite !
Betrayed at this moment .
It is signed with his initials .
It is a direction for finding the secret of this new Noiseless Powder .
"
Livid as he was , he spoke with a sort of prim decision , so that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence .
It is true I have asked two other men to confront him for me .
The French ask for a duellist as the English ask for a sportsman .
At one of the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat in complete solitude , and applied himself to a pile of whitebait with the gravest sort of enjoyment .
But it wasn ' t written by Hirsch .
" asked Father Brown .
" It is a clumsy forgery by somebody who knew nothing of the real hiding - place .
It ' s manifestly absurd to say that Hirsch can have made a mistake about a paper that nobody knew of but himself ; or can have tried to help a foreign thief by telling him to fumble in the wrong drawer .
Father Brown seemed to cogitate ; he lifted a little whitebait on his fork .
" he asked .
" I ' m frightened of a white envelope ," said the other seriously , " If it had only just been grey !
" cried Flambeau .
" The note is utterly wrong about the facts .
"
The man must have known that particular house to be so accurately inaccurate .
" I can ' t conceive ," said Brown ; " I don ' t understand this Hirsch affair at all .
As long as it was only the left drawer instead of the right , and red ink instead of black , I thought it must be the chance blunders of a forger , as you say .
It wasn ' t .
"
" What was it , then ?
" I don ' t know that either ," answered Brown , with a face of blank bewilderment .
" Suppose a person in a position of trust ," went on the priest , " began to give the enemy information because it was false information .
Suppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner .
The better part of him ( what was left of it ) would still say : ` I have not helped the enemy ; I said it was the left drawer .
"
"
" I wasn ' t thinking of Dreyfus ," said Father Brown .
You don ' t doubt him ?
"
You ' d expect a secret paper passing between such people , officials or officers , to look quite different from that .
"
" What ?
" cried Flambeau , with an incredulity quite frightful -- " apologize ?
" cried Flambeau .
" He can ' t be afraid of that little Hirsch !
" I believe it ' s some plot !
Brown said nothing , but finished his plate of fish .
" Where did you last see our precious Colonel ?
" No ," said Father Brown , quite simply , but suddenly standing up , " for a very short journey .
Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept round the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis , where they got out , and he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the growing dusk .
" All Paris will cheer him now our cursed Colonel has turned tail .
He looked much the same as when they first saw him , except that he had changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers for a conventional pair of trousers .
It was clear he was already escaping from the hotel .
On the other side of the lane ran the high gilt railings of a gloomy park .
Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face , and stood in front of it for a moment , biting his black moustache in a fury of curiosity .
" Dubosc ' s escape is more elaborate than we thought ," he said ; " but I suppose he is escaping from France .
" Do you mean suicide ?
A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above .
The Duke , however stimulated , had the instincts of an aristocrat , and desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it ; but Flambeau , who had the instincts of a burglar ( and a detective ), had already swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggling tree from which he could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window in the back of the high dark house .
"
This is something of the kind , but more curious .
" Oh , what does all this mysticism mean ?
Under the wall Father Brown was going on in heavy meditation , as if to himself .
" It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau .
One of these men is fair and the other dark , one stout and the other slim , one strong and the other weak .
Things made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel .
Slipping on a loose black coat , the figure vanished towards the front of the house .
The evening daylight in the streets was large and luminous , opalescent and empty .
His tall , slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked the reverse of feeble .
His hair was silver - grey , but he did not look old ; it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate ; it was curly but it did not look curled .
His face was somewhat square , his jaw was square , his shoulders were square , even his jacket was square .
You could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were ; his portrait was on every other postcard ; his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper ; songs in his honour in every other music - hall turn or on every other barrel - organ .
For it was against his breeding to show eagerness , and against his conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers .
The priest did really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action .
But they won ' t be complete , you know , without my favourite flower .
He had already handed his spear in a lordly style , like a sceptre , to the piteous Parkinson , and was about to assume one of the cushioned seats like a throne .
But meanwhile Miss Rome ' s experiment in mobilizing the British Army had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable .
Cutler had indeed risen stiffly and suddenly , and walked towards the door , hatless , as if at a word of command .
Yet a second or two after Seymour ' s brow darkened again .
" What ' s that creature down the passage ?
Is this some of your tricks ?
" hissed his pale rival , and made a stride towards him .
"
" My name is Brown ," said the priest sadly , as he bent over something and straightened himself again .
The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away .
Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear .
" You need not kill me ," he said in a voice quite cold ; " I shall do that on my own account .
Even as Cutler bore him back across tilted chair and table , Bruno had twisted the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist .
Cutler made no answer , but said sharply a moment after : " We must attend to the ... the death ..." and his voice escaped from articulation .
He also had paid his tribute , not without eloquence , to the woman who had died .
" I wish I was him ," he said huskily .
" We had better all be going ," said Seymour heavily ; " we have done all we can to help .
As far as my words on oath can go , you might either of you have done it .
"
" Which drew blood ," replied the priest , nodding .
There was a silence ; and then Seymour said , with an emphasis quite alien to his daily accent : " But I saw a man in the passage .
"
Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer , Father Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping up the road with his stumpy old umbrella .
The victim was a popular actress ; the accused was a popular actor ; and the accused had been caught red - handed , as it were , by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season .
In those extraordinary circumstances the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy ; and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of Bruno ' s trial .
Though himself much more of a public man than the judge , he conveyed exactly the fine shade of self - effacement before the King ' s justice ; and though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister or the Archbishop of Canterbury , they could have said nothing of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman , with an accent on the noun .
Sir Wilson was leaving the witness - box , after a few final particulars to which there were many other witnesses , when the counsel for the defence sprang up and stopped him .
" I shall only detain you a moment ," said Mr Butler , who was a rustic - looking person with red eyebrows and an expression of partial slumber .
A faint , refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour ' s features .
Butler ' s sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion .
Asked if it was a man or a woman , he said it looked more like a beast -- with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner .
But the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere anger , and Cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already fairly clear .
The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross - examination ; although ( as was his custom ) even in being brief , he seemed to take a long time about it .
"
" The last witness said it was ," commented the counsel , with unscrupulous swiftness .
"
" He may have been bending forward ," said Cutler , in a hoarse and rather faint voice .
" A black shape was seen in the passage .
" You are a most extraordinary witness ," he said ; " but there is something about you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth .
Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest had really seen himself doing murder with a short dagger with a long hilt ( which seemed somehow to make it more horrible ), he had himself hurried on to explain .
Spears have short blades .
"
But the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest ; and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed .
She struggled to free herself , and as she did so Parkinson came out of the prisoner ' s room and lunged with the spear .
" When I was in the dressing - room I noticed that some of them could probably be slid out into the passage .
" Yes , my lord ; that was what I was trying to say ," said Brown , " but they asked me for the shape ; and our hats have corners just like horns , and so I --"
" And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee with humped shoulders and hog ' s bristles , he simply saw himself ?
What do you think of it ?
" Do you really mean ," demanded his friend , " that you think the two methods equally valuable ?
"
" What is it ?
It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right end .
" Society ' s brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt .
" I cannot think at this moment of anything in this world that would interest me less .
" said Mr Usher dryly , and handing across another scrap of newspaper .
"
Finally , when daylight bad fully revealed the scene of murder , it was found that he had written on the wall above the body a fragmentary sentence , apparently with a finger dipped in blood : ` This was self - defence and he had the gun .
Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide .
"
" It would have been rather awkward ," remarked Brown , " if you had found he was a popular athlete practising a mile race .
" You thought it was the runaway convict ," observed the priest simply , " because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that a convict had run away .
Nor do they run all doubled up like a crouching dog .
" To begin with , on the face of it , there is no mystery here at all .
Last - Trick is a man of mental endowments and a high public character ; but in this country the relations of employers and employed are considerably strained .
I ' d forgotten the exact tale ; but you know the place I mean ; it lies north of Todd ' s house towards the wilderness , and has two queer wrinkled trees , so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids than decent foliage .
As she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face , a face that I knew .
Todd ' s daughter was fully eighteen when her father first made his pile ; so there isn ' t really anything impossible in her having a hanger - on in low life ; or even in her hanging on to him , as I think she must be doing , to judge by the lantern business .
"
" I sat the man in the ill - fitting clothes in a comfortable chair , and simply wrote words on a blackboard ; and the machine simply recorded the variations of his pulse ; and I simply observed his manner .
Thus I wrote ` heron ' and ` eagle ' and ` owl ', and when I wrote ` falcon ' he was tremendously agitated ; and when I began to make an ` r ' at the end of the word , that machine just bounded .
You say you observed his manner ; but how do you know you observed it right ?
" I tell you ," cried the American in the utmost excitement , " I was as cool as a cucumber .
" Well , this one wasn ' t ," said Usher , throwing the papers about .
" I only point out what seems a reasonable possibility .
"
Though the word was a mere howl , every syllable was as clear as a separate stroke on the clock .
"` Drugger Davis !
` They ' ve got Drugger Davis !
I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite character this time , lending money instead of borrowing it ; but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate , but still with the same bad result for them .
Even , since then , four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story .
You talk as if a miser on Monday were always a spendthrift on Tuesday .
He didn ' t write on the wall with his own hand , to say he had done it .
Can ' t you see the whole character is different , in good and evil ?
Why , you don ' t seem to be like I am a bit .
The door flew open .
The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster with an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments .
Now , you know him -- you know him quite well -- but you don ' t know him -- naturally .
"
Hadn ' t you better go and investigate him ?
" I am not saying anything about it ," he said .
" I leave all the rest to you .
But I think ," he went on softly and reflectively , " I think you Americans are too modest .
" I ' m afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather ," he said , " but this cutting may interest you .
A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness into the steering - seat of a pretty high - toned Panhard ; he was accompanied by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl .
On the police interfering , the young woman threw back the shawl , and all recognized Millionaire Todd ' s daughter , who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner at the Pond , where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille .

Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes , but Father Brown was gone .
The Head of Caesar
THERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue of tall houses , rich but largely empty , that looks like a terrace of tombs .
Then ( seeing his friend put away the pocket - book ), he said softly :
" If you ' ve got ten minutes , I wish you ' d follow that man with the false nose .
"
How do you know it ' s false ?
"
I could only suppose that you ' d seen somebody coming whom you didn ' t want to meet ; and found the public - house was the only shelter in this wilderness of stone ....
He looked at her steadily for the first time , and said : " Because I hoped you would speak to me .
" There was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile .... That man , I fancy , has gone a very crooked road -- by following his nose .
" she demanded , rather shakily .
That is why atheism is only a nightmare .
He then made a will leaving the Carstairs Collection , actually with a yet smaller allowance , to my brother Arthur .
" Arthur , you may say , might well complain of this ; but Arthur is my father over again .
We used to go shrimping together , and said and thought we were in love with each other ; at least he certainly said he was , and I certainly thought I was .
" One summer afternoon , when I had promised to go shrimping along the sands with Philip , I was waiting rather impatiently in the front drawing - room , watching Arthur handle some packets of coins he had just purchased and slowly shunt them , one or two at a time , into his own dark study and museum which was at the back of the house .
It was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear , but all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming in pursuit of me .
And yet my heart rose higher and higher like a child ' s kite , until I came over the loose , dry sand - hills and to the flat , wet sands , where Philip stood already up to his ankles in the shallow shining water , some hundred yards out to sea .
There was no earthly logical evidence that he was looking at me ; he might have been looking at a ship , or the sunset , or the sea - gulls , or at any of the people who still strayed here and there on the shore between us .
If he had hesitated an instant at the water ' s edge it would have been nothing .
Then he said , with a clearly modulated and rather mincing articulation : ` Would it discommode you to contribute elsewhere a coin with a somewhat different superscription ?
His dark beard was not really long or wild --, but he looked rather hairy , because the beard began very high up in his face , just under the cheek - bones .
I had not , to all appearance , been followed in the street ; and if I had , they could not ` X - ray ' the coin in my closed hand .
The man standing on the sand - hills could no more have seen what I gave Philip than shoot a fly in one eye , like the man in the fairy - tale .
He merely said gruffly to the man : ` You clear out of this .
He turned suddenly , saying , ` Go back .
" This stroke comforted me somehow , though it might well increase my peril ; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess .
The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of the investigator Flambeau fell across the table .
He went off sulking , but more sheepishly than I had expected -- perhaps he had been shaken by his fall -- and I watched the star of sand splashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid vindictive pleasure .
I sat at the drawing - room window looking on to the garden , which still glowed with the last full evening light .
Anyhow , I was looking blankly , but rather pleasantly than otherwise , at another window , uncurtained , but by this time black as a slate with the final night - fall .
" For it was not a thumb , any more than it was a snail .
I slammed the shutters together somehow , rushed up to my room and locked myself in .
My brother might cast me out and curse me for ever , but he was a gentleman , and would defend me on the spot .
His face was composed and occupied , but his nose - tip still had the air of being the most mobile part of his face , as if it had just turned from left to right like an elephant ' s proboscis .
He was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to confess the abstraction of the lesser gem --, but he bore down all other topics with his over - powering projects .
Because the bargain might still misfire any moment , he insisted on my packing at once and going up with him to lodgings he had already taken in Fulham , to be near the curio - shop in question .
Thus in spite of myself , I fled from my foe almost in the dead of night -- but from Philip also .... My brother was often at the South Kensington Museum , and , in order to make some sort of secondary life for myself , I paid for a few lessons at the Art Schools .
" It is an extraordinary problem ," admitted Flambeau .
" Not so extraordinary as the answer ," remarked Father Brown rather gloomily .
Flambeau lowered his voice .
" Well , obviously ," cried his friend , " there must be one to be exposed ; one to threaten exposure ; and one at least whom exposure would horrify .
"
"
He blackmailed his brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime ( that is why he took the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney ), he blackmailed his sister for the theft he alone could have noticed .
" What is there wrong about a miser that is not often as wrong about a collector ?
"
The Purple Wig
It might truly be said of him , as for many journalists in authority , that his most familiar emotion was one of continuous fear ; fear of libel actions , fear of lost advertisements , fear of misprints , fear of the sack .
Another tradition says that Cavaliers just after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover the ear of the first Lord Exmoor .
I suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary , how inhuman , how downright diabolist , is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses .
In such happy , healthful activities did Mr Nutt disport himself , until the ensuing Saturday found him at the same desk , dictating to the same typist , and using the same blue pencil on the first instalment of Mr Finn ' s revelations .
Though written violently , it was in excellent English ; but the editor , as usual , had given to somebody else the task of breaking it up into sub - headings , which were of a spicier sort , as " Peeress and Poisons ", and " The Eerie Ear ", " The Eyres in their Eyrie ", and so on through a hundred happy changes .
I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little ; but it broke the spell of the third man ' s silence most successfully .
The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country , and many have suffered from it .
"
Don ' t fancy because you see him sitting here that he isn ' t a great lord in the worst sense of the word .
The librarian turned to him and seemed to forget my presence ; he was strongly moved and , I think , a little heated with wine .
Anybody is kicked out of the house without a character who is so much as found near his dressing - room door .,
He does , with sincere shame and terror , hide under that purple wig something he thinks it would blast the sons of man to see .
" The law will give it you ," he said ; " but you will not take it .... Why not ?
Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures , and with a passion I think at least partisan .
I was quite conscious of the possibility that the whole was the extravagance of an old braggart and gossip .
I learned from an old apothecary in the village that there was a bald man in evening dress , giving the name of Green , who came to him one night to have a three - cornered cut on his forehead plastered .
Mr Nutt , of the Daily Reformer , wrote some highly incongruous words across the top of the copy , made some highly mysterious marks down the side of it , and called to Miss Barlow in the same loud , monotonous voice : " Take down a letter to Mr Finn .
I ' ve altered him to Mr Brown , a Spiritualist .
A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor examining , with blue eyes that seemed to grow rounder and rounder , the second instalment of Mr Finn ' s tale of mysteries in high life .
" I can quite understand that it ' s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps .
" I cried ; " and that ' s true enough .
Why should he show every stranger over such a Chamber of Horrors unless he is proud of it ?
The embarrassment of the librarian left him hovering on his hind legs , like a huge bear .
The Duke addressed the priest with great seriousness .
" To see me do what ?
The Duke ' s face did not move ; but he looked at his petitioner with a glassy stare which was the most awful expression I have ever seen on a human face .
And I say to you , wherever you find men ruled merely by mystery , it is the mystery of iniquity .
I entreat your Grace to end this nightmare now and here at this table .
I was leaning over the table in ungovernable excitement ; in listening to this extraordinary duel half a thought had come into my head .
When he said , in the same voice of stone , " I refuse ," I simply sprang on him .
His head and mine were both bending over the bald head of the wigless Duke .
Why , the man had nothing to hide .
"
" Yes ," said Father Brown , " that is what he had to hide .
What happened was this .
Why , Sir Simon is one of Exmoor ' s greatest pals ; and it would ruin that cousin of the Eyres that ' s standing for us at Bradford .
Besides , old Soap - Suds was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year ; he ' d sack me by wire if I lost him it with such lunacy as this .
And what about Duffey ?
FATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures .
" He heard the most important things and the most trivial with the same tasteless absorption .
He heard that Fanshaw couldn ' t find his cigar - holder anywhere ; he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle " Both eyes bright , she ' s all right ; one eye winks , down she sinks .
He heard Fanshaw add that his country was full of such quaint fables and idioms ; it was the very home of romance ; he even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire , as a claimant to the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship .
He heard Flambeau laugh , and ask if , perhaps , the adventurous title of " Westward Ho !
This Cecil Fanshaw was , in person , of the kind that commonly urges such crude but pleasing enthusiasms ; a very young man , light - haired , high - coloured , with an eager profile ; with a boyish bravado of spirits , but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type .
The water seemed to widen and split , being cloven by the dark wedge of a fish - shaped and wooded islet .
He was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere , but never in such architectural proportions .
It was in view only long enough for the priest to see that , however old - fashioned , it was a comfortable and well - kept country - house , with flower - beds in front of it .
you ' ve not seen a place quite like this before , I fancy ; that ' s why I ' ve brought you here , my friend .
If Queen Elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up this river in a gilded barge , she would be received by the Admiral in a house exactly such as she was accustomed to , in every corner and casement , in every panel on the wall or plate on the table .
As it happened the ship had already turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water .
Indeed , the black - haired young lady was letting her canoe float slowly and silently past the strange islet ; and was looking intently up at the strange tower , with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval and olive face .
"
"
They followed him on to the island , just under the tower , and Father Brown , whether from the mere touch of dry land , or the interest of something on the other bank of the river ( which he stared at very hard for some seconds ), seemed singularly improved in briskness .
The voice in the gloom swore again , and then broke into a jolly laugh .
Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager , all the more because it was not only clean - shaven , but without eyebrows .
When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity .
The Admiral pooh - poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work ; but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter , and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour :
And though the third thing isn ' t so very heraldic , it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire ; and it looks just as like it .
"
Fanshaw , here , who is fond of such things , will tell you there are other versions of the tale , and much more horrible ones .
Someone saw a blaze hereabout , don ' t you know , as he walked home through a wood ; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower .
" asked Father Brown with a gentle suddenness , pointing to the woods on the left river - bank .
" he said ; " they ' ve been camping about here for about a week .
The dining - room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship ; but its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain .
But such things were less prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint - coloured South American birds , very scientifically stuffed , fantastic shells from the Pacific , and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or to cook them .
" I ' m rather sorry you take this so lightly ," said Fanshaw to the host ; " for the truth is , I ' ve brought these friends of mine with the idea of their helping you , as they know a good deal of these things .
" I don ' t believe in anything ," answered Pendragon very briskly , with a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird .
" I ' m a man of science .
Rather to Flambeau ' s surprise , his clerical friend , who seemed to have entirely woken up , took up the digression and talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected information , until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the servants vanished .
"
" he cried ; " and so had that girl !
You looked surprised .
But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order of succession to the property , he thought it might show whether any connected fate followed the family as a family .
My father , coming up this coast out of the Atlantic , was washed up on these Cornish rocks .
We ' ll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle of this wine .
Let me , and my friends if they like , stop in that tower of yours just for tonight ?
Do you know that in my business you ' re an exorcist almost before anything else ?
"
"
Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen ; but he sat quite still , and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice .
They followed him , laughing and half remonstrating ; but he replied with the utmost solemnity , explaining to them , in a maddening little sermon , that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others .
You should have seen me with the spud !
Talking of tools , you ' ve got that swordstick , Flambeau , you always carry ?
How grey everything looks !
"
" He made a wavering half - turn of apology towards the gardener , with the hose still spouting in his hand .
" Your river mist ," he said , " has a rum smell .
"
As he spoke a most beautiful rose - red light seemed to burst into blossom like a gigantic rose ; but accompanied with a crackling and rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils .
" My God !
what is this ?
Behind him came the two negroes , also with the old crooked cutlasses out of the trophy .
But he remained composed ; and never took his eye off the patch of flame which had begun by spreading , but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear of water .
" Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip .
He almost felt the island shake when Flambeau collided with the huge gardener ; he merely imagined how it would whirl round them as they wrestled .
But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent , which had lately once more increased , had once more slightly diminished .
Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head .
Three times at least it raced round the whole island , in a way that was as horrible as the chase of a lunatic , both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes carried by the pursuers ; but was more horrible still , because it somehow suggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden .
He knew the use of a family legend .
'"
"
" You thought it was a chart of the Pacific Islands ," answered Brown .
It was the map of this river .
" But how do you know ?
" asked Fanshaw .
" I saw the rock you thought was like a dragon , and the one like Merlin , and --"
" I felt simply horrible .
A light fall of snow had half - melted into a few strips , also looking leaden rather than silver , when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost ; no fresh snow had fallen , but a ribbon of the old snow ran along the very margin of the coast , so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam .
After walking a mile or two farther , they found that the shore was beginning to be formally embanked , so as to form something like a parade ; the ugly lamp - posts became less few and far between and more ornamental , though quite equally ugly .
Half a mile farther on Father Brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower - pots , covered with the low , flat , quiet - coloured plants that look less like a garden than a tessellated pavement , between weak curly paths studded with seats with curly backs .
" I suppose ," said Father Brown , turning up his coat - collar and drawing a woollen scarf rather closer round his neck , " that we are approaching a pleasure resort .
They had come under the big bandstand , and the priest was looking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it , his head a little on one side , like a bird ' s .
It was the conventional , rather tawdry kind of erection for its purpose : a flattened dome or canopy , gilt here and there , and lifted on six slender pillars of painted wood , the whole being raised about five feet above the parade on a round wooden platform like a drum .
" And with an agility hardly to be expected of him , he hopped up on to the raised platform .
For some reason or other the platform had given way under Father Brown , and the unfortunate little man had dropped through to the level of the parade .
I rather think I want to get in .
" he asked .
Behind the table and on the seat sat a dark - haired young man , bareheaded , and gazing at the sea in a state of almost astonishing immobility .
But though he might have been a waxwork when they were within four yards of him , he jumped up like a jack - in - the - box when they came within three , and said in a deferential , though not undignified , manner : " Will you step inside , gentlemen ?
" Much obliged ," said Flambeau .
"
As instant evidence proved , the proprietor had told , then and after , nothing but the literal truth .
But both Flambeau and Father Brown have often confessed that , in all their ( often outrageous ) adventures , nothing had so chilled their blood as that voice of an ogre , sounding suddenly out of a silent and empty inn .
The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders .
After all , it is hardly weather for basking on the shore .
Nor was there anything notable in the face , except something that was probably a mere nervous trick -- a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other , giving the impression that the other was larger , or was , perhaps , artificial .
"
" Curious ," said the dark - haired man thoughtfully .
His phrase that the cook was starting presently was fulfilled to the letter , for the cook came out , pulling his gloves on , even as they spoke .
A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head -- a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors .
"
Flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other .
" It was a very long gold pin , and had the carved head of a monkey or some such thing ," continued the cleric ; " and it was fixed in a rather odd way -- he wore pince - nez and a broad black --"
"
As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell , brushing the brim of his hat .
Flambeau ' s shoulders again filled out and altered suddenly .
Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall , just as a third shot picked up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel .
Without ceremony he snatched up the little priest , slung him astraddle on his shoulders , and went racing towards Seawood as fast as his long legs could carry him .
" I had hoped he had only a little ," answered Brown in a rather troubled voice , " and I may have been wrong in what I did .
"
" It ' s odd you should mention Epsom ," said the priest .
As a fact , I know ( from an Irish policeman who is a friend of mine ) that he was found close up to the Epsom Grand Stand -- in fact , only hidden by one of the lower doors being pushed back .
"
Are you going to see the fight ?
Lord Pooley was a gentleman , and , like most of the few remaining to our race , was worried -- especially about money .
Now they ' re fighting with the regulation gloves , and there ' s not the rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed .
The referee ?
" I don ' t know who ' s going to be killed ," replied Father Brown , with a reflective stare .
" If I did I shouldn ' t have to spoil your pleasure .
" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes .
The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air of new curiosity .
The clerk stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished .
The gongs beat with a deafening din as the doors of the shrine open and the monkey - god is revealed ; almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him .
But after --'"
" he cried , showing his apish teeth .
" The matter is only deferred ," said the nobleman quietly .
A beautiful Italian head .
" He put the little leather book in his overcoat pocket .
Father Brown shook his head , like a murderer of much riper experience .
" But consider .
That is the little trick Nigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs .
" By the way , Malvoli --" Pooley began .
Also ," he added , with a smile , " I fear the English decline to draw any fine distinction between the moral character produced by my religion and that which blooms out of Voodoo .
Nigger Ned had been overtaken a mile or two away , and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand .
Persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions , made to scrub their faces before going on board ship , as if each white complexion were made up like a mask , of greasepaint .
For people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savage secret society , and by the time Flambeau and Father Brown were leaning on the parade parapet in April , the Black Man meant in England almost what he once meant in Scotland .
"
But all the windows and doors were sealed ; none of the people were of the sort that would be up at such a time , or still less on such an errand .
But as he passed under the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens , he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop .
Major Putnam was a bald - headed , bull - necked man , short and very broad , with one of those rather apoplectic faces that are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate with the occidental luxuries .
He had a large palm - leaf hat on the back of his head ( suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face ), but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas ; which , though glowing enough to behold , must have been , on a fresh morning , pretty chilly to wear .
If you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly --"
" I thought so ," answered Cray with gravity .
Colonel Cray was regarding his host with a strange and steady stare .
" I ' ll tell you exactly what he did ," he said .
Father Brown ' s hand went half - way to his head , with the gesture of a man remembering somebody ' s name .
The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such morning hours : that the rooms seemed brighter than the sky outside ; even after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the front hall .
"
The Major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar to the soothing of a sick child , and said : " It was a burglar .
Then , as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards the door in the garden , he added in a husky , confidential voice : " I doubt whether I should send for the police , for fear my friend here has been a little too free with his bullets , and got on the wrong side of the law .
He ' s lived in very wild places ; and , to be frank with you , I think he sometimes fancies things .
" I suppose we ' d better follow him outside ," he said .
He stood regarding this dismal object for some minute and a half --, then he stepped towards it , lifted the lid and put his head inside .
" It serves you right ," she was saying : " I always told you not to have that old - fashioned cruet - stand .
"
" I ' m old - fashioned myself ; and the things keep together .
And it ' s time you had a treat , Audrey ; you mustn ' t be a housekeeper every hour of the day ; and I know you want to hear the music .
" I want to go to church ," she said , with rather severe eyes .
"
You are struggling against it .
"
" By hell , but that is a true word !
I know what they think I am .
Then I came to a flight of steps , and then to a blind door , secured by a latch of elaborate Eastern ironwork , which I could only trace by touch , but which I loosened at last .
Just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain .
I had begun , in the dim light , to guess at the hieroglyphic , not without horror , when a more horrible thing happened .
He had a carved smile on his face , of copper flesh and ivory teeth ; but I think the most hateful thing about him was that he was in European dress .
But as you have seen the Monkey ' s Tail , we must pronounce the worst sentence .
"` It is vain to ask for mercy ; you must go free ,' said the smiling man .
What I did see was a sort of stick or branch circling , self - supported , in the empty sky .
Father Brown threw away a daisy - chain he was making , and rose with a wistful look .
But Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be in charity even with those who wax their pointed beards , who have small gloved hands , and who speak with perfectly modulated voices .
" I didn ' t know that was in your line ," he said rather rudely .
But it ' s rather too large to take to church .
"
" And he ran his eyes over the stew - pots or other strange utensils on the wall .
Father Brown , touching other people , was as sensitive as a barometer ; but today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros .
" I know ," replied Brown , rather vaguely .
" I wonder why the burglar wanted mustard , too ," he went on , taking a mustard - pot from another pocket .
" I shall come and hear your sermons , if they ' re as amusing as your manners .
" Oh , there are sermons in a cruet - stand , too ," said Father Brown , quite gravely .
" Have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard - seed ; or charity that anoints with oil ?
Father Brown , who was making the salad , tipped two spoonfuls of the mustard into the tumbler of water beside him ; stood up and said in a new , loud and sudden voice --" Drink that !
Has he been poisoned ?
Major Putnam had sprung up , his purple face mottled .
The priest could hear him dragging down his palm - leaf hat from the peg and tumbling out of the front door ; he heard the garden gate slam .
There is no curse on you .
The moment after , Audrey Watson came rushing into the house and fell on her knees beside Cray ' s chair .
He could not hear what they said to each other ; but their faces moved with amazement , not unhappiness .
" said the priest .
The Strange Crime of John Boulnois
By the paradox already noted , articles of valuable intelligence and enthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written by an illiterate maniac , headlines such as " Darwin Chews Dirt ; Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks "-- or " Keep Catastrophic , says Thinker Boulnois .
The only other person present was a lean man with close red hair and loose , horsey - looking clothes , who was drinking very bad whisky , but smoking a very good cigar .
" What is Pendragon Park ?
" asked Calhoun Kidd .
The American pressman considered him with more attention .
There was something of the Renascence Prince about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity --, he was not only a great amateur , but an ardent one .
There was in him none of that antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word " dilettante ".
Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection ; and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious in an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour .
That very evening , marked by Mr Kidd for the exposition of Catastrophism , had been marked by Sir Claude Champion for an open - air rendering of Romeo and Juliet , in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name .
" Old Boulnois may be squared -- or he may be square .
But Calhoun Kidd , having finished a milk and soda , betook himself smartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage , leaving his cynical informant to his whisky and tobacco .
The last of the daylight had faded ; the skies were of a dark , green - grey , like slate , studded here and there with a star , but lighter on the left side of the sky , with the promise of a rising moon .
" Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies , sir ," he said , " but he has been obliged to go out suddenly .
"
" And he shut the door , brutally , but with an air of duty not done .
In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun will be on the spot .
Something happened such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale .
It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle .
He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come , and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles ; which , when he turned it , brought him in full view of the long , lighted house , with a lake and fountains in front of it .
Nevertheless , he did not look at this , having something more interesting to look at .
Kidd bent his head down to hear more , and just managed to catch the words :
This man ' s dead .
"
" Were you too late also ?
" Boulnois ," said Calhoun Kidd , and whistled softly .
"
His butler told me so .
The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue , and now returned with the fallen sword , which looked ludicrously large and theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure , at once clerical and commonplace .
Then , without glancing at the point or pommel , he handed the long weapon to the doctor .
" she said , with a rather fearful smile .
" I don ' t think he did it , and you don ' t either .
Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed , and passed his hand across his forehead .
He would not snatch Romeo ' s sword from its romantic scabbard ; or slay his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar ; or leave his body among the roses , or fling the sword away among the pines .
"
"
"
" Yes " she said , with a face like marble .
" I saw him do it .
" He died ," said Father Brown , " for love of you ?
" My husband ," she said , " is a great man .
Sir Claude Champion was not a great man : he was a celebrated and successful man .
He no more expects to be famous for thinking than for smoking cigars .
And Champion wanted to be envied .
" Why , what can you mean ?
And we don ' t keep a butler , thank goodness !
"
" You don ' t understand ," said Mrs Boulnois .
When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy dog , a small and neat maid - servant showed him into the dining - room , where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp , exactly as his wife described him .
"
'" He said it with neither frown nor smile , and his visitor was conscious of a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which his wife had called greatness .
" I know ," assented the other , " but one often has to choose between feeling a damned fool and being one .
"
"
It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history -- hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and Father Brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer .
Despite his prosaic appearance and generally practical walk of life , Father Brown was not without a certain streak of romance in his composition , though he generally kept his daydreams to himself , as many children do .
Or something of that kind .
Indeed , it is by no means certain that the occupation would ever have been successful had not one of the three brothers , Paul , despicably , but very decisively declined to abide these things any longer , and , by surrendering all the secrets of the insurrection , ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion to the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto .
" I saw him once .
It is only right to say that it received some support from fragmentary words -- spoken by the great Ludwig in the hour of death , when he looked at Heinrich but pointed at Paul , and said , ` You have not told him ...' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech .
It was a brilliant gathering , but very late , and gradually the Chamberlain -- you saw his portrait , too : a man with black eyebrows , serious eyes , and a meaningless sort of smile underneath -- the Chamberlain , I say , discovered there was everything there except the Prince himself .
" First it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable on the horizon of the crowd , even beyond the castle .
But , dead or alive , he was a riddle -- he who had always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods , unarmed and alone .
" asked Father Brown .
" Some girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other ," replied his friend , " who had been out in the wood picking wild flowers .
" Had the flowers got long stalks ?
He said the ugliest part of it , he thought -- uglier than the blood and bullet -- was that the flowers were quite short , plucked close under the head .
"
" I know what you ' re driving at ," said Flambeau rather gloomily .
" But that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point -- the want of a weapon .
"
"
Father Brown ' s smooth brow became suddenly constricted .
Hold on !
" cried Brown , frowning more and more , with a quite unusual concentration of curiosity .
" Don ' t think me rude .
Let me think this out for a moment .
" All right ," said Flambeau , laughing , and finished his beer .
A slight breeze stirred the budding trees and blew up into the sky cloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer and the whole coloured scene more quaint .
Only beyond the tower glimmered the wood in which the man had lain dead .
I know it doesn ' t sound like having a disease .
As I explained before , he might easily have been strangled .
But he was shot .
"
" He was shot by his own orders ," said the priest .
" You mean he committed suicide ?
"
All the full - dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant .
Otto was no coward , in spite of his network of military precautions , and , in any case , his avarice was stronger than his fears .
Rifles ranked so close even to that mountain path that a cry from him would bring the soldiers rushing up the hill , to say nothing of the fact that the wood and ridge were patrolled at regular intervals ; rifles so far away , in the dim woods , dwarfed by distance , beyond the river , that an enemy could not slink into the town by any detour .
" It was all the more clear when he had crested the ridge and found how naked was the nest of his old enemy .
He found himself on a small platform of rock , broken abruptly by the three corners of precipice .
Behind was the black cave , masked with green thorn , so low that it was hard to believe that a man could enter it .
"` Sir ,' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein , with quite unusual courtesy , ` I should like only one word with you .
But when the word ` gold ' was said he held out his hand as if in arrest of something , and turned away his face to the mountains .
` He has spoken of things not lawful .
A dumb devil was in him .
Once more he looked down grimly at the bright , square labyrinths of the lamp - lit city below him , and he smiled no more .
Far as the eye could see ran the rifles of his friends , every one of whom would shoot him dead if he could not answer the challenge .
" He tried to scream and was silent .
" I wonder what part -- I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is twice a traitor ?
Like the white lock of Whistler , that lit our aimless gloom , Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume .
THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset .
It was built of a bright brick throughout ; its sky - line was fantastic , and even its ground plan was wild .
He had not discovered anything new in biology ; but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself ?
Thus , and thus only , the whole place had properly to be regarded ; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists , but as a frail but finished work of art .
This again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity , when the little gardens were often illuminated , and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit .
The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place .
This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population .
This particular evening , if it is remembered for nothing else , will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset .
It looked like the end of the world .
The very sky seemed small .
"
The third party of the group , Gregory ' s sister Rosamond , who had her brother ' s braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them , laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle .
An artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions .
The rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it .
it is Victoria .
"
It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest .
Being sick is a revolt .
Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ' m hanged if I can see why they are poetical .
Revolt in the abstract is -- revolting .
The girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word , but Syme was too hot to heed her .
"
" Am I not serious about my anarchism ?
" My dear fellow !
" said Syme , and strolled away .
Syme smiled .
" My dear Miss Gregory ," said Syme gently , " there are many kinds of sincerity and insincerity .
No .
When you say ' the world is round ,' do you mean what you say ?
It is true , but you don ' t mean it .
"
He made a sort of doubtful salute , which Syme somewhat more formally returned .
" asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder .
Gregory began in a smooth voice and with a rather bewildering smile .
" Now I remember ," resumed Gregory reflectively , " one other person succeeded in doing it .
You have irritated me .
" I am very sorry ," replied Syme with gravity .
" You said I was not serious about being an anarchist .
You think me a flaneur who lets fall occasional truths .
Syme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory again opened his lips .
" Oh ," said Syme with a beaming smile , " we are all Catholics now .
" Then may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves that you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam , and especially not to the police ?
If you will take upon yourself this awful abnegations if you will consent to burden your soul with a vow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about , I will promise you in return --"
" inquired Syme , as the other paused .
"
"
Accepting the vein of humour , he said , with a well - bred indifference --
" said the motionless Syme .
" You are very good .
" If in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little , don ' t put it down to your inroads into the champagne .
Gregory led him down a low , vaulted passage , at the end of which was the red light .
They passed through several such passages , and came out at last into a queer steel chamber with curved walls , almost spherical in shape , but presenting , with its tiers of benches , something of the appearance of a scientific lecture - theatre .
There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment , but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes , things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants , or the eggs of iron birds .
They were bombs , and the very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb .
Does this place strike you as being serious ?
We dig deeper and we blow you higher .
They are much more troublesome to me .
You cannot pass it without submitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr . Chamberlain .
You surround yourself with steel instruments which make the place , if I may say so , more impressive than homelike .
" The history of the thing might amuse you ," he said .
presumptuous human reason !
' Well , well , it seems majors don ' t do this .
"
' You see , there are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council , and they are named after days of the week .
"
" And he clasped his hands .
Why do I positively like you , Gregory ?
Gregory , I gave you a promise before I came into this place .
"
Yes , I will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me .
"
THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY
" Don ' t be such a silly man ," he said , with the effeminate dignity of a curate .
" Don ' t you see it ' s not necessary ?
Gregory could not speak , but he could not fire either , and he looked his question .
" What branch do you represent ?
"
" What do you mean ?
"
" If you ask my advice as a friend ," said Syme with severe benevolence , " I think you ' d better .
He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night , and then let Syme go , and chance it .
As you also know , his death was as self - denying as his life , for he died through his faith in a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk , which beverage he regarded as barbaric , and as involving cruelty to the cow .
Upon you , comrades , it devolves this evening to choose out of the company present the man who shall be Thursday .
There was a stir of almost inaudible applause , such as is sometimes heard in church .
He had made up his mind , and he saw his best policy quite plain in front of him like a white road .
We have no chance of denying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end of Europe to another .
I know that he will not hear it tonight , though my passion were to rend the roof .
But if , by some incredible accident , there were here tonight a man who all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us , I would put this question to him : ' When those Christians met in those Catacombs , what sort of moral reputation had they in the streets above ?
The applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing fainter , and at the last word it stopped suddenly .
" I ' m not meek !
His words are , indeed , extravagant ; his appearance is ferocious , and even ( to an ordinary taste ) unattractive .
" No , no !
We do not eat human flesh --"
"
The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a resolute , forcible , and efficient Thursday ( hear , hear ).
" Comrade Gregory has told us , in only too apologetic a tone , that we are not the enemies of society .
Comrade Gregory has told us ( apologetically again ) that we are not murderers .
"
" he cried , at the top of a voice that tore his throat .
" Does anyone second this amendment ?
" he said .
He is a --"
" Gregory ' s mouth worked twice without sound ; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face .
Before he had done so , the long , lean man with the American beard was again upon his feet , and was repeating in a high American monotone --
" Oh , oh !
Strike , but hear me !
For the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real silence .
Then Gregory fell back in his seat , a pale wreck of a man , and the chairman repeated , like a piece of clock - work suddenly started again --
The roar rose like the sea , the hands rose like a forest , and three minutes afterwards Mr . Gabriel Syme , of the Secret Police Service , was elected to the post of Thursday on the General Council of the Anarchists of Europe .
" Talk sense ," said Syme shortly .
You have kept it even down to a small particular .
CHAPTER IV
Hence the child , during his tenderer years , was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinth and cocoa , of both of which he had a healthy dislike .
After that he went about as usual -- quiet , courteous , rather gentle ; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane .
It looked like a stream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean country .
"
" Good God , the Board Schools !
"
" I found that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears for humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific intellect than with the normal and excusable , though excessive , outbreaks of the human will .
I am a democrat myself , and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in matters of ordinary valour or virtue .
We have to trace the origin of those dreadful thoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual crime .
" Do you mean ," asked Syme , " that there is really as much connection between crime and the modern intellect as all that ?
We remember the great poisoning princes of the Renaissance .
Thieves respect property .
They merely wish the property to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it .
"
He is a reformer , but not an anarchist .
Yes , the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious , the harrying of the poor , the spying upon the unfortunate .
" cried the policeman , clasping his hands with an excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume , " but it is intolerable !
Their bolt is ready to fall .
These I call the innocent section .
And so also the men of the inner circle speak -- the sacred priesthood .
They also speak to applauding crowds of the happiness of the future , and of mankind freed at last .
But in their mouths "-- and the policeman lowered his voice --" in their mouths these happy phrases have a horrible meaning .
When they talk of a paradise without right or wrong , they mean the grave .
" Are you the new recruit ?
" I really have no experience ," he began .
" But I am really unfit --"
" I do ," said the other --" martyrs .
Thus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson light of evening , in his shabby black hat and shabby , lawless cloak , he came out a member of the New Detective Corps for the frustration of the great conspiracy .
But the more he felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land , the more his own chivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire .
But in all Syme ' s circumstances , with the dark dawn and the deadly errand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones , there was something unnerving in it .
And there was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong .
Sunday always insists on an early breakfast .
" Nor have I ," answered the man in an ordinary tone .
He spoke with casual civility , but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted the fanaticism of his face .
So in case you don ' t know , I ' d better tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by not concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now .
Clever !
" When you ' ve seen Sunday for a split second you ' ll leave off calling him clever .
"
It will never be known , I suppose , why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental .
Between the open square and the sunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra , it looked the replica of some French or even Spanish public place .
As a fact , he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since he was a boy .
He was enlarged terribly to scale ; and this sense of size was so staggering , that when Syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish .
" The gentlemen are up there , sare ," he said .
And the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm , much pleased with the singular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs .
Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe .
As he walked across the inner room towards the balcony , the large face of Sunday grew larger and larger ; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible , and that he would scream aloud .
He remembered that as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum , because it was a face , and so large .
If out of that stiff tie and collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog , it could not have been a more idiotic contrast .
He insists on the ways of the stage conspirator .
" Yes you are , my boy , and so is the cause of you ," said the President good - naturedly .
But now that Syme had more space and light to observe him , there were other touches .
He had a black French beard cut square and a black English frock - coat cut even squarer .
His black coat looked as if it were only black by being too dense a purple .
His face was as grey as his long grey beard , his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair .
Syme ' s eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin .
SUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world .
The ends of the earth were closing in .
They were deep in the discussion of an actual and immediate plot .
The waiter downstairs had spoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and kings .
He would have thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from being ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas .
But the truth was that by this time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear , more piercing and practical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility .
He looked over the edge of the balcony , and saw a policeman , standing abstractedly just beneath , staring at the bright railings and the sunlit trees .
He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade .
Whenever he looked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman , a pillar of common sense and common order .
First , it never occurred to him to doubt that the President and his Council could crush him if he continued to stand alone .
If he defied the man he was probably dead , either struck stiff there in his chair or long afterwards as by an innocent ailment .
It never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy .
Many moderns , inured to a weak worship of intellect and force , might have wavered in their allegiance under this oppression of a great personality .
The men were eating as they talked , and even in this they were typical .
" I have often wondered ," said the Marquis , taking a great bite out of a slice of bread and jam , " whether it wouldn ' t be better for me to do it with a knife .
Most of the best things have been brought off with a knife .
" The knife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal tyrant .
It must expand !
"
"
"
But he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street , who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel - organ .
"
The President seemed to take the foreigner ' s incoherent satire with entire good humour .
" You can ' t get hold of it yet , Gogol ," he said in a fatherly way .
" When once they have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where we go afterwards .
" I see , I see ," said the President , nodding kindly as he seated himself at the top of a long table .
As for him , he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the scaffold with the intention , at any rate , of making a good speech .
I suggest Comrade Saturday , Dr .
"
But Syme saw little of the scene , for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness ; he had sunk down into his seat shuddering , in a palsy of passionate relief .
CHAPTER VII
THE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS
" said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life , a voice that made men drop drawn swords .
"
" You bet ," answered the Pole .
" I see it ' s a fair cop .
Now listen to me .
" Time is flying ," said the President in his gayest manner , after glancing at his watch , which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be .
I can ' t say .
How do you know you aren ' t overheard now ?
His top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas , the white drift was rising round his boots and ankles ; but it seemed as if nothing could tear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty evening dress .
Tall houses and populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven ; he was free in free London , and drinking wine among the free .
Then with a gesture as of blind hurry , he brushed past the Professor , dashing open the door and slamming it behind him , and stood outside in the snow .
Or am I too fanciful ?
As he crossed the great market the snow increased , growing blinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken .
He had a violent run of a hundred yards to reach it ; but he managed to spring , swaying upon the splash - board and , pausing for an instant to pant , he climbed on to the top .
When he had been seated for about half a minute , he heard behind him a sort of heavy and asthmatic breathing .
He let himself into a seat with characteristic care , and wrapped himself up to the chin in the mackintosh rug .
Every movement of the old man ' s tottering figure and vague hands , every uncertain gesture and panic - stricken pause , seemed to put it beyond question that he was helpless , that he was in the last imbecility of the body .
He thought little of this as he passed it , only plunging into yet another arm of the maze .
When Syme saw it he suddenly straightened himself , and made with his sword - stick an involuntary salute .
He came nearer and nearer , the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles , his lifted , patient face .
And the old Professor came right up to him and passed him like a total stranger , without even a blink of his mournful eyelids .
This outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus , up Ludgate Hill , round St . Paul ' s Cathedral , along Cheapside , Syme remembering all the nightmares he had ever known .
CHAPTER VIII
It was just possible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight suspicion of him .
Perhaps it was a ritual .
Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity .
" The process was simple enough ," answered the Professor patiently .
" I thought you looked like a policeman .
"
" But perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy .
Perhaps policeman is a relative term .
"
" Your suggestion is ridiculous ," he began .
" Why on earth --"
The old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table , nearly breaking it .
" You swear it ," said the old man , leaning across to him , his dead face becoming as it were loathsomely alive .
Will you be sure that the devil dances at your funeral ?
Will there really be no mistake ?
" But as you think policeman only a relative term , of course I have nothing to do with you .
He knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free man .
For with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy humiliation .
" Pull yourself together ," said the Professor , " or you ' ll get hysterical .
I was thirty - eight last birthday .
"
"
" I knew no more than the dead ," replied the man who called himself de Worms .
Syme struck the table with an exclamation .
" No ," said the Professor with sobriety , " not if we were three hundred against Sunday .
"
They were both silent for a measure of moments , and then Syme ' s speech came with a rush , like the sudden foaming of champagne .
Syme was dumb for an instant .
I am afraid of him .
" Because I am afraid of him ," said Syme ; " and no man should leave in the universe anything of which he is afraid .
"
" Have you any conception how ?
Syme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement .
"
Syme felt almost dazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows ; but his companion walked on with a certain briskness , towards where , at the end of the street , an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame .
He is hygienic , and retires early .
" As a matter of fact he lives some way off , on the other side of the river , but we can tell from here whether he has gone to bed .
Turning the corner as he spoke , and facing the dim river , flecked with flame , he pointed with his stick to the other bank .
"
The beans and bacon , which these unaccountable people cooked well , the astonishing emergence of Burgundy from their cellars , crowned Syme ' s sense of a new comradeship and comfort .
Syme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrageous tale , from the time when Gregory had taken him to the little tavern by the river .
His own story was almost as silly as Syme ' s .
" That ' s a good get - up of yours ," said Syme , draining a glass of Macon ; " a lot better than old Gogol ' s .
I am a portrait painter .
" You mean you are made up like him ," said Syme .
" I have denounced him ," answered the Professor .
When I met him I was in a frivolous mood , and I disliked him so much that I resolved to imitate him .
I had been too subtle , I had been too true .
Before I could fully recover , however , two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation , and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room .
An old man in poor health , like my rival , could not be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of life .
' I replied quite scornfully , ' You read all that up in Pinckwerts ; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long ago by Glumpe .
He is now , I believe , received everywhere in Europe as a delightful impostor .
I am arresting you on the charge of not being the celebrated anarchist , Professor de Worms .
THE MAN IN SPECTACLES
" You don ' t look as if it were ," said Syme ; " you drink it as if it were medicine .
" You must excuse my manner ," said the Professor dismally , " my position is rather a curious one .
Then he said in a low voice --
But then that very fanaticism in the Secretary has a human pathos , and is almost a redeeming trait .
He bounces like an india - rubber ball .
" And you think ," said Syme , " that this unique monster will be soothed if I play the piano to him ?
" Don ' t be an ass ," said his mentor .
" We must have several word - signs ," said Syme seriously --" words that we are likely to want , fine shades of meaning .
Bull , as a revolutionist , you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass ; and indeed many of us , looking on the fresh lush grass of summer "'
I suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes ?
"
"
Was this man ' s silence a sensational way of declaring war ?
Was this adamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor , who had turned for the last time ?
Then his eye strayed downwards , and he burst out laughing .
Though the Professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue , his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table .
They took their hats and sticks in silence ; but as Syme took his sword - stick , he held it hard .
Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had somehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past .
The Jacobins were idealists ; there was about this man a murderous materialism .
His Dosition gave him a somewhat new appearance .
The quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless .
The Doctor ' s smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor half an hour before .
But his smile was quite slight , the pose of his head polite ; the only uncanny thing was his silence .
His words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem ; but Syme , who was watching , saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy table .
This devil has sucked me dry !
" Yes , the thing really happened to me ," he said hastily .
Wishing to clinch my reputation for respectability , I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy .
All this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the Doctor stared at the Professor , but quite without the smile .
The Professor , with scarcely a pause in his monologue , signalled back , " Then sit on it .
His companion disdained to reply .
He leant across the table , and said in a voice that could not be neglected --
Then Dr . Bull rose slowly , still smiling , and took off his spectacles .
" Project be damned !
" Why , by God ," said Syme , " I ' ll take the risk of that myself !
Clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses , the Doctor moved so quickly towards the door , that the others instinctively followed him .
Syme seemed a little distrait , and as he passed under the doorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang .
" he said .
But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up as a dynamiter ; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a dynamiter .
They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed freely .
"
" Theoretically , I suppose , we ought to call the police .
"
" Eh ?
Dr . Bull smiled a little , and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit sea .
"
We cannot denounce him as a dynamiter ; that is agreed .
We cannot get him detained on some trivial charge , for we should have to appear ; he knows us , and he would smell a rat .
" The Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century ," said Syme ; " but there is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn .
" Our bearings ," continued Syme calmly , " are ' argent a chevron gules charged with three cross crosslets of the field .
"
And in order to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt , I propose at the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off .
He was making apparently for the extreme end of the line of cafes , but he stopped abruptly .
CHAPTER X
It has only forty - three questions and answers , and some of the Marquis ' s answers are wonderfully witty .
I like to be just to my enemy .
That meeting displeases me .
" Insulted you ?
" Oh , just now ," said Syme recklessly .
" Oh , I assure you ," said Syme earnestly , " the whole of your conversation was simply packed with sinister allusions to my aunt ' s weaknesses .
"
" This is nonsense !
" My aunt ' s was red .
" It seems to me ," said the other , " that you are simply seeking a pretext to insult the Marquis .
The Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tiger ' s .
there was never a man who had to seek long .
Let us fight this evening .
" Marquis ," he said , " your action is worthy of your fame and blood .
There is no time for talk .
If he misses that he misses his crime .
But this is what he will do .
With the exception of the Marquis , all the men were in sombre and solemn morning - dress , with hats like black chimney - pots ; the little Doctor especially , with the addition of his black spectacles , looked like an undertaker in a farce .
Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between this funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow , growing wild flowers everywhere .
On his right was a little wood ; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line , which he was , so to speak , guarding from the Marquis , whose goal and escape it was .
" To a man of the well - known skill and valour of Monsieur de St . Eustache ," said the Professor solemnly , " it must be a matter of indifference which method is adopted , and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer encounter , reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit , but for the just and honourable nature of which I can --"
" broke from the Marquis behind , whose face had suddenly darkened , " let us stop talking and begin ," and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with his stick .
He had the feeling that if by some miracle he escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree , desiring nothing else in the world .
Syme ' s sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquis ' s body , which it had pierced .
Syme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener that he has stuck his spade into the ground .
There was no blood on it at all .
I can do the one thing which Satan himself cannot do -- I can die ," and as the word went through his head , he heard a faint and far - off hoot , which would soon be the roar of the Paris train .
Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible ?
" It is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent ," said Colonel Ducroix , looking wistfully at his principal .
" Come , come , Mr . Syme !
You wanted to do it , do it !
Don ' t be so selfish !
The Paris train , panting and groaning , had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill .
" said the Marquis , recklessly throwing various parts of himself right and left about the field .
"
" Yes ," said Dr . Bull fiercely , " and the train shall go out of the station .
" We know all ," said the Professor sternly .
" Going to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock !
Damn Paris trains !
" The police , of course !
Here he certainly saved the situation .
We are not buffoons , but very desperate men at war with a vast conspiracy .
" With the people out of that train ," said the other .
" What you say seems utterly wild ," began Syme .
Don ' t you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them ?
Can you think of anything more like Sunday than this , that he should put all his powerful enemies on the Supreme Council , and then take care that it was not supreme ?
But there were just five people , perhaps , who would have resisted him .
Sunday knew that the Professor would chase Syme through London , and that Syme would fight me in France .
Syme uttered an involuntary cry , and they all turned their eyes towards the far - off station .
CHAPTER XI
" But surely they are right away on the horizon ," said the bewildered Colonel , blinking and but half recovered from Bull ' s hasty though polite explanation .
" As you very truly say , they are on the horizon ; but if he were walking with them .
"
" said Syme .
" Something may have happened in our absence ; but he cannot have carried the world with a rush like that .
But to kill the Supreme Council he regards as a trivial matter , like a post card ; it may be left to his private secretary ," and he spat on the grass .
They saw already , even with the naked eye , black blots on the foremost faces , which marked the masks they wore .
The Marquis had taken off his nose and turned out to be a detective .
Was not everything , after all , like this bewildering woodland , this dance of dark and light ?
Everything only a glimpse , the glimpse always unforeseen , and always forgotten .
As a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake , Syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies .
Surely not many working men are anarchists , and surely if they were , mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police .
"
The poor have sometimes objected to being governed badly ; the rich have always objected to being governed at all .
But I forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy .
"
" He looks poor ," said Dr . Bull doubtfully .
He told them that the best thing they could do was to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy , where the innkeeper , an old soldier who had become devot in his latter years , would be certain to sympathise with them , and even to take risks in their support .
The whole company , therefore , piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood , and went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the woodland .
That ' s Sunday .
"
Syme nodded .
The travelling cloud of their enemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon .
The horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms , and the horse ' s nose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches outside the little cafe of " Le Soleil d ' Or .
" repeated Syme , looking up quickly .
" asked Syme doubtfully .
Syme nodded gravely ; then he said abruptly --
" And your other reason for coming here ?
Syme looked up at the wall , and saw a crudely - painted and pathetic religious picture .
URGING the horses to a gallop , without respect to the rather rugged descent of the road , the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the march , and at last the bulk of the first buildings of Lancy cut off the sight of their pursuers .
"
" He has a motor - car ," said the Colonel .
" asked Syme , as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter .
" He may have been forced ," said the Colonel gently .
"
But although the main black square was the same , though travelling faster , there was now one sensational difference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill , as if upon a slanted map .
"
These , however , he seemed to use very sparingly , having the simple tastes of the French middle class , and when his impatient friends came to examine them , it took them some time to assure themselves that one of them even could be made to work .
"
" I can ' t understand why it has grown so dark ," said the Professor at last in a low voice .
" I got it where I got the car ," answered the Colonel , chuckling , " from my best friend .
While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel , I ran up the front steps of the house and spoke to Renard , who was standing in his own porch , you will remember .
Inspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together .
If we turned and fought these fellows , the whole town would fight for us .
We shall see .
" I thought we had got clear of them .
"
" I tell you they were his ," he repeated , with wild eyes , " and they were full of men in masks !
" Absurd !
" said the Colonel angrily .
" Dr . Renard would never give them his cars .
" He may have been forced ," said Ratcliffe quietly .
The thing is nonsense .
"
We shall soon get there .
"
"
Syme had slowed down the car as their plans became doubtful , and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea .
" Well , if there is ," said Bull impatiently , " it must be something else -- a sham fight or the mayor ' s birthday or something .
I cannot and will not believe that plain , jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their pockets .
"
" Why , it ' s Renard !
"
Almost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from this atrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also from the cigarette of the cynical Ratcliffe .
" Well ," said the cigarette smoker slowly , " what do you think now ?
"
Syme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which he did not commonly make clear .
"
If you had got the man ' s character into your head --"
" It is no good ," said Syme .
" I won ' t ' ave it ," said Dr . Bull , growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his virtue .
" cried the Professor , seizing his arm .
" said the Professor , and buried his face in his hands .
" That ' s some comfort .
As they spoke , the white - haired horseman and his followers came thundering from above , and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting along the sea - front .
" We have one more chance ," said Syme , taking the steel out of his mouth .
He splashed into the surf on a huge cart - horse , and shook his axe at them .
" The peasant !
"
Then he added in his dreamy voice , " What is all that at the end of the ' Dunciad '?
The low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures , and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry .
" Yes ," said Ratcliffe , " and they are going to fire on us .
"
Mr . Ratcliffe kept a stony silence ; then at last he said quietly --
The power of this whole planet is against us , yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless yet .
" Perhaps ," said the other steadily ; " but if so , he was the only man whom Sunday found it hard to kill .
" The Colonel !
"
I will never believe it !
" Will you believe your eyes ?
Two or three figures , however , stood on the beginning of the stone footway , and seemed to be cautiously advancing down it .
The shot missed Syme , but struck his sword , breaking it short at the hilt .
" he said , and struck the Colonel down upon the stones .
" Do you see this lantern ?
You did not make it .
You can only destroy .
" shouted Syme , turning his flaming face ; to the three behind him .
The Secretary , ever since Syme ' s speech , had stood with his hand to his stricken head as if dazed ; now he suddenly pulled off his black mask .
"
" I am a detective from Scotland Yard ," and he took a small blue card from his pocket .
" You ," said the Secretary stiffly , " are , as I know for a fact , members of the Supreme Anarchist Council .
Dr . Bull tossed his sword into the sea .
But he was a magnanimous old gentleman , and being much relieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite , he saw them off on the pier with great geniality .
If they were all harmless officers , what was Sunday ?
"
" I suppose you are right ," said the Professor reflectively .
Dr . Bull , who had always been the optimist of the party , endeavoured to persuade the other four that the whole company could take the same hansom cab from Victoria ; but this was over - ruled , and they went in a four - wheeler , with Dr . Bull on the box , singing .
" said Dr . Bull , with thick emphasis .
" whispered Syme .
" I think it is a bit queerer than that ," said Syme .
" I think it is six men going to ask one man what they mean .
They turned in silence into the Square , and though the hotel was in the opposite corner , they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it .
" he said .
I bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles .
" Disgusting spectacles ?
Dr . Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table .
Who are you ?
As far as I can make out , you want me to tell you what I am , and what you are , and what this table is , and what this Council is , and what this world is for all I know .
" And you ," said Syme , leaning forward , " what are you ?
Bull , you are a man of science .
Stare at those morning clouds .
" What does yours say , Syme ?
"
" No one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the Archdeacon more than I . I trust it will not come to that .
When he had one leg over the fence and his friends were following , he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow .
"
" All the better ," said the Secretary grimly , planting a foot in a foothold , " we shall find him at home .
" said Syme furiously , " snails barking !
geraniums barking !
" The dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs ," said Gogol , and shuddered .
" Well , his house ought to be hell !
"
" asked Syme .
"
Clean across the space of grass , about two hundred yards away , with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his heels , went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride , with his trunk thrown out as rigid as a ship ' s bowsprit , and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom .
Just before they came to Baker Street , however , he was seen to throw something far up into the air , as a boy does a ball meaning to catch it again .
Through street after street , through district after district , went the prodigy of the flying elephant , calling crowds to every window , and driving the traffic left and right .
But the President had disappeared .
" Gentleman rushed into the Exhibition , sir !
Then he added in an injured voice : " Funny gentleman , sir .
Asked me to hold his horse , and gave me this .
"
" When the herring runs a mile , Let the Secretary smile ; When the herring tries to fly , Let the Secretary die .
Rustic Proverb .
They all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the Exhibition on a string , like a child ' s balloon .
" God bless my soul !
There was a short silence , and then Syme said , biting his beard --
"
The optimist of the party had at first proposed that they should follow the balloon across South England in hansom - cabs .
" Hurt him !
"
" I don ' t want him hurt , somehow ," said Dr . Bull .
It seems to make everything nonsense .
Shall I make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat ?
"
Moderate strength is shown in violence , supreme strength is shown in levity .
It was like the old speculations -- what would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a grasshopper ?
" Our elephant ," said Syme , looking upwards , " has leapt into the sky like a grasshopper .
.
how can I tell you ?
But there must have been something in me that answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men .
He sat there on a bench , a huge heap of a man , dark and out of shape .
He listened to all my words without speaking or even stirring .
But I ' ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about Sunday .
Men have felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests , and felt that the animals there were at once innocent and pitiless .
" asked Syme .
" said Syme genially .
" I think something ," he said , " that I cannot say clearly .
Or , rather , I think something that I cannot even think clearly .
Syme ' s eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb , which , reddened in the evening light , looked like some rosier and more innocent world .
This is queer , but it is queerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President , and I also find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world .
" Get on a little faster , Syme ," said Bull ; " never mind the balloon .
"
On the contrary , it frightened me because it was so beautiful , because it was so good .
" Syme ," exclaimed the Secretary , " are you ill ?
"
" Then , and again and always ," went on Syme like a man talking to himself , " that has been for me the mystery of Sunday , and it is also the mystery of the world .
" asked Ratcliffe .
" Horrible !
" Listen to me ," cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis .
"
There was no need to cry out to Syme , who had never taken his eyes off it .
" he cried .
" Dead !
" You will not find him dead easily .
" Clashing his hoofs ," said the Professor .
He means everything .
" Don ' t forget ," said the Secretary , looking down , " that he also means Panic .
He strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy , his rags and ribbons fluttering in the wind .
His advance was very quiet ; but for the silver frost upon his head , he might have been one to the shadows of the wood .
" I was told you knew his name ," said the man respectfully .
There was a silence , and then the Secretary said --
" asked Bull of Syme as they separated .
The six adventurers had passed through many adventures , but not one had carried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort .
They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages were ; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages , and carriages with cushions .
It was typical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so long as anything could be done , when the whole business was taken out of his hands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse .
He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be , living walls ; that a hedge is like a human army , disciplined , but all the more alive .
" Oh , yes , sir ," said the other eagerly , " the Thursday costume is quite warm , sir .
It fastens up to the chin .
I once saw the moon on Tuesday , I remember .
CHAPTER XV
Syme was scarcely surprised to notice that , amid all the ease and hospitality of their new surroundings , this man ' s eyes were still stern .
As they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe , who was clad in spring green like a huntsman , and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees .
For he stood for that third day on which the earth and green things were made , and his square , sensible face , with its not unfriendly cynicism , seemed appropriate enough to it .
One by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats .
Almost as Syme heard the words , he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration , as if heaven had opened behind his head .
Couples strolled away into the garden - walks , or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood smoking , in huge pots like fish - kettles , some hot and scented mixtures of old ale or wine .
Above all these , upon a sort of black framework on the roof of the house , roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire , which lit up the land for miles .
Soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden ; soon only four .
"
You did not forget your secret honour , though the whole cosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you .
Well , I am not reconciled .
Sunday answered not a word , but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon Syme as if asking a question .
" No ," said Syme , " I do not feel fierce like that .
I am grateful to you , not only for wine and hospitality here , but for many a fine scamper and free fight .
My soul and heart are as happy and quiet here as this old garden , but my reason is still crying out .
" It seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought yourself .
In fact , I am going to sleep .
" I have heard your complaints in order .
"
" You are right ," said Gregory , and gazed all round .
I curse you for being safe !
Oh , I could forgive you everything , you that rule all mankind , if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I --"
Why does each small thing in the world have to fight against the world itself ?
So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face of this blasphemer , so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say to this man , ' You lie !
We have been broken upon the wheel .
I repel the slander ; we have not been happy .
At least --"
As he gazed , the great face grew to an awful size , grew larger than the colossal mask of Memnon , which had made him scream as a child .
When men in books awake from a vision , they commonly find themselves in some place in which they might have fallen asleep ; they yawn in a chair , or lift themselves with bruised limbs from a field .
That companion had been a part of his recent drama ; it was the red - haired poet Gregory .
Syme felt a simple surprise when he saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red , irregular buildings of Saffron Park .
THE ORPHANS .
Near the ruins of the castle of Rossmore , in Ireland , is a small cabin , in which there once lived a widow and her four children .
As long as she was able to work , she was very industrious , and was accounted the best spinner in the parish ; but she overworked herself at last , and fell ill , so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do , and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter , Mary .
Mary was at this time about twelve years old .
" Bless them , the poor young creatures !
" No need to stop the wheel , Mary , dear , for me ," said her mother , " I was not asleep ; nor is it THAT which keeps me from sleep .
"' Tis a folly , Mary , to hope for that ; but what I hope is , that you ' ll find some friend -- some help -- orphans as you ' ll soon all of you be .
And one thing comforts my heart , even as I AM lying here , that not a soul in the wide world I am leaving has to complain of me .
The two youngest girls , Peggy and Nancy , were six and seven years old .
He had been used to bring home turf from the bog on his back , to lead cart - horses , and often to go on errands for gentlemen ' s families , who paid him a sixpence or a shilling , according to the distance which he went , so that Edmund , by some or other of these little employments , was , as he said , likely enough to earn his bread ; and he told Mary to have a good heart , for that he should every year grow able to do more and more , and that he should never forget his mother ' s words when she last gave him her blessing , and joined their hands all together .
As for Peggy and Nancy , it was little that they could do ; but they were good children , and Mary , when she considered that so much depended upon her , was resolved to exert herself to the utmost .
The kitchen and two other rooms near it were yet covered in tolerably well ; and a little thatch , she thought , would make them comfortable through the winter .
mother !
At her leisure hours she taught her sisters to read and write ; and Edmund , with part of the money which he earned by his work out of doors , paid a schoolmaster for teaching him a little arithmetic .
The orphans continued to assist one another in their work according to their strength and abilities ; and they went on in this manner for three years .
He told his sister Mary of his distress , and she made for him , after many trials , a pair of cloth shoes , with soles of platted hemp .
It was his business to hammer the soles flat : and as soon as he came home every morning he performed his task with so much cheerfulness and sang so merrily at his work , that the hour of his arrival was always an hour of joy to the family .
One begged Mary to let her plat some packthread for the soles ; another helped Peggy and Anne to baste in the linings ; and all who could get employment were pleased , for the idle ones were shoved out of the way .
"
Without losing any time , she went to the village that was at the end of the avenue leading to the vicarage , for she wished to get a lodging in this village because it was so near to her brother , and to the ladies who had been so kind to her .
Three guineas a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could venture to engage .
He offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages ; and Mr . Gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward , and inquired whether , amongst any of those who had given in proposals , there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house , and who would join with Mary in paying the rent .
" What ' s the matter ?
"
" Your poor goat is dead ," replied Peggy .
" Many ' s the time ," said Mary , " that I have driven the poor thing away from that place ; I was always afraid she would shake that great ugly stone down upon her at last .
this is come to us just in right time -- now you can pay for the slated house .
"
The value of the coins was estimated at about thirty or forty guineas .
In her youth she had heard someone talking , in a whisper , of an old prophecy , found in a bog , which said that before many
** What are in Ireland called moats , are , in England , called Danish mounds , or barrows .
]
Year after year St . Patrick ' s day came about , without her ever finding a farthing by all her groping ; and as she was always idle , she grew poorer and poorer .
"
But it is idle talking of what ' s done -- that ' s past ; but I ' ll try my luck in this here castle before next St . Patrick ' s day comes about .
She set her elbow upon her knees , and stopping her ears with her hands bid Mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders ; for that , let them say what they would , she would fall to work the next morning , " BARRING you ' ll make it worth my while to let it alone .
" said Mary ; for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habitation , or comply with the conditions of this provoking old woman .
Half a crown , Goody Grope said , was the least she could be content to take .
Mary did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortunate pot of gold coins .
He replied , that it was very likely such coins had been found at Rossmore Castle , and that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them ; but he positively declared that they never came to his hands ; that he had restored all that were deposited with him ; and that , as to the others , he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot by the children , or by Edmund or Mary on their way from the ladies ' house to his .
Then Peggy exclaimed --" Sure !
Does not he remember Edmund ' s counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall , and we all standing by !
I remember it as well as if it was this instant .
" And don ' t you recollect , Mary , your picking out the gold ones , and telling Mr . Hopkins that they were gold ; and he said you knew nothing of the matter ; and I was going to tell him that Miss Isabella had tried them , and knew that they were gold ?
Edmund was mistaken , alas !
The buzz of scandal went on for some time without reaching their ears , because they lived very retiredly .
She let Betsy in , and asked what she could want at such a time of night .
So , till then , fare ye well , dear Mary , Nancy , and little Peg .
Now , Mr . Hopkins , the agent , was at this time in Dublin , and Caroline ' s father posted the Jew , the next day , in the back - parlour of a banker ' s house , with whom Mr . Hopkins had , on this day , appointed to settle some accounts .
This was the joyful news which Edmund had to tell his sisters .
and is not that the cause why they are going to live in a slated house now ?
Edmund showed it to me , and will show it to anyone that wants to see .
Now Lightfoot , though perhaps he had seen his best days , was a very great favourite .
It was Jem ' s business to feed Lightfoot , and to take care of him -- a charge which he never neglected , for , besides being a very good natured , he was a very industrious boy .
" God bless the boy !
" Ay , upon Lightfoot , you know , mother , very easily ; mayn ' t I ?
To work he set , by the light of the fire , and the dame having once more stirred it , began again with " Jem , dear , does he go lame at all now ?
" God bless him -- that ' s right .
"
" For Monday fortnight at the fair .
"
who says you MUST ?
"
"
Early in the morning he wakened full of this scheme , jumped up , dressed himself , and , having given one look at poor Lightfoot in his stable , set off to Clifton in search of the old woman , to inquire where she found her sparkling stones .
He did not waste his time waiting for her , but saddled and bridled Lightfoot , and went to Farmer Truck ' s for the giant strawberries .
"
Presently he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosening some large rocks , and one amongst the workmen was stooping down looking for something very eagerly ; Jem ran up , and asked if he could help him .
" Yes ," said the man , " you can ; I ' ve just dropped , amongst this heap of rubbish , a fine piece of crystal that I got to - day .
" said Jem .
" White , and like glass ," said the man , and went on working whilst Jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while .
Jem waited ; and , as he was very attentively observing how the workmen went on with their work , he heard somebody near him give a great yawn , and , turning round , he saw stretched upon the grass , beside the river , a boy about his own age , who , in the village of Ashton , as he knew , went by the name of Lazy Lawrence -- a name which he most justly deserved , for he never did anything from morning to night .
"
"
"
"
Will you come and play ?
"
"
" And I ," said Jem , laughing , " would not be you for the world , to have nothing to do .
"
He chose his place well , and waited nearly all the evening , offering his fossils with great assiduity to every passenger ; but not one person bought any .
Come along , my lad ; we can but try .
"
" She smiled , and , pleased with his activity and simplicity , began to ask him several questions ; such as who he was , where he lived , what employment he had , and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils .
"
" Yes , but I don ' t promise you ," said she , " to give you half a crown , to - morrow .
If you knew all , you ' d know I did not .
"
" I ' ve no story , ma ' am , to tell , but as how mammy says he must go to the fair Monday fortnight , to be sold , if she can ' t get the two guineas for her rent ; and I should be main sorry to part with him , for I love him , and he loves me ; so I ' ll work for him , I will , all I can .
To be sure , as mammy says , I have no chance , such a little fellow as I am , of earning two guineas afore Monday fortnight .
" said the lady ; " you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones , and working steadily every day , and all day long .
"
He was just come home from work , and was surprised when Jem showed him the half - crown , saying , " Look what I got for the stones ; you are to have half , you know .
I expected but a shilling at the most , and the half of that is but sixpence , and that I ' ll take .
" cried the woman .
" No , that it shall not , I promise you ," said Jem ; and so he ran away home , fed Lightfoot , stroked him , went to bed , jumped up at five o ' clock in the morning , and went singing to work as gay as a lark .
" Well ," said the lady to her gardener , " show me how much is a fair day ' s work for a boy of his age .
" Come at six o ' clock and go at six ?
Jem joined them , and was the merriest and most active amongst them ; till , at last , when quite out of breath with running , he was obliged to give up to rest himself , and sat down upon the stile , close to the gate on which Lazy Lawrence was swinging .
" Ah , no , I can ' t run , indeed ," said he , hanging back heavily ; " you know I can play all day long if I like it , so I don ' t mind play as you do , who have only one hour for it .
"
"
" That ' s very odd ," said Lawrence , and yawned , for want of some better answer ; then taking out a handful of halfpence ,--" See what I got from father today , because I asked him just at the right time , when he had drunk a glass or two ; then I can get anything I want out of him -- see !
"
" That does not signify , though .
You don ' t know what it is to have eightpence .
" Is it far ?
"
" That ' s a secret ," said Jem , looking great .
"
Come now , let ' s go back and play - - their game ' s up , I daresay .
" What had you to think of ?
The next day he saw the nuts again , and wishing for them more than ever , he went home , in hopes that his father , as he said to himself , would be in a better humour .
But the cider was still fresh in his recollection ; and the moment Lawrence began to whisper the word " halfpenny " in his ear , his father swore , with a loud oath , " I will not give you a halfpenny , no , not a farthing , for a month to come .
With this he proceeded to the fruit woman ' s stall .
The fruit woman ' s stall was at the gate of an inn yard ; and peeping through the gate in this yard , Lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy , about his own size , playing at pitch farthing .
" Head ," replied Lawrence , and it came up head .
The stable boy , grumbling , swore he would have his revenge another time , and Lawrence went and bought his nuts .
At first their shocking oaths and loud wrangling frightened and shocked him ; for Lawrence , though lazy , had not yet learned to be a wicked boy .
" I am very sorry to hear that ," said the lady ; " I wish we could find somebody who would do them , if he can ' t .
Many were the difficulties which his " prophetic eye " foresaw ; but he felt within himself that spirit which spurs men on to great enterprises , and makes them " trample on impossibilities .
what pains did it cost him , before he could make anything like a mat !
He laid it by his bedside , that he might see it the moment he awoke in the morning .
And now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress .
I made it in my play hours , I was very happy in making it ; and I ' m very glad , too , that you like it ; and if you please to keep it , ma ' am , that ' s all .
the hat was heavy with shillings .
" exclaimed Jem , now quite conquering his bashfulness , for at the moment he forgot where he was , and saw nobody that was by .
"
He now went home , but felt it a great restraint to wait till to - morrow evening before he told his mother .
Whilst he was intent upon this , Jem was startled by a noise at the door : somebody was trying to pull up the latch .
It opened , and there came in Lazy Lawrence , with a boy in a red jacket , who had a cock under his arm .
They started when they got into the middle of the stable , and when they saw Jem , who had been at first hidden by the horse .
" We -- we -- we came ," stammered Lazy Lawrence --" I mean , I came to -- to -- to --"
See , I ' ve a fine cock here , and Lawrence told me you were a great friend of his ; so I came .
Then turning his eyes upon the cock with a look of compassion , said , in a low voice , to Lawrence , " Shall you like to stand by and see its eyes pecked out ?
"
It was almost even with the ground .
" Lawrence stretched out his hand .
The black cloud had now passed over the moon , and the light shone full upon them .
" said the stable boy , snatching the flower - pot out of Lawrence ' s trembling hands , and pulled him away from the door .
" Good God !
He thought the morning would never come ; but when it was day , when he heard the birds sing , and saw everything look cheerful as usual , he felt still more miserable .
" said Lawrence , starting ; " why do you say that I look black ?
"
" Why , my Jem , how merry you are to - day !
" Now , keep those spirits of yours , Jem , till you want ' em , and don ' t let it come upon you all at once .
" Run , Jem ," said his mother .
" You ' d best sit down , if the lady will give you leave ; for he ' ll not hurry himself back again .
"
" What ' s gone , love ?
" My two guineas -- Lightfoot ' s two guineas .
His mother listened to him with the greatest surprise , whilst his mistress stood in silence , looking first at the old woman , and then at Jem with a penetrating eye , as if she suspected the truth of his story , and was afraid of becoming the dupe of her own compassion .
" How came you to leave all your money in a broken flower - pot in the stable ?
"
" And as he had the greatest command over himself , he actually did not shed another tear , not even when the farmer got up to go , saying , he could wait no longer .
At this instant a party of milk - women went by ; and one of them , having set down her pail , came behind Jem , and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back .
" I forget ," said Jem ; " I think I have seen your face before , but I forget .
" No , no ," said the lady , calling to her servant ; and she desired him to take his horse and ride after them .
Whilst they were gone in pursuit of the thieves , the lady , who was now thoroughly convinced of Jem ' s truth , desired her coachman would produce what she had ordered him to bring with him that evening .
" exclaimed the wretched father .
" Bad company ," said Lawrence .
While this was saying the farmer was emptying Lazy Lawrence ' s pockets ; and when the money appeared , all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror .
" Oh !
Lawrence was eventually sent to Bridewell for a month , and the stable - boy was sent for trial , convicted , and transported to Botany Bay .
Mr . Spencer , a very benevolent and sensible man , undertook the education of several poor children .
You will carry this letter to my sister , Mrs . Churchill , in Queen ' s Square .
You know Queen ' s Square ?
" And you will always -- I mean , as long as you deserve it -- find a friend in me .
I have sometimes spoken harshly to you ; but you will not meet with a more indulgent friend .
" said the butler .
" I have a letter for Mrs . Churchill , sir ," said Franklin , endeavouring to pronounce his " sir " in a tone as respectful as the butler ' s was insolent .
He was then shown into a handsome room , where he found his mistress -- an elderly lady .
"
The housekeeper , when she first came in , appeared with a smiling countenance ; but the moment she cast her eyes on Franklin , it changed to a look of surprise and suspicion .
" I ' m sure I hope so too ," observed Mrs . Pomfret ; " but I can ' t say ; for my part , I ' ve no great notion of those low people .
I declare it frights me .
"
Pomfret , who really was a good woman , was softened at this idea , and said , " God forbid he should starve or steal , and God forbid I should say anything PREJUDICIARY of the boy ; for there may be no harm in him .
"
" Well , but since I did say that I should have no objection to try him , I shall keep my word ; let him come to - morrow .
Dismissed with these orders , Mrs . Pomfret hastened to report all that had passed to the cook , like a favourite minister , proud to display the extent of her secret influence .
" Where to !
" Mischievous , impertinent , mean !
" Why ," said Corkscrew , " when mistress asked for me , how came you to say I was gone out ?
" And when she asked you where I was gone , how came you to say that you did not know ?
Nor were the bumpers of port the only unlawful rewards which Felix received : his aunt , the cook , had occasion for his assistance , and she had many delicious douceurs in her gift .
I know how he wins cook ' s favour too well , and I fancy I know how I have offended her ; for since the day I saw the basket , she has done nothing but huff me .
"
But at length it was time to explain .
" I thought I saw --" poor Franklin began .
" You thought you saw !
"
"
These words , and the bitter sense of injustice , drew tears at length fast down the proud cheek of Franklin , which might possibly have touched Mrs . Pomfret , if Felix , with a sneer , had not called them CROCODILE TEARS .
" said his mistress .
" Call at the bookseller ' s in -- stay , I must write down the direction .
" Pomfret came with the writing - paper , and looked very angry to see that Felix was going out without her knowledge ; so , while Mrs . Churchill was writing the direction , she stood talking to him about it ; whilst he , in the greatest terror imaginable , looked up in her face as she spoke ; but was all the time intent on parrying on the other side the attacks of a little French dog of his mistress ', which , unluckily for him , had followed her into the passage .
" cried Felix , and put him away .
" exclaimed the housekeeper , darting upon it with horror and amazement .
He was struck dumb .
"
Good people , when they are made sensible that they have treated anyone with injustice , are impatient to have an opportunity to rectify their mistake ; and Mrs . Pomfret was now prepared to see everything which Franklin did in the most favourable point of view ; especially as the next day she discovered that it was he who every morning boiled the water for her tea , and buttered her toast -- services for which she had always thought she was indebted to Felix .
The butler , who had the reputation of being an honest man , and indeed whose integrity had hitherto been proof against everything but his mistress ' port , turned pale , and trembled at this proposal ; drank two or three bumpers to drown thought ; and promised to give an answer the next day .
His mind was so full of what had passed , that he could not help bragging to Felix , whom he found awake at his return , that he could have his bill paid off at the alehouse whenever he pleased ; dropping , besides , some hints , which were not lost upon Felix .
Even this paltry temptation , working upon his vanity , at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood .
Felix , the night after all this had been planned , went to bed , and fell fast asleep ; but the butler , who had not yet stifled the voice of conscience , felt , in the silence of the night , so insupportably miserable , that , instead of going to rest , he stole softly into the pantry for a bottle of his mistress ' wine , and there drinking glass after glass , he stayed till he became so far intoxicated , that , though he contrived to find his way back to bed , he could by no means undress himself .
He jumped up , and seeing a light under the butler ' s door , gently opened it , and to his astonishment , beheld one of the bed curtains in flames .
He immediately ran to the butler , and pulled him with all his force , to rouse him from his lethargy .
" If she asks me , you know I must tell the truth ," replied he .
"
Turning short round to Franklin , she desired that he would show her where he found the candle when he came into the room .
" Oh , ma ' am ," said Felix , " indeed you forget ; for Mr . Corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning , and I happened to take particular notice , and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand , and that was just as I heard you , bolting the door .
" said she , undrawing the curtains .
"
" But just struck .
"
" inquired her mistress .
" No , ma ' am , he never makes mistakes ; it is not his way to go gossiping and tattling ; he never tells anything till he ' s asked , and then it ' s fit he should .
About the sirloin of beef , and all , he was right in the end , I found , to do him justice ; and I ' m sure he ' s right now about the lantern -- he ' s ALWAY ' S RIGHT "
But he ' s too good to hate anybody ; and I ' ll be bound I ' ll make it up to him now .
"
"
" There ' s no occasion , I think , for trying him any more , ma ' am ," said Mrs . Pomfret , who was as violent in her likings as in her dislikes .
She spoke to him of his last night ' s exertions in terms of much approbation .
"
" How should you like to go to the play with me to - morrow ?
" Oh ," exclaimed Franklin , " I should like it exceedingly .
" And do you think mistress would let you if I asked ?
Run , run , and get it for us .
"
Felix , you would have no objection , I suppose , to going to the play with me ?
"
Corkscrew .
" Shake hands ," said Corkscrew , " I am glad to find you out to be an honest fellow !
He shall repent of these airs .
They discovered the place where Franklin kept the key at night , stole it whilst he slept , took off the impression in wax , and carefully replaced it in Franklin ' s trunk , exactly where they found it .
Probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax .
Knowing how to do mischief is very different from wishing to do it : and the most innocent persons are generally the least ignorant .
Struck with this circumstance , it brought to his mind all that had passed the preceding evening , and being sure that he had no wax near the key , he began to suspect what had happened ; and he could not help recollecting what he had once heard Felix say , that " give him but a halfpenny worth of wax , and he could open the strongest lock that ever was made by hands .
" I was not mistaken when I thought I might trust YOU with this key ," said Mrs . Churchill , after she had heard his story .
" So , Mr . Franklin ," said he , " I ' m glad to find you are in such high TRUST in this family .
"
"
Nothing at first appeared in Corkscrew ' s bedchamber , to strengthen their suspicions , till , just as they were going to leave the room , Mrs . Pomfret exclaimed , " Why , if there is not Mr . Corkscrew ' s dress coat hanging up there !
Look at the cravat .
upon my word I am afraid they are not at the play .
They looked so shocking !
I am sure I never shall forget Felix ' s look to my dying day !
"
His complaints and his extortions wearied and alarmed the whole hamlet .
Sometimes she saw her in the neat garden raking the beds , or weeding the borders ; sometimes she was kneeling at her beehive with fresh flowers for her bees ; sometimes she was in the poultry yard , scattering corn from her sieve amongst the eager chickens ; and in the evening she was often seated in a little honeysuckle arbour , with a clean , light , three - legged deal table before her , upon which she put her plain work .
Mrs . Price was an intelligent , active , domestic woman ; but her health was not robust .
She was respected in the village , for her conduct as a wife and as a mother , and all were eager to show her attention .
It was now time to choose the Queen .
" repeated Philip , stopping short in the middle of a new tune that he was playing on his pipe .
" Susan will give me some thread to tie up my nosegays , and she ' ll show me where the fresh violets grow ; and she has promised to give me a great bunch of her double cowslips to wear to - morrow .
"
" Tell her to make haste ," cried Philip .
She does not hold it up nicely , like Susan ; and with all her fine clothes she never looks half so neat .
I know what he thought of Bab by his looks , and of Susan , too ; for Susan was in her garden , bending down a branch of the laburnum - tree , looking at its yellow flowers , which were just come out ; and when the gentleman asked her how many miles it was from Shrewsbury , she answered him so modest !-- not bashful , like as if she had never seen nobody before -- but just right ; and then she pulled on her straw hat , which was fallen back with her looking up at the laburnum , and she went her ways home ; and the gentleman says to me , after she was gone , ' Pray , who is that neat , modest girl --?
"
" said Betty , holding it fast by the legs .
is he so nice that he can eat none but guinea - hen ' s eggs ?
" Barbara !
But the truth is the truth , and it is what I think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it .
He has found what he calls a flaw in my lease ; and the lease , he tells me , is not worth a farthing , and that he can turn us all out of our farm to - morrow if he pleases ; and sure enough he will please , for I have thwarted him this day , and he swears he ' ll be revenged of me .
" Susan , love , open the window .
The baronet died suddenly , and his estate and title devolved to a younger brother , who was now just arrived in the country , and to whom Mr . Case was eager to pay his court , in hopes of obtaining his favour .
Accosting the farmer in a haughty manner , the attorney began with , " So , Farmer Price , a word with you , if you please .
Case ?
Why , you said something about its not belonging to me , when you heard me talk of inclosing it the other day .
"
" True , right , very proper , of course ," said Mr . Case ; " but then you have no interest in life in the land in question ?
All I want of you to say --"
In my memory , since the NEW lane was made , it has always been open to the parish ; and no man shall inclose it with my good - will .
It is my duty to show it to my employer ; or , in other words , to your new landlord , whose agent I have good reasons to expect I shall be ; you will live to repent your obstinacy , Mr . Price .
All was silent : the grey light of the morning was now spreading over every object ; the sun rose slowly , and Susan stood at the lattice window , looking through the small leaded , cross - barred panes at the splendid spectacle .
" cried Rose , pressing forward ; but Susan put her finger upon her lips , and pointed to her mother ' s window .
" Then gently putting aside the crown , her companions bid her say who should wear it for her .
We sha ' n ' t hear your voices or the pipe when you have turned the corner into the village ; so you need only stop till then , Philip .
" I forgot to thank you ," said she , " for the double cowslips ; look how pretty they are , and smell how sweet the violets are in my bosom , and kiss me quick , for I shall be left behind .
" She taught me to knit , she taught me everything that I know ," thought Susan , " and the best of all , she taught me to love her , to wish to be like her .
" But he ' ll want , he ' ll want a hundred things ," said she , starting up .
" I must get his linen ready for him .
She went out .
" How does your mother do , in the first place ?
See how generous they have been -- twelve shillings , I assure you .
You may go back , and tell her so .
The attorney ' s daughter had , whilst Rose opened her negotiation , measured the depth of her purse with a keen eye ; and her penetration discovered that it contained at least ten shillings .
" Have you no conscience , Miss Barbara ?
Barbara ' s avarice was moved , she consented for this ransom to liberate her prisoner .
Many know how to give , but few know how to accept a gift properly .
It was sent to the Abbey ; and as the family there had not tasted any good bread since their arrival in the country , they also were earnest and warm in its praise .
The housekeeper , who had known Susan from a child , was pleased to have an opportunity in speaking in her favour .
It was impossible that such a grand event as Susan ' s visit to the Abbey could long remain unknown to Barbara Case and her gossiping maid .
" There she is , I declare , just come into her garden ," cried Bab ; " I ' ll run in and get it all out of her in a minute .
Susan was gathering some marigolds and some parsley for her mother ' s broth .
dear , how polite we are grown of a sudden !
" said the maid .
"
"
I ' ll step in and ask to see her mother , that will put her in a good humour in a trice .
" Will you please to sit down then , miss ," said Simple Susan , with a smile ; for at this instant she forgot the guinea - hen ; " I have but just put the parsley into the broth ; but it soon will be ready .
People , you know , don ' t always mean exactly , downright , neither more nor less than what they say .
Susan had now poured the broth into a basin , and as she strewed over it the bright orange marigolds , it looked very tempting .
The next time I set my foot in this house , you shall be as saucy to me as you please .
Barbara did not know that her father meant to go to the Abbey that morning , for Attorney Case was mysterious even to his own family about his morning rides .
Sir Arthur was also a man of wit and eloquence , yet of plain dealing and humanity .
" At this speech the attorney changed his ground , flattering himself that he should find his man averse to business , and ignorant of country affairs .
" Are you sure of that , Mr .
"
The attorney went on with all the eagerness of a keen man , who sees a chance at one stroke of winning a rich friend , and of ruining a poor enemy .
Your name shall not appear in it at all .
" What can that be , sir ?
"
The courtiers of Louis the Fourteenth could not have looked more astounded than our attorney , when they received from their monarch a similar answer .
" It can ' t be helped ," said Susan , with a sigh .
" Sir , DEAR sir !
" And if YOU could help it , Susan ?
"
Is your lamb better than anybody else ' s , think you ?
" I don ' t know ," said Susan , " but I love it better .
you don ' t say so ?
" Are you sure he will stay ?
Tell me all quick .
" Some of them are wrong , and I ' ve written them out again ," said Susan .
CHAPTER II .
The dame - school , which was about a mile from the hamlet , was not a showy edifice ; but it was reverenced as much by the young race of village scholars as if it had been the most stately mansion in the land ; it was a low roofed , long , thatched tenement , sheltered by a few reverend oaks , under which many generations of hopeful children had gambolled in their turn .
" I am blind ," said the old man , " and cannot see your faces ; but I know you all asunder by your voices , and I can guess pretty well at all your humours and characters by your voices .
"
" exclaimed the child , and " quite right " echoed on all sides .
" Though I am blind ," said the harper , " I can hear , you know , and I heard from your sister herself all that I told you of her , that she was good - tempered and good - natured and fond of you .
And when you said you did not like the tune she liked best , she was not angry with you , but said , ' Then play William ' s first , if you please ,'-- was not that good - tempered ?
Well , play us a tune , if you can play ever a good one -- play me -- let ' s see , what shall he play , Bob ?
" added he turning to his companion .
" Bumper Squire Jones .
"
The little children shrunk back in timid silence , and eyed the brutal boy with dislike .
" The children readily produced their halfpence , and thought their wealth well bestowed upon this poor , good - natured man , who had taken so much pains to entertain them , better even than upon the gingerbread woman , whose stall they loved to frequent .
" God bless you , sir ," said the lad ; but as he took the shilling which the young gentleman had slily put INTO THE BLIND MAN ' S HAND , he saw that it was not worth one farthing .
" I am afraid , then , you ' ll get no other ," said young Case , with an insulting laugh .
Sir , nobody will take it from us .
" The shilling was handed to Susan , who , though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference , did not hesitate , when she was called upon , to speak the truth : " I think that this shilling is a bad one ," said she ; and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words , for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy .
Good - bye .
Miss Somers and her sister smiled at the affectionate simplicity with which Susan ' s little brothers undertook her defence , and they were , from this slight circumstance , disposed to think yet more favourably of a family which seemed so well united .
Some people are wholly inattentive to the lesser feelings , and incapable of reading the countenances of those on whom they bestow their bounty .
" She does not like any of these things ," whispered Miss Somers to her sister .
Good night , Susan , we shall soon come again to your neat cottage .
She was to have been Queen of the May , which in our little village , amongst the younger tribe , is a thing that is thought of a good deal ; but Susan ' s mother was ill , and Susan , after sitting up with her all night , would not leave her in the morning , even when they brought the crown to her .
You will , I hope , find us good customers and well - wishers ," added she , with a smile ; " for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well - wishers themselves .
She put the bright guinea carefully into the glove with the twelve shillings , which she had received from her companions on May day .
But she did not pass by unperceived .
Her little brothers were watching for her return , and , as soon as they saw her , they ran after her , and overtook her as she reached the meadow .
" What did that good lady want with you ?
" said William .
" Yours !
" I have no time to waste ," said he ; " butcher , you ' ll account with me .
The neighbours were kind enough to show me whereabouts you lived ; for , though I didn ' t know your name , they guessed who I meant by what I said of you all .
Could you be so charitable as to give an old blind man a night ' s lodging ?
Of this he had just had experience at the house of the Attorney Case , while he had asked , but had been roughly refused all assistance by Miss Barbara , who was , according to her usual custom , standing staring at the hall door .
Who knows , dearest mother , but we may keep him with us for ever !
Susan ' s father , as soon as supper was finished , even before he would let the harper play a tune for his boys , opened the little purse , which Susan had given him .
But tell us , child , how came you by all this riches ?
and how comes it that I don ' t go to - morrow ?
"
How rejoiced , how triumphant was she , when this very evening , just about the time when the butcher was bargaining with her father about Susan ' s lamb , a servant from the Abbey rapped at the door , and left a card for Mr . and Miss Barbara Case .
And , Betty , I have thought of the most charming present for Miss Somers , as papa says it ' s good never to go empty - handed to a great house , I ' ll make Miss Somers , who is fond , as her maid told you , of such things -- I ' ll make Miss Somers a present of that guinea - hen of Susan ' s ; it ' s of no use to me , so do you carry it up early in the morning to the Abbey , with my compliments .
She was dressed in all the finery which she had heard from her maid , who had heard from the ' prentice of a Shrewsbury milliner , was THE THING in London ; and she was much surprised and disappointed , when she was shown into the room where the Miss Somerses and the ladies of the Abbey were sitting , to see that they did not , in any one part of their dress , agree with the picture her imagination had formed of fashionable ladies .
Miss Barbara Case , with her mistaken airs of gentility , aiming to be thought a woman , and a fine lady , whilst she was , in reality , a child and a vulgar attorney ' s daughter , rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous , that the good natured , yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself .
Miss Somers went out of the room for a few minutes to alter her dress , as it was the custom of the family , before dinner .
She left a portfolio of pretty drawings and good prints , for Miss Barbara ' s amusement ; but Miss Barbara ' s thoughts were so intent upon the harpers ' ball , that she could not be entertained with such TRIFLES .
How unhappy are those who spend their time in expectation !
"
She made no answer , in expectation that the housekeeper , who was a woman of a very open temper , would explain her cause of dissatisfaction .
" But , sir ," said the vulgar attorney , " I must make bold to differ with you in one point , and I ' ll appeal to Sir Arthur .
Sir Arthur , pray may I ask , when you carve a forequarter of lamb , do you , when you raise the shoulder , throw in salt , or not ?
" This well prepared question was not lost upon Sir Arthur .
"
One of the ladies observed , that this hall would be a charming place for music .
Bab brought in harps and harpers , and the harpers ' ball , in a breath .
"
" What is the matter , Philip ?
" said Miss Somers , in a pacifying tone ; but Philip was not inclined to be pacified .
Philip took his pipe and tabor , and they marched in innocent triumph towards the whitewashed cottage .
my father has something to say to you .
" I did not shed one tear when I parted with you , my dear little Daisy !
" Now , if my father was not to go away from us next week , and if my mother was quite stout , I should be the happiest person in the world !
" Nor I neither , I hope ," said Susan , looking round upon her companions with a most affectionate smile : " I hope , whilst I live , I shall never forget your goodness to me last May day .
" was the general cry .
" Well ," said Susan , " I am not too proud to be obliged .
I must cut your nice wings ; but I won ' t hurt you .
As papa says , it ' s a good thing to have two strings to one ' s bow .
" said Bab , laughing .
You know , on a particular occasion such as this , neighbours must help one another .
Barbara grew angry , and lost all command of herself , when she saw that Susan , without regarding her reproaches , went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive .
" But instead of standing quietly , Bab buffeted and stamped and roared , and the bees stung her terribly .
" Indeed , Miss Barbara ," said she , " this was quite wrong of you to go and get yourself into such a scrape .
I shall be turned away for it , you ' ll see .
" I don ' t care whether you are turned away or not ," said Barbara ; " I never felt such pain in my life .
"
" You need not think of balls ; for those lumps and swellings won ' t go off your face this week .
He now thought that the most prudent course he could possibly follow would be to HUSH UP matters with the Prices with all convenient speed .
Betty instantly began to tell the story of Barbara ' s mishap her own way .
So stood matters the day of the long expected harpers ' ball .
Miss Barbara Case , stung by Susan ' s bees , could not , after all her manoeuvres , go with Mrs . Strathspey to the ball .
The ballroom was filled early in the evening .
There was a numerous assembly .
Six ladies and six gentlemen were now appointed to be judges of the performance .
All were fixed in delighted attention ; and when the music ceased , the silence for some moments continued .
The judges were unanimous in their opinions , and it was declared that the old blind harper , who played the last , deserved the prize .
Miss Somers looked at her brother from time to time , as she wrote ; and Sir Arthur , as soon as the old man had finished , took him aside , and asked him some questions , which brought the whole history of Susan ' s lamb and of Attorney Case ' s cruelty to light .
The attorney himself was present when the harper began to dictate his ballad .
The boy ran with the letter to the post - office .
"
If it is never convenient to you to pay it , I shall never ask it .
But it is my humour to go about as I do .
"
"
"
When they got to the ground , Mr . Case , who saw them walking together , was in a hurry to join them , that he might put a stop to any explanations .
" Why , Sir Arthur ," interposed the politic attorney , with an assumed air of generosity , " don ' t let us talk any more about it .
"
" Very possibly .
" I thought it my duty to do so ; not out of any malice or ill - will to this good man .
"
You will observe that it is neither signed nor sealed by the grantor .
"
"
" You are a scholar ; you write a good hand ; you can keep accounts , cannot you ?
" said Sir Arthur to Mr . Price , as they walked home towards the cottage .
Did you teach her to write ?
" But I mean to do more than PAY YOU WITH WORDS ," said Sir Arthur .
Susan gave it to her father ; but she must not refuse a gown of our choosing this time ; and I am sure she will not , because her mother , I see , likes it .
"
"
"
It must be large enough for everybody to have a slice , and the housekeeper will ice it for you .
Fare ye well .
Where is it ?
"
" The words are something , but the tune -- the tune -- I must have the tune ," cried Philip .
You see , at last Attorney Case , with all his cunning has not proved a match for " Simple Susan .
" And please your honour , but I don ' t know what it is I or mine have done to offend you .
I ' m sure there is not a gentleman in all Ireland I ' d go further to sarve .
" No man has belied you , Mr . Cox , but your nose belies you much , if you do not love drinking a little , and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little .
I defy any man , or set of men , ten mile round , to prove such a thing , and I am ready to fight him that dares to say the like of me .
"
To this speech Mr . Somerville made no answer , but turned away to look at the bow window of a handsome new inn , which the glazier was at this instant glazing .
"
"
"
don ' t chop his head off : he does not deserve it ," cried the boy , who came running out of the garret with the greatest eagerness -- " _I_ broke your window , sir ," said he to Mr . Somerville .
" I broke your window with this ball ; but I did not know that I had done it , till this moment , I assure you , or I should have told you before .
and how came you to find it out at last ?
"
Upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play .
He ran to look for it in the street , but could not find it , which I was very glad of ; but I was very sorry just now to find it myself lying upon this heap of shavings , sir , under this broken window ; for , as soon as I saw it lying there , I knew I must have been the person that broke the window ; and through this window came the white pigeon .
Here ' s one of his white feathers sticking in the gap .
" Yes ," said the carpenter , " and in the bow - window room below there ' s plenty of his feathers to be seen ; for I ' ve just been down to look .
It was the pigeon broke THEM windows , sure enough .
" Take the pigeon , my honest , generous lad ," said Mr . Somerville , " and carry him back to your neighbour .
" More happy for him to have such a father and mother ," exclaimed the boy .
They have the good - will of all who know them ; and I am sure I hope they will do well .
Besides , he is likely to do well in the world , because he is never in idle company , and I ' ve known him since he was two foot high , and never heard of his telling a lie .
" Brian thanked her ; and he from that day began to grow fond of the pigeon .
Brian , after the shop was shut up at night , used to amuse himself with reading some little books which the schoolmaster who formerly taught him arithmetic was so good as to lend him .
Hey , father ?
"
At one of these fairs a set of men of desperate fortunes met to drink , and to concert plans of robberies .
The scrawl was scarcely legible ; but these words were at length deciphered :--
Somerville .
" I know the difference , my good friends ," said Mr . Somerville , " between vile informers and courageous , honest men .
" Go up the ladder , will you ?
" said Mr . Somerville to Brian , " and pull that sign straight , for it hangs quite crooked .
' And I wish him joy of having such a son as you are .
"
But Bell has a great many nice things -- I don ' t mean nice eatable things , but nice new playthings , given to her always on her birthday ; and everybody drinks her health , and she ' s so happy .
And , mother ," added Rosamond , stopping her as she was going out of the room , " will you -- not now , but when you ' ve time -- will you tell me why you never keep my birthday -- why you never make any difference between that day and any other day ?
The work was at a stand for want of some filigree - paper , and , as her mother was going out , she asked her to take her with her , that she might buy some .
" Sister ," said Rosamond , as they were walking along , " what have you done with your half - guinea ?
" Yes ," said Laura , smiling ; " she whispered so loud that I could not help hearing her too .
" Stay ," interrupted her sister , for Rosamond , anticipating the glories of her work - basket , talked and walked so fast that she had passed , without perceiving it , the shop where the filigree - paper was to be bought .
They turned back .
Now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street , and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane .
She took it up eagerly , looked at it as if she was very hungry , then put aside her work , and ran after the baker to return it to him .
The little girl came back out of breath to her work ; but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled .
" I must go to my mother , sir ," said the child ; " besides , you have spoiled all my lace .
" And he broke off , one after another , all the bobbins , put them into his pocket , rolled her weaving - pillow down the dirty lane , then jumped up behind his mistress ' coach , and was out of sight in an instant .
" Yes , madam ," said Rosamond ; and the idea of what her godmother and her cousin Bell would think of her generosity rushed again upon her imagination .
"
" Then you can buy another with that ," said Laura , dropping the half - guinea into her hand ; and she shut the window before the child could find words to thank her , but not before she saw a look of joy and gratitude , which gave Laura more pleasure probably than all the praise which could have been bestowed upon her generosity .
" It is not a box , father ," said Rosamond , a little peevishly ; " it ' s a basket .
"
You think , then , that I have wasted my time , because the basket is of no use ; but then it is a present for my Cousin Bell .
I thought you had forgotten that -- it was two years ago ; I ' m not so silly now .
"
"
" I did not say VERY fond .
" But you have spent a whole week in making this thing for her .
" Yet you think her silly , and you are not fond of her at all ; and you say you know this thing will be of no use to her .
"
From her infancy she had been humoured ; and at eight years old she had the misfortune to be a spoiled child .
" Not come home , indeed !
But then I say I won ' t wear it without the lace -- I can ' t wear it without the lace , and I won ' t .
"
" Well , then ," said the maid , " your cousin Rosamond is come , and has brought you the most BEAUTIFULLEST thing you ever saw in your life ; but you are not to know anything about it till after dinner , because she wants to surprise you ; and mistress has put it into her wardrobe till after dinner .
" exclaimed the spoiled child , who never considered anything but her own immediate gratification --" Become of YOU , indeed !
If you don ' t hold it down for me directly , I ' ll tell that you showed it to me .
" What ' s your business ?
The little girl gave the lace without reply , and the maid desired her to go about her business , and not to expect to be paid ; for that her mistress could not see anybody , BECAUSE she was in a room full of company .
"
" Yes , but you do , though ," said Bell , more angrily .
Laura received this declaration in silence -- Rosamond smiled ; and at her smile the ill - suppressed rage of the spoiled child burst forth into the seventh and loudest fit of crying which had yet been heard on her birthday .
" What ' s the matter , my pet ?
Who has put it into your head , child , to dislike it ?
" No , not Nancy , but THEM , mamma ," said Bell , pointing to Laura and Rosamond .
"
" cried Rosamond , warmly , rising in her sister ' s defence .
No defence or explanation , however , was to be heard , for everybody had now gathered round Bell , to dry her tears , and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs .
Rosamond , followed by all the company , amongst whom , to her great joy , was her godmother , proceeded to the dressing room .
"
" Afraid of !
Don ' t ," said the maid .
But you know ," continued she , turning to the maid , " somebody must have done this , and I must know how it was done .
"
" Who ?
"
" Why , miss , don ' t you recollect that little girl with the lace , that we saw peeping about in the passage ?
"
" Oh , that would not comfort me at all ," said Rosamond ; " besides , we are not sure that she did it , and if --" A single knock at the door was heard at this instant .
" Yes , ma ' am ," said the girl .
" Yes , do confess it ," added Bell , earnestly .
You must have opened my wardrobe .
"
" Well , and what became of it afterwards ?
"
" Everybody else , however , did believe ; and their eyes were fixed upon Bell in a manner which made her feel rather ashamed .
Why do you all look so ?
" cried she , bursting into a roar of passion ; " and all for this nasty thing !
" added she , pushing away the remains of the basket , and looking angrily at Rosamond .
Bell !
Did I not , Laura ?
" said she , appealing , in a sarcastic tone , to where she thought Laura was .
It is not only by giving away money that we can show generosity ; it is by giving up to others anything that we like ourselves : and therefore ," added he , smiling , " it is really generous of you to give your sister the thing you like best of all others .
" The thing I like the best of all others , father ," said Rosamond , half pleased , half vexed .
" What is that , I wonder ?
" Their Royal Highnesses the Dukes of Kent and Cumberland , Earl Morton , and General Gwynne , all on horseback , dressed in the Windsor uniform , except the Prince of Wales , who wore a suit of dark blue , and a brown surtout over .
" The cavalcade was brought up by her Majesty and her amiable daughters in two carriages , and a numerous company of equestrians and pedestrians , all eager to behold their Sovereign and his family .
Among the former , Lady Lade was foremost in the throng ; only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude .
" An exceeding heavy shower of rain coming on , the Prince took leave , and went to the ' Windmill Inn ,' till it subsided .
" The Scholars partook of an elegant dinner at the ' Windmill Inn ,' and in the evening walked on Windsor Terrace .
" The profit arising from the Salt collected , according to account , amounted to 8OO pounds .

When I was young , they say , I was proud ; but I am humble enough now : these petty mortifications do not vex me .
Mrs . Talb .
Since you have left it and have felt something of the difference that is made in this world between splendour and no splendour , you have never regretted that you did not stay there , and that you did not bear more patiently with Miss Bursal ' s little airs ?

Lord J .
Rory .
One day his father sent him to the neighbouring town to purchase some garden seeds for him .
"
then stir about it .
" I am glad to have a day longer to stay ashore , and I ' ve business enough on my hands .
" said he , " or you will break your china jar .
Are you in your garden !
I have good news for you -- something you ' ll be delighted to see , Arthur !-- Ha !-- but here is something that I am not delighted to see , I am sure ," said poor Maurice , who , when he had got through the raspberry - bushes , and had come in sight of his own garden , beheld his bell - glass -- his beloved bell - glass , under which his cucumbers were grown so finely -- his only bell - glass , broken to pieces !
" Oh , forgive and forget , as my father always says ; that ' s the best way .
"
He was not nearly so good - natured as you are .
He thought that it showed SPIRIT , to remember and to resent an injury ; and , therefore , though he was not an ill - natured man , he was sometimes led , by this mistaken idea of SPIRIT , to do ill - natured things : " A warm friend and a bitter enemy ," was one of his maxims , and he had many more enemies than friends .
When first he settled near Mr . Grant , the gardener , he felt inclined to dislike him , because he was told that Mr . Grant was a Scotchman , and he had a prejudice against Scotchmen ; all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious , because he had once been over - reached by a Scotch peddler .
"
Here Mr . Oakly was interrupted by the entrance of some strangers , and he did finish making his request -- Mr . Oakly was not , as he said of himself , apt to ask favours , and nothing but Grant ' s cordiality could have conquered his prejudices , so far as to tempt him to ask a favour from a Scotchman .
let me never again see you with Grant ' s son .
"
" Why now , what does the boy cry for ?
"
Now , the message which Grant really sent about the Brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which Mr . Oakly received .
The message was , that the raspberries were not Mr . Grant ' s ; that therefore he had no right to give them away ; that they belonged to his son Maurice , and that this was not the right time of year for planting them .
Oakly , when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour Grant , could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint .
Oakly thought the plum - tree , as it belonged to Mr . Grant , had no right to make its appearance on his ground : an attorney told him that he might oblige Grant to cut it down ; but Mr . Grant refused to cut down his plum - tree at the attorney ' s desire , and the attorney persuaded Oakly to go to law about the business , and the lawsuit went on for some months .
Oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas , remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay , and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground , " which , after all ," said he , " is not worth twopence .
"
The attorney saw and took advantage of Oakly ' s prejudice against the natives of Scotland ; and he persuaded him , that to show the SPIRIT of a true - born Englishman it was necessary , whatever it might cost him , to persist in this law suit .
" DEAR MR . OAKLY ,-- I don ' t know why you have quarrelled with us ; I am very sorry for it .
It was not the right time of the year to plant them , which was the reason they were not sent to you ; but it is just the right time to plant them now ; and I send you the book , in which you will find the reason why we always put seaweed ashes about their roots ; and I have got some seaweed ashes for you .
Although this may be attributed to these islands being surrounded with a salt , and consequently a moist atmosphere , yet the ashes ( seaweed ashes ) made use of as manure , may also have their portion of influence .
"*
* It is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry - plants .
Mr . Oakly was much pleased by this openness , and said , " Why now , Arthur , this is something like , this is telling one the thing one wants to know , without fine speeches .
"
I don ' t mean to ask for any good round sum ; for the plum - tree has done me no great harm by coming into my garden ; but only I don ' t choose it should come there without my leave .
One of his own Brobdingnag raspberry - plants , swung by the angry arm of Oakly , struck off the head of his precious tulip !
" cried Arthur and Mr . Oakly at once .
"
Mr . Oakly stood surprised --" Certainly ," said he to himself , " this cannot be such a miser as I took him for "; and he walked immediately up to Grant , and bluntly said to him , " Mr . Grant , your son has behaved very handsomely to my son ; and you seem to be glad of it .
"
"
He repeated exactly the answer which he really sent , and Oakly immediately stretched out his hand to him , saying " I believe you : no more need be said .
" Oh , forgive and forget ," said Grant and his son at the same moment .
And from this time forward the two families lived in friendship with each other .
WASTE NOT , WANT NOT ; or TWO STRINGS TO YOUR BOW .
They had been educated very differently .
His father was a gentleman , who spent rather more than he could afford ; and Hal , from the example of the servants in his father ' s family , with whom he had passed the first years of his childhood , learned to waste more of everything than he used .
Mr . Gresham accompanied them , and attended to their remarks and exclamations .
" WASTE NOT , WANT NOT .
"
"
" Nothing , sir ," said Hal ; " you were called away from us and we did not know which way to go .
The two parcels were exactly alike , both of them well tied up with good whip cord .
" Oh , no ," said Ben , who now had undone the last knot of his parcel , and who drew out the length of string with exultation , " don ' t cut it , Hal ,-- look what a nice cord this is , and yours is the same : it ' s a pity to cut it ; ' WASTE NOT , WANT NOT !
"
" " And here ' s my parcel , uncle ; and here ' s the string ," said Ben .
"
" No , I am afraid not , if this be it ," said his uncle , taking up the jagged knotted remains of Hal ' s cord .
Ben bore this misfortune with good humour .
When this cord was drawn forth , it appeared that it was the very same jagged , entangled piece which Hal had pulled off his parcel .
" That ' s right , Ben ; never be ashamed of being good - natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself ," said his uncle , smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord , to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat ' s cradle .
"
" My dear uncle , but I assure you ," said Hal , earnestly , " there ' s no judging about the matter , because really , upon my word , Lady Diana said distinctly , that her sons were to have uniforms , white faced with green , and a green and white cockade in their hats .
And as for this gentleman that we are going to , I ' m sure , if he knows anything about the matter , he ' ll say exactly the same as I do .
The gentleman upon whom Mr . Gresham called had three sons , who were all to be at this archery meeting ; and they unanimously assured him , in the presence of Hal and Ben , that they had never thought of buying uniforms for this grand occasion , and that , amongst the number of their acquaintance , they knew of but three boys whose friends intended to be at such an UNNECESSARY expense .
"
" But I really am hungry ," said Hal ; " you know , uncle , it is a good while since breakfast .
" I ' m not hungry ," said Ben .
"
Mr . Millar ' s dog was sitting on the flags before the door , and he looked up with a wistful , begging eye at Hal , who was eating a queen cake .
" True , I am not hungry now ; but that is no reason why I should never be hungry again .
" For a stout archer ," said Mr . Gresham , " you are more easily tired than one might have expected .
"
"*
" Pray , let us see the poor robin eat out of your hand .
" Ah , no , sir ," said the young man , with a deep sigh , " that is not the thing .
" What a horrid place it is !
" Oh , no ," said Ben , laughing ; " I shall not change my mind ,"
We sha ' n ' t want greatcoats YET .
Mr . Gresham took six guineas out of his purse and he placed three of them before Hal , and three before Ben .
Now I will lay out this money for you just as you please .
" To all this conclusive , conditional reasoning , which depended upon the word PERHAPS , three times repeated , Mr . Gresham made no reply ; but he immediately bought the uniform for Hal , and desired that it should be sent to Lady Diana Sweepstakes ' son ' s tailor , to be made up .
" And how am I to lay out the three guineas for you , Ben ?
" Gresham bought the coat ; and , after it was paid for , five - and - twenty shillings of Ben ' s three guineas remained .
I ' m glad you are so exact , however .
"
Choose the poor , blind boy ' s coat , my dear nephew , and pay for it .
" And when he saw the look of delight and gratitude with which the poor boy received the clothes which Ben gave him ; and when he heard the mother and children thank him , he sighed , and said , " Well , I hope mamma will give me some more pocket money soon .
" But I don ' t understand , Cousin Hal ," said little Patty , " why you call this bow a FAMOUS bow .
What does famous mean ?
In short , what does it signify talking any longer , Patty , about the matter ?
" What sort of a day is it ?
The sun shone bright , but there was a sharp and high wind .
" Good morning to you , uncle ; how do you do ?
seemed rather to mean , " How do you like me in my uniform ?
How good you were to me , Ben , when I was in pain the day I sprained my ankle !
The white teeth are not quite even .
I told him they were just going out with you ; but he says he won ' t detain them more than half a minute .
"
" But , I suppose ," said Hal , with a sigh , " that Stephen mistook , when he said the young GENTLEMEN ; he only wants to see Ben , I daresay ; I ' m sure he has no reason to want to see me .
he looked at you first , Ben -- and well he may !
"
He made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins .
" He held the balls to Ben and Hal .
"
" Sir -- uncle -- sir , you know , since all the UNIFORMS agreed to go together - -"
" Off with you , then , Mr .
Hal ran downstairs in such a hurry that he forgot his bow and arrows .
Ben discovered this when he went to fetch his own ; and the lad from Bristol , who had been ordered by Mr . Gresham to eat his breakfast before he proceeded to Redland Chapel , heard Ben talking about his cousin ' s bow and arrows .
" I know ," said Ben , " he will be sorry not to have his bow with him , because here are the green knots tied to it , to match his cockade : and he said that the boys were all to carry their bows , as part of the show .
" Will you ?
The public walk leading to the Wells was full of company .
A barge , with coloured streamers flying , was waiting to take up a party who were going upon the water .
The drummer only waited for her ladyship ' s signal ; and the archers ' corps only waited for her ladyship ' s word of command to march .
The walk appeared much shorter than usual , and he was extremely sorry that Lady Diana , when they were half - way up the hill leading to Prince ' s Place , mounted her horse , because the road was dirty , and all the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied her followed her example .
" We can leave the children to walk , you know ," said she to the gentleman who helped her to mount her horse .
" I must call to some of them , though , and leave orders where they are to join .
She beckoned : and Hal , who was foremost , and proud to show his alacrity , ran on to receive her ladyship ' s orders .
" Oh , my new ball !
" Careless brat !
" said she , " why can ' t he keep his hat upon his head ?
It happened that the poor boy with the black patch upon his eye , who had been ordered by Lady Diana to " fall back " and to " keep at a distance ," was now coming up the hill ; and the moment he saw our fallen hero , he hastened to his assistance .
"-- and under this persuasion our young archer resumed his bow -- his bow with green ribands , now no more !-- and he pursued his way to the Downs .
Hal trudged on as fast as he possibly could .
pray let me into the circle !
I ' m one of the archers -- I am , indeed ; don ' t you see my green and white uniform ?
They were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers .
He was in such confusion , that , amongst the number of faces , he could scarcely distinguish one from another ; but he felt somebody at this moment pull his elbow , and , to his great relief , he heard the friendly voice , and saw the good natured face of his Cousin Ben .
" Come , come ," cried young Sweepstakes , " I ' m within one inch of the mark ; who ' ll go nearer ?
Hurried by his impatient rival , and with his hands so much benumbed that he could scarcely feel how to fix the arrow in the string , he drew the bow .
" Here ' s my bow for him , and welcome ," said Ben .
But his laughter ceased when our provident hero calmly drew from his pocket an excellent piece of whip cord .
" Yes ," said Ben , as he fastened it to his bow , " I put it into my pocket , to - day , on purpose , because I thought I might happen to want it .

Good morrow to your worship !
Our pie is in the oven ; that was what you sent for me about , I take it .
Will you take a glass of anything this morning , Mrs .
ha !
Why , it ' s past one , I declare ; and I thought I was up in remarkably good time , too .

For dinner , as sure as the clock strikes four -- but I mustn ' t stay prating , for it may be spoiling if I ' m away ; so I must wish your worship a good morning .

And show the old man in now .

My old gentleman , as I hope to breathe !

But please your worship , it pleased God to take away the use of my left arm ; and since that I have never been able to work .

Silence !
Five times have I commanded silence , and five times in vain ; and I won ' t command anything five times in vain -- THAT ' S POZ !

Don ' t contradict him , though , because he told ME not .
Just .
Old M . Oh , please your worship , quite sure ; for I took it out and looked at it just before I said my prayers .
Pray , my good friend , where might you put your money when you went to bed ?
Old M . No , please your worship , no ; not the box -- the box was never stirred from the place where I put it .
the thing ' s impossible !
Just .
Sir , it does not signify -- it does not signify !

Go to your dolls , darling , and don ' t be positive -- go to your dolls , and don ' t talk of what you don ' t understand .
Why , what I say is this , that I don ' t dispute that that box , that you hold in your hands , is a box ; nay , for aught I know , it may be a tobacco - box -- but it ' s clear to me that if they left the box they did not take the money ; and how do you dare , sir , to come before Justice Headstrong with a lie in your mouth ; recollect yourself -- I ' ll give you time to recollect yourself .
( A pause .
Well , sir ;, and what do you say now about the box ?
Go , go , for the present .
( Lucy speaks to the Old Man as he is going off .
Lucy .
Was the box shut fast when you left it ?
why -- why then , why will you be so positive to persist in a lie ?
Lucy .
Here , old man ; here ' s your money -- here it is all -- a guinea and a half , and a shilling and a sixpence , just as he said , papa .

Mr . and Mrs . Montague spent the summer of the year 1795 at Clifton with their son Frederick , and their two daughters Sophia and Marianne .
" Let children see and judge for themselves ," is often inconsiderately said .
The blooming complexion of the lady had indeed attracted the attention of the children , as they caught a glimpse of her face when she was getting into her carriage to go out upon the Downs .
Besides her blooming complexion , the delicate white of her garments had struck them with admiration ; and they observed that her brother carefully guarded her dress from the wheel of the carriage , as he handed her in .
Her voice was eternally to be heard , and it was not particularly melodious .
" " Mrs . Theresa Tattle not at home !
"
No person at the Wells was oftener at home and abroad than Mrs . Tattle .
"
This alarming whisper could not , however , have a permanent effect upon Mrs . Montague ' s understanding , because three days afterwards Mrs . Theresa , upon the most anxious inspection , entirely mistook the just and natural proportions of the hip and shoulder .
* Lobe .
They had heard of a house in the country which was likely to suit them , and they determined to go directly to look at it .
" Mrs . Theresa Tattle presents her very best compliments to the entertaining Mr . Frederick Montague ; she hopes he will have the charity to drink tea with her this evening , and bring his charming sister , Miss Marianne , with him , as Mrs . Theresa will be quite alone with a shocking headache , and is sensible her nerves are affected ; and Dr . Cardamum says that ( especially in Mrs . T . T .' s case ) it is downright death to nervous patients to be alone an instant .
So I think we might as well go , because we could not refuse , if we would , I say .
"
" You know words mean nothing in themselves .
" I wanted to prove ," interrupted Frederick , " that it ' s not worth while to dispute for two hours about two words .
Women have no business to do either ; for , how should they know how to chop logic like men ?
Now , Marianne , look at her brush dabbing so fast in the water !
blood heat !
"
" cried Marianne , " she ' s so good - humoured , don ' t tease her any more , and don ' t draw heads upon her paper , and don ' t stretch her india - rubber , and don ' t let us dirty any more of her brushes .
But she is temperate now , and I won ' t plague her ; she shall chop logic , if she likes it , though she is a woman .
"
" All I have to say is , that she ' ll never be able to make a pudding .
"
"
" The same thing !
Oh , Frederick !
"
"
"
"
A knock at the door , from Mrs . Theresa Tattle ' s servant , recalled Marianne to the business of the day .
The servant came with his mistress ' compliments , to let the young ladies and Mr . Frederick know that she was waiting tea for them .
" Waiting !
She was " delighted " they were come , and " grieved " not to see Miss Sophy along with them .
" Come , Mr . Frederick ," said she after tea , " you promised to make me laugh ; and nobody can make me laugh so well as yourself .
Eat , madam !
eat !
Fred .
Mar .
You might as well tell me to cut the table , ma ' am .
Mutton , truly !
It ' s a very hard case , Mrs . Carbuncle , that I can never have a bit of anything that I can eat at my own table , Mrs . Carbuncle , since I was married , ma ' am , I that am the easiest man in the whole world to please about my dinner .
Mar .
Yes , brother , because she is frightened , you know , and Mrs . Carbuncle always says " my dear " to him when she ' s frightened , and looks so pale from side to side ; and sometimes she cries before dinner ' s done , and then all the company are quite silent , and don ' t know what to do .
" Oh , such a little creature ; to have so much sense , too !
" Oh , admirable !
I really am so hoarse , it distresses me so to be pressed to sing ; besides , upon my word , I have quite left off singing .
I ' ve never sung once , except for very particular people , this winter .
Mar .
"
It ' s not late .
" As a delicate white hand has ever been deemed a distinguishing ornament in either sex , Messrs . Valiant and Wise conceive it to be their duty to take the earliest opportunity to advertise the nobility and gentry of Great Britain in general , and their friends in particular , that they have now ready for sale , as usual , at the Hippocrates ' Head , a fresh assortment of new - invented , much admired , primrose soap .

"
That is Sir Charles to the very life .
But with all that , you must know he ' s a mighty pleasant , fashionable young man when you come to know him , and has a great deal of sense under all that , and is of a very good family -- the Slangs , you know .
Sir Charles will come into a fine fortune himself next year , if he can keep clear of gambling , which I hear is his foible , poor young man !
Even in the midst of laughter , and whilst the voice of flattery yet sounded in his ear , Frederick felt sad , displeased with himself , and disgusted with Mrs . Theresa .
"
" Marianne ," cried Frederick , " do you remember the man in the mask ?
very extraordinary !
" Oh yes ; indeed you must not leave me without taking something ; and Miss Marianne must have another macaroon .
The door opened just as Mrs . Tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip - wine .
Christopher !
" said Mrs . Theresa , who was standing at the fire , with her back to the door , when it opened , " Christopher !
" repeated Mrs . Theresa , provoked at the recollection of her late solemn address to them .
" The bell rang , ma ' am ,", answered a squeaking voice .
"
I have no brother , dunce ," said Mrs . Theresa .
"
" said the lady to her footman , who was now lighting the candles .
"
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa ; " but did old Eden go up the chimney himself after the boy , wig and all ?
But I finds him stupid and ill - mannered like , for I offered him a shilling , ma ' am , myself , to tell about the wig ; but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he , to no lady ' s butler , ma ' am ; whereupon I turns to the slim fellow ( and he ' s smarterer , and more mannerly , ma ' am , with a tongue in his head for his betters ), but he could not resolve me my question either ; for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o ' the time : and when he came down Mr . Eden had his wig on , but had his arm all bare and bloody , ma ' am .
* To be sure ," added she , observing that both Frederick and Marianne looked displeased at this speech , " to be sure , if one may believe this story , there was some real danger .
yes , indeed ," said Marianne ; " and I ' m sure I think Mr . Eden was very good .
or which ?
Old Eden , I know , has long wanted to obtain an introduction into that house ; and a charming charitable expedient hit upon !
She will do me the honour to be here to spend an evening to - morrow .
" If they do come home , I will ask them about it ," said Frederick , hesitating ; for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation , he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying No .
" My dear sir , at your age , must you ask your papa and mamma about such things ?
"
" Take care , take care ," said Mrs . Theresa , laughing at his perplexity : " you want to get off from obliging me , and you don ' t know how .
And there is not a person at the Wells , I ' ll venture to say , could be of more advantage to your sister Sophy , in the way of partners , when she comes to go the balls , which it ' s to be supposed she will , some time or other ; and as you are so good a brother , that ' s a thing to be looked to , you know .
"
Between friends , can there be any harm in showing one ' s talents ?
She ' ll keep your secret , I ' ll answer for her ; and ," added she , " you needn ' t be afraid of her criticism ; for , between you and me , she ' s no great critic ; so you ' ll come .
Frederick looked surprised ; for he thought that the favour of his company was what she meant : but she explained herself farther .
He is the best character , the oddest creature !
But then his voice and way , and altogether , if one could get them to the life , they ' d be better than anything on the stage ; better even than anything I ' ve seen to - night ; and I think you ' d make a capital Quaker for my Lady Battersby ; but then the thing is , one can never get to hear the old quiz talk .
I ' m sure you , who are so quick , would only want to see him , and hear him , for half a minute , to be able to take him off , so as to kill one with laughing .
"
"
" Well , well , let us hear it ; and you shall do as you please afterwards .
Merciful goodness !
" Now ," continued he , " this fellow is just my height .
"
" Oh , it ' s an admirable invention !
"
" Well , well ; but only let me ring , and ask whether the chimney - sweepers are below .
You shall do as you please afterwards .
" No , ma ' am .
" Oh , no , ma ' am ; nor be not to go till the bell rings ; for Miss Bertha , ma ' am , was asleep a - lying down , and her brother wouldn ' t have her wakened on no account whatsomever .
Quick , but don ' t let the other bear come up with him .
"
Only just change clothes with the boy ; only just let me see what a charming chimney - sweeper you ' d make .
"
" What do you mean ?
" said Marianne .
" That she ' ll die , child .
How sorry her poor , poor brother will be !
Oh , you must be quite mistaken , I hope .
"
"
here he is .
" exclaimed Mrs . Theresa .
cobwebs !
" He ' ll bleed to death !
" cried Marianne , catching hold of the words ; and terrified , she ran upstairs , crying , " Sophy , oh , Sophy !
come down , or he ' ll be dead !
" My brother !
I wish Miss Bertha --"
I was frightened out of my wits at first .
I thought it was his eye , but I see it ' s only his nose .
They are surely thy best friends ," said a voice .
for goodness ' sake !
Let me speak ," cried he , pushing away her hand , which stopped his mouth .
" My brother , ma ' am ," said Sophy , " is not afraid of my father and mother ' s coming back .
" Forgive , brother , without asking what ," said Bertha , smiling .
The chimney - sweeper , where is he ?
After we left you we went down to the kitchen together , and there , fool as I was , for the pleasure of making Mr . Christopher and the servants laugh , began to mimic you .
"
" You are not mistaken ," cried Marianne .
I speak plainly , friend , for that is best .
He will want to go home ," said Mr . Eden , turning to Mrs . Theresa .
" Here is a catastrophe indeed !
I declare , Mr . Montague , you are vastly good , not to be in a passion ," added Mrs . Theresa .
Nor will he be tempted to offend against humanity , for the sake of being called ' The best mimic in the world .
" The mother of mischief ," says an old proverb , " is no bigger than a midge ' s wing .
He used to torment everybody with --" Do pray help me !
Fisher was mortally offended one morning by De Grey ' s refusing to translate his whole lesson for him .
Fisher applauded this as a very spirited speech ; and , by insinuations that Dr . Middleton " always gave the premium to De Grey ," and that " those who had lost their bets might thank themselves for it , for being such simpletons as to bet against the favourite ," he raised a murmur highly flattering to Archer , amongst some of the most credulous boys ; whilst others loudly proclaimed their belief in Dr . Middleton ' s impartiality .
These warmly congratulated De Grey .
At this Archer grew more and more angry , and when Fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense FOR him , pushed forward into the circle to De Grey , crying , " I wish , Mr . Fisher , you would let me fight my own battles !
" And _I_ wish ," said young Townsend , who was fonder of diversions than of premiums , or battles , or of anything else --" _I_ wish , that we were not to have any battles ; after having worked like horses , don ' t set about to fight like dogs .
" Come then !
" said De Grey , and he ran across the playground to a waste building at the farthest end of it , in which , at the earnest request of the whole community , and with the permission of Dr . Middleton , he had with much pain and ingenuity erected a theatre .
Follow the manager !
" FOLLOW THE MANAGER !
" I wish you had , any of you , seen the playhouse _I_ have been used to ?
" Another attacked the scenes ; " Scenes !
Archer , who was touched by what his rival said , and , stopping the hand of his new partisan , Fisher , cried , " No , Fisher !
The riot once begun , nothing could stop the little mob , till the whole theatre was demolished .
The love of power prevailed in the mind of Archer ; he was secretly flattered by the zeal of his PARTY , and he mistook their love of mischief for attachment to himself .
" And now it was all over , there was silence .
In this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice .
" Hush !
It was dusk .
Two window - shutters at the farthest end of the building were seen to move slowly inwards .
De Grey , and in the same instant Archer , went forward ; and , as the shutters opened , there appeared through the hole the dark face and shrivelled hands of a very old gipsy .
"
" Not you !
" There ," cried Townsend , as he chanced to stumble over the carpenter ' s mitre box , which stood in the way , " there ' s a good omen for me .
Happy he who had sixpence , for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench .
No one had half a crown , or no one would surely have kept it in his pocket upon such an occasion , for he might have been an archbishop , a king , or what he pleased .
They hope to WIN , when they cannot EARN ; and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense , it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense .
" I have a question to put ," said Fisher , in a solemn tone .
I thought I had scratched it , so that nobody could make it out .
"
" Meet me here at this hour to - morrow evening , and I will answer you .
No more !
Not a word more to - night .
"
He had been so deeply engaged in this conference , that he had not perceived their departure .
The watch - chain had not deceived the gipsy , for Archer was the richest person in the community .
" I scorn to take advantage of a hasty moment ; but since last night you have had time to consider .
Am I your manager ?
About ten of the most reasonable of the assembly declared their gratitude and high approbation of their old friend , De Grey ; but the numbers were in favour of the new friend .
The judicious reader will apprehend that I allude to the persons called day scholars .
The carpenter , De Grey ' s friend , was discarded by Archer , for having said " LACK - A - DAISY !
" Upon this principle Mr . Chip set to work with all possible alacrity .
I do not think proper to give my reasons for these orders ; but you who KNOW me ," said the doctor , and his eye turned towards De Grey , " will not suspect me of caprice .
To the dead silence with which these orders were received , succeeded in a few minutes a universal groan .
This , you see , is a stroke at me and my party , and I won ' t bear it .
Remember my majority this morning , and your theatre last night .
I won ' t be made a fool of by a few soft words .
We never heard of parties till you came amongst us .
Did not you want to be manager ?
"
I ' ll tell you , Mr . Chip ," said Archer , lowering his voice , " what you must do for me , my good fellow .
" Ay , ay !
" said Archer , knowing that he had been cheated , and yet proud of managing a carpenter , " ay , ay !
'"
" They had heard of such a thing , but they had only heard of it .
" cried Archer , " that ' s the way we are always to be governed by a man in a wig , who says he has good reasons , and can ' t tell them .
Who goes first ?
" I will have nothing to do with ye , if ye are resolved to be slaves !
" " We won ' t be slaves !
" they all exclaimed at once .
Dr . Johnson mentions that Addison , while under the tuition of Mr . Shaw , master of the Lichfield Grammar School , led , and successfully conducted , " a plan for BARRING OUT his master .
"
In the Gentleman ' s Magazine of 1828 , Dr . P . A . Nuttall , under the signature of II .
The arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager , to whom they all pledged implicit obedience .
Obedience , it seems , is necessary , even from rebels to their ringleaders ; not reasonable , but implicit obedience .
Scarcely had the assembly adjourned to the Ball - alley , when Fisher , with an important length of face , came up to the manager , and desired to speak one word to him .
Who is ' YOU KNOW WHO ?
" No ; but you don ' t TAKE me ," said Fisher ; " you don ' t TAKE me .
With these instructions Archer put his watch into the solemn dupe ' s hand , and left him to count the seconds , till the moment of his appointment , whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle .
Proud of his secret commission , Fisher slouched his hat , he knew not why , over his face , and proceeded towards the appointed spot .
To keep , as he had been charged by Archer , within the letter of the law , he stood BEHIND the forbidden building , and waited some minutes .
lost !
"
His Aunt Barbara ' s interdiction had shut him out of the confectioner ' s shop ; but he flattered himself that he could outwit his aunt ; he therefore begged the gipsy to procure him twelve buns by Thursday morning , and bring them secretly to one of the windows of the schoolroom .
My mouth waters for the buns , and have ' em I must now .
Fisher , pray did you ever buy the candles for the playhouse ?
"
They were at supper when he returned .
The long expected moment at length arrived .
"-- in which he was joined by all the party most manfully -- by all but the poor Greybeard , who , the picture of astonishment , stood stock still in the midst of them with his books under his arm ; at which spectacle Townsend , who enjoyed the FROLIC of the fray more than anything else , burst into an immoderate fit of laughter .
It ' s a pity that the king of the Greybeards is not here to admire me .
I ' m your manager !
Greybeard , I ' ve knocked Greybeard down here in the scuffle .
" No , no ," cried Townsend , " evil communication corrupts good manners .
" cried Townsend , " let Greybeards think of to - morrow ; Mr .
But at the moment that the cups were at their lips , and as Archer bowed to thank the company , a sudden shower from above astonished the whole assembly .
"
" Mercy upon us !
" exclaimed Fisher .
were ye never in the dark before ?
You are not afraid of a shower of rain , I hope .
"
" No ," said they , with a faint laugh , " but what shall we do here in the dark all night long , and all day to - morrow ?
We can ' t unbar the shutters .
The trap - door had indeed escaped the manager ' s observation .
* The light appeared .
" cried a third ; " mercy !
" Bread !
"
"
Begin , Townsend --
It would not do .
Dr . Middleton had probably considered this in the choice he made of his first attack .
The room had been built high to admit a free circulation of air .
" It is well they have somebody to think for them .
Now if I wanted -- which , thank goodness , I don ' t -- but if I did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance , whom could I pitch upon ?
"
" Come , Townsend , waken , my boy !
up !
" Diversion !
I ' m up -- UP TO ANYTHING .
They crowded under the penthouse as soon as it was ready , and their admiration of its ingenuity paid the workmen for the job .
" There it is !
" cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before .
" interrupted Archer ; " no , that I won ' t , for you or the gipsy either ; but I have heard enough to get your buns without that .
I must think for ye all , I see , regularly .
The morning had been very long , and Archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply .
Did not I set to work for you at sunrise ?
Did not I earn it by my own ingenuity from that selfish dunce " ( pointing to Fisher ), " who could never have gotten one of his twelve buns , if I had not shown him how ?
Traitors !
The Archers scrambled for it , and Fisher ate it .
" said Townsend ; " it was an excellent joke !
" Pooh !
" Never mind , Mr . Archer , if you are thinking about me ," said the little boy , trying gently to pull his hands from his face .
coward !
The commanding air with which Archer spoke and looked , and the belief that the little boy deserved his protection , silenced the crowd .
Some sat in a corner , whispering their wishes that Archer would unbar the doors , and give up .
It was at length resolved that at all events they WOULD HOLD OUT .
With this determination they stretched themselves again to sleep , for the second night , in weak and weary obstinacy .
Don ' t be angry .
" His hands are free !
"
" cried Archer , with a look of ineffable contempt ; " you reptile !-- YOUR party ?
"
" That ' s right , Townsend ," said Archer , " laugh on , my boy !
"
Don ' t tie him ," was feebly raised .
Their curiosity increased as their hunger diminished .
Does Dr . Middleton know ?
"
That ' s a noble fellow !
" added he , pointing to Archer .
Not so Fisher , whose memory was upon this occasion very distinct .
I say , we ' d better all be flogged at once , which must be the end of it sooner or later , than wait here to be without dinner , breakfast , and supper , all only because Mr . Archer won ' t give up because of his honour and nonsense !
friend !
" Pull away !
Fill the bag , then .
" And you , Townsend ," said Archer , " may look like a wit , if you will ; but you will never be a hero .
I ' m not a tyrant .
Bless us all , Archer !
My Aunt Barbara , for one , would be AT HIM long before that time was out ; and besides , you know , in that case , he ' d be hanged for murder , which is quite another thing , in law , from a BARRING OUT , you know .
This half - hour the gardener has made nearly a hour .
" De Grey !
" interrupted Townsend ; " are heroes allowed to change sides , pray ?
"
"
" replied De Grey .
" Yes , with circumstances ," replied Archer ; " but right or wrong , as long as I think it honourable to do so and so , I ' m satisfied .
" But you cannot think anything honourable , or the contrary ," observed De Grey , " without reasoning ; and as to what you call feeling , it ' s only a quick sort of reasoning .
" We are apt to reason best when we are not in quite so great a hurry .
"
"
" No ," replied Archer ; " but I should never have thought of heading a Barring Out , if he had not shown partiality ; and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery , which would have been quite natural , and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge , there would have been none of this work .
" Not quite .
"
But , alas !
VENGEANCE never looks to the FUTURE , but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past .
" Yes , I see that you have broken my windows ; that is a small evil .
" Name it yourself ," said Dr . Middleton , " and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment .
" Sir ," said Archer , " I brought five guineas with me to school .
" You shall return from the playground , all of you ," said Dr . Middleton , " one quarter of an hour sooner , for two months to come , than the rest of your companions .
" De Grey , you were in the right ," whispered Archer , " and it was I that was UNJUST .
"
" I know he had , but he chose to apply it to his private use , and gave it to the gipsy to buy twelve buns for his own eating .
When the people in the shop refused to let Mr . Fisher have the things without paying for them , he made use of De Grey ' s name , who was known there .
As for you , Mr . Fisher , depart ; you must never return hither again .
How unsteady were the last steps to these tables !
Till this moment everyone thought herself secure of success ; and the heart , which exulted with hope , now palpitated with fear .
Cecilia was behind her companions , on the highest row .
The head , which she placed in the socket , fell from the shoulders , and rolled , bounding along the gravel walk .
At any other time they would have been more inclined to cry with Louisa ; but Cecilia had just been successful , and sympathy with the victorious often makes us forget justice .
" Poor Louisa !
Her thoughts were discomposed , and her mind was running upon something else .
Cecilia ' s companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip , and painted a peach , better than they , yet that they could play as well , and keep their tempers better ; for she was discomposed .
They were dancing in a round upon the grass .
Louisa silently let go her companion ' s hand , and , quitting the dance , ran up to Leonora to inquire what was the matter with her .
The injury , however , Louisa had already forgotten .
" No ," said Louisa , mysteriously , " I am not eating them .
"
" Oh , as to that , Cecilia , you know I need not answer you unless I choose it ; not but what I would if you would only ask me civilly , and if you would not call me CHILD .
" Why should not I call you child ?
"
" How ?
" Let me go , let me go !
" cried Louisa , struggling .
"
" You don ' t , don ' t you ?
" cried Cecilia , provoked , and , catching the hat from Louisa , she flung the strawberries over the hedge .
stop !
" cried Louisa , breaking through them ; and , rushing up to Leonora , she threw her hat at her feet , and panting for breath --" It was full -- almost full of my own strawberries ," said she , " the first I ever got out of my garden .
" said everyone , at once running up to her .
Cecilia !
" Come , and I will get you some more strawberries .
" Oh , I don ' t mind the strawberries , indeed ; but I wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you .
There she is !
" She ' s very sorry ; are not you , Cecilia ?
how I love you !
" Go , my dear , and I ' ll come presently .
"
So don ' t stay , now .
At this instant , Mrs . Villars came out to enjoy the serenity of the evening , and , passing by the arbour where Cecilia lay , she started .
Cecilia rose hastily .
"
"
" Why , what keeps you here , my dear ?
Where are your companions ?
You know that when I ask you to tell me anything as your friend , I never punish you as your governess ; therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter .
"
The prize was for the most assiduous , not for the most amiable .
"
Mrs . Villars , smiling ,--" Why , what do you think yourself , Cecilia ?
You are good - natured , Cecilia ; for you are desirous to oblige and serve your companions -- to gain them praise , and save them from blame -- to give them pleasure , and relieve them from pain ; but Leonora is good - tempered , for she can bear with their foibles , and acknowledge her own .
"
But you must not expect to succeed all at once .
I repeat it to you , for habit must be counteracted by habit .
" A bad heart ,-- my dear !
"
Ambition she knew to be its most powerful incentive .
In consequence of this reasoning , Cecilia formed a design of proposing to her companions that they should give a prize , the first of the ensuing month ( the lst of June ), to the most amiable .
For it is habit which confers ease ; and without ease , even in moral actions , there can be no grace .
Of this they bitterly complained , and unanimously entreated that it might be cut to fit them .
" How foolish !
This was the fundamental error of her mind ; it arose in a great measure from her early education .
This brother was some years older than Cecilia , but he had always been the favourite companion of her youth .
Cecilia ' s colour was red , Leonora ' s white .
They were both sitting together in Louisa ' s room .
Downstairs they ran immediately , to ask Mrs . Villars ' permission to bring him into the hall .
" said Cecilia , shutting the drawer of lockets which tempted her most , " these are not the things which I want .
It had besides , a small lock in the middle .
" said Cecilia , eagerly .
" Could you let me look at it ?
Alas !
" Yes , miss , the very same ," replied the peddler , who , during this time , had been examining the little box out of which Cecilia had taken her money -- it was of silver .
" No ," said Cecilia hastily , blushing a little , and stretching out her hand to receive it .
I didn ' t hear you come in ; but what have you got there ?
Leonora unscrewed it .
" Goodness !
"
You know that I bought this box just now of the peddler .
"
" Oh , but this is a great deal prettier and larger than that .
Leonora , who was just quitting the room , turned her head back , and gave Louisa a look , which silenced her .
and I have concealed it too , and have been making a parade of my generosity .
She began to compare her conduct with that of others of her own age ; and at length , fixing her comparison upon her brother George , as the companion of whom , from her infancy , she had been habitually the most emulous , she recollected that an almost similar circumstance had once happened to him , and that he had not only escaped disgrace , but had acquired glory , by an intrepid confession of his fault .
Her father ' s word to her brother , on the occasion , she also perfectly recollected .
She willingly believed that the observation extended equally to both sexes , and flattered herself that she should exceed her brother in merit if she owned a fault , which she thought that it would be so much more difficult to confess .
Leonora or I shall win it .
If it were but to - morrow , or yesterday , or any day but this , I would not hesitate ; but now I am almost certain of the prize , and if I win it -- well , why then I will -- I think I will tell all -- yes I will ; I am determined ," said Cecilia .
" Surely ," said she to herself , " if Cecilia had done that which I suspect , she would not , she could not , look as she does .
Whose , then , will it be ?
" I see that it is not yet decided ," said Mrs . Villars ; and immediately they ran upstairs , amidst confused whisperings .
" How can she be so happy !
" Come in ," said Louisa ; " I ' m not asleep .
" Yes , if I could I would choose both of you ," said Louisa , " but you know I can only choose which I like the best .
And it would really mortify her to lose this prize -- you know that she proposed it herself .
It has been her object for this month past , and I am sure she has taken great pains to obtain it .
"
"
" The time is now come ," said Cecilia ; " in a few moments all will be decided .
How shall I beg Leonora to forgive me ?
They are gone to seek for her .
They most of them ran forwards to Cecilia .
" said Cecilia , eagerly , " who begins ?
You have not it in your power to give the prize to Leonora .
It is yours .
You have forgotten Louisa .
" She put it into Cecilia ' s hand .
"
" Louisa !
"

" The children are busied in various ways .
"
He taught him , that to make a GOOD BARGAIN was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of ; to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence .
Upon these occasions , our fisherman always forgot , or neglected to count , the hours and days which were wasted in waiting for a fair wind to put to sea , or angling in vain on the shore .
" He is smart and quick enough , but he is always in mischief .
" Whenever he casts my nets , they never come up empty .
' It is better to be lucky than wise .
" As old as Francisco , and older by six months ," said Piedro .
Venture a small fish , as the proverb says , to catch a great one .
"
He positively asserted to all who looked at his fish , that they were just fresh out of the water .
" Not before MY FATHER thinks I have done enough , but before I think so myself ," replied Francisco .
" And my father ," said Francisco .
He will buy no more fish from you , because he will be afraid of your cheating him ; but he will be ready enough to buy fruit from me , because he will know I shall not cheat him -- so you ' ll have lost a customer , and I gained one .
* see anted .
" And you have never considered , then ," said Francisco , " that all these people will , one after another , find you out in time ?
" Next summer is not come yet ; there is time enough to think what I shall do before next summer comes .
In Naples , are there not a hundred ways of making money for a smart lad like me ?
as my father says .
Would they be hard to deal with , think you ?
" I don ' t doubt them .
Then IN TIME I could , you know , change my trade -- sell chips and sticks in the wood - market -- hand about the lemonade to the fine folks , or twenty other things .
" said Piedro , angrily .
When I am found out for what I am , or when the worst comes to the worst , I can drive a stupid ass , with his panniers filled with rubbish , as well as you do now , HONEST FRANCISCO .
The foreign servant lad , to whom Francisco had so honestly , or , as Piedro said , so sillily , shown the bruised side of the melon , was an Englishman .
fine fresh fish !
He lost more by not selling his fish to these people than he had gained the day before by cheating the ENGLISH BOOBY .
"
" So they are ," said Franscisco , " but you said so yesterday , when they were not ; and he that was duped then , is not ready to believe you to - day .
Here ; this vine , this fig - tree , and a melon a week next summer shall be yours .
He pursued his scheme of imposing , as far as he could , upon every person he dealt with ; and the consequence was , that at last nobody would deal with him .
" It is easy to outwit one person , but impossible to outwit all the world ," said a man * who knew the world at least as well as either Piedro or his father .
"
Piedro ' s father , amongst others , had reason to complain .
He saw his own customers fall off from him , and was told , whenever he went into the market , that his son was such a cheat there was no dealing with him .
"
A very great rogue * was once heard to say , that he would , with all his heart , give ten thousand pounds for a good character , because he knew that he could make twenty thousand by it .
" Well , don ' t be angry that I asked the question ; it was only from fear of getting you into disgrace that I asked it .
" Ay , to be sure ; that would be still better ," said Piedro , observing that Francisco , as he uttered his last sentence , was separating the grapes and other fruits into two equal divisions .
You would find me no bad hand , if you were to try , and take me into partnership .
"
" But won ' t you ?
" said Piedro , in a supplicating tone ; " CAN ' T you have thoughts of it ?
"
" Adieu , I wish you well with all my heart ; but I must leave you now , or I shall be too late for the market .
All seemed disposed to believe in his intended reformation , and to give him a fair trial .
" I make but a few shillings a day , and this is but slow work ," said he to himself .
Light gains , and frequent , make a heavy purse , * was one of Francisco ' s proverbs .
what have we here ?
"
Here ' s for myself , and here ' s for my sister ' s share ," said he , laying down his money ; " and now for the burnt almonds gratis , my good fellow .
"
"
" I give you full measure , as I give to everybody .
"
" The eye often deceives us ;" said Piedro .
that concerns all who love sugar - plums .
" We have bought ," and " We have bought of those sugar - plums ," cried several little voices at once , " if you mean Piedro ' s .
" My discovery is ," said Carlo , " that you , none of you , know Piedro .
* Chi et FA pi caress che non vole , O ingannato t ' ha , o inganuar et vole .
" Is this Piedro a relation of yours ?
" I am sorry , if he be , that I have published his disgrace , for I would not hurt YOU .
" You have a measure for sugar - plums ; and we have all agreed to refer to that , and to see how much we have been cheated before we go to break Piedro ' s bench and declare him bankrupt , *-- the punishment for all knaves .
The little Neapolitan merchants will have no knaves amongst them !
He is a bankrupt in honesty .
There was a prodigious number , more than would have filled many honest measures , scattered upon the ground and trampled under foot by the crowd .
It was , after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for Piedro , hung up in a conspicuous part of the market - place ; and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners .
Piedro could never more show his face in this market , and all hopes of friendship -- all hopes of partnership with Francisco -- were for ever at an end .
When the mob had dispersed , after satisfying themselves with executing summary justice upon Piedro ' s bench and board , Francisco found a carpenter ' s rule lying upon the ground near Piedro ' s broken bench , which he recollected to have seen in the hands of Carlo .
It was given to me for having measured the work and made up the bill of a whole pleasure - boat myself .
By - the - by , I can make up for you a fruit stall .
" Oh , never fear ," replied Carlo , laughing .
"
I know it is ready by this time .
Oh , I see we must be good friends , just made for each other ; so come in -- no ceremony .
Carlo was not mistaken in his predictions ; he and Francisco became very good friends , spent all their leisure hours together , either in Carlo ' s workshop or in Francisco ' s vineyard , and they mutually improved each other .
Francisco , before he saw his friend ' s rule , knew but just enough of arithmetic to calculate in his head the price of the fruit which he sold in the market ; but with Carlo ' s assistance , and the ambition to understand the tables and figures upon the wonderful rule , he set to work in earnest , and in due time , satisfied both himself and his master .
" A word to the wise will always suffice .
Here the carpenter , just as he was going to pronounce a fresh panegyric upon his favourite trigonometry , was interrupted by the sudden entrance of his little daughter Rosetta , all in tears : a very unusual spectacle , for , taking the year round , she shed fewer tears than any child of her age in Naples .
" And were these shells the cause of the tears ?
" Yes ; for I thought you and Francisco , brother , would like to have them for your nice grotto that you are making at Resina .
That was the reason I was in such a hurry to get them .
'
" said her brother .
" Should you know any one of your pieces of wood again if you were to see them ?
" It had a notch at one end of it , where one of the carpenters cut it off from another piece of wood for me .
" said Francisco .
" We can go to it ," said Francisco , " and I hope we shall recover your basketful .
On their part , her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her , and exclaimed , " That they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them ; that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little Rosetta , who was always ready to give to others , and to help them in making up their loads .
stop !
I hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood , Mr .
Baker ?
" With all my heart ," said Piedro , still maintaining an unmoved countenance , and they returned immediately to the little wood - market .
The prisoner was sentenced never more to sell wood in the market ; and the moment sentence was pronounced , Piedro was hissed and hooted out of the market - place .
We shall not dwell upon all his petty methods of cheating in the trades he next attempted .
They had been borrowed from an old woman , who hired out glasses to the boys who sold lemonade .
Don ' t you remember , Carlo , how you and even Rosetta laughed at me the first time your father put a pencil into my awkward , clumsy hands ?
"
How richly have you and your father rewarded me for returning this rule !
" You must come with me to Carlo ' s , and see how I spend my evenings ; then complain of me , if you can .
"
It was the utmost stretch of Arthur ' s complaisance to pay this visit ; but , in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper , he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous Carlo and the playful Rosetta .
"
"
Arthur carried off the drawings , and one day , when his master was better than usual , and when he was at leisure , eating a dessert of Francisco ' s grapes , he entered respectfully , with his little portfolio under his arm , and begged permission to show his master a few drawings done by the gardener ' s son , whose grapes he was eating .
*
About fifty years ago , in a poor man ' s garden at Resina , a hole in a well about thirty feet below the surface of the earth was observed .
The streets branched out in many directions , and , lying across them , the workmen often found large pieces of timber , beams , and rafters ; some broken in the fall , others entire .
** Philosophical Transactions , vol .
Signor Camillo made no difficulties ; he was pleased with his pupil ' s appearance , and every day he liked him better and better .
Signor Camillo , the first day he came into this room with his pupil , said to him , " Here are many valuable books and drawings , young man .
I trust , from the character I have heard of you , that they will be perfectly safe here .
" What !
"
"
I am now sure of your having the one , and let me see whether you have , as I believe you have , the other .
"
His confidence in Francisco was much increased by this circumstance , slight as it may appear .
He was employed , as soon as he had gratified his curiosity , in drawing .
The carpenter had unluckily appointed to settle a long account that day with one of his employers , and he could not accompany his children .
" Yes , all the way most willingly ," cried Francisco , " that I may have the pleasure of giving to your father , with my own hands , this fine bunch of grapes , that I have reserved for him out of my own share .
" Add this fine pine - apple for my share , then ," said his father , " and a pleasant walk to you , my young friends .
They proceeded gaily along , and when they reached Naples , as they passed through the square where the little merchants held their market , Francisco pointed to the spot where he found Carlo ' s rule .
The hat was dropped just as Francisco and his two friends came under the piazza .
He fixed his eyes upon Francisco , then glanced at Carlo and Rosetta , and after a moment ' s consideration he began a story which bore some resemblance to one that our young English readers may , perhaps , know by the name of " Cornaro , or the Grateful Turk .
At the end of the story , when the speaker ' s voice stopped , there was a momentary silence , which was broken by the orator himself , who exclaimed , as he took up the hat which lay at his feet , " My friends , here is some mistake !
this is not my hat ; it has been changed whilst I was taken up with my story .
"
Most excellent players at hide - and - seek you would make .
" If they are friends , they can wait ," said Piedro .
" You need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now , I can tell you ; for I am , as I always told you I should be , the richest man of the two .
"
"
Francisco did not consider that those who have habits of pilfering continue to practise them often , when the poverty which first tempted them to dishonesty ceases .
I have friends in Naples , and I call myself Piedro the Lucky .
" This does not smell of fish , does it ?
Neither do I sell sugar - plums to children : nor do I slave myself in a vineyard , like some folks ; but fortune , when I least expected it , has stood my friend .
" That I wish you joy of your prosperity , and hope you may enjoy it long and well .
" *
*
Not to leave our readers longer in suspense , we must inform them that the peasants of Resina were right in their suspicions .
After he was banished from the little wood - market for stealing Rosetta ' s basketful of wood , after he had cheated the poor woman , who let glasses out to hire , out of the value of the glasses which he broke , and , in short , after he had entirely lost his credit with all who knew him , he roamed about the streets of Naples , reckless of what became of him .
" No equivocations !
"
Concern yourself no more about it .
"
Piedro , though familiarized to the idea of fraud , was shocked at the thought of becoming a robber by profession .
Whether Piedro had power to stop , or whether he was hurried on by his associates , we shall , for the present , leave in doubt .
CHAPTER IV
By his unremitting perseverance , he improved himself rapidly under the instructions of his master and friend , Signor Camillo ; his friend , we say , for the fair and open character of Francisco won , or rather earned , the friendship of this benevolent artist .
" And a good man , papa ," said Rosetta ; " for though he has grown so great , and though he goes into palaces now , to say nothing of that place underground , where he has leave to go , yet , notwithstanding all this , he never forgets my brother Carlo and you .
The peasants -- men , women and children , who had come with their pitchers to draw water at this well -- were held at bay by the enraged female .
Francisco ' s father and mother , more prudent than the generality of their neighbours , went to the house of a relation , at some miles ' distance from Vesuvius , and carried with them all their effects .
He related all the facts that he had heard to Arthur , who , not having been , like the inhabitants of Resina , familiarized to the idea of living in the vicinity of a burning mountain , and habituated to trust in St . Januarius , was sufficiently alarmed by Francisco ' s representations .
The house will certainly be ransacked before morning ," said the old carpenter to Francisco , who was at his house giving him an account of their flight .
It is all over with Resina !
What was the surprise and joy of the poor firework - maker when he saw Francisco return from this dangerous expedition !
" said the count to Francisco , " I thank you , and shall not limit my gratitude to thanks .
You tell me that there is danger of my villa being pillaged by robbers .
As soon as the count left the hall , the stranger came up to Francisco .
"
" Tears from my eyes ?
" repeated Francisco , smiling ; " I have shed but few tears .
"
My ode was to have been set to music , and to have been performed at his villa near Torre del Greco , if these troubles had not intervened .
Now that the mountain is quiet again , people will return to their senses .
I still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings , and I shall sound your praises through Naples in a poem I mean to recite on the late eruption of Mount Vesuvius .
" said a man , pushing his way through the crowd .
" Ha !
" repeated the lad with disdain .
" Your hat is very safe , I promise you ; I shall not touch it .
"
" The Count de Flora has promised him a liberal portion of all the fine furniture , plate and jewels that can be saved from his villa at Torre del Greco .
That robbery was not discovered ; and his success , as he called it , hardened him in guilt .
He was both unwilling and unable to withdraw himself from the bad company with whom his ill gotten wealth connected him .
He did not consider that bad company leads to the gallows .
"
" None other ; none but this ," cried his companion , with an oath .
You don ' t require to be reminded of what I said to you when we were alone just now ?
You were in the street with me the night I let off that unlucky rocket , which frightened the horses , and was the cause of overturning a lady ' s coach .
" I have a confused recollection of some such thing ," said Piedro , in great embarrassment ; and he looked suspiciously at this man , in doubt whether he was cunning , and wanted to sound him , or whether he was so simple as he appeared .
" You did not , perhaps , hear , then ," continued the man , " that there was a great search made , after the overturn , for a fine diamond cross , belonging to the lady in the carriage ?
"
The man ' s curiosity was excited , and his suspicions of Piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance .
Piedro felt for the leaden image of the saint , which he wore round his neck .
" I am ," said the man .
He was going there to speak to the countess about some artificial flowers ; but Piedro thought he was going to speak to her about the diamond cross .
They will set out five hours hence .
With all possible expedition he ran to the count ' s palace in Naples , and related to him all that had been said by Piedro .
"
They waited , much against Arthur ' s inclination , a considerable time for these sbirri .
" Oh !
" Ay ," said they , as he went by , " his father encouraged him in cheating when he was BUT A CHILD ; and see what he is come to , now he is a man !
His wound was soon healed .
To Mr . Lee , the English gentleman , he offered one of his own drawings -- a fruit - piece .
" I like this very well ," said Arthur , as he examined the drawing , " but I should like this melon better if it was a little bruised .
"
TARLTON .
Young Hardy was educated by Mr . Freeman , a very excellent master , at one of our rural Sunday schools .
The arms of the combatants tired that they could scarcely wield the battledores .
For another minute the victory was doubtful ; but at length the setting sun , shining full in Loveit ' s face , so dazzled his eyes that he could no longer see the shuttlecock , and it fell at his feet .
he ' s the best natured fellow in the world !
" Am I ?
"
" Of doing wrong !
" Indeed , though ," cried Loveit , piqued , " THERE you ' re mistaken , for I could refuse if I chose it .
Hardy smiled ; and Loveit , half afraid of his contempt , and half afraid of Tarlton ' s ridicule , stood doubtful , and again had recourse to his battledore , which he balanced most curiously upon his forefinger .
"
I had better go back , and just tell them that I ' m very sorry I can ' t get their shuttlecock ; do come back with me .
" What ?
Regardless of this confusion , Tarlton continued , " But before I say any more , I hope we have no spies amongst us .
" Each boy gave his hand and his promise ; repeating , " Stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you .
"
Do , pray , give up this scheme .
" What scheme , man ?
"
Everything was silent .
" Ah ," said he to himself , " how quietly he sleeps !
Nor was he in the least avaricious , for though he was not rich , he had enough to live upon , because he had been very industrious in his youth ; and he was always very ready to part with the little he had .
If anything would have made him angry , it would have been the seeing his favourite tree robbed , as he had promised himself the pleasure of giving his red apples to his grandchildren on his birthday .
"
At last , torn and terrified , he got through the hedge and ran home , despising his companions for their selfishness .
" said he .
is there anything strange in that ?
" Hardy would not have served me so , however ," said Loveit , turning away in disgust .
" I forgive it with all my heart ," said he ; " but I cannot forget it so soon !
" Loveit smiled , and allowed that he certainly could not bear malice .
"
" I can ' t come now ," said Loveit , drawing away his arm .
" exclaimed Loveit .
" And is it for the dog ?
"
" Only poison for A DOG ," said Tarlton , confused ; " you could not look more shocking if it was poison for a Christian .
" Tarlton ," said he at last , in a changed tone and altered manner , " I did not know you ; I will have no more to do with you .
" Let go my arm -- you were in earnest .
" But then that was before I knew there was any harm .
If you think there ' s any harm ?
" IF ," said Loveit .
" I ' ll ask nobody !
Surely we know better what ' s right and wrong than Tom does .
"
"
" asked he , in an inquiring manner , fixing his eyes upon him .
" WELL !
" said Loveit to himself , " else he could not whistle .
About ten minutes after this , as he and Hardy were undressing , Hardy suddenly recollected that he had left his new kite out upon the grass .
" Call Tom ," said Loveit , " and bid him bring it in for you in a minute .
" said Hardy , after he had been watching some time ; " why don ' t you come to bed ?
" exclaimed Loveit aloud , with an emotion which he could not command .
to do what ?
" How cruel !
" continued Loveit .
" I will not betray you , trust to me ," said Hardy : and he left the room , and Loveit stood in amazement ; while , in the meantime , Hardy , in hopes of overtaking Tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided , ran with all possible speed across the meadow , then down the lane .
Hardy , too much out of breath to speak , seized hold of him , dragged him down , detaining him with a firm grasp , whilst he panted for utterance .
"
Tom was terrified lest the old man should come out to see what was the matter ; his strength forsook him , and flinging the handkerchief and meat over the hedge , he ran away with all his speed .
Full of the pleasure of successful benevolence , Hardy tripped joyfully home , and vaulted over the window sill , when the first object he beheld was Mr . Power , the usher , standing at the head of the stairs , with his candle in his hand .
Hardy ?
what next ?
" Poisoned !
Still Hardy was silent .
" As I do now , sir ," said Hardy , unmoved .
Better and better !
Saying these words , he pulled Hardy along a narrow passage to a small closet , set apart for desperate offenders , and usually known by the name of the BLACK HOLE .
At this instant the prisoner was led in , and as he passed through the circle , every eye was fixed upon him .
"
" Hardy !
"
I have never had anything to do with thieves ," cried Hardy , indignantly .
" No , sir ; I do not .
It was torn almost to pieces ; but luckily the corner that was marked remained .
" cried Mr . Trueman .
It ' s very hard I ' m to be flogged more than they !
"
Hardy looked as if he wished to speak .
" Gentlemen ," said the old man , with a faltering voice , " it wasn ' t for the sake of my apples that I spoke ; and you , sir ," said he to Hardy , " I thank you for saving my dog .
She taught them to dislike idleness , and to wish that they could be useful .
One evening , as they were standing beside her , the little boy said to her , " Grandmother ," for that was the name by which she liked that these children should call her --" grandmother , how often you are forced to get up from your spinning - wheel , and to follow the chaises and coaches up that steep hill , to put stones underneath the wheels , to hinder them from rolling back !
" Yes , child .
A great many carriages happened to go by this day , and the little girl received a great many halfpence .
" But , Paul my boy ," said she , " what is the matter with your hand ?
" So do I , my dear Anne ," said the old woman ; " for I mean that you and your brother shall have all the money that you get to - morrow .
"
" whispered little Anne .
He followed it up the hill ; and the instant the postillion called to him , and bid him stop the wheels , he put his scotcher behind them , and found that it answered the purpose perfectly well .
Many carriages went by this day , and Paul and Anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers .
"
"
First they began by counting what was in the hat --" One , two , three , four halfpence .
" said Anne , who had never seen a guinea in her life before , and who did not know its value ; " and will it do as well as a halfpenny to buy gingerbread ?
" No , no ," said Paul , " you need not ask any woman , or anybody but me ; I can tell you all about it , as well as anybody in the whole world .
" If she has so many , and if we like to have so many , to be sure she will ," said Paul , " but I think we should not like to have two hundred and fifty - two dozen of plums ; we could not eat such a number .
" But we could give some of them to my grandmother ," said Anne .
But , Paul , how shall we buy a blanket ?
"
Hush !
"
"
" My dear , honest children ," said she , " I am very glad you told me all this .
Those who threw it you gave it you by mistake , I warrant ; and what I would have you do is , to go to Dunstable , and try if you can , at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you .
It is now so late in the evening that perhaps the travellers will sleep at Dunstable , instead of going on the next stage ; and it is likely that whosoever gave you a guinea instead of a halfpenny has found out their mistake by this time .
I remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels : and I remember I read the innkeeper ' s name upon the chaise , ' John Nelson .
' ( I am much obliged to you for teaching me to read , grandmother .
It was John Nelson .
Anne and her brother passed with great courage the tempting stall that was covered with gingerbread and ripe plums , and pursued their way steadily through the streets of Dunstable ; but Paul , when he came to the shop where he had seen the blanket , stopped for a moment , and said , " It is a great pity , Anne , that the guinea is not ours .
Paul pushed forward , through a crowded passage , till he got into the inn - yard .
The waiter was at this instant luckily obliged to leave them to attend the bell ; and Paul told his business to the hostler , who as soon as he saw the guinea and heard the story , shook Paul by the hand , and said , " Stand steady , my honest lad ; I ' ll find the chaise for you , if it is to be found here ; but John Nelson ' s chaises almost always drive to the ' Black Bull .
"
The postillion made no reply , but looked vexed , and went towards the house , desiring the children would wait in the passage till his return .
A man who was pushing his way in , and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole , impatient at being stopped , kicked down the straw basket , and all its contents were thrown out .
"
"

" When they come to their wine ," added she , " I ' ll speak a good word for you , and get you called in afore the children are sent to bed .
The landlady , after the usual speech of , " I hope the supper and everything is to your liking , ladies and gentlemen ," began with , " If any of the young gentlemen or ladies would have a CUR ' OSITY to see any of our famous Dunstable straw - work , there ' s a decent body without would , I daresay , be proud to show them her pincushion - boxes , and her baskets and slippers , and her other CUR ' OSITIES .
" Yes , my dear ," said her father , " but these slippers are meant --"
" No , I cannot indulge myself ," said her father , " in buying them now .
I should think , if she had been an honest girl , she would have returned it .
" I ' ll go for them myself ," said the good natured basket - woman ; " I bid them wait in the street yonder , for my mind misgave me that the man who spoke so short to them was a cheat , with his larks and his claret .
Paul and Anne were speedily summoned , and brought back by their friend the basket - woman ; and Anne , the moment she saw the gentleman , knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her , who admired her brother ' s scotcher , and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat ; but she could not be certain , she said , that she received the guinea from him ; she only thought it most likely that she did .
" The gentleman in the white parlour , sir , do you mean ?
" He is a Mr . Pembroke , sir ," said the waiter .
that you got from this child ; that guinea which you said I ordered you to ask for from this child .
The servant , confounded and half intoxicated , could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him , and that he really did not know which it was .
She had the rheumatism sadly last winter , sir ; and there is a blanket in this street that would be just the thing for her .
"
" She shall have it , then ; and ," continued the gentleman , " I will do something more for you .
" We like to have something to do always , if we could , sir ," said Paul ; " but we are forced to be idle sometimes , because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we CAN do well .
"
" said Anne .
If I find that they are , I will do something more for you .
" It is a fine moonlight night ," said the basket - woman ; " and is not far .

" Silly Mansoul swallowed it without chewing , as if it had been a sprat in the mouth of a whale .
" That sea beast Leviathan , which God of all his works Created hugest that swim the ocean stream .
---" There Leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , in the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his breath spouts out a sea .

The whale is doubtless the largest animal in creation .
" -- COWPER , ON THE QUEEN ' S VISIT TO LONDON .
" The aorta of a whale is larger in the bore than the main pipe of the water - works at London Bridge , and the water roaring in its passage through that pipe is inferior in impetus and velocity to the blood gushing from the whale ' s heart .
" In the free element beneath me swam , Floundered and dived , in play , in chace , in battle , Fishes of every colour , form , and kind ; Which language cannot paint , and mariner Had never seen ; from dread Leviathan To insect millions peopling every wave : Gather ' d in shoals immense , like floating islands , Led by mysterious instincts through that waste And trackless region , though on every side Assaulted by voracious enemies , Whales , sharks , and monsters , arm ' d in front or jaw , With swords , saws , spiral horns , or hooked fangs .
" The papers were brought in , and we saw in the Berlin Gazette that whales had been introduced on the stage there .

" Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous tail in the air , which , cracking like a whip , resounds to the distance of three or four miles .
...
It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting , and , in a commercial point of view , so important an animal ( as the Sperm Whale ) should have been so entirely neglected , or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous , and many of them competent observers , that of late years , must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes .

Strange !
Inlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues -- north , east , south , and west .
Once more .
Take almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .
There stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke .
But that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans .
And as for going as cook ,-- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship - board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ;-- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will .
No , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the forecastle , aloft there to the royal mast - head .
Again , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of .
On the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .
The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us .
" GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES .
By reason of these things , then , the whaling voyage was welcome ; the great flood - gates of the wonder - world swung open , and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose , two and two there floated into my inmost soul , endless processions of the whale , and , mid most of them all , one grand hooded phantom , like a snow hill in the air .
It was a Saturday night in December .
I knew no one in the place .
get away from before the door ; your patched boots are stopping the way .
But presently I came to a smoky light proceeding from a low , wide building , the door of which stood invitingly open .
It had a careless look , as if it were meant for the uses of the public ; so , entering , the first thing I did was to stumble over an ash - box in the porch .
Ha !
It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet .
Coffin ?-- Spouter ?-- Rather ominous in that particular connexion , thought I .
" In judging of that tempestuous wind called Euroclydon ," says an old writer -- of whose works I possess the only copy extant --" it maketh a marvellous difference , whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside , or whether thou observest it from that sashless window , where the frost is on both sides , and of which the wight Death is the only glazier .
What a pity they didn ' t stop up the chinks and the crannies though , and thrust in a little lint here and there .
The universe is finished ; the copestone is on , and the chips were carted off a million years ago .
Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here ?
Entering that gable - ended Spouter - Inn , you found yourself in a wide , low , straggling entry with old - fashioned wainscots , reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft .
On one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked , and every way defaced , that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it , it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it , and careful inquiry of the neighbors , that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose .
But by dint of much and earnest contemplation , and oft repeated ponderings , and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry , you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea , however wild , might not be altogether unwarranted .
A boggy , soggy , squitchy picture truly , enough to drive a nervous man distracted .
But stop ; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish ?
The picture represents a Cape - Horner in a great hurricane ; the half - foundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible ; and an exasperated whale , purposing to spring clean over the craft , is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast - heads .
Some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws ; others were tufted with knots of human hair ; and one was sickle - shaped , with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the new - mown grass by a long - armed mower .
And that harpoon -- so like a corkscrew now -- was flung in Javan seas , and run away with by a whale , years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco .
The original iron entered nigh the tail , and , like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man , travelled full forty feet , and at last was found imbedded in the hump .
Crossing this dusky entry , and on through yon low - arched way -- cut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all round -- you enter the public room .
On one side stood a long , low , shelf - like table covered with cracked glass cases , filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide world ' s remotest nooks .
I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed ; that if I should ever do so , it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be , and that if he ( the landlord ) really had no other place for me , and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable , why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night , I would put up with the half of any decent man ' s blanket .
At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jack - knife , stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs .
It was cold as Iceland -- no fire at all -- the landlord said he couldn ' t afford it .
" He ' ll be here afore long ," was the answer .
" Landlord !
I ' ll try the bench here .
But I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window , that this plan would never do at all , especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window , and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night .
I ' ll have a good look at him then , and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all -- there ' s no telling .
But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones , twos , and threes , and going to bed , yet no sign of my harpooneer .
" It was now hard upon twelve o ' clock .
"
"
"
He wanted to , last Sunday , but I stopped him just as he was goin ' out of the door with four heads strung on a string , for all the airth like a string of inions .
Why , afore we give it up , Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it .
" I turned round from eyeing the bed , but he had disappeared .
I took it up , and held it close to the light , and felt it , and smelt it , and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it .
I was all eagerness to see his face , but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag ' s mouth .
I remembered a story of a white man -- a whaleman too -- who , falling among the cannibals , had been tattooed by them .
There was no hair on his head -- none to speak of at least -- nothing but a small scalp - knot twisted up on his forehead .
For now the savage goes up to the empty fire - place , and removing the papered fire - board , sets up this little hunch - backed image , like a tenpin , between the andirons .
But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say , was a fatal one .
The next moment the light was extinguished , and this wild cannibal , tomahawk between his teeth , sprang into bed with me .
Angels !
" Stop your grinning ," shouted I , " and why didn ' t you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal ?
CHAPTER 4
The Counterpane .
When I was a child , I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me ; whether it was a reality or a dream , I never could entirely settle .
I had been cutting up some caper or other -- I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney , as I had seen a little sweep do a few days previous ; and my stepmother who , somehow or other , was all the time whipping me , or sending me to bed supperless ,-- my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed , though it was only two o ' clock in the afternoon of the 21st June , the longest day in the year in our hemisphere .
I then rolled over , my neck feeling as if it were in a horse - collar ; and suddenly felt a slight scratch .
" At length , by dint of much wriggling , and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style , I succeeded in extracting a grunt ; and presently , he drew back his arm , shook himself all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water , and sat up in bed , stiff as a pike - staff , looking at me , and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how I came to be there , though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him .
Nevertheless , a man like Queequeg you don ' t see every day , he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding .
If he had not been a small degree civilized , he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all ; but then , if he had not been still a savage , he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on .
At last , he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes , and began creaking and limping about the room , as if , not being much accustomed to boots , his pair of damp , wrinkled cowhide ones -- probably not made to order either -- rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning .
Seeing , now , that there were no curtains to the window , and that the street being very narrow , the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room , and observing more and more the indecorous figure that Queequeg made , staving about with little else but his hat and boots on ; I begged him as well as I could , to accelerate his toilet somewhat , and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible .
Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made , and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept .
CHAPTER 5
The bar - room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous , and whom I had not as yet had a good look at .
Still , for the most part , that sort of thing is to be had anywhere .
These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table , and I was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling ; to my no small surprise , nearly every man maintained a profound silence .
To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding .
Enough , that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room , lighted his tomahawk - pipe , and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on , when I sallied out for a stroll .
that chap strutting round the corner .
Had it not been for us whalemen , that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador .
Yet , in spite of this , nowhere in all America will you find more patrician - like houses ; parks and gardens more opulent , than in New Bedford .
Yes ; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian oceans .
You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding ; for , they say , they have reservoirs of oil in every house , and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles .
Returning from my first morning stroll , I again sallied out upon this special errand .
A muffled silence reigned , only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm .
What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith , and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave .
In what census of living creatures , the dead of mankind are included ; why it is that a universal proverb says of them , that they tell no tales , though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands ; how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world , we prefix so significant and infidel a word , and yet do not thus entitle him , if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth ; why the Life Insurance Companies pay death - forfeitures upon immortals ; in what eternal , unstirring paralysis , and deadly , hopeless trance , yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago ; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss ; why all the living so strive to hush all the dead ; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city .
But what then ?
The Pulpit .
The perpendicular parts of this side ladder , as is usually the case with swinging ones , were of cloth - covered rope , only the rounds were of wood , so that at every step there was a joint .
Can it be , then , that by that act of physical isolation , he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time , from all outward worldly ties and connexions ?
But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place , borrowed from the chaplain ' s former sea - farings .
Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit , the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers .
" Starboard gangway , there !
" The ribs and terrors in the whale , Arched over me a dismal gloom , While all God ' s sun - lit waves rolled by , And lift me deepening down to doom .
what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet !
How billow - like and boisterously grand !
As with all sinners among men , the sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of God -- never mind now what that command was , or how conveyed -- which he found a hard command .
He thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where God does not reign , but only the Captains of this earth .
By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz .
Because Joppa , the modern Jaffa , shipmates , is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean , the Syrian ; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that , just outside the Straits of Gibraltar .
Strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent .
" Another runs to read the bill that ' s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored , offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide , and containing a description of his person .
He will not confess himself suspected ; but that itself is strong suspicion .
' Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah , though the man now stands before him ; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice , than he darts a scrutinizing glance .
' Ha !
He charges him thrice the usual sum ; and it ' s assented to .
He rings every coin to find a counterfeit .
' Point out my state - room , Sir ,' says Jonah now , ' I ' m travel - weary ; I need sleep .
Hearing him foolishly fumbling there , the Captain laughs lowly to himself , and mutters something about the doors of convicts ' cells being never allowed to be locked within .
the contraband was Jonah .
But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her ; when boxes , bales , and jars are clattering overboard ; when the wind is shrieking , and the men are yelling , and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over Jonah ' s head ; in all this raging tumult , Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep .
" Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul .
What people ?
Aye , well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN !
Straightway , he now goes on to make a full confession ; whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled , but still are pitiful .
He leaves all his deliverance to God , contenting himself with this , that spite of all his pains and pangs , he will still look towards His holy temple .
His deep chest heaved as with a ground - swell ; his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work ; and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow , and the light leaping from his eye , made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them .
And now how gladly would I come down from this mast - head and sit on the hatches there where you sit , and listen as you listen , while some one of you reads ME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME , as a pilot of the living God .
Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal !
Woe to him who , in this world , courts not dishonour !
Is not the main - truck higher than the kelson is low ?
But savages are strange beings ; at times you do not know exactly how to take them .
Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy ; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that .
And those same things that would have repelled most others , they were the very magnets that thus drew me .
He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as I to him ; and when our smoke was over , he pressed his forehead against mine , clasped me round the waist , and said that henceforth we were married ; meaning , in his country ' s phrase , that we were bosom friends ; he would gladly die for me , if need should be .
After supper , and another social chat and smoke , we went to our room together .
Thus , then , in our hearts ' honeymoon , lay I and Queequeg -- a cosy , loving pair .
We felt very nice and snug , the more so since it was so chilly out of doors ; indeed out of bed - clothes too , seeing that there was no fire in the room .
Nothing exists in itself .
We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time , when all at once I thought I would open my eyes ; for when between sheets , whether by day or by night , and whether asleep or awake , I have a way of always keeping my eyes shut , in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed .
On one side was a coral reef ; on the other a low tongue of land , covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water .
Thought he , it ' s a wicked world in all meridians ; I ' ll die a pagan .
He answered no , not yet ; and added that he was fearful Christianity , or rather Christians , had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan Kings before him .
But by and by , he said , he would return ,-- as soon as he felt himself baptized again .
For the nonce , however , he proposed to sail about , and sow his wild oats in all four oceans .
To all this I joyously assented ; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg , he was an experienced harpooneer , and as such , could not fail to be of great usefulness to one , who , like me , was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling , though well acquainted with the sea , as known to merchant seamen .
Wheelbarrow .
But we heeded them not , going along wheeling the barrow by turns , and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs .
To this , in substance , he replied , that though what I hinted was true enough , yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon , because it was of assured stuff , well tried in many a mortal combat , and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales .
The people of his island of Rokovoko , it seems , at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl ; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held .
Grace being said ,-- for those people have their grace as well as we -- though Queequeg told me that unlike us , who at such times look downwards to our platters , they , on the contrary , copying the ducks , glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts -- Grace , I say , being said , the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island ; that is , dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates .
Seeing himself placed next the Priest , and noting the ceremony , and thinking himself -- being Captain of a ship -- as having plain precedence over a mere island King , especially in the King ' s own house -- the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl ;-- taking it I suppose for a huge finger - glass .
Gaining the more open water , the bracing breeze waxed fresh ; the little Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows , as a young colt his snortings .
Don ' t you know you might have killed that chap ?
But it so happened just then , that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye .
Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale .
"
Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there , they don ' t grow naturally ; that they import Canada thistles ; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask ; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in Rome ; that people there plant toadstools before their houses , to get under the shade in summer time ; that one blade of grass makes an oasis , three blades in a day ' s walk a prairie ; that they wear quicksand shoes , something like Laplander snow - shoes ; that they are so shut up , belted about , every way inclosed , surrounded , and made an utter island of by the ocean , that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering , as to the backs of sea turtles .
In olden times an eagle swooped down upon the New England coast , and carried off an infant Indian in his talons .
Let America add Mexico to Texas , and pile Cuba upon Canada ; let the English overswarm all India , and hang out their blazing banner from the sun ; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer ' s .
Merchant ships are but extension bridges ; armed ones but floating forts ; even pirates and privateers , though following the sea as highwaymen the road , they but plunder other ships , other fragments of the land like themselves , without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself .
With the landless gull , that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows ; so at nightfall , the Nantucketer , out of sight of land , furls his sails , and lays him to his rest , while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales .
A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns ; yes , TWO of them , one for Queequeg , and one for me .
and a pair of prodigious black pots too !
Hussey .
Hussey ?
But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple Shirt , who was waiting for it in the entry , and seeming to hear nothing but the word " clam ," Mrs . Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen , and bawling out " clam for two ," disappeared .
But when that smoking chowder came in , the mystery was delightfully explained .
Oh , sweet friends !
There was a fishy flavor to the milk , too , which I could not at all account for , till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen ' s boats , I saw Hosea ' s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants , and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod ' s decapitated head , looking very slip - shod , I assure ye .
" Ever since young Stiggs coming from that unfort ' nt v ' y ' ge of his , when he was gone four years and a half , with only three barrels of ILE , was found dead in my first floor back , with his harpoon in his side ; ever since then I allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night .
I had not a little relied upon Queequeg ' s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely .
DEVIL - DAM , I do not know the origin of ; TIT - BIT is obvious ; PEQUOD , you will no doubt remember , was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians ; now extinct as the ancient Medes .
She was a ship of the old school , rather small if anything ; with an old - fashioned claw - footed look about her .
Her masts -- cut somewhere on the coast of Japan , where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale -- her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne .
Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled , like the pilgrim - worshipped flag - stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled .
Old Captain Peleg , many years her chief - mate , before he commanded another vessel of his own , and now a retired seaman , and one of the principal owners of the Pequod ,-- this old Peleg , during the term of his chief - mateship , had built upon her original grotesqueness , and inlaid it , all over , with a quaintness both of material and device , unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill - Hake ' s carved buckler or bedstead .
A cannibal of a craft , tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies .
He was seated on an old - fashioned oaken chair , wriggling all over with curious carving ; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed .
"
"
" Dost know nothing at all about whaling , I dare say -- eh ?
" Merchant service be damned .
Talk not that lingo to me .
I protested my innocence of these things .
It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage , and supplied with all her needs , including crew .
" What do you mean , sir ?
" Sir ," said I , " I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in the merchant --"
But let us understand each other .
I have given thee a hint about what whaling is ; do ye yet feel inclined for it ?
" I do , sir .
" Very good .
But concentrating all his crow ' s feet into one scowl , Captain Peleg started me on the errand .
I was a little staggered , but go a - whaling I must , and I would ; and the Pequod was as good a ship as any -- I thought the best -- and all this I now repeated to Peleg .
They are fighting Quakers ; they are Quakers with a vengeance .
This world pays dividends .
" He ' ll do ," said Bildad , eyeing me , and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible .
Peleg now threw open a chest , and drawing forth the ship ' s articles , placed pen and ink before him , and seated himself at a little table .
Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jack - knife , old Bildad , to my no small surprise , considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings ; Bildad never heeded us , but went on mumbling to himself out of his book , " LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth --"
" Seven hundred and seventy - seventh ," again said Bildad , without lifting his eyes ; and then went on mumbling --" for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship , and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded , I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad , who , I made no doubt , was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of Peleg .
" Whew !
" he whistled at last --" the squall ' s gone off to leeward , I think .
"
" turning to me .
" Well , bring him along then .
It ' s all right enough ; thou art shipped .
Any how , young man , he won ' t always see me , so I don ' t suppose he will thee .
Oh , thou ' lt like him well enough ; no fear , no fear .
He ' s a grand , ungodly , god - like man , Captain Ahab ; doesn ' t speak much ; but , when he does speak , then you may well listen .
he ain ' t Captain Bildad ; no , and he ain ' t Captain Peleg ; HE ' S AHAB , boy ; and Ahab of old , thou knowest , was a crowned king !
"
"
And somehow , at the time , I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him , but for I don ' t know what , unless it was the cruel loss of his leg .
However , my thoughts were at length carried in other directions , so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind .
The Ramadan .
As Queequeg ' s Ramadan , or Fasting and Humiliation , was to continue all day , I did not choose to disturb him till towards night - fall ; for I cherish the greatest respect towards everybody ' s religious obligations , never mind how comical , and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad - stool ; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth , who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets , bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name .
I say , we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these things , and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals , pagans and what not , because of their half - crazy conceits on these subjects .
There was Queequeg , now , certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan ;-- but what of that ?
All our arguing with him would not avail ; let him be , I say : and Heaven have mercy on us all -- Presbyterians and Pagans alike -- for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head , and sadly need mending .
Towards evening , when I felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over , I went up to his room and knocked at the door ; but no answer .
I had allowed him such abundant time ; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit .
I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg ' s harpoon , which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him , before our mounting to the chamber .
That ' s strange , thought I ; but at any rate , since the harpoon stands yonder , and he seldom or never goes abroad without it , therefore he must be inside here , and no possible mistake .
"-- all still .
Running down stairs , I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person I met -- the chamber - maid .
" La !
la !
la , ma ' am !-- Mistress !
" Get the axe !
" Look here ," said the landlady , quickly putting down the vinegar - cruet , so as to have one hand free ; " look here ; are you talking about prying open any of my doors ?
Unconsciously clapping the vinegar - cruet to one side of her nose , she ruminated for an instant ; then exclaimed --" No !
Has the poor lad a sister ?
there sat Queequeg , altogether cool and self - collected ; right in the middle of the room ; squatting on his hams , and holding Yojo on top of his head .
I wonder , thought I , if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan ; do they fast on their hams that way in his native island .
It must be so ; yes , it ' s part of his creed , I suppose ; well , then , let him rest ; he ' ll get up sooner or later , no doubt .
After sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum - pudding voyage , as they called it ( that is , a short whaling - voyage in a schooner or brig , confined to the north of the line , in the Atlantic Ocean only ); after listening to these plum - puddingers till nearly eleven o ' clock , I went up stairs to go to bed , feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination .
" For heaven ' s sake , Queequeg , get up and shake yourself ; get up and have some supper .
You ' ll starve ; you ' ll kill yourself , Queequeg .
For some time , do all I would , I could not get into the faintest doze .
He said no ; only upon one memorable occasion .
" I mean ," he replied , " he must show his papers .
"
I never saw him going there , and I pass it every Lord ' s day .
What church dost thee mean ?
"
" Splice , thou mean ' st SPLICE hands ," cried Peleg , drawing nearer .
Come aboard , come aboard ; never mind about the papers .
I say , tell Quohog there -- what ' s that you call him ?
" Quick , I say , you Bildad , and get the ship ' s papers .
Look ye , Quohog , we ' ll give ye the ninetieth lay , and that ' s more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket .
When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for signing , he turned to me and said , " I guess , Quohog there don ' t know how to write , does he ?
I say , Quohog , blast ye !
dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ?
Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg , and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broad - skirted drab coat , took out a bundle of tracts , and selecting one entitled " The Latter Day Coming ; or No Time to Lose ," placed it in Queequeg ' s hands , and then grasping them and the book with both his , looked earnestly into his eyes , and said , " Son of darkness , I must do my duty by thee ; I am part owner of this ship , and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew ; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways , which I sadly fear , I beseech thee , remain not for aye a Belial bondsman .
" Peleg !
Death and the Judgment then ?
No !
"
"
"
" What are you jabbering about , shipmate ?
"
"
"
" Aye , among some of us old sailor chaps , he goes by that name .
" laughed the stranger , with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh .
" Look ye ; when Captain Ahab is all right , then this left arm of mine will be all right ; not before .
" What do you know about him ?
" They didn ' t tell much of anything about him ; only I ' ve heard that he ' s a good whale - hunter , and a good captain to his crew .
Who knows it ?
But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab , of that ship there , the Pequod , then let me tell you , that I know all about the loss of his leg .
"
when ye get there , tell ' em I ' ve concluded not to make one of ' em .
It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him .
But we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards , when chancing to turn a corner , and looking back as I did so , who should be seen but Elijah following us , though at a distance .
Not only were the old sails being mended , but new sails were coming on board , and bolts of canvas , and coils of rigging ; in short , everything betokened that the ship ' s preparations were hurrying to a close .
On the day following Queequeg ' s signing the articles , word was given at all the inns where the ship ' s company were stopping , that their chests must be on board before night , for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing .
At one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the steward ' s pantry ; another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mate ' s desk , where he kept his log ; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one ' s rheumatic back .
But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on board , as she did the last day , with a long oil - ladle in one hand , and a still longer whaling lance in the other .
Every once in a while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den , roaring at the men down the hatchways , roaring up to the riggers at the mast - head , and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam .
During these days of preparation , Queequeg and I often visited the craft , and as often I asked about Captain Ahab , and how he was , and when he was going to come on board his ship .
Going Aboard .
" Avast !
" cried a voice , whose owner at the same time coming close behind us , laid a hand upon both our shoulders , and then insinuating himself between us , stood stooping forward a little , in the uncertain twilight , strangely peering from Queequeg to me .
" Going aboard ?
" Yes , we are ," said I , " but what business is that of yours ?
" Elijah ," said I , " you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing .
" Ye be , be ye ?
" Holloa !
Struck by this plain matter - of - fact question , I answered , saying , " Yes , I thought I did see four or five men ; but it was too dim to be sure .
" Face !
"
Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper , and lighted his tomahawk pipe .
He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk - pipe , which , it seemed , had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul , when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger .
"
" He ' s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , I must turn to .
Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin .
" No need of profane words , however great the hurry , Peleg ," said Bildad , " but away with thee , friend Starbuck , and do our bidding .
"
Indeed , as that was not at all his proper business , but the pilot ' s ; and as he was not yet completely recovered -- so they said -- therefore , Captain Ahab stayed below .
" Aft here , ye sons of bachelors ," he cried , as the sailors lingered at the main - mast .
"-- was the next order .
" Man the capstan !
Nevertheless , not three days previous , Bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod , particularly in getting under weigh ; and Charity , his sister , had placed a small choice copy of Watts in each seaman ' s berth .
" he roared .
Quohog !
" Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood , Stand dressed in living green .
So to the Jews old Canaan stood , While Jordan rolled between .
"
Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then .
The stout sail - boat that had accompanied us began ranging alongside .
For loath to depart , yet ; very loath to leave , for good , a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyage -- beyond both stormy Capes ; a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested ; a ship , in which an old shipmate sailed as captain ; a man almost as old as he , once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw ; loath to say good - bye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him ,-- poor old Bildad lingered long ; paced the deck with anxious strides ; ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there ; again came on deck , and looked to windward ; looked towards the wide and endless waters , only bounded by the far - off unseen Eastern Continents ; looked towards the land ; looked aloft ; looked right and left ; looked everywhere and nowhere ; and at last , mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin , convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand , and holding up a lantern , for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face , as much as to say , " Nevertheless , friend Peleg , I can stand it ; yes , I can .
Have an eye to the molasses tierce , Mr . Stubb ; it was a little leaky , I thought .
Good - bye , good - bye !
Be careful with the butter -- twenty cents the pound it was , and mind ye , if --"
" and with that , Peleg hurried him over the side , and both dropt into the boat .
The land seemed scorching to his feet .
With all her might she crowds all sail off shore ; in so doing , fights ' gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward ; seeks all the lashed sea ' s landlessness again ; for refuge ' s sake forlornly rushing into peril ; her only friend her bitterest foe !
Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth ; that all deep , earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea ; while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous , slavish shore ?
who would craven crawl to land !
Take heart , take heart , O Bulkington !
As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling ; and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit ; therefore , I am all anxiety to convince ye , ye landsmen , of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales .
And if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldier ' s profession ; let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery , would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale ' s vast tail , fanning into eddies the air over his head .
But this is not the half ; look again .
If American and European men - of - war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale - ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages .
That great America on the other side of the sphere , Australia , was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman .
And who composed the first narrative of a whaling - voyage ?
Certainly it cannot be olive oil , nor macassar oil , nor castor oil , nor bear ' s oil , nor train oil , nor cod - liver oil .
Looking into his eyes , you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand - fold perils he had calmly confronted through life .
Outward portents and inward presentiments were his .
" By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward .
Besides , he thought , perhaps , that in this business of whaling , courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship , like her beef and her bread , and not to be foolishly wasted .
Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun - down ; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him .
For , thought Starbuck , I am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living , and not to be killed by them for theirs ; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew .
Where , in the bottomless deeps , could he find the torn limbs of his brother ?
With memories like these in him , and , moreover , given to a certain superstitiousness , as has been said ; the courage of this Starbuck which could , nevertheless , still flourish , must indeed have been extreme .
Thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike ; that democratic dignity which , on all hands , radiates without end from God ; Himself !
He was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat , as an old stage - driver is about the snugness of his box .
He would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster .
Or , being armed with their long keen whaling spears , they were as a picked trio of lancers ; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins .
Next was Tashtego , an unmixed Indian from Gay Head , the most westerly promontory of Martha ' s Vineyard , where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men , which has long supplied the neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers .
Tashtego ' s long , lean , sable hair , his high cheek bones , and black rounding eyes -- for an Indian , Oriental in their largeness , but Antarctic in their glittering expression -- all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters , who , in quest of the great New England moose , had scoured , bow in hand , the aboriginal forests of the main .
Tashtego was Stubb the second mate ' s squire .
As for the residue of the Pequod ' s company , be it said , that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the American whale fishery , are Americans born , though pretty nearly all the officers are .
The same , I say , because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the brains , the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles .
In like manner , the Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London , put in at the Shetland Islands , to receive the full complement of their crew .
How it is , there is no telling , but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen .
Black Little Pip -- he never did -- oh , no !
For several days after leaving Nantucket , nothing above hatches was seen of Captain Ahab .
Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below , I instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible ; for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain , now in the seclusion of the sea , became almost a perturbation .
For though the harpooneers , with the great body of the crew , were a far more barbaric , heathenish , and motley set than any of the tame merchant - ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with , still I ascribed this -- and rightly ascribed it -- to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked .
Reality outran apprehension ; Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter - deck .
Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab .
So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out -- which might hardly come to pass , so he muttered -- then , whoever should do that last office for the dead , would find a birth - mark on him from crown to sole .
His bone leg steadied in that hole ; one arm elevated , and holding by a shroud ; Captain Ahab stood erect , looking straight out beyond the ship ' s ever - pitching prow .
And not only that , but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face ; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe .
The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets , nursing at home in lonely pride , the memory of their absent conquering Earls , the golden helmeted suns !
Ah !
But go thy ways ; I had forgot .
"
How he flashed at me !-- his eyes like powder - pans !
Didn ' t that Dough - Boy , the steward , tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man ' s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled , and the sheets down at the foot , and the coverlid almost tied into knots , and the pillow a sort of frightful hot , as though a baked brick had been on it ?
Who ' s made appointments with him in the hold ?
He might as well have kicked me , and done with it .
I don ' t stand right on my legs .
Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out .
how ?
How could one look at Ahab then , seated on that tripod of bones , without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized ?
For a Khan of the plank , and a king of the sea , and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab .
Oh , my pipe !
This thing that is meant for sereneness , to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs , not among torn iron - grey locks like mine .
He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea .
The fire hissed in the waves ; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made .
Queen Mab .
" Such a queer dream , King - Post , I never had .
And then , presto !
' Why ,' thinks I , ' what ' s the row ?
No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb .
Look ye -- there ' s something special in the wind .
"
The classification of the constituents of a chaos , nothing less is here essayed .
" " A field strewn with thorns .
And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas .
good people all ,-- the Greenland whale is deposed ,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth !
Those books are Beale ' s and Bennett ' s ; both in their time surgeons to English South - Sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men .
What am I that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan !
But in brief , they are these : lungs and warm blood ; whereas , all other fish are lungless and cold blooded .
* I am aware that down to the present time , the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs ( Pig - fish and Sow - fish of the Coffins of Nantucket ) are included by many naturalists among the whales .
The SPERM WHALE ; II .
All his peculiarities will , in many other places , be enlarged upon .
It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do .
Philologically considered , it is absurd .
It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as " whale oil ," an inferior article in commerce .
When the sea is moderately calm , and slightly marked with spherical ripples , and this gnomon - like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface , it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial , with its style and wavy hour - lines graved on it .
And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned .
What then remains ?
nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily , in their entire liberal volume , and boldly sort them that way .
BOOK I .
( RAZOR - BACK ).-- Of this whale little is known but his name .
Let him go .
I know little more of him , nor does anybody else .
Adieu , Sulphur Bottom !
( BLACK FISH ).-- I give the popular fishermen ' s names for all these fish , for generally they are the best .
So , call him the Hyena Whale , if you please .
This whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length .
Strictly speaking , this horn is but a lengthened tusk , growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal .
But it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left - handed man .
It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword - fish and bill - fish ; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food .
Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice - piercer ; for the Narwhale , rising to the surface of the Polar Sea , and finding it sheeted with ice , thrusts his horn up , and so breaks through .
He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas .
Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer .

The Huzza Porpoise .
BOOK III .
He is somewhat larger than the Huzza Porpoise , but much of the same general make .
BOOK III .
( DUODECIMO ), CHAPTER III .
In shape , he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise , being of a less rotund and jolly girth ; indeed , he is of quite a neat and gentleman - like figure .
You cannot but plainly see that I have kept my word .
CHAPTER 33
Concerning the officers of the whale - craft , this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship - board , arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers , a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale - fleet .
Nevertheless , as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends , and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat , but under certain circumstances ( night watches on a whaling ground ) the command of the ship ' s deck is also his ; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands , that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast , and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior ; though always , by them , familiarly regarded as their social equal .
Indeed , many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter - deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy ; nay , extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple , and not the shabbiest of pilot - cloth .
That certain sultanism of his brain , which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested ; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship .
Oh , Ahab !
what shall be grand in thee , it must needs be plucked at from the skies , and dived for in the deep , and featured in the unbodied air !
It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of sea - usages , that while in the open air of the deck some officers will , upon provocation , bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander ; yet , ten to one , let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander ' s cabin , and straightway their inoffensive , not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him , as he sits at the head of the table ; this is marvellous , sometimes most comical .
Perhaps not .
Over his ivory - inlaid table , Ahab presided like a mute , maned sea - lion on the white coral beach , surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs .
In his own proper turn , each officer waited to be served .
What a relief it was to choking Stubb , when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below .
Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him , on account of its clotting his clear , sunny complexion ; or whether he deemed that , on so long a voyage in such marketless waters , butter was at a premium , and therefore was not for him , a subaltern ; however it was , Flask , alas !
Another thing .
Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him ; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear .
Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private , that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer , from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry , more or less .
Alas !
In this one matter , Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale captains , who , as a set , rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ship ' s cabin belongs to them ; and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is , at any time , permitted there .
Nor did they lose much hereby ; in the cabin was no companionship ; socially , Ahab was inaccessible .
It was during the more pleasant weather , that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast - head came round .
I take it , that the earliest standers of mast - heads were the old Egyptians ; because , in all my researches , I find none prior to them .
For though their progenitors , the builders of Babel , must doubtless , by their tower , have intended to rear the loftiest mast - head in all Asia , or Africa either ; yet ( ere the final truck was put to it ) as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board , in the dread gale of God ' s wrath ; therefore , we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the Egyptians .
But this custom has now become obsolete ; turn we then to the one proper mast - head , that of a whale - ship at sea .
For the most part , in this tropic whaling life , a sublime uneventfulness invests you ; you hear no news ; read no gazettes ; extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements ; you hear of no domestic afflictions ; bankrupt securities ; fall of stocks ; are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner -- for all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks , and your bill of fare is immutable .
"
Nor are these monitions at all unneeded .
"
It drew near the close of day .
When the entire ship ' s company were assembled , and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces , were eyeing him , for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up , Ahab , after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks , and then darting his eyes among the crew , started from his standpoint ; and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck .
With bent head and half - slouched hat he continued to pace , unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men ; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask , that Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat .
Vehemently pausing , he cried :--
" And what tune is it ye pull to , men ?
" All ye mast - headers have before now heard me give orders about a white whale .
Look ye !
D ' ye see it ?
Mr . Starbuck , hand me yon top - maul .
Skin your eyes for him , men ; look sharp for white water ; if ye see but a bubble , sing out .
" shouted Ahab .
" Does he fan - tail a little curious , sir , before he goes down ?
" And has he a curious spout , too ," said Daggoo , " very bushy , even for a parmacetty , and mighty quick , Captain Ahab ?
Death and devils !
" Who told thee that ?
I think ye do look brave .
" Aye , aye !
Steward !
"
" He smites his chest ," whispered Stubb , " what ' s that for ?
To be enraged with a dumb thing , Captain Ahab , seems blasphemous .
All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks .
How can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall ?
more intolerable than fiends ' glarings is a doltish stare !
The crew , man , the crew !
See Stubb !
' Tis but to help strike a fin ; no wondrous feat for Starbuck .
Ah !
thy silence , then , THAT voices thee .
For again Starbuck ' s downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life ; the subterranean laugh died away ; the winds blew on ; the sails filled out ; the ship heaved and rolled as before .
But rather are ye predictions than warnings , ye shadows !
Receiving the brimming pewter , and turning to the harpooneers , he ordered them to produce their weapons .
Round with it , round !
Short draughts -- long swallows , men ; ' tis hot as Satan ' s hoof .
Men , ye seem the years ; so brimming life is gulped and gone .
Steward , refill !
" Attend now , my braves .
" Advance , ye mates !
Cross your lances full before me .
Well done !
Let me touch the axis .
" So saying , with extended arm , he grasped the three level , radiating lances at their crossed centre ; while so doing , suddenly and nervously twitched them ; meanwhile , glancing intently from Starbuck to Stubb ; from Stubb to Flask .
What , when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars , using his tiara for ewer ?
"
So , so ; now , ye cup - bearers , advance .

The gold brow plumbs the blue .
Yet is it bright with many a gem ; I the wearer , see not its far flashings ; but darkly feel that I wear that , that dazzlingly confounds .
No more .

ye cannot swerve me , else ye swerve yourselves !
The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails , whereon my soul is grooved to run .

)
clear my throat !-- I ' ve been thinking over it ever since , and that ha , ha ' s the final consequence .
I heard not all his talk with Starbuck ; but to my poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt .
I feel funny .
Fa , la !
What ' s my juicy little pear at home doing now ?
Crying its eyes out ?-- Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers , I dare say , gay as a frigate ' s pennant , and so am I -- fa , la !

In that way , mostly , the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded .
One of the wild suggestions referred to , as at last coming to be linked with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined , was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous ; that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time .
His three boats stove around him , and oars and men both whirling in the eddies ; one captain , seizing the line - knife from his broken prow , had dashed at the whale , as an Arkansas duellist at his foe , blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom - deep life of the whale .
Small reason was there to doubt , then , that ever since that almost fatal encounter , Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale , all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him , not only all his bodily woes , but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations .
But , as in his narrow - flowing monomania , not one jot of Ahab ' s broad madness had been left behind ; so in that broad madness , not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished .
What the white whale was to Ahab , has been hinted ; what , at times , he was to me , as yet remains unsaid .
It was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me .
So that not the fierce - fanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white - shrouded bear or shark .
But even assuming all this to be true ; yet , were it not for the whiteness , you would not have that intensified terror .
This peculiarity is most vividly hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish .
As Abraham before the angels , I bowed myself ; the white thing was so white , its wings so wide , and in those for ever exiled waters , I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns .
never had heard that name before ; is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore !
But I doubt not , that leathern tally , meant for man , was taken off in Heaven , when the white fowl flew to join the wing - folding , the invoking , and adoring cherubim !
It is that whiteness which invests him , a thing expressed by the name he bears .
Or , to the unread , unsophisticated Protestant of the Middle American States , why does the passing mention of a White Friar or a White Nun , evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ?
What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples .
"
Not so the sailor , beholding the scenery of the Antarctic seas ; where at times , by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air , he , shivering and half shipwrecked , instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery , views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses .
Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe , and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation , when beholding the white depths of the milky way ?
And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers , that all other earthly hues -- every stately or lovely emblazoning -- the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods ; yea , and the gilded velvets of butterflies , and the butterfly cheeks of young girls ; all these are but subtile deceits , not actually inherent in substances , but only laid on from without ; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot , whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel - house within ; and when we proceed further , and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues , the great principle of light , for ever remains white or colourless in itself , and if operating without medium upon matter , would touch all objects , even tulips and roses , with its own blank tinge -- pondering all this , the palsied universe lies before us a leper ; and like wilful travellers in Lapland , who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes , so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him .
And of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol .
It was in the midst of this repose , that Archy , one of the cordon , whose post was near the after - hatches , whispered to his neighbor , a Cholo , the words above .
did you hear that noise , Cabaco ?
" There it is again -- under the hatches -- don ' t you hear it -- a cough -- it sounded like a cough .
Pass along that return bucket .
"
" Caramba !
" Say what ye will , shipmate ; I ' ve sharp ears .
I heard Stubb tell Flask , one morning watch , that there was something of that sort in the wind .
" Tish !
Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew , you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom , and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts , spread them before him on his screwed - down table .
So assured , indeed , is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale ' s resorting to given waters , that many hunters believe that , could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world ; were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated , then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring - shoals or the flights of swallows .
And hence not only at substantiated times , upon well known separate feeding - grounds , could Ahab hope to encounter his prey ; but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could , by his art , so place and time himself on his way , as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting .
Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds , yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year , say , will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season ; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true .
For there and then , for several consecutive years , Moby Dick had been periodically descried , lingering in those waters for awhile , as the sun , in its annual round , loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the Zodiac .
There it was , too , that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place ; there the waves were storied with his deeds ; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance .
For the peculiar snow - white brow of Moby Dick , and his snow - white hump , could not but be unmistakable .
what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire .
He sleeps with clenched hands ; and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms .
Was it not so , O Morquan !
So ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world , that without some hints touching the plain facts , historical and otherwise , of the fishery , they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable , or still worse and more detestable , a hideous and intolerable allegory .
Do you suppose that that poor fellow there , who this moment perhaps caught by the whale - line off the coast of New Guinea , is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan -- do you suppose that that poor fellow ' s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to - morrow at your breakfast ?
Secondly : People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power ; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two - fold enormousness , they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness ; when , I declare upon my soul , I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses , when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt .
Being returned home at last , Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship , but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers ; for the second time his ship was utterly lost , and forthwith forswearing the sea , he has never tempted it since .
" Again : " At all events , the whole circumstances taken together , all happening before my own eyes , and producing , at the time , impressions in my mind of decided , calculating mischief , on the part of the whale ( many of which impressions I cannot now recall ), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion .
"
"
Very good ; but there is more coming .
But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale , that begged a few moments ' confidential business with him .
I will now refer you to Langsdorff ' s Voyages for a little circumstance in point , peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof .
An uncommon large whale , the body of which was larger than the ship itself , lay almost at the surface of the water , but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship , which was in full sail , was almost upon him , so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him .
"
I have the honour of being a nephew of his .
In that up and down manly book of old - fashioned adventure , so full , too , of honest wonders -- the voyage of Lionel Wafer , one of ancient Dampier ' s old chums -- I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff , that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example , if such be needed .
But I should not much wonder if , in the darkness of that early hour of the morning , the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath .
But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale -- squid or cuttle - fish -- lurks at the bottom of that sea , because large creatures , but by no means the largest of that sort , have been found at its surface .
It would be refining too much , perhaps , even considering his monomania , to hint that his vindictiveness towards the White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales , and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted .
For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest ; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable -- they live in the varying outer weather , and they inhale its fickleness -- and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit , however promissory of life and passion in the end , it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash .
Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing .
In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations ; but such times are evanescent .
They may scorn cash now ; but let some months go by , and no perspective promise of it to them , and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them , this same cash would soon cashier Ahab .
That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand , backed by a heedful , closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to .
Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so strange , long drawn , and musically wild and unearthly , that the ball of free will dropped from my hand , and I stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing .
To be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas , from hundreds of whalemen ' s look - outs perched as high in the air ; but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from Tashtego the Indian ' s .
As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air , so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon , you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate , and by those wild cries announcing their coming .
The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks , with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity .
And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus .
" There go flukes !
Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward , we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows .
But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale .
The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart , with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel - like lips .
A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him , with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff .
While yet the wondering ship ' s company were gazing upon these strangers , Ahab cried out to the white - turbaned old man at their head , " All ready there , Fedallah ?
" Lower away then ; d ' ye hear ?
" Oh , I don ' t mind ' em , sir ," said Archy ; " I knew it all before now .
And didn ' t I tell Cabaco here of it ?
Those chaps in yonder boat ?
Three cheers , men -- all hearts alive !
Why don ' t you snap your oars , you rascals ?
Bite something , you dogs !
The devil fetch ye , ye ragamuffin rapscallions ; ye are all asleep .
Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger - cakes don ' t ye pull ?-- pull and break something !
"
" Mr . Starbuck !
( Strong , strong , boys !
They were hidden down there .
The White Whale ' s at the bottom of it .
Well , well , so be it !
Can ' t be helped !
For me , I silently recalled the mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket dawn , as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah .
As for Fedallah , who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar , he had thrown aside his black jacket , and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale , clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon ; while at the other end of the boat Ahab , with one arm , like a fencer ' s , thrown half backward into the air , as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him .
Boat and crew sat motionless on the sea .
" Good a mast - head as any , sir .
Will you mount ?
And here was Flask now standing , Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by .
At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat , even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross - running seas .
On his broad back , flaxen - haired Flask seemed a snow - flake .
Roar and pull , my thunderbolts !
But what the devil are you hurrying about ?
Softly , softly , and steadily , my men .
Only pull , and keep pulling ; nothing more .
Take it easy -- why don ' t ye take it easy , I say , and burst all your livers and lungs !
Our sail was now set , and , with the still rising wind , we rushed along ; the boat going with such madness through the water , that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row - locks .
" Give way , men ," whispered Starbuck , drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail ; " there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes .
A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat ; it was the darted iron of Queequeg .
There we sat up to our knees in the sea , the water covering every rib and plank , so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean .
Meanwhile the driving scud , rack , and mist , grew darker with the shadows of night ; no sign of the ship could be seen .
The oars were useless as propellers , performing now the office of life - preservers .
Affrighted , we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view , bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length .
Ere the squall came close to , the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time .
However , nothing dispirits , and nothing seems worth while disputing .
" Without much emotion , though soaked through just like me , he gave me to understand that such things did often happen .
"
" Can ' t you twist that smaller ?
Ahab ' s Boat and Crew .
" cried Stubb ; " if I had but one leg you would not catch me in a boat , unless maybe to stop the plug - hole with my timber toe .
he ' s a wonderful old man !
Among whale - wise people it has often been argued whether , considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage , it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase .
Now , with the subordinate phantoms , what wonder remained soon waned away ; for in a whaler wonders soon wane .
But be all this as it may , certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew , though still as it were somehow distinct from them , yet that hair - turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last .
Whence he came in a mannerly world like this , by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab ' s peculiar fortunes ; nay , so far as to have some sort of a half - hinted influence ; Heaven knows , but it might have been even authority over him ; all this none knew .
Lit up by the moon , it looked celestial ; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea .
On life and death this old man walked .
And so it served us night after night , till no one heeded it but to wonder at it .
Mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight , or starlight , as the case might be ; disappearing again for one whole day , or two days , or three ; and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van , this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on .
Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race , and in accordance with the preternaturalness , as it seemed , which in many things invested the Pequod , were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried ; at however remote times , or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes , that unnearable spout was cast by one self - same whale ; and that whale , Moby Dick .
These temporary apprehensions , so vague but so awful , derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather , in which , beneath all its blue blandness , some thought there lurked a devilish charm , as for days and days we voyaged along , through seas so wearily , lonesomely mild , that all space , in repugnance to our vengeful errand , seemed vacating itself of life before our urn - like prow .
And every morning , perched on our stays , rows of these birds were seen ; and spite of our hootings , for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp , as though they deemed our ship some drifting , uninhabited craft ; a thing appointed to desolation , and therefore fit roosting - place for their homeless selves .
Cape of Good Hope , do they call ye ?
In tempestuous times like these , after everything above and aloft has been secured , nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale .
Meantime , the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows , stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist ; and the better to guard against the leaping waves , each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail , in which he swung as in a loosened belt .
The Albatross .
As if the waves had been fullers , this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus .
But taking advantage of his windward position , he again seized his trumpet , and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and shortly bound home , he loudly hailed --" Ahoy there !
and this time three years , if I am not at home , tell them to address them to --"
Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight , yet , to any monomaniac man , the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings .
" Swim away from me , do ye ?
Keep her off round the world !
But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of , or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that , some time or other , swims before all human hearts ; while chasing such over this round globe , they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed .
CHAPTER 53
The Gam .
And in degree , all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each other ' s track on the cruising - ground itself , even though they are equally long absent from home .
For one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third , and now far remote vessel ; and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets .
As for Men - of - War , when they chance to meet at sea , they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings , such a ducking of ensigns , that there does not seem to be much right - down hearty good - will and brotherly love about it at all .
And as for Pirates , when they chance to cross each other ' s cross - bones , the first hail is --" How many skulls ?
But look at the godly , honest , unostentatious , hospitable , sociable , free - and - easy whaler !
What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather ?
She has a " GAM ," a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even ; and if by chance they should hear of it , they only grin at it , and repeat gamesome stuff about " spouters " and " blubber - boilers ," and such like pretty exclamations .
And besides , when a man is elevated in that odd fashion , he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude .
In a pirate , man - of - war , or slave ship , when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat , he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable , sometimes cushioned seat there , and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner ' s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons .
To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town - Ho ' s story , which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous , inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men .
One morning upon handling the pumps , according to daily usage , it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common .
At all events , he had proved so thus far ; but Radney was doomed and made mad , and Steelkilt -- but , gentlemen , you shall hear .
Now this Radney , I suppose , was as little of a coward , and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless , unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine , gentlemen .
By the Lord , it ' s worth bottling !
I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men .
Any man who has gone sailor in a whale - ship will understand this ; and all this and doubtless much more , the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command .
And then , without at all alluding to the shovel , he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers ; who , not being billeted at the pumps , had done little or nothing all day .
And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass ; when , resolved at last no longer to retreat , bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor , the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer :
Radney , I will not obey you .
They were both Canallers .
"' Nay , Senor ; hereabouts in this dull , warm , most lazy , and hereditary land , we know but little of your vigorous North .
" For three hundred and sixty miles , gentlemen , through the entire breadth of the state of New York ; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages ; through long , dismal , uninhabited swamps , and affluent , cultivated fields , unrivalled for fertility ; by billiard - room and bar - room ; through the holy - of - holies of great forests ; on Roman arches over Indian rivers ; through sun and shade ; by happy hearts or broken ; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties ; and especially , by rows of snow - white chapels , whose spires stand almost like milestones , flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life .
For by some curious fatality , as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice , so sinners , gentlemen , most abound in holiest vicinities .
' said Don Pedro , looking downwards into the crowded plazza , with humorous concern .
"' Well for our northern friend , Dame Isabella ' s Inquisition wanes in Lima ,' laughed Don Sebastian .
Pardon !
' cried another of the company .
' In the name of all us Limeese , I but desire to express to you , sir sailor , that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison .
The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports ; his slouched and gaily - ribboned hat betoken his grand features .
' No need to travel !
At intervals , he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion , and prying into the heart of it with his pike , sought to prick out the object of his resentment .
"' Will you promise not to touch us , if we do ?
"' Turn to !
Turn to !
"' Sink the ship ?
A fierce cheer was their response .
Emboldened by this , the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest , but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged .
Only three were left .
But to this their leader as fiercely objected , reserving that priority for himself ; particularly as his two comrades would not yield , the one to the other , in the matter ; and both of them could not be first , for the ladder would but admit one man at a time .
But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last , they in some way , by some subtle chemistry of villany , mixed their before secret treacheries together ; and when their leader fell into a doze , verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences ; and bound the sleeper with cords , and gagged him with cords ; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight .
" Thinking murder at hand , and smelling in the dark for the blood , he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle .
" Steelkilt here hissed out something , inaudible to all but the Captain ; who , to the amazement of all hands , started back , paced the deck rapidly two or three times , and then suddenly throwing down his rope , said , ' I won ' t do it -- let him go -- cut him down : d ' ye hear ?
'
On the contrary , it seemed , that mainly at Steelkilt ' s instigation , they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness , obey all orders to the last , and , when the ship reached port , desert her in a body .
what does it look like ?
'
" But there was none in the forecastle .
Twenty - four hours after , his trick at the silent helm -- nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman ' s hand -- that fatal hour was then to come ; and in the fore - ordaining soul of Steelkilt , the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse , with his forehead crushed in .
' cried Don Sebastian ; ' St .
Dominic !
Let me get more into the air , Sirs .
" Meantime , at the first tap of the boat ' s bottom , the Lakeman had slackened the line , so as to drop astern from the whirlpool ; calmly looking on , he thought his own thoughts .
" Watching the boat till it was fairly beached , and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa - nut trees , Steelkilt made sail again , and in due time arrived at Tahiti , his own place of destination .
Bear with me if I seem to press .
I go for it ; but are you well advised ?
"' Excuse me for running after you , Don Sebastian ; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can .
I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas , something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whale - ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there .
It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda , than the broad palms of the true whale ' s majestic flukes .
Nor does Hogarth , in painting the same scene in his own " Perseus Descending ," make out one whit better .
Then , there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald , and Jonah ' s whale , as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of old primers .
In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale , where all manner of spouts , jets d ' eau , hot springs and cold , Saratoga and Baden - Baden , come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain .
In another plate , the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes .
" In this book is an outline purporting to be a " Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale , drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of Mexico , August , 1793 , and hoisted on deck .
In 1836 , he published a Natural History of Whales , in which he gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale .
They are generally Richard III .
Though elephants have stood for their full - lengths , the living Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait .
Who Garnery the painter is , or was , I know not .
The French are the lads for painting action .
Even Scoresby , the justly renowned Right whaleman , after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale , and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises , treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks , chopping knives , and grapnels ; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety - six fac - similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals .
Durand .
The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use ; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole ; while from a sudden roll of the sea , the little craft stands half - erect out of the water , like a rearing horse .
CHAPTER 57
On Tower - hill , as you go down to the London docks , you may have seen a crippled beggar ( or KEDGER , as the sailors say ) holding a painted board before him , representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg .
But , though for ever mounted on that stump , never a stump - speech does the poor whaleman make ; but , with downcast eyes , stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation .
But , in general , they toil with their jack - knives alone ; and , with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor , they will turn you out anything you please , in the way of a mariner ' s fancy .
what is called savagery .
For , with but a bit of broken sea - shell or a shark ' s tooth , that miraculous intricacy of wooden net - work has been achieved ; and it has cost steady years of steady application .
Some of them are done with much accuracy .
In bony , ribby regions of the earth , where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain , you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the Leviathan partly merged in grass , which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges .
*
That same ocean rolls now ; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year .
Consider the subtleness of the sea ; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water , unapparent for the most part , and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure .
CHAPTER 59
Upon this , the seamen rushed to the yard - arms , as in swarming - time the bees rush to the boughs .
Bare - headed in the sultry sun , Ahab stood on the bowsprit , and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman , cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo .
Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object , certain it is , that a glimpse of it being so very unusual , that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness .
By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature , here spoken of , it is included among the class of cuttle - fish , to which , indeed , in certain external respects it would seem to belong , but only as the Anak of the tribe .
With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described , as well as for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented , I have here to speak of the magical , sometimes horrible whale - line .
In these instances , the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale , as it were , from the one boat to the other ; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort .
It is worse ; for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils , because the boat is rocking like a cradle , and you are pitched one way and the other , without the slightest warning ; and only by a certain self - adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action , can you escape being made a Mazeppa of , and run away with where the all - seeing sun himself could never pierce you out .
All men live enveloped in whale - lines .
CHAPTER 61
The next day was exceedingly still and sultry , and with nothing special to engage them , the Pequod ' s crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea .
So that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars , and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman .
close under our lee , not forty fathoms off , a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate , his broad , glossy back , of an Ethiopian hue , glistening in the sun ' s rays like a mirror .
But that pipe , poor whale , was thy last .
And obeying his own order , he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes .
Yes , a mighty change had come over the fish .
Besides , such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head , and such the tapering cut - water formation of the lower part , that by obliquely elevating his head , he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff - bowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot - boat .
" cried Stubb to the bowsman !
And all the while , jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale , and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman ; as at every dart , hauling in upon his crooked lance ( by the line attached to it ), Stubb straightened it again and again , by a few rapid blows against the gunwale , then again and again sent it into the whale .
" he now cried to the bowsman , as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath .
" and the boat ranged along the fish ' s flank .
" Yes ; both pipes smoked out !
CHAPTER 62
Now it needs a strong , nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish ; for often , in what is called a long dart , the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet .
For one , I cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time .
No wonder , taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body , that out of fifty fair chances for a dart , not five are successful ; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated ; no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood - vessels in the boat ; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels ; no wonder that to many ship owners , whaling is but a losing concern ; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage , and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted !
The headsman should stay in the bows from first to last ; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance , and no rowing whatever should be expected of him , except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman .
But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous , violent , convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron , it becomes impossible for the harpooneer , however lightning - like in his movements , to pitch the second iron into him .
But this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties .
Furthermore : you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard , it thenceforth becomes a dangling , sharp - edged terror , skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale , entangling the lines , or cutting them , and making a prodigious sensation in all directions .
All these particulars are faithfully narrated here , as they will not fail to elucidate several most important , however intricate passages , in scenes hereafter to be painted .
*
By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass , so that now having girdled the whale , the chain is readily made to follow suit ; and being slipped along the body , is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail , at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes .
If moody Ahab was now all quiescence , at least so far as could be known on deck , Stubb , his second mate , flushed with conquest , betrayed an unusual but still good - natured excitement .
You , Daggoo !
overboard you go , and cut me one from his small !
Here be it known , that though these wild fishermen do not , as a general thing , and according to the great military maxim , make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war ( at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage ), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale designated by Stubb ; comprising the tapering extremity of the body .
Mingling their mumblings with his own mastications , thousands on thousands of sharks , swarming round the dead leviathan , smackingly feasted on its fatness .
This particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous .
But , as yet , Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was going on so nigh him , no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his own epicurean lips .
You ' ve been beating this steak too much , cook ; it ' s too tender .
Blast me , if I can hear my own voice .
Massa Stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings , but by Gor !
"
" No , cook ; go on , go on .
Now , look here , bred ' ren , just try wonst to be cibil , a helping yourselbs from dat whale .
Don ' t be tearin ' de blubber out your neighbour ' s mout , I say .
"
"
" Come back here , cook ;-- here , hand me those tongs ;-- now take that bit of steak there , and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be ?
"
" Passed one once in Cape - Down ," said the old man sullenly .
" Where do you expect to go to , cook ?
" Avast !
"
How ?
And fetch him where ?
" So , then , you expect to go up into our main - top , do you , cook , when you are dead ?
"
But , perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber ' s hole , cook ; but , no , no , cook , you don ' t get there , except you go the regular way , round by the rigging .
"
But Fleece had hardly got three paces off , when he was recalled .
I ' m bressed if he ain ' t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself ," muttered the old man , limping away ; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock .
The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them .
Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal ' s jaw ?
But Stubb , he eats the whale by its own light , does he ?
For that business is an exceedingly laborious one ; is not very soon completed ; and requires all hands to set about it .
They viciously snapped , not only at each other ' s disembowelments , but like flexible bows , bent round , and bit their own ; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth , to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound .
It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures .
"
CHAPTER 67
The ivory Pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble ; every sailor a butcher .
Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange , so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it .
CHAPTER 68
Already you know what his blubber is .
That blubber is something of the consistence of firm , close - grained beef , but tougher , more elastic and compact , and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness .
True , from the unmarred dead body of the whale , you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin , transparent substance , somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass , only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin ; that is , previous to being dried , when it not only contracts and thickens , but becomes rather hard and brittle .
But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned , but seem to be seen through it , as if they were engraved upon the body itself .
It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales ; for I have most remarked them in the large , full - grown bulls of the species .
For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane ; or , still better , an Indian poncho slipt over his head , and skirting his extremity .
How wonderful is it then -- except after explanation -- that this great monster , to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man ; how wonderful that he should be found at home , immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters !
in all seasons a temperature of thine own .
Haul in the chains !
The peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre ; though changed in hue , it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk .
The vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship , and every rod that it so floats , what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls , augment the murderous din .
The sea - vultures all in pious mourning , the air - sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled .
And for years afterwards , perhaps , ships shun the place ; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum , because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held .
There ' s your law of precedents ; there ' s your utility of traditions ; there ' s the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth , and now not even hovering in the air !
There ' s orthodoxy !
Thus , while in life the great whale ' s body may have been a real terror to his foes , in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world .
It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan , he was beheaded .
Bear in mind , too , that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh ; and in that subterraneous manner , without so much as getting one single peep into the ever - contracting gash thus made , he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent , interdicted parts , and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull .
The Pequod ' s whale being decapitated and the body stripped , the head was hoisted against the ship ' s side -- about half way out of the sea , so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element .
" Speak , thou vast and venerable head ," muttered Ahab , " which , though ungarnished with a beard , yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses ; speak , mighty head , and tell us the secret thing that is in thee .
Thou hast been where bell or diver never went ; hast slept by many a sailor ' s side , where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down .
Thou saw ' st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck ; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw ; and his murderers still sailed on unharmed -- while swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched , longing arms .
" Aye ?
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies !
"
Hand in hand , ship and breeze blew on ; but the breeze came faster than the ship , and soon the Pequod began to rock .
But as she was so far to windward , and shooting by , apparently making a passage to some other ground , the Pequod could not hope to reach her .
Squaring her yards , she bore down , ranged abeam under the Pequod ' s lee , and lowered a boat ; it soon drew nigh ; but , as the side - ladder was being rigged by Starbuck ' s order to accommodate the visiting captain , the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat ' s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary .
For , though himself and boat ' s crew remained untainted , and though his ship was half a rifle - shot off , and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between ; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land , he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod .
But this did by no means prevent all communications .
Subject to this , and other the like interruptions now and then , a conversation was sustained between the two parties ; but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort .
Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam ' s boat , was a man of a singular appearance , even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities .
A long - skirted , cabalistically - cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him ; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists .
He published his manifesto , whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicar - general of all Oceanica .
So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew , that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship , not a man of them would remain .
Gabriel !
Beware of the horrible tail !
"
a broad white shadow rose from the sea ; by its quick , fanning motion , temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen .
Next instant , the luckless mate , so full of furious life , was smitten bodily into the air , and making a long arc in his descent , fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards .
Not a chip of the boat was harmed , nor a hair of any oarsman ' s head ; but the mate for ever sank .
He became a nameless terror to the ship .
"
It was sorely tumbled , damp , and covered with a dull , spotted , green mould , in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin .
" Nay , keep it thyself ," cried Gabriel to Ahab ; " thou art soon going that way .
Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars , and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod .
On the occasion in question , Queequeg figured in the Highland costume -- a shirt and socks -- in which to my eyes , at least , he appeared to uncommon advantage ; and no one had a better chance to observe him , as will presently be seen .
So , then , an elongated Siamese ligature united us .
True , you may say that , by exceeding caution , you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life .
Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night , the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass -- the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive .
and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half - drowned man ?
" I trust not ," said Starbuck , " it is poor stuff enough .
" Enough ," replied Starbuck , " only don ' t hit him again , but --"
What were you about saying , sir ?
So close did the monster come to the hull , that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice ; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom , within three rods of the planks , he wholly disappeared from view , as if diving under the keel .
But the fagged whale abated his speed , and blindly altering his course , went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him , so that they performed a complete circuit .
" I don ' t know , but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so , and he seems to know all about ships ' charms .
Flask , I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise .
Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship ?
He hasn ' t got any hammock ; but I ' ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging .
"
"
" What ' s the old man have so much to do with him for ?
"
"
" Why , do ye see , the old man is hard bent after that White Whale , and the devil there is trying to come round him , and get him to swap away his silver watch , or his soul , or something of that sort , and then he ' ll surrender Moby Dick .
Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil ?
" Duck him again ; and keep ducking him .
"
"
"
Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat .
throw all these thunder - heads overboard , and then you will float light and right .
Meantime , Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale ' s head , and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand .
Here , now , are two great whales , laying their heads together ; let us join them , and lay together our own .
In the present instance , too , this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit , giving token of advanced age and large experience .
Man may , in effect , be said to look out on the world from a sentry - box with two joined sashes for his window .
Not at all .-- Why then do you try to " enlarge " your mind ?
from floor to ceiling , lined , or rather papered with a glistening white membrane , glossy as bridal satins .
But come out now , and look at this portentous lower jaw , which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff - box , with the hinge at one end , instead of one side .
it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery , upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force .
Crossing the deck , let us now have a good long look at the Right Whale ' s head .
But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects , according to your point of view .
a sulk and pout , by carpenter ' s measurement , about twenty feet long and five feet deep ; a sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more .
Over this lip , as over a slippery threshold , we now slide into the mouth .
But in this particular , the demand has long been on the decline .
It was in Queen Anne ' s time that the bone was in its glory , the farthingale being then all the fashion .
And as those ancient dames moved about gaily , though in the jaws of the whale , as you may say ; even so , in a shower , with the like thoughtlessness , do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection ; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone .
But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment , and , standing in the Right Whale ' s mouth , look around you afresh .
Look your last , now , on these venerable hooded heads , while they yet lie together ; for one will soon sink , unrecorded , in the sea ; the other will not be very long in following .
But mark the other head ' s expression .
They do not suspend between them , at the point of coming contact , any merely hard substance , like iron or wood .
That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow - bars .
But supplementary to this , it has hypothetically occurred to me , that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them , capable , at will , of distension or contraction ; and as the Sperm Whale , as far as I know , has no such provision in him ; considering , too , the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface , and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water ; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope ; considering the unique interior of his head ; it has hypothetically occurred to me , I say , that those mystical lung - celled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air , so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction .
If this be so , fancy the irresistibleness of that might , to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes .
For unless you own the whale , you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in Truth .
CHAPTER 77
Regarding the Sperm Whale ' s head as a solid oblong , you may , on an inclined plane , sideways divide it into two quoins ,* whereof the lower is the bony structure , forming the cranium and jaws , and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones ; its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale .
The upper part , known as the Case , may be regarded as the great Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale .
Moreover , as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys , so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages ; namely , the highly - prized spermaceti , in its absolutely pure , limpid , and odoriferous state .
Cistern and Buckets .
Nimble as a cat , Tashtego mounts aloft ; and without altering his erect posture , runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard - arm , to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun .
He has carried with him a light tackle called a whip , consisting of only two parts , travelling through a single - sheaved block .
" Come down , come down !
" yelled the seamen to Daggoo , but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles , so that if the head should drop , he would still remain suspended ; the negro having cleared the foul line , rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well , meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it , and so be hoisted out .
The next , a loud splash announced that my brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue .
" cried Daggoo , all at once , from his now quiet , swinging perch overhead ; and looking further off from the side , we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves ; a sight strange to see , as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave .
both !-- it is both !
CHAPTER 79
Nor have Gall and his disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man .
He has no proper nose .
For as in landscape gardening , a spire , cupola , monument , or tower of some sort , is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene ; so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open - work belfry of the nose .
This aspect is sublime .
Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles , the elephant ' s brow is majestic .
Human or animal , the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees .
Few are the foreheads which like Shakespeare ' s or Melancthon ' s rise so high , and descend so low , that the eyes themselves seem clear , eternal , tideless mountain lakes ; and all above them in the forehead ' s wrinkles , you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink , as the Highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer .
But in the great Sperm Whale , this high and mighty god - like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified , that gazing on it , in that full front view , you feel the Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature .
For you see no one point precisely ; not one distinct feature is revealed ; no nose , eyes , ears , or mouth ; no face ; he has none , proper ; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead , pleated with riddles ; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats , and ships , and men .
Nor , in profile , does this wondrous brow diminish ; though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so .
No , his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it .
Unhinge the lower jaw , and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base .
If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end , which is the high end , you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull , beheld in the same situation , and from the same point of view .
If you attentively regard almost any quadruped ' s spine , you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls , all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper .
A foreign friend once pointed it out to me , in the skeleton of a foe he had slain , and with the vertebrae of which he was inlaying , in a sort of basso - relievo , the beaked prow of his canoe .
I would rather feel your spine than your skull , whoever you are .
" cried Starbuck , pointing to something wavingly held by the German .
"
However curious it may seem for an oil - ship to be borrowing oil on the whale - ground , and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle , yet sometimes such a thing really happens ; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp - feeder as Flask did declare .
Now , the game having risen to leeward , he and the other three German boats that soon followed him , had considerably the start of the Pequod ' s keels .
Aware of their danger , they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind , rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness .
Nevertheless , he stuck to their wake , though indeed their back water must have retarded him , because the white - bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one , like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet .
" said Stubb , " he has the stomach - ache , I ' m afraid .
" cried Starbuck ; " he mocks and dares me with the very poor - box I filled for him not five minutes ago !
Who ' s that been dropping an anchor overboard -- we don ' t budge an inch -- we ' re becalmed .
"
" Oh !
such a sogger !
The bank of England !-- Oh , DO , DO , DO !-- What ' s that Yarman about now ?
Fiercely , but evenly incited by the taunts of the German , the Pequod ' s three boats now began ranging almost abreast ; and , so disposed , momentarily neared him .
Every keel a sunbeam !
It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres .
this he ?
The lines , of which , hardly an instant before , not one hand ' s breadth could have been gained , were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats , and soon the whale broke water within two ship ' s lengths of the hunters .
From this last vent no blood yet came , because no vital part of him had thus far been struck .
But pity there was none .
" A nice spot ," cried Flask ; " just let me prick him there once .
"
" cried Starbuck , " there ' s no need of that !
For , by this time , so spent was he by loss of blood , that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made ; lay panting on his side , impotently flapped with his stumped fin , then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world ; turned up the white secrets of his belly ; lay like a log , and died .
By very heedful management , when the ship drew nigh , the whale was transferred to her side , and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke - chains , for it was plain that unless artificially upheld , the body would at once sink to the bottom .
It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade , the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh , on the lower part of the bunch before described .
But still more curious was the fact of a lance - head of stone being found in him , not far from the buried iron , the flesh perfectly firm about it .
What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling .
"
Aye , aye ," cried Queequeg , and seizing the carpenter ' s heavy hatchet , he leaned out of a porthole , and steel to iron , began slashing at the largest fluke - chains .
Besides , it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St . George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land , instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep .
And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop .
How is that ?
But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of Nineveh ?
And so it was .
Nevertheless , the boats pursued , and Stubb ' s was foremost .
Next moment with a rapid , nameless impulse , in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance , and quivers in the life spot of the whale .
Instead of sparkling water , he now spouts red blood .
"' Tis July ' s immortal Fourth ; all fountains must run wine today !
Then , Tashtego , lad , I ' d have ye hold a canakin to the jet , and we ' d drink round it !
The Fountain .
But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs , like a human being ' s , the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere .
But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth , for , in his ordinary attitude , the Sperm Whale ' s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface ; and what is still more , his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth .
And not till those seventy breaths are told , will he finally go down to stay out his full term below .
Sure it is , nevertheless , that the Sperm Whale has no proper olfactories .
The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it ; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it , when , always , when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout , he is in a prodigious commotion , the water cascading all around him .
For even when coming into slight contact with the outer , vapoury shreds of the jet , which will often happen , your skin will feverishly smart , from the acridness of the thing so touching it .
The wisest thing the investigator can do then , it seems to me , is to let this deadly spout alone .
And I am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings , such as Plato , Pyrrho , the Devil , Jupiter , Dante , and so on , there always goes up a certain semi - visible steam , while in the act of thinking deep thoughts .
The invariable moisture of my hair , while plunged in deep thought , after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic , of an August noon ; this seems an additional argument for the above supposition .
CHAPTER 86
Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale ' s tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man , it comprises upon its upper surface alone , an area of at least fifty square feet .
The fibres in the upper and lower layers , are long and horizontal ; those of the middle one , very short , and running crosswise between the outside layers .
This triune structure , as much as anything else , imparts power to the tail .
On the contrary , those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it .
Therein no fairy ' s arm can transcend it .
First , when used as a fin for progression ; Second , when used as a mace in battle ; Third , in sweeping ; Fourth , in lobtailing ; Fifth , in peaking flukes .
It never wriggles .
On more accounts than one , a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail ; for I have heard of yet another elephant , that when wounded in the fight , curved round his trunk and extracted the dart .
You would almost think a great gun had been discharged ; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour from the spiracle at his other extremity , you would think that that was the smoke from the touch - hole .
Excepting the sublime BREACH -- somewhere else to be described -- this peaking of the whale ' s flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature .
For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to Leviathan , so , compared with Leviathan ' s tail , his trunk is but the stalk of a lily .
The most direful blow from the elephant ' s trunk were as the playful tap of a fan , compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whale ' s ponderous flukes , which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air , very much as an Indian juggler tosses his balls .
* Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous , inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant ; nevertheless , there are not wanting some points of curious similitude ; among these is the spout .
much more , how comprehend his face , when face he has none ?
Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
Nay .
But here be it premised , that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans , the Sperm Whales , instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies , as in former times , are now frequently met with in extensive herds , sometimes embracing so great a multitude , that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection .
If the wind only held , little doubt had they , that chased through these Straits of Sunda , the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number .
As with glass under arm , Ahab to - and - fro paced the deck ; in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased , and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above seemed his .
As , blind and deaf , the whale plunged forward , as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him ; as we thus tore a white gash in the sea , on all sides menaced as we flew , by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us ; our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by ice - isles in a tempest , and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits , knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed .
All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances , originally invented by the Nantucket Indians , called druggs .
It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used .
They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball .
For , suspended in those watery vaults , floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales , and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers .
" Line !
" What ails ye , man ?
" cried Starbuck .
" Look - e here ," said Queequeg , pointing down .
It is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert , to seek to hamstring him , as it were , by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail - tendon .
It is done by darting a short - handled cutting - spade , to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again .
So that tormented to madness , he was now churning through the water , violently flailing with his flexible tail , and tossing the keen spade about him , wounding and murdering his own comrades .
Oars !
Stand up -- stand up , and stay so !
"
But by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening ; then giving way rapidly , and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet .
Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was , it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement ; for having clumped together at last in one dense body , they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness .
The waif is a pennoned pole , two or three of which are carried by every boat ; and which , when additional game is at hand , are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale , both to mark its place on the sea , and also as token of prior possession , should the boats of any other ship draw near .
The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm Whales , and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations .
In truth , this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman , swimming about over the watery world , surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem .
Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming that way , presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies , with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him , and chases him away !
The schools composing none but young and vigorous males , previously mentioned , offer a strong contrast to the harem schools .
These pleadings , and the counter pleadings , being duly heard , the very learned Judge in set terms decided , to wit ,-- That as for the boat , he awarded it to the plaintiffs , because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives ; but that with regard to the controverted whale , harpoons , and line , they belonged to the defendants ; the whale , because it was a Loose - Fish at the time of the final capture ; and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them , it ( the fish ) acquired a property in those articles ; and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them .
What is yonder undetected villain ' s marble mansion with a door - plate for a waif ; what is that but a Fast - Fish ?
What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai , the broker , gets from poor Woebegone , the bankrupt , on a loan to keep Woebegone ' s family from starvation ; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast - Fish ?
What to that redoubted harpooneer , John Bull , is poor Ireland , but a Fast - Fish ?
What India to England ?
What at last will Mexico be to the United States ?
But not so .
Now when these poor sun - burnt mariners , bare - footed , and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs , had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry , promising themselves a good L150 from the precious oil and bone ; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives , and good ale with their cronies , upon the strength of their respective shares ; up steps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman , with a copy of Blackstone under his arm ; and laying it upon the whale ' s head , he says --" Hands off !
I seize it as the Lord Warden ' s .
"
"
" Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of getting a livelihood ?
" It is his .
Thinking that viewed in some particular lights , the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed , under the circumstances , a rather hard one , an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace , begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration .
We must needs inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with that right .
In his treatise on " Queen - Gold ," or Queen - pinmoney , an old King ' s Bench author , one William Prynne , thus discourseth : " Ye tail is ye Queen ' s , that ye Queen ' s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone .
There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers -- the whale and the sturgeon ; both royal property under certain limitations , and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown ' s ordinary revenue .
Nevertheless , in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this , however much he may shun blasted whales in general .
" There ' s a pretty fellow , now ," he banteringly laughed , standing in the ship ' s bows , " there ' s a jackal for ye !
I say , pass round a hat , some one , and let ' s make him a present of a little oil for dear charity ' s sake .
For what oil he ' ll get from that drugged whale there , wouldn ' t be fit to burn in a jail ; no , not in a condemned cell .
I wonder now if our old man has thought of that .
Upon her head boards , in large gilt letters , he read " Bouton de Rose ,"-- Rose - button , or Rose - bud ; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship .
" he cried with his hand to his nose , " that will do very well ; but how like all creation it smells !
Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck , he had to pull round the bows to the starboard side , and thus come close to the blasted whale ; and so talk over it .
Arrived then at this spot , with one hand still to his nose , he bawled --" Bouton - de - Rose , ahoy !
" Yes ," rejoined a Guernsey - man from the bulwarks , who turned out to be the chief - mate .
" WHAT whale ?
" The WHITE Whale -- a Sperm Whale -- Moby Dick , have ye seen him ?
Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod , and seeing Ahab leaning over the quarter - deck rail awaiting his report , he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shouted --" No , Sir !
" Broke it ?
" I wish it was broken , or that I didn ' t have any nose at all !
" roared the Guernseyman , flying into a sudden passion .
" I know that well enough ; but , d ' ye see , the Captain here won ' t believe it ; this is his first voyage ; he was a Cologne manufacturer before .
But come aboard , and mayhap he ' ll believe you , if he won ' t me ; and so I ' ll get out of this dirty scrape .
Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the Captain ' s round - house abaft ; and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door , which was held ajar from within .
This was the tormented surgeon , who , after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day , had betaken himself to the Captain ' s round - house ( CABINET he called it ) to avoid the pest ; but still , could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times .
Marking all this , Stubb argued well for his scheme , and turning to the Guernsey - man had a little chat with him , during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus , who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle .
" Why ," said Stubb , eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals , " you may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me , though I don ' t pretend to be a judge .
Upon this the captain started , and eagerly desired to know more .
" said the Guernsey - man to Stubb .
"
While the Frenchman ' s boats , then , were engaged in towing the ship one way , Stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way , ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow - line .
The Turks use it in cooking , and also carry it to Mecca , for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St . Peter ' s in Rome .
Who would think , then , that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale !
It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman , that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod ' s crew ; an event most lamentable ; and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own .
In outer aspect , Pip and Dough - Boy made a match , like a black pony and a white one , of equal developments , though of dissimilar colour , driven in one eccentric span .
poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .
In less than half a minute , this entire thing happened .
" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted , that though man loved his fellow , yet man is a money - making animal , which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence .
He saw God ' s foot upon the treadle of the loom , and spoke it ; and therefore his shipmates called him mad .
So man ' s insanity is heaven ' s sense ; and wandering from all mortal reason , man comes at last to that celestial thought , which , to reason , is absurd and frantic ; and weal or woe , feels then uncompromised , indifferent as his God .
such a sweetener !
such a softener !
It is called slobgollion ; an appellation original with the whalemen , and even so is the nature of the substance .
It is an ineffably oozy , stringy affair , most frequently found in the tubs of sperm , after a prolonged squeezing , and subsequent decanting .
Gurry , so called , is a term properly belonging to right whalemen , but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen .
Toes are scarce among veteran blubber - room men .
The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling .
Immemorial to all his order , this investiture alone will adequately protect him , while employed in the peculiar functions of his office .
Bible leaves !
This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer .
She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship .
It is as if from the open field a brick - kiln were transported to her planks .
The try - works are planted between the foremast and mainmast , the most roomy part of the deck .
Removing this hatch we expose the great try - pots , two in number , and each of several barrels ' capacity .
While employed in polishing them -- one man in each pot , side by side -- many confidential communications are carried on , over the iron lips .
It was in the left hand try - pot of the Pequod , with the soapstone diligently circling round me , that I was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact , that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid , my soapstone for example , will descend from any point in precisely the same time .
Here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try - works has to be fed for a time with wood .
for his smoke is horrible to inhale , and inhale it you must , and not only that , but you must live in it for the time .
The hatch , removed from the top of the works , now afforded a wide hearth in front of them .
Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers , always the whale - ship ' s stokers .
Their tawny features , now all begrimed with smoke and sweat , their matted beards , and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth , all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works .
Wrapped , for that interval , in darkness myself , I but the better saw the redness , the madness , the ghastliness of others .
Starting from a brief standing sleep , I was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong .
But , spite of all this , I could see no compass before me to steer by ; though it seemed but a minute since I had been watching the card , by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it .
Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom , now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness .
There is a wisdom that is woe ; but there is a woe that is madness .
And there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges , and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces .
Stowing Down and Clearing Up .
Now , with elated step , they pace the planks in twos and threes , and humorously discourse of parlors , sofas , carpets , and fine cambrics ; propose to mat the deck ; think of having hanging to the top ; object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle .
To hint to such musked mariners of oil , and bone , and blubber , were little short of audacity .
Yes ; and many is the time , when , after the severest uninterrupted labors , which know no night ; continuing straight through for ninety - six hours ; when from the boat , where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the Line ,-- they only step to the deck to carry vast chains , and heave the heavy windlass , and cut and slash , yea , and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try - works ; when , on the heel of all this , they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship , and make a spotless dairy room of it ; many is the time the poor fellows , just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks , are startled by the cry of " There she blows !
Now this doubloon was of purest , virgin gold , raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills , whence , east and west , over golden sands , the head - waters of many a Pactolus flows .
For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe - striking end ; and however wanton in their sailor ways , one and all , the mariners revered it as the white whale ' s talisman .
It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example of these things .
Before this equatorial coin , Ahab , not unobserved by others , was now pausing .
From storm to storm !
I have never marked the coin inspectingly .
" There now ' s the old Mogul ," soliloquized Stubb by the try - works , " he ' s been twigging it ; and there goes Starbuck from the same , and both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long .
Halloa !
Come , Almanack !
comes Cancer the Crab , and drags us back ; and here , going from Virtue , Leo , a roaring Lion , lies in the path -- he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw ; we escape , and hail Virgo , the Virgin !
There ; he ' s before it ; he ' ll out with something presently .
So , so ; he ' s beginning .
" Shall I call that wise or foolish , now ; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it ; yet , if it be really foolish , then has it a sort of wiseish look to it .
But , avast ; here comes our old Manxman -- the old hearse - driver , he must have been , that is , before he took to the sea .
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?
The lion is the horse - shoe sign -- the roaring and devouring lion .
As I live he ' s comparing notes ; looking at his thigh bone ; thinks the sun is in the thigh , or in the calf , or in the bowels , I suppose , as the old women talk Surgeon ' s Astronomy in the back country .
And by Jove , he ' s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh -- I guess it ' s Sagittarius , or the Archer .
Stand away again and hear him .
Improving his mind , poor fellow !
But what ' s that he says now -- hist !
"
" Why , he ' s getting it by heart -- hist !
"
" Well , that ' s funny .
"
Ain ' t I a crow ?
So , so , I leave him muttering .
But , unscrew your navel , and what ' s the consequence ?
Then again , if it stays here , that is ugly , too , for when aught ' s nailed to the mast it ' s a sign that things grow desperate .
Hish !
CHAPTER 100
" and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it , he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone , terminating in a wooden head like a mallet .
In the excitement of the moment , Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own , and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the Pequod , and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moment ' s warning .
As good luck would have it , they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous , and the great tackles were still aloft , and the massive curved blubber - hook , now clean and dry , was still attached to the end .
" Spin me the yarn ," said Ahab ; " how was it ?
Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale , with a milky - white head and hump , all crows ' feet and wrinkles .
" Well , this old great - grandfather , with the white head and hump , runs all afoam into the pod , and goes to snapping furiously at my fast - line !
" Aye , I see !-- wanted to part it ; free the fast - fish -- an old trick -- I know him .
And thinking the hap - hazard line would get loose , or the tooth it was tangled to might draw ( for I have a devil of a boat ' s crew for a pull on a whale - line ); seeing all this , I say , I jumped into my first mate ' s boat -- Mr . Mounttop ' s here ( by the way , Captain -- Mounttop ; Mounttop -- the captain );-- as I was saying , I jumped into Mounttop ' s boat , which , d ' ye see , was gunwale and gunwale with mine , then ; and snatching the first harpoon , let this old great - grandfather have it .
" Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship ," interrupted the one - armed captain , addressing Ahab ; " go on , boy .
" chimed in the patient himself ; then suddenly altering his voice , " Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night , till he couldn ' t see to put on the bandages ; and sending me to bed , half seas over , about three o ' clock in the morning .
" Yes , I may as well ," said the surgeon , coolly .
In short , it grew black ; I knew what was threatened , and off it came .
But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there ; that thing is against all rule "-- pointing at it with the marlingspike --" that is the captain ' s work , not mine ; he ordered the carpenter to make it ; he had that club - hammer there put to the end , to knock some one ' s brains out with , I suppose , as he tried mine once .
" No , I don ' t ," said the captain , " but his mother did ; he was born with it .
"
" Did ' st thou cross his wake again ?
"
"
He was heading east , I think .-- Is your Captain crazy ?
CHAPTER 101
How long , prior to the year of our Lord 1775 , this great whaling house was in existence , my numerous fish - documents do not make plain ; but in that year ( 1775 ) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale ; though for some score of years previous ( ever since 1726 ) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan , but only in the North and South Atlantic : not elsewhere .
Flip ?
They had dumplings too ; small , but substantial , symmetrically globular , and indestructible dumplings .
The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is matter for historical research .
" In short , this ancient and learned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland ; and , among other subjects , contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery .
of beef .
550 ankers of Geneva .
At the time , I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer , beef , and bread , during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me , capable of a transcendental and Platonic application ; and , furthermore , I compiled supplementary tables of my own , touching the probable quantity of stock - fish , etc ., consumed by every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen whale fishery .
In the first place , the amount of butter , and Texel and Leyden cheese consumed , seems amazing .
Yet they did aim at them , and hit them too .
For , say they , when cruising in an empty ship , if you can get nothing better out of the world , get a good dinner out of it , at least .
unseen weaver !-- pause !-- one word !-- whither flows the fabric ?
The spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles ; those same words are plainly heard without the walls , bursting from the opened casements .
To and fro I paced before this skeleton -- brushed the vines aside -- broke through the ribs -- and with a ball of Arsacidean twine , wandered , eddied long amid its many winding , shaded colonnades and arbours .
" " Aye , priests -- well , how long do ye make him , then ?
" But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them , concerning feet and inches ; they cracked each other ' s sconces with their yard - sticks -- the great skull echoed -- and seizing that lucky chance , I quickly concluded my own admeasurements .
Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column ; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum ; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead .
But as I was crowded for space , and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing -- at least , what untattooed parts might remain -- I did not trouble myself with the odd inches ; nor , indeed , should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale .
In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams .
The largest of the Tranque ribs , one of the middle ones , occupied that part of the fish which , in life , is greatest in depth .
Now , the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet ; whereas , the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet .
The largest , a middle one , is in width something less than three feet , and in depth more than four .
CHAPTER 104
From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge , amplify , and generally expatiate .
Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary .
And though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time , they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects , to justify their taking rank as Cetacean fossils .
The awe - stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels .
A significant illustration of the fact , again and again repeated in this book , that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body .
Then the whole world was the whale ' s ; and , king of creation , he left his wake along the present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs .
Who can show a pedigree like Leviathan ?
But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre - adamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature , and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust ; but upon Egyptian tablets , whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character , we find the unmistakable print of his fin .
CHAPTER 105
And I have heard , on whalemen ' s authority , that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture .
But may it not be , that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods ; may it not be , that since Adam ' s time they have degenerated ?
And even in the days of Banks and Solander , Cooke ' s naturalists , we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales ( reydan - siskur , or Wrinkled Bellies ) at one hundred and twenty yards ; that is , three hundred and sixty feet .
Because I cannot understand how it is , that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born , do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks ; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets , by the relative proportions in which they are drawn , just as plainly prove that the high - bred , stall - fed , prize cattle of Smithfield , not only equal , but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh ' s fat kine ; in the face of all this , I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated .
But you must look at this matter in every light .
In Noah ' s flood he despised Noah ' s Ark ; and if ever the world is to be again flooded , like the Netherlands , to kill off its rats , then the eternal whale will still survive , and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood , spout his frothed defiance to the skies .
He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half - splintering shock .
And when after gaining his own deck , and his own pivot - hole there , he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman ( it was , as ever , something about his not steering inflexibly enough ); then , the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench , that though it still remained entire , and to all appearances lusty , yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy .
For it had not been very long prior to the Pequod ' s sailing from Nantucket , that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground , and insensible ; by some unknown , and seemingly inexplicable , unimaginable casualty , his ivory limb having been so violently displaced , that it had stake - wise smitten , and all but pierced his groin ; nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured .
And when that functionary appeared before him , he bade him without delay set about making a new leg , and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw - ivory ( Sperm Whale ) which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage , in order that a careful selection of the stoutest , clearest - grained stuff might be secured .
This done , the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night ; and to provide all the fittings for it , independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use .
CHAPTER 107
Like all sea - going ship carpenters , and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels , he was , to a certain off - handed , practical extent , alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own ; the carpenter ' s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material .
A lost land - bird of strange plumage strays on board , and is made a captive : out of clean shaved rods of right - whale bone , and cross - beams of sperm whale ivory , the carpenter makes a pagoda - looking cage for it .
Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar ; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood , the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation .
But not precisely so .
He was a stript abstract ; an unfractioned integral ; uncompromised as a new - born babe ; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next .
You might almost say , that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence ; for in his numerous trades , he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct , or simply because he had been tutored to it , or by any intermixture of all these , even or uneven ; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb , spontaneous literal process .
He was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful , MULTUM IN PARVO , Sheffield contrivances , assuming the exterior -- though a little swelled -- of a common pocket knife ; but containing , not only blades of various sizes , but also screw - drivers , cork - screws , tweezers , awls , pens , rulers , nail - filers , countersinkers .
What that was , whether essence of quicksilver , or a few drops of hartshorn , there is no telling .
Halloa , this bone dust is ( SNEEZES )-- why it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- yes it ' s ( SNEEZES )-- bless my soul , it won ' t let me speak !
This is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber .
If the captain pleases , I will now mark the length .
Let me measure , sir .
good .
Well , it ' s not the first time .
What ' s Prometheus about there ?-- the blacksmith , I mean -- what ' s he about ?
How the soot flies !
Sir ?
Imprimis , fifty feet high in his socks ; then , chest modelled after the Thames Tunnel ; then , legs with roots to ' em , to stay in one place ; then , arms three feet through the wrist ; no heart at all , brass forehead , and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains ; and let me see -- shall I order eyes to see outwards ?
Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols .
I thought , sir , that you spoke to carpenter .
clay , sir ?
That ' s mud ; we leave clay to ditchers , sir .
Take the hint , then ; and when thou art dead , never bury thyself under living people ' s noses .
Sir ?-- oh !
Canst thou not drive that old Adam away ?
Truly , sir , if it comes to that , I must calculate over again ; I think I didn ' t carry a small figure , sir .
CARPENTER ( RESUMING HIS WORK ).
Well , well , well !
And here ' s his leg !
I ' m a sort of strange - thoughted sometimes , they say ; but that ' s only haphazard - like .
And here ' s the heron ' s leg !
long and slim , sure enough !
Begone !
The oil in the hold is leaking , sir .
" Either do that , sir , or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year .
Aye !
I ' ll not have the Burtons hoisted .
" Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons .
" Nay , sir , not yet ; I do entreat .
Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack ( forming part of most South - Sea - men ' s cabin furniture ), and pointing it towards Starbuck , exclaimed : " There is one God that is Lord over the earth , and one Captain that is lord over the Pequod .-- On deck !
It may have been a flash of honesty in him ; or mere prudential policy which , under the circumstance , imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection , however transient , in the important chief officer of his ship .
So deep did they go ; and so ancient , and corroded , and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons , that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner - stone cask containing coins of Captain Noah , with copies of the posted placards , vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood .
Well was it that the Typhoons did not visit them then .
So with poor Queequeg , who , as harpooneer , must not only face all the rage of the living whale , but -- as we have elsewhere seen -- mount his dead back in a rolling sea ; and finally descend into the gloom of the hold , and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement , resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage .
when the ship was about half disembowelled , you should have stooped over the hatchway , and peered down upon him there ; where , stripped to his woollen drawers , the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime , like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well .
How he wasted and wasted away in those few long - lingering days , till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing .
For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man , never yet was put into words or books .
poor fellow !
The head part turned over with a leather hinge , and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view .
" Poor rover !
where go ye now ?
Now , Queequeg , die ; and I ' ll beat ye your dying march .
Hark ye ; if ye find Pip , tell all the Antilles he ' s a runaway ; a coward , a coward , a coward !
I ' d never beat my tambourine over base Pip , and hail him General , if he were once more dying here .
Pip was led away , and the sick man was replaced in his hammock .
With a wild whimsiness , he now used his coffin for a sea - chest ; and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes , set them in order there .
CHAPTER 111
And meet it is , that over these sea - pastures , wide - rolling watery prairies and Potters ' Fields of all four continents , the waves should rise and fall , and ebb and flow unceasingly ; for here , millions of mixed shades and shadows , drowned dreams , somnambulisms , reveries ; all that we call lives and souls , lie dreaming , dreaming , still ; tossing like slumberers in their beds ; the ever - rolling waves but made so by their restlessness .
But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab ' s brain , as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging , with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles ( in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking ), and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea ; that sea in which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming .
The Blacksmith .
Availing himself of the mild , summer - cool weather that now reigned in these latitudes , and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated , Perth , the begrimed , blistered old blacksmith , had not removed his portable forge to the hold again , after concluding his contributory work for Ahab ' s leg , but still retained it on deck , fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast ; being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen , and harpooneers , and bowsmen to do some little job for them ; altering , or repairing , or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture .
Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons , and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled .
He had been an artisan of famed excellence , and with plenty to do ; owned a house and garden ; embraced a youthful , daughter - like , loving wife , and three blithe , ruddy children ; every Sunday went to a cheerful - looking church , planted in a grove .
Why tell the whole ?
And so Perth went a - whaling .
CHAPTER 113
How can ' st thou endure without being mad ?
"
"
" Look ye here , then ," cried Ahab , passionately advancing , and leaning with both hands on Perth ' s shoulders ; " look ye here -- HERE -- can ye smoothe out a seam like this , blacksmith ," sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow ; " if thou could ' st , blacksmith , glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil , and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes .
Answer !
" Look ye , blacksmith , these are the gathered nail - stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses .
" Horse - shoe stubbs , sir ?
Quick !
When at last the twelve rods were made , Ahab tried them , one by one , by spiralling them , with his own hand , round a long , heavy iron bolt .
" Work that over again , Perth .
"
" Pray God , not that ; yet I fear something , Captain Ahab .
Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape , and welded by Perth to the shank , the steel soon pointed the end of the iron ; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat , prior to tempering them , he cried to Ahab to place the water - cask near .
Ahoy , there !
What say ye , pagans !
Will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb ?
This done , pole , iron , and rope -- like the Three Fates -- remained inseparable , and Ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon ; the sound of his ivory leg , and the sound of the hickory pole , both hollowly ringing along every plank .
thy wretched laugh , thy idle but unresting eye ; all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship , and mocked it !
CHAPTER 114
The Gilder .
CHAPTER 115
The three men at her mast - head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats ; from the stern , a whale - boat was suspended , bottom down ; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain .
Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm , but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for , from the ships she had met ; and these were stowed along the deck , and in the captain ' s and officers ' state - rooms .
"
" Not enough to speak of -- two islanders , that ' s all ;-- but come aboard , old hearty , come along .
" How wondrous familiar is a fool !
Set all sail , and keep her to the wind !
The Dying Whale .
So seemed it with the Pequod .
" He turns and turns him to it ,-- how slowly , but how steadfastly , his homage - rendering and invoking brow , with his last dying motions .
Yet dost thou , darker half , rock me with a prouder , if a darker faith .
"
It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude .
At length the desired observation was taken ; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg , Ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant .
This instant thou must be eyeing him .
babies ' plaything of haughty Admirals , and Commodores , and Captains ; the world brags of thee , of thy cunning and might ; but what after all canst thou do , but tell the poor , pitiful point , where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet , and the hand that holds thee : no !
Curse thee , thou quadrant !
It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky , like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town .
Though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ' s ) did not escape .
But never mind ; it ' s all in fun : so the old song says ;"--( SINGS .
Oh !
"
" Madman !
" Here !
"
"
" Who ' s there ?
" Blast the boat !
let it go !
" No , no , it wasn ' t ; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all ; and I hope they will , still .
"
Glancing upwards , he cried : " See !
thou clear spirit of clear fire , whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship , till in the sacramental act so burned by thee , that to this hour I bear the scar ; I now know thee , thou clear spirit , and I now know that thy right worship is defiance .
I own thy speechless , placeless power ; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional , unintegral mastery in me .
" I own thy speechless , placeless power ; said I not so ?
I would not take it .
Light though thou be , thou leapest out of darkness ; but I am darkness leaping out of light , leaping out of thee !
Oh , cruel !
what hast thou done with her ?
There lies my puzzle ; but thine is greater .
There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee , thou clear spirit , to whom all thy eternity is but time , all thy creativeness mechanical .
Through thee , thy flaming self , my scorched eyes do dimly see it .
Here again with haughty agony , I read my sire .
the boat !
For the moment all the aghast mate ' s thoughts seemed theirs ; they raised a half mutinous cry .
" All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine ; and heart , soul , and body , lungs and life , old Ahab is bound .
CHAPTER 120
We must send down the main - top - sail yard , sir .
The band is working loose and the lee lift is half - stranded .
" Strike nothing , and stir nothing , but lash everything .
I would e ' en take it for sublime , did I not know that the colic is a noisy malady .
No , Stubb ; you may pound that knot there as much as you please , but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying .
Didn ' t you once say that whatever ship Ahab sails in , that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy , just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward ?
Stop , now ; didn ' t you say so ?
Shake yourself ; you ' re Aquarius , or the water - bearer , Flask ; might fill pitchers at your coat collar .
Don ' t you see , then , that for these extra risks the Marine Insurance companies have extra guarantees ?
Here are hydrants , Flask .
You sometimes find it rather hard .
There , hammer that knot down , and we ' ve done .
The tails tapering down that way , serve to carry off the water , d ' ye see .
whew !
there goes my tarpaulin overboard ; Lord , Lord , that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly !
THE MAIN - TOP - SAIL YARD .-- TASHTEGO PASSING NEW LASHINGS AROUND IT .
Um , um , um .
The Musket .
The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there , though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements .
I ' ll cure myself of this .
But how fair ?
Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale ?
Not reasoning ; not remonstrance ; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to ; all this thou scornest .
hope to wrest this old man ' s living power from his own living hands ?
I must see to the deck here .
The Needle .
thou mightest well be taken now for the sea - chariot of the sun .
all ye nations before my prow , I bring the sun to ye !
a tandem , I drive the sea !
Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle , Ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses ; his uplifted arm slowly fell ; for a moment he almost seemed to stagger .
Deliberately standing before the binnacle , and eyeing the transpointed compasses , the old man , with the sharp of his extended hand , now took the precise bearing of the sun , and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted , shouted out his orders for the ship ' s course to be changed accordingly .
Meanwhile , whatever were his own secret thoughts , Starbuck said nothing , but quietly he issued all requisite orders ; while Stubb and Flask -- who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings -- likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced .
Mr . Starbuck -- a lance without a pole ; a top - maul , and the smallest of the sail - maker ' s needles .
Quick !
But Starbuck looked away .
At first , the steel went round and round , quivering and vibrating at either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when Ahab , who had been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed ,--" Look ye , for yourselves , if Ahab be not lord of the level loadstone !
"
Two seamen came .
" Take the reel , one of ye , I ' ll heave .
They went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ' s lee side , where the deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost dipping into the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea .
Ahab stood before him , and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary hand - coil to toss overboard , when the old Manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to speak .
Long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ?
Or , truer perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it .
" I hold the spool , sir .
" In the little rocky Isle of Man , sir .
" Excellent !
Thou ' st hit the world by that .
Up with the reel !
"
cut it off -- we haul in no cowards here .
" Hands off from that holiness !
Lo !
Oh God !
" Bell - boy , sir ; ship ' s - crier ; ding , dong , ding !
Come , let ' s down .
here ' s velvet shark - skin ," intently gazing at Ahab ' s hand , and feeling it .
" Ah , now , had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this , perhaps he had ne ' er been lost !
Oh , sir , let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for I will not let this go .
" Oh , boy , nor will I thee , unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here .
I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand , than though I grasped an Emperor ' s !
The Life - Buoy .
" A life - buoy of a coffin !
" moving his hand as with a caulking - iron .
" Aye .
Now I don ' t like this .
We workers in woods make bridal - bedsteads and card - tables , as well as coffins and hearses .
We work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded cobbling , and then we stash it if we can .
I ' ll do the job , now , tenderly .
CHAPTER 127
He goes !
" I believe it did , sir ; does the ferrule stand , sir ?
Thou art as unprincipled as the gods , and as much of a jack - of - all - trades .
"
"
Do I sing ?
" Faith , sir , I ' ve --"
"
" Um , um ; go on .
Look at thy bosom !
)
that thing rests on two line - tubs , full of tow - lines .
A most malicious wag , that fellow .
Oh !
how immaterial are all materials !
What things real are there , but imponderable thoughts ?
Here now ' s the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere hap , made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life .
I ' ll think of that .
But no .
Will ye never have done , Carpenter , with that accursed sound ?
The Pequod Meets The Rachel .
" Aye , yesterday .
Throttling his joy , Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question ; and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain himself , having stopped his vessel ' s way , was seen descending her side .
A few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the Pequod ' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck .
" Where was he ?-- not killed !-- not killed !
"
But the captain , for some unknown constitutional reason , had refrained from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by Ahab ' s iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer ' s paternal love , had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race .
"
God bless ye , man , and may I forgive myself , but I must go .
The Cabin .
( AHAB MOVING TO GO ON DECK ; PIP CATCHES HIM BY THE HAND TO FOLLOW .
There is that in thee , poor lad , which I feel too curing to my malady .
"
spite of million villains , this makes me a bigot in the fadeless fidelity of man !-- and a black !
" If thou speakest thus to me much more , Ahab ' s purpose keels up in him .
"
" Oh good master , master , master !
" Weep so , and I will murder thee !
( AHAB GOES ; PIP STEPS ONE STEP FORWARD .
Pip !
Who ' s seen Pip ?
Jumped from a whale - boat once ;-- seen him ?
As the unsetting polar star , which through the livelong , arctic , six months ' night sustains its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so Ahab ' s purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew .
Though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , they seemed pole - like asunder .
At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn , his iron voice was heard from aft ,--" Man the mast - heads !
Ahab must have the doubloon !
But already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long hooked bill at his head : with a scream , the black hawk darted away with his prize .
But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good .
" The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that ," answered the other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together .
" Not forged !
Only THAT one I bury ; the rest were buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb .
" cried Ahab like lightning to his men .
But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism .
"
And at the girdling line of the horizon , a soft and tremulous motion -- most seen here at the Equator -- denoted the fond , throbbing trust , the loving alarms , with which the poor bride gave her bosom away .
That glad , happy air , that winsome sky , did at last stroke and caress him ; the step - mother world , so long cruel -- forbidding -- now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , and did seem to joyously sob over him , as if over one , that however wilful and erring , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless .
Aye and yes , Starbuck , out of those forty years I have not spent three ashore .
Guinea - coast slavery of solitary command !-- when I think of all this ; only half - suspected , not so keenly known to me before -- and how for forty years I have fed upon dry salted fare -- fit emblem of the dry nourishment of my soil !-- when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily hand , and broken the world ' s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts -- away , whole oceans away , from that young girl - wife I wedded past fifty , and sailed for Cape Horn the next day , leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow -- wife ?
Why this strife of the chase ?
how the richer or better is Ahab now ?
Oh , Starbuck !
this is the magic glass , man ; I see my wife and my child in thine eye .
noble soul !
Wife and child , too , are Starbuck ' s -- wife and child of his brotherly , sisterly , play - fellow youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , longing , paternal old age !
Is Ahab , Ahab ?
who put it into him to chase and fang that flying - fish ?
CHAPTER 133
The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak , by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it , the polished metallic - like marks of some swift tide - rip , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream .
" What d ' ye see ?
Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three look - outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing .
" And did none of ye see it before ?
Stand by three boats .
Mr . Starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship .
Luff , luff a point !
Hard down the helm !-- brace up !
"
Their vision was keener than man ' s ; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea .
It was Moby Dick ' s open mouth and scrolled jaw ; his vast , shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea .
Then , calling upon Fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and seizing Perth ' s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern .
Through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it thrilled for an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of a biting shark , slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth , so that the long , narrow , scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row - lock .
These floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew at the stern - wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across .
But only slipping further into the whale ' s mouth , and tilting over sideways as it slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea .
The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus ' s elephants in the book of Maccabees .
For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale ' s aspect , and so planetarily swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them .
Dragged into Stubb ' s boat with blood - shot , blinded eyes , the white brine caking in his wrinkles ; the long tension of Ahab ' s bodily strength did crack , and helplessly he yielded to his body ' s doom : for a time , lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb ' s boat , like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants .
" The harpoon ," said Ahab , half way rising , and draggingly leaning on one bended arm --" is it safe ?
" Aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it ," said Stubb , showing it .
" Lay it before me ;-- any missing men ?
" That ' s good .-- Help me , man ; I wish to stand .
there !
As he was thus walking , uttering no sound , except to hail the men aloft , or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still greater breadth -- thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon the quarter - deck , and lay there reversed ; broken bow to shattered stern .
At last he paused before it ; and as in an already over - clouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ' s face there now stole some such added gloom as this .
Man , man !
" Aye , sir ," said Starbuck drawing near , "' tis a solemn sight ; an omen , and an ill one .
omen ?-- the dictionary !
Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing ; Starbuck is Stubb reversed , and Stubb is Starbuck ; and ye two are all mankind ; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth , nor gods nor men his neighbors !
Down royals and top - gallant stun - sails , Mr . Starbuck .
come down !-- Mr .
Stubb , send a fresh hand to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning .
For such is the wonderful skill , prescience of experience , and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders ; that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they will , under certain given circumstances , pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of sight , as well as his probable rate of progression during that period .
The rigging lived .
It was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale - spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck , when he struck the key - note to an orchestra , that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles .
For not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching .
"
But skilfully manoeuvred , incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; though , at times , but by a plank ' s breadth ; while all the time , Ahab ' s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds .
"
Nor white whale , nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being .
" Dead to leeward , sir .
"
" Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir .
"
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate !
Give me something for a cane -- there , that shivered lance will do .
The old man ' s hinted thought was true .
Upon mustering the company , the Parsee was not there .
" The black vomit wrench thee !-- run all of ye above , alow , cabin , forecastle -- find him -- not gone -- not gone !
the irons , the irons !-- hoist the royals higher -- a pull on all the sheets !-- helm there !
I feel strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale ; and I may look so .
" And as mechanical ," muttered Ahab .
Meantime , of the broken keel of Ahab ' s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as on the night before , slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his hid , heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial ; sat due eastward for the earliest sun .
The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh , and once more the solitary night - man at the fore - mast - head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look - outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar .
A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells , and wards of hospitals , and ventilated them , and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces .
What d ' ye see ?
" Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw ," murmured Starbuck to himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail .
"
" Stand by to sway me up !
" We should meet him soon .
" Forehead to forehead I meet thee , this third time , Moby Dick !
He ' s too far off to lower yet , Mr . Starbuck .
No such green weather stains on Ahab ' s head !
he should still go before me , my pilot ; and yet to be seen again ?
" Starbuck !
"
I am old ;-- shake hands with me , man .
"
" Stand by the crew !
see !
he pecks -- he tears the vane "-- pointing to the red flag flying at the main - truck --" Ha !
he soars away with it !-- Where ' s the old man now ?
"
Lashed round and round to the fish ' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , during the past night , the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him , the half torn body of the Parsee was seen ; his sable raiment frayed to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab .
The harpoon dropped from his hand .
But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word .
Away , mates , to the ship !
"
"
" But at every bite , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller !
Almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of ungraduated , instantaneous swiftness , the White Whale darted through the weltering sea .
Some sinew cracks !--' tis whole again ; oars !
" The whale !
" Oars !
But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge - hammering seas , the before whale - smitten bow - ends of two planks burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves ; its half - wading , splashing crew , trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water .
Up helm , up helm !
thou grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of gulping soon !
Retribution , swift vengeance , eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal man could do , the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship ' s starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled .
Oh , now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief .
Next instant , the heavy eye - splice in the rope ' s final end flew out of the stark - empty tub , knocked down an oarsman , and smiting the sea , disappeared in its depths .
For an instant , the tranced boat ' s crew stood still ; then turned .
Great God , where is the ship ?
Epilogue
When I reached it , it had subsided to a creamy pool .
Round and round , then , and ever contracting towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle , like another Ixion I did revolve .
Book I
But his doom Reserved him to more wrath ; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him : round he throws his baleful eyes , That witnessed huge affliction and dismay , Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate .
A dungeon horrible , on all sides round , As one great furnace flamed ; yet from those flames No light ; but rather darkness visible Served only to discover sights of woe , Regions of sorrow , doleful shades , where peace And rest can never dwell , hope never comes That comes to all , but torture without end Still urges , and a fiery deluge , fed With ever - burning sulphur unconsumed .
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared For those rebellious ; here their prison ordained In utter darkness , and their portion set , As far removed from God and light of Heaven As from the centre thrice to th ' utmost pole .
But what if he our Conqueror ( whom I now Of force believe almighty , since no less Than such could have o ' erpowered such force as ours ) Have left us this our spirit and strength entire , Strongly to suffer and support our pains , That we may so suffice his vengeful ire , Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of war , whate ' er his business be , Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire , Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep ?
Here at least We shall be free ; th ' Almighty hath not built Here for his envy , will not drive us hence : Here we may reigh secure ; and , in my choice , To reign is worth ambition , though in Hell : Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven .
" He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend Was moving toward the shore ; his ponderous shield , Ethereal temper , massy , large , and round , Behind him cast .
" They heard , and were abashed , and up they sprung Upon the wing , as when men wont to watch On duty , sleeping found by whom they dread , Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake .
With these in troop Came Astoreth , whom the Phoenicians called Astarte , queen of heaven , with crescent horns ; To whose bright image nigntly by the moon Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs ; In Sion also not unsung , where stood Her temple on th ' offensive mountain , built By that uxorious king whose heart , though large , Beguiled by fair idolatresses , fell To idols foul .
Belial came last ; than whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven , or more gross to love Vice for itself .
His form had yet not lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than Archangel ruined , and th ' excess Of glory obscured : as when the sun new - risen Looks through the horizontal misty air Shorn of his beams , or , from behind the moon , In dim eclipse , disastrous twilight sheds On half the nations , and with fear of change Perplexes monarchs .
For who can yet believe , though after loss , That all these puissant legions , whose exile Hath emptied Heaven , shall fail to re - ascend , Self - raised , and repossess their native seat ?
Mammon led them on -- Mammon , the least erected Spirit that fell From Heaven ; for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent , admiring more The riches of heaven ' s pavement , trodden gold , Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed In vision beatific .
Th ' ascending pile Stood fixed her stately height , and straight the doors , Opening their brazen folds , discover , wide Within , her ample spaces o ' er the smooth And level pavement : from the arched roof , Pendent by subtle magic , many a row Of starry lamps and blazing cressets , fed With naptha and asphaltus , yielded light As from a sky .
Nor was his name unheard or unadored In ancient Greece ; and in Ausonian land Men called him Mulciber ; and how he fell From Heaven they fabled , thrown by angry Jove Sheer o ' er the crystal battlements : from morn To noon he fell , from noon to dewy eve , A summer ' s day , and with the setting sun Dropt from the zenith , like a falling star , On Lemnos , th ' Aegaean isle .
The happier state In Heaven , which follows dignity , might draw Envy from each inferior ; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Foremost to stand against the Thunderer ' s aim Your bulwark , and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain ?
Who but felt of late , When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear Insulting , and pursued us through the Deep , With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low ?
What fear we then ?
A fairer person lost not Heaven ; he seemed For dignity composed , and high exploit .
The towers of Heaven are filled With armed watch , that render all access Impregnable : oft on the bodering Deep Encamp their legions , or with obscure wing Scout far and wide into the realm of Night , Scorning surprise .
' Wherefore cease we , then ?
Our purer essence then will overcome Their noxious vapour ; or , inured , not feel ; Or , changed at length , and to the place conformed In temper and in nature , will receive Familiar the fierce heat ; and , void of pain , This horror will grow mild , this darkness light ; Besides what hope the never - ending flight Of future days may bring , what chance , what change Worth waiting -- since our present lot appears For happy though but ill , for ill not worst , If we procure not to ourselves more woe .
for so the popular vote Inclines -- here to continue , and build up here A growing empire ; doubtless !
For he , to be sure , In height or depth , still first and last will reign Sole king , and of his kingdom lose no part By our revolt , but over Hell extend His empire , and with iron sceptre rule Us here , as with his golden those in Heaven .
What sit we then projecting peace and war ?
But , first , whom shall we send In search of this new World ?
whom shall we find Sufficient ?
If thence he scape , into whatever world , Or unknown region , what remains him less Than unknown dangers , and as hard escape ?
Their rising all at once was as the sound Of thunder heard remote .
Part on the plain , or in the air sublime , Upon the wing or in swift race contend , As at th ' Olympian games or Pythian fields ; Part curb their fiery steeds , or shun the goal With rapid wheels , or fronted brigades form : As when , to warn proud cities , war appears Waged in the troubled sky , and armies rush To battle in the clouds ; before each van Prick forth the airy knights , and couch their spears , Till thickest legions close ; with feats of arms From either end of heaven the welkin burns .
Through many a dark and dreary vale They passed , and many a region dolorous , O ' er many a frozen , many a fiery alp , Rocks , caves , lakes , fens , bogs , dens , and shades of death -- A universe of death , which God by curse Created evil , for evil only good ; Where all life dies , death lives , and Nature breeds , Perverse , all monstrous , all prodigious things , Obominable , inutterable , and worse Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived , Gorgons , and Hydras , and Chimeras dire .
Retire ; or taste thy folly , and learn by proof , Hell - born , not to contend with Spirits of Heaven .
" To whom the Goblin , full of wrath , replied :-- " Art thou that traitor Angel ?
On th ' other side , Incensed with indignation , Satan stood Unterrified , and like a comet burned , That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge In th ' arctic sky , and from his horrid hair Shakes pestilence and war .
For him who sits above , and laughs the while At thee , ordained his drudge to execute Whate ' er his wrath , which he calls justice , bids -- His wrath , which one day will destroy ye both !
" T ' whom thus the Portress of Hell - gate replied :-- " Hast thou forgot me , then ; and do I seem Now in thine eye so foul ?-- once deemed so fair In Heaven , when at th ' assembly , and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combined In bold conspiracy against Heaven ' s King , All on a sudden miserable pain Surprised thee , dim thine eyes and dizzy swum In darkness , while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth , till on the left side opening wide , Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright , Then shining heavenly fair , a goddess armed , Out of thy head I sprung .
I fled , and cried out Death !
" He ceased ; for both seemed highly pleased , and Death Grinned horrible a ghastly smile , to hear His famine should be filled , and blessed his maw Destined to that good hour .
No less rejoiced His mother bad , and thus bespake her sire :-- " The key of this infernal Pit , by due And by command of Heaven ' s all - powerful King , I keep , by him forbidden to unlock These adamantine gates ; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart , Fearless to be o ' ermatched by living might .
But what owe I to his commands above , Who hates me , and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound , To sit in hateful office here confined , Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born -- Here in perpetual agony and pain , With terrors and with clamours compassed round Of mine own brood , that on my bowels feed ?
Thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss , among The gods who live at ease , where I shall reign At thy right hand voluptuous , as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling , without end .
" Thus Satan ; and him thus the Anarch old , With faltering speech and visage incomposed , Answered : " I know thee , stranger , who thou art -- *** That mighty leading Angel , who of late Made head against Heaven ' s King , though overthrown .
I upon my frontiers here Keep residence ; if all I can will serve That little which is left so to defend , Encroached on still through our intestine broils Weakening the sceptre of old Night : first , Hell , Your dungeon , stretching far and wide beneath ; Now lately Heaven and Earth , another world Hung o ' er my realm , linked in a golden chain To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell !
" He ceased ; and Satan stayed not to reply , But , glad that now his sea should find a shore , With fresh alacrity and force renewed Springs upward , like a pyramid of fire , Into the wild expanse , and through the shock Of fighting elements , on all sides round Environed , wins his way ; harder beset And more endangered than when Argo passed Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks , Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned Charybdis , and by th ' other whirlpool steered .
Thee I re - visit now with bolder wing , Escap ' d the Stygian pool , though long detain ' d In that obscure sojourn , while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne , With other notes than to the Orphean lyre I sung of Chaos and eternal Night ; Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down The dark descent , and up to re - ascend , Though hard and rare : Thee I revisit safe , And feel thy sovran vital lamp ; but thou Revisit ' st not these eyes , that roll in vain To find thy piercing ray , and find no dawn ; So thick a drop serene hath quench ' d their orbs , Or dim suffusion veil ' d .
Thus with the year Seasons return ; but not to me returns Day , or the sweet approach of even or morn , Or sight of vernal bloom , or summer ' s rose , Or flocks , or herds , or human face divine ; But cloud instead , and ever - during dark Surrounds me , from the cheerful ways of men Cut off , and for the book of knowledge fair Presented with a universal blank Of nature ' s works to me expung ' d and ras ' d , And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out .
Him God beholding from his prospect high , Wherein past , present , future , he beholds , Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake .
Only begotten Son , seest thou what rage Transports our Adversary ?
whom no bounds Prescrib ' d no bars of Hell , nor all the chains Heap ' d on him there , nor yet the main abyss Wide interrupt , can hold ; so bent he seems On desperate revenge , that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head .
what praise could they receive ?
they therefore , as to right belong $ ' d , So were created , nor can justly accuse Their Maker , or their making , or their fate , As if predestination over - rul ' d Their will dispos ' d by absolute decree Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed Their own revolt , not I ; if I foreknew , Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault , Which had no less proved certain unforeknown .
Thus while God spake , ambrosial fragrance fill ' d All Heaven , and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus ' d .
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious ; in him all his Father shone Substantially express ' d ; and in his face Divine compassion visibly appear ' d , Love without end , and without measure grace , Which uttering , thus he to his Father spake .
or wilt thou thyself Abolish thy creation , and unmake For him , what for thy glory thou hast made ?
My word , my wisdom , and effectual might , All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are , all As my eternal purpose hath decreed ; Man shall not quite be lost , but sav ' d who will ; Yet not of will in him , but grace in me Freely vouchsaf ' d ; once more I will renew His lapsed powers , though forfeit ; and enthrall ' d By sin to foul exorbitant desires ; Upheld by me , yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe ; By me upheld , that he may know how frail His fallen condition is , and to me owe All his deliverance , and to none but me .
This my long sufferance , and my day of grace , They who neglect and scorn , shall never taste ; But hard be harden ' d , blind be blinded more , That they may stumble on , and deeper fall ; And none but such from mercy I exclude .
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear ?
And now without redemption all mankind Must have been lost , adjudg ' d to Death and Hell By doom severe , had not the Son of God , In whom the fulness dwells of love divine , His dearest mediation thus renew ' d .
Thou , at the sight Pleased , out of Heaven shalt look down and smile , While , by thee raised , I ruin all my foes ; Death last , and with his carcase glut the grave ; Then , with the multitude of my redeemed , Shall enter Heaven , long absent , and return , Father , to see thy face , wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain , but peace assured And reconcilement : wrath shall be no more Thenceforth , but in thy presence joy entire .
His words here ended ; but his meek aspect Silent yet spake , and breathed immortal love To mortal men , above which only shone Filial obedience : as a sacrifice Glad to be offered , he attends the will Of his great Father .
Admiration seized All Heaven , what this might mean , and whither tend , Wondering ; but soon th ' Almighty thus replied .
Nor shalt thou , by descending to assume Man ' s nature , lessen or degrade thine own .
Then , crowned again , their golden harps they took , Harps ever tuned , that glittering by their side Like quivers hung , and with preamble sweet Of charming symphony they introduce Their sacred song , and waken raptures high ; No voice exempt , no voice but well could join Melodious part , such concord is in Heaven .
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created ; and by thee threw down The aspiring Dominations : Thou that day Thy Father ' s dreadful thunder didst not spare , Nor stop thy flaming chariot - wheels , that shook Heaven ' s everlasting frame , while o ' er the necks Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed .
Each stair mysteriously was meant , nor stood There always , but drawn up to Heaven sometimes Viewless ; and underneath a bright sea flowed Of jasper , or of liquid pearl , whereon Who after came from earth , failing arrived Wafted by Angels , or flew o ' er the lake Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds .
The stairs were then let down , whether to dare The Fiend by easy ascent , or aggravate His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss : Direct against which opened from beneath , Just o ' er the blissful seat of Paradise , A passage down to the Earth , a passage wide , Wider by far than that of after - times Over mount Sion , and , though that were large , Over the Promised Land to God so dear ; By which , to visit oft those happy tribes , On high behests his angels to and fro Passed frequent , and his eye with choice regard From Paneas , the fount of Jordan ' s flood , To Beersaba , where the Holy Land Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore ; So wide the opening seemed , where bounds were set To darkness , such as bound the ocean wave .
Satan from hence , now on the lower stair , That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven - gate , Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this world at once .
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazzled ; far and wide his eye commands ; For sight no obstacle found here , nor shade , But all sun - shine , as when his beams at noon Culminate from the equator , as they now Shot upward still direct , whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall ; and the air , No where so clear , sharpened his visual ray To objects distant far , whereby he soon Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand , The same whom John saw also in the sun : His back was turned , but not his brightness hid ; Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar Circled his head , nor less his locks behind Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round ; on some great charge employed He seemed , or fixed in cogitation deep .
to tell thee how I hate thy beams , That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell , how glorious once above thy sphere ; Till pride and worse ambition threw me down Warring in Heaven against Heaven ' s matchless King : Ah , wherefore !
What could be less than to afford him praise , The easiest recompence , and pay him thanks , How due !
Me miserable !
Which way I fly is Hell ; myself am Hell ; And , in the lowest deep , a lower deep Still threatening to devour me opens wide , To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven .
Ay me !
Ease would recant Vows made in pain , as violent and void .
For never can true reconcilement grow , Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep : Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall : so should I purchase dear Short intermission bought with double smart .
This knows my Punisher ; therefore as far From granting he , as I from begging , peace ; All hope excluded thus , behold , in stead Mankind created , and for him this world .
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed ; Then was not guilty shame , dishonest shame Of nature ' s works , honour dishonourable , Sin - bred , how have ye troubled all mankind With shows instead , mere shows of seeming pure , And banished from man ' s life his happiest life , Simplicity and spotless innocence !
O Hell !
gentle pair , ye little think how nigh Your change approaches , when all these delights Will vanish , and deliver ye to woe ; More woe , the more your taste is now of joy ; Happy , but for so happy ill secured Long to continue , and this high seat your Heaven Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe As now is entered ; yet no purposed foe To you , whom I could pity thus forlorn , Though I unpitied : League with you I seek , And mutual amity , so strait , so close , That I with you must dwell , or you with me Henceforth ; my dwelling haply may not please , Like this fair Paradise , your sense ; yet such Accept your Maker ' s work ; he gave it me , Which I as freely give : Hell shall unfold , To entertain you two , her widest gates , And send forth all her kings ; there will be room , Not like these narrow limits , to receive Your numerous offspring ; if no better place , Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wronged .
So spake the Fiend , and with necessity , The tyrant ' s plea , excused his devilish deeds .
Then let us not think hard One easy prohibition , who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else , and choice Unlimited of manifold delights : But let us ever praise him , and extol His bounty , following our delightful task , To prune these growing plants , and tend these flowers , Which were it toilsome , yet with thee were sweet .
That day I oft remember , when from sleep I first awaked , and found myself reposed Under a shade on flowers , much wondering where And what I was , whence thither brought , and how .
whom thou flyest , of him thou art , ' His flesh , his bone ; to give thee being I lent ' Out of my side to thee , nearest my heart , ' Substantial life , to have thee by my side ' Henceforth an individual solace dear ; ' Part of my soul I seek thee , and thee claim ' My other half :' With that thy gentle hand Seised mine : I yielded ; and from that time see How beauty is excelled by manly grace , And wisdom , which alone is truly fair .
Live while ye may , Yet happy pair ; enjoy , till I return , Short pleasures , for long woes are to succeed !
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat , Chief of the angelick guards , awaiting night ; About him exercised heroick games The unarmed youth of Heaven , but nigh at hand Celestial armoury , shields , helms , and spears , Hung high with diamond flaming , and with gold .
But if within the circuit of these walks , In whatsoever shape he lurk , of whom Thou tellest , by morrow dawning I shall know .
When Adam thus to Eve .
To whom our general ancestor replied .
Thus , at their shady lodge arrived , both stood , Both turned , and under open sky adored The God that made both sky , air , earth , and heaven , Which they beheld , the moon ' s resplendent globe , And starry pole : Thou also madest the night , Maker Omnipotent , and thou the day , Which we , in our appointed work employed , Have finished , happy in our mutual help And mutual love , the crown of all our bliss Ordained by thee ; and this delicious place For us too large , where thy abundance wants Partakers , and uncropt falls to the ground .
Far be it , that I should write thee sin or blame , Or think thee unbefitting holiest place , Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets , Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced , Present , or past , as saints and patriarchs used .
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault , And from their ivory port the Cherubim , Forth issuing at the accustomed hour , stood armed To their night watches in warlike parade ; When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake .
From these , two strong and subtle Spirits he called That near him stood , and gave them thus in charge .
This evening from the sun ' s decline arrived , Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent ( who could have thought ?
Know ye not then said Satan , filled with scorn , Know ye not me ?
To whom thus Zephon , answering scorn with scorn .
Think not , revolted Spirit , thy shape the same , Or undiminished brightness to be known , As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure ; That glory then , when thou no more wast good , Departed from thee ; and thou resemblest now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul .
He scarce had ended , when those two approached , And brief related whom they brought , where found , How busied , in what form and posture couched .
thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise , And such I held thee ; but this question asked Puts me in doubt .
Lives there who loves his pain !
Who would not , finding way , break loose from Hell , Though thither doomed !
hadst thou alleged To thy deserted host this cause of flight , Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive .
But still thy words at random , as before , Argue thy inexperience what behoves From hard assays and ill successes past A faithful leader , not to hazard all Through ways of danger by himself untried : I , therefore , I alone first undertook To wing the desolate abyss , and spy This new created world , whereof in Hell Fame is not silent , here in hope to find Better abode , and my afflicted Powers To settle here on earth , or in mid air ; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay legions dare against ; Whose easier business were to serve their Lord High up in Heaven , with songs to hymn his throne , And practised distances to cringe , not fight , To whom the warriour Angel soon replied .
Faithful to whom ?
Now Morn , her rosy steps in the eastern clime Advancing , sowed the earth with orient pearl , When Adam waked , so customed ; for his sleep Was aery - light , from pure digestion bred , And temperate vapours bland , which the only sound Of leaves and fuming rills , Aurora ' s fan , Lightly dispersed , and the shrill matin song Of birds on every bough ; so much the more His wonder was to find unwakened Eve With tresses discomposed , and glowing cheek , As through unquiet rest : He , on his side Leaning half raised , with looks of cordial love Hung over her enamoured , and beheld Beauty , which , whether waking or asleep , Shot forth peculiar graces ; then with voice Mild , as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes , Her hand soft touching , whispered thus .
Forthwith up to the clouds With him I flew , and underneath beheld The earth outstretched immense , a prospect wide And various : Wondering at my flight and change To this high exaltation ; suddenly My guide was gone , and I , methought , sunk down , And fell asleep ; but O , how glad I waked To find this but a dream !
So all was cleared , and to the field they haste .
Thine this universal frame , Thus wonderous fair ; Thyself how wonderous then !
His praise , ye Winds , that from four quarters blow , Breathe soft or loud ; and , wave your tops , ye Pines , With every plant , in sign of worship wave .
Fountains , and ye that warble , as ye flow , Melodious murmurs , warbling tune his praise .
Go therefore , half this day as friend with friend Converse with Adam , in what bower or shade Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired , To respite his day - labour with repast , Or with repose ; and such discourse bring on , As may advise him of his happy state , Happiness in his power left free to will , Left to his own free will , his will though free , Yet mutable ; whence warn him to beware He swerve not , too secure : Tell him withal His danger , and from whom ; what enemy , Late fallen himself from Heaven , is plotting now The fall of others from like state of bliss ; By violence ?
Adam , earth ' s hallowed mould , Of God inspired !
To whom the Angel .
For know , whatever was created , needs To be sustained and fed : Of elements The grosser feeds the purer , earth the sea , Earth and the sea feed air , the air those fires Ethereal , and as lowest first the moon ; Whence in her visage round those spots , unpurged Vapours not yet into her substance turned .
So down they sat , And to their viands fell ; nor seemingly The Angel , nor in mist , the common gloss Of Theologians ; but with keen dispatch Of real hunger , and concoctive heat To transubstantiate : What redounds , transpires Through Spirits with ease ; nor wonder ; if by fire Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist Can turn , or holds it possible to turn , Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold , As from the mine .
if ever , then , Then had the sons of God excuse to have been Enamoured at that sight ; but in those hearts Love unlibidinous reigned , nor jealousy Was understood , the injured lover ' s hell .
Inhabitant with God , now know I well Thy favour , in this honour done to Man ; Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed To enter , and these earthly fruits to taste , Food not of Angels , yet accepted so , As that more willingly thou couldst not seem At Heaven ' s high feasts to have fed : yet what compare To whom the winged Hierarch replied .
O Adam , One Almighty is , from whom All things proceed , and up to him return , If not depraved from good , created all Such to perfection , one first matter all , Endued with various forms , various degrees Of substance , and , in things that live , of life ; But more refined , more spiritous , and pure , As nearer to him placed , or nearer tending Each in their several active spheres assigned , Till body up to spirit work , in bounds Proportioned to each kind .
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied .
But say , What meant that caution joined , If ye be found Obedient ?
High matter thou enjoinest me , O prime of men , Sad task and hard : For how shall I relate To human sense the invisible exploits Of warring Spirits ?
This day I have begot whom I declare My only Son , and on this holy hill Him have anointed , whom ye now behold At my right hand ; your head I him appoint ; And by myself have sworn , to him shall bow All knees in Heaven , and shall confess him Lord : Under his great vice - gerent reign abide United , as one individual soul , For ever happy : Him who disobeys , Me disobeys , breaks union , and that day , Cast out from God and blessed vision , falls Into utter darkness , deep ingulfed , his place Ordained without redemption , without end .
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled From that high mount of God , whence light and shade Spring both , the face of brightest Heaven had changed To grateful twilight , ( for night comes not there In darker veil ,) and roseat dews disposed All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest ; Wide over all the plain , and wider far Than all this globous earth in plain outspread , ( Such are the courts of God ) the angelick throng , Dispersed in bands and files , their camp extend By living streams among the trees of life , Pavilions numberless , and sudden reared , Celestial tabernacles , where they slept Fanned with cool winds ; save those , who , in their course , Melodious hymns about the sovran throne Alternate all night long : but not so waked Satan ; so call him now , his former name Is heard no more in Heaven ; he of the first , If not the first Arch - Angel , great in power , In favour and pre - eminence , yet fraught With envy against the Son of God , that day Honoured by his great Father , and proclaimed Messiah King anointed , could not bear Through pride that sight , and thought himself impaired .
but double how endured , To one , and to his image now proclaimed ?
Who can in reason then , or right , assume Monarchy over such as live by right His equals , if in power and splendour less , In freedom equal ?
So spake the fervent Angel ; but his zeal None seconded , as out of season judged , Or singular and rash : Whereat rejoiced The Apostate , and , more haughty , thus replied .
That we were formed then sayest thou ?
Doctrine which we would know whence learned : who saw When this creation was ?
I see thy fall Determined , and thy hapless crew involved In this perfidious fraud , contagion spread Both of thy crime and punishment : Henceforth No more be troubled how to quit the yoke Of God ' s Messiah ; those indulgent laws Will not be now vouchsafed ; other decrees Against thee are gone forth without recall ; That golden scepter , which thou didst reject , Is now an iron rod to bruise and break Thy disobedience .
So pondering , and from his armed peers Forth stepping opposite , half - way he met His daring foe , at this prevention more Incensed , and thus securely him defied .
All Heaven Resounded ; and had Earth been then , all Earth Had to her center shook .
Heaven , the seat of bliss , Brooks not the works of violence and war .
Hence then , and evil go with thee along , Thy offspring , to the place of evil , Hell ; Thou and thy wicked crew !
for likest Gods they seemed , Stood they or moved , in stature , motion , arms , Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven .
I might relate of thousands , and their names Eternize here on earth ; but those elect Angels , contented with their fame in Heaven , Seek not the praise of men : The other sort , In might though wonderous and in acts of war , Nor of renown less eager , yet by doom Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory , Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell .
He sat ; and in the assembly next upstood Nisroch , of Principalities the prime ; As one he stood escaped from cruel fight , Sore toiled , his riven arms to havock hewn , And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake .
Not uninvented that , which thou aright Believest so main to our success , I bring .
Nor long shall be our labour ; yet ere dawn , Effect shall end our wish .
So all ere day - spring , under conscious night , Secret they finished , and in order set , With silent circumspection , unespied .
At interview both stood A while ; but suddenly at head appeared Satan , and thus was heard commanding loud .
while we discharge Freely our part : ye , who appointed stand Do as you have in charge , and briefly touch What we propound , and loud that all may hear !
if on they rushed , repulse Repeated , and indecent overthrow Doubled , would render them yet more despised , And to their foes a laughter ; for in view Stood ranked of Seraphim another row , In posture to displode their second tire Of thunder : Back defeated to return They worse abhorred .
O Friends !
Leader !
Into thee such virtue and grace Immense I have transfused , that all may know In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare ; And , this perverse commotion governed thus , To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things ; to be Heir , and to be King By sacred unction , thy deserved right .
Scepter and power , thy giving , I assume , And gladlier shall resign , when in the end Thou shalt be all in all , and I in thee For ever ; and in me all whom thou lovest : But whom thou hatest , I hate , and can put on Thy terrours , as I put thy mildness on , Image of thee in all things ; and shall soon , Armed with thy might , rid Heaven of these rebelled ; To their prepared ill mansion driven down , To chains of darkness , and the undying worm ; That from thy just obedience could revolt , Whom to obey is happiness entire .
Then shall thy Saints unmixed , and from the impure Far separate , circling thy holy mount , Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing , Hymns of high praise , and I among them Chief .
But to convince the proud what signs avail , Or wonders move the obdurate to relent ?
So spake the Son , and into terrour changed His countenance too severe to be beheld , And full of wrath bent on his enemies .
He on his impious foes right onward drove , Gloomy as night ; under his burning wheels The stedfast empyrean shook throughout , All but the throne itself of God .
Hell heard the unsufferable noise , Hell saw Heaven ruining from Heaven , and would have fled Affrighted ; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations , and too fast had bound .
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced , and soon repaired Her mural breach , returning whence it rolled .
Descend from Heaven , Urania , by that name If rightly thou art called , whose voice divine Following , above the Olympian hill I soar , Above the flight of Pegasean wing !
So fail not thou , who thee implores : For thou art heavenly , she an empty dream .
At least our envious Foe hath failed , who thought All like himself rebellious , by whose aid This inaccessible high strength , the seat Of Deity supreme , us dispossessed , He trusted to have seised , and into fraud Drew many , whom their place knows here no more : Yet far the greater part have kept , I see , Their station ; Heaven , yet populous , retains Number sufficient to possess her realms Though wide , and this high temple to frequent With ministeries due , and solemn rites : But , lest his heart exalt him in the harm Already done , to have dispeopled Heaven , My damage fondly deemed , I can repair That detriment , if such it be to lose Self - lost ; and in a moment will create Another world , out of one man a race Of men innumerable , there to dwell , Not here ; till , by degrees of merit raised , They open to themselves at length the way Up hither , under long obedience tried ; And Earth be changed to Heaven , and Heaven to Earth , One kingdom , joy and union without end .
Mean while inhabit lax , ye Powers of Heaven ; And thou my Word , begotten Son , by thee This I perform ; speak thou , and be it done !
So sang the Hierarchies : Mean while the Son On his great expedition now appeared , Girt with Omnipotence , with radiance crowned Of Majesty Divine ; sapience and love Immense , and all his Father in him shone .
Again , God said , Let there be firmament Amid the waters , and let it divide The waters from the waters ; and God made The firmament , expanse of liquid , pure , Transparent , elemental air , diffused In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great round ; partition firm and sure , The waters underneath from those above Dividing : for as earth , so he the world Built on circumfluous waters calm , in wide Crystalline ocean , and the loud misrule Of Chaos far removed ; lest fierce extremes Contiguous might distemper the whole frame : And Heaven he named the Firmament : So even And morning chorus sung the second day .
The sixth , and of creation last , arose With evening harps and matin ; when God said , Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind , Cattle , and creeping things , and beast of the Earth , Each in their kind .
Let us make now Man in our image , Man In our similitude , and let them rule Over the fish and fowl of sea and air , Beast of the field , and over all the Earth , And every creeping thing that creeps the ground .
Easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostate , and their counsels vain , Thou hast repelled ; while impiously they thought Thee to diminish , and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers .
Witness this new - made world , another Heaven From Heaven - gate not far , founded in view On the clear hyaline , the glassy sea ; Of amplitude almost immense , with stars Numerous , and every star perhaps a world Of destined habitation ; but thou knowest Their seasons : among these the seat of Men , Earth , with her nether ocean circumfused , Their pleasant dwelling - place .
The Angel ended , and in Adam ' s ear So charming left his voice , that he a while Thought him still speaking , still stood fixed to hear ; Then , as new waked , thus gratefully replied .
When I behold this goodly frame , this world , Of Heaven and Earth consisting ; and compute Their magnitudes ; this Earth , a spot , a grain , An atom , with the firmament compared And all her numbered stars , that seem to roll Spaces incomprehensible , ( for such Their distance argues , and their swift return Diurnal ,) merely to officiate light Round this opacous Earth , this punctual spot , One day and night ; in all her vast survey Useless besides ; reasoning I oft admire , How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions , with superfluous hand So many nobler bodies to create , Greater so manifold , to this one use , For aught appears , and on their orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated ; while the sedentary Earth , That better might with far less compass move , Served by more noble than herself , attains Her end without least motion , and receives , As tribute , such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed , her warmth and light ; Speed , to describe whose swiftness number fails .
And for the Heaven ' s wide circuit , let it speak The Maker ' s high magnificence , who built So spacious , and his line stretched out so far ; That Man may know he dwells not in his own ; An edifice too large for him to fill , Lodged in a small partition ; and the rest Ordained for uses to his Lord best known .
The swiftness of those circles attribute , Though numberless , to his Omnipotence , That to corporeal substances could add Speed almost spiritual : Me thou thinkest not slow , Who since the morning - hour set out from Heaven Where God resides , and ere mid - day arrived In Eden ; distance inexpressible By numbers that have name .
What if the sun Be center to the world ; and other stars , By his attractive virtue and their own Incited , dance about him various rounds ?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe , Moved contrary with thwart obliquities ; Or save the sun his labour , and that swift Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed , Invisible else above all stars , the wheel Of day and night ; which needs not thy belief , If earth , industrious of herself , fetch day Travelling east , and with her part averse From the sun ' s beam meet night , her other part Still luminous by his ray .
Thee I have heard relating what was done Ere my remembrance : now , hear me relate My story , which perhaps thou hast not heard ; And day is not yet spent ; till then thou seest How subtly to detain thee I devise ; Inviting thee to hear while I relate ; Fond !
But thy relation now ; for I attend , Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine .
Rejoicing , but with awe , In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss : He reared me , and ' Whom thou soughtest I am ,' Said mildly , ' Author of all this thou seest ' Above , or round about thee , or beneath .
' Not only these fair bounds , but all the Earth ' To thee and to thy race I give ; as lords ' Possess it , and all things that therein live , ' Or live in sea , or air ; beast , fish , and fowl .
What thinkest thou then of me , and this my state ?
who am alone From all eternity ; for none I know Second to me or like , equal much less .
How have I then with whom to hold converse , Save with the creatures which I made , and those To me inferiour , infinite descents Beneath what other creatures are to thee ?
Thus I emboldened spake , and freedom used Permissive , and acceptance found ; which gained This answer from the gracious Voice Divine .
but fairest this Of all thy gifts !
Thus have I told thee all my state , and brought My story to the sum of earthly bliss , Which I enjoy ; and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed , but such As , used or not , works in the mind no change , Nor vehement desire ; these delicacies I mean of taste , sight , smell , herbs , fruits , and flowers , Walks , and the melody of birds : but here Far otherwise , transported I behold , Transported touch ; here passion first I felt , Commotion strange !
or do they mix Irradiance , virtual or immediate touch ?
Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension , and shall be honoured ever With grateful memory : Thou to mankind Be good and friendly still , and oft return !
I now must change Those notes to tragick ; foul distrust , and breach Disloyal on the part of Man , revolt , And disobedience : on the part of Heaven Now alienated , distance and distaste , Anger and just rebuke , and judgement given , That brought into this world a world of woe , Sin and her shadow Death , and Misery Death ' s harbinger : Sad talk ! yet argument Not less but more heroick than the wrath Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued Thrice fugitive about Troy wall ; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous ' d ; Or Neptune ' s ire , or Juno ' s , that so long Perplexed the Greek , and Cytherea ' s son :
Terrestrial Heaven , danced round by other Heavens That shine , yet bear their bright officious lamps , Light above light , for thee alone , as seems , In thee concentring all their precious beams Of sacred influence !
With what delight could I have walked thee round , If I could joy in aught , sweet interchange Of hill , and valley , rivers , woods , and plains , Now land , now sea and shores with forest crowned , Rocks , dens , and caves !
But I in none of these Find place or refuge ; and the more I see Pleasures about me , so much more I feel Torment within me , as from the hateful siege Of contraries : all good to me becomes Bane , and in Heaven much worse would be my state .
Now , when as sacred light began to dawn In Eden on the humid flowers , that breathed Their morning incense , when all things , that breathe , From the Earth ' s great altar send up silent praise To the Creator , and his nostrils fill With grateful smell , forth came the human pair , And joined their vocal worship to the quire Of creatures wanting voice ; that done , partake The season prime for sweetest scents and airs : Then commune , how that day they best may ply Their growing work : for much their work out - grew The hands ' dispatch of two gardening so wide , And Eve first to her husband thus began .
Sole Eve , associate sole , to me beyond Compare above all living creatures dear !
Not then mistrust , but tender love , enjoins , That I should mind thee oft ; and mind thou me .
Thus saying , from her husband ' s hand her hand Soft she withdrew ; and , like a Wood - Nymph light , Oread or Dryad , or of Delia ' s train , Betook her to the groves ; but Delia ' s self In gait surpassed , and Goddess - like deport , Though not as she with bow and quiver armed , But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude , Guiltless of fire , had formed , or Angels brought .
event perverse !
She fair , divinely fair , fit love for Gods !
and toward Eve Addressed his way : not with indented wave , Prone on the ground , as since ; but on his rear , Circular base of rising folds , that towered Fold above fold , a surging maze !
his head Crested aloft , and carbuncle his eyes ; With burnished neck of verdant gold , erect Amidst his circling spires , that on the grass Floated redundant : pleasing was his shape And lovely ; never since of serpent - kind Lovelier , not those that in Illyria changed , Hermione and Cadmus , or the god In Epidaurus ; nor to which transformed Ammonian Jove , or Capitoline , was seen ; He with Olympias ; this with her who bore Scipio , the highth of Rome .
there best beheld , Where universally admired ; but here In this enclosure wild , these beasts among , Beholders rude , and shallow to discern Half what in thee is fair , one man except , Who sees thee ?
What may this mean ?
Say , for such wonder claims attention due .
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep I turned my thoughts , and with capacious mind Considered all things visible in Heaven , Or Earth , or Middle ; all things fair and good : But all that fair and good in thy divine Semblance , and in thy beauty ' s heavenly ray , United I beheld ; no fair to thine Equivalent or second !
from hence how far ?
Serpent , we might have spared our coming hither , Fruitless to me , though fruit be here to excess , The credit of whose virtue rest with thee ; Wonderous indeed , if cause of such effects .
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied .
Indeed !
now I feel thy power Within me clear ; not only to discern Things in their causes , but to trace the ways Of highest agents , deemed however wise .
or will God incense his ire For such a petty trespass ?
of evil , if what is evil Be real , why not known , since easier shunned ?
Why then was this forbid ?
What can your knowledge hurt him , or this tree Impart against his will , if all be his ?
and can envy dwell In heavenly breasts ?
And I perhaps am secret : Heaven is high , High , and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth ; and other care perhaps May have diverted from continual watch Our great Forbidder , safe with all his spies About him .
shall I to him make known As yet my change , and give him to partake Full happiness with me , or rather not , But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power Without copartner ?
And Adam , wedded to another Eve , Shall live with her enjoying , I extinct ; A death to think !
Great joy he promised to his thoughts , and new Solace in her return , so long delayed : Yet oft his heart , divine of something ill , Misgave him ; he the faltering measure felt ; And forth to meet her went , the way she took That morn when first they parted : by the tree Of knowledge he must pass ; there he her met , Scarce from the tree returning ; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit , that downy smiled , New gathered , and ambrosial smell diffused .
Thou therefore also taste , that equal lot May join us , equal joy , as equal love ; Lest , thou not tasting , different degree Disjoin us , and I then too late renounce Deity for thee , when Fate will not permit .
how forego Thy sweet converse , and love so dearly joined , To live again in these wild woods forlorn !
On my experience , Adam , freely taste , And fear of death deliver to the winds .
Eve , now I see thou art exact of taste , And elegant , of sapience no small part ; Since to each meaning savour we apply , And palate call judicious ; I the praise Yield thee , so well this day thou hast purveyed .
But come , so well refreshed , now let us play , As meet is , after such delicious fare ; For never did thy beauty , since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee , adorned With all perfections , so inflame my sense With ardour to enjoy thee , fairer now Than ever ; bounty of this virtuous tree !
Thus fenced , and , as they thought , their shame in part Covered , but not at rest or ease of mind , They sat them down to weep ; nor only tears Rained at their eyes , but high winds worse within Began to rise , high passions , anger , hate , Mistrust , suspicion , discord ; and shook sore Their inward state of mind , calm region once And full of peace , now tost and turbulent : For Understanding ruled not , and the Will Heard not her lore ; both in subjection now To sensual Appetite , who from beneath Usurping over sovran Reason claimed Superiour sway : From thus distempered breast , Adam , estranged in look and altered style , Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed .
Imputest thou that to my default , or will Of wandering , as thou callest it , which who knows But might as ill have happened thou being by , Or to thyself perhaps ?
As good have grown there still a lifeless rib .
Is this the love , is this the recompence Of mine to thee , ingrateful Eve !
expressed Immutable , when thou wert lost , not I ; Who might have lived , and joyed immortal bliss , Yet willingly chose rather death with thee ?
And am I now upbraided as the cause Of thy transgressing ?
) the penalty ; And , manifold in sin , deserved to fall .
To thee I have transferred All judgement , whether in Heaven , or Earth , or Hell .
Easy it may be seen that I intend Mercy colleague with justice , sending thee Man ' s friend , his Mediator , his designed Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary , And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen .
I go to judge On earth these thy transgressours ; but thou knowest , Whoever judged , the worst on me must light , When time shall be ; for so I undertook Before thee ; and , not repenting , this obtain Of right , that I may mitigate their doom On me derived ; yet I shall temper so Justice with mercy , as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied , and thee appease .
Now was the sun in western cadence low From noon , and gentle airs , due at their hour , To fan the earth now waked , and usher in The evening cool ; when he , from wrath more cool , Came the mild Judge , and Intercessour both , To sentence Man : The voice of God they heard Now walking in the garden , by soft winds Brought to their ears , while day declined ; they heard , And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest trees , both man and wife ; till God , Approaching , thus to Adam called aloud .
in evil strait this day I stand Before my Judge ; either to undergo Myself the total crime , or to accuse My other self , the partner of my life ; Whose failing , while her faith to me remains , I should conceal , and not expose to blame By my complaint : but strict necessity Subdues me , and calamitous constraint ; Lest on my head both sin and punishment , However insupportable , be all Devolved ; though should I hold my peace , yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceal .-- This Woman , whom thou madest to be my help , And gavest me as thy perfect gift , so good , So fit , so acceptable , so divine , That from her hand I could suspect no ill , And what she did , whatever in itself , Her doing seemed to justify the deed ; She gave me of the tree , and I did eat .
Was she thy God , that her thou didst obey Before his voice ?
Which when the Lord God heard , without delay To judgement he proceeded on the accused Serpent , though brute ; unable to transfer The guilt on him , who made him instrument Of mischief , and polluted from the end Of his creation ; justly then accursed , As vitiated in nature : More to know Concerned not Man , ( since he no further knew ) Nor altered his offence ; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom applied , Though in mysterious terms , judged as then best : And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall .
Because thou hast done this , thou art accursed Above all cattle , each beast of the field ; Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go , And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life .
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply By thy conception ; children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth ; and to thy husband ' s will Thine shall submit ; he over thee shall rule .
So judged he Man , both Judge and Saviour sent ; And the instant stroke of death , denounced that day , Removed far off ; then , pitying how they stood Before him naked to the air , that now Must suffer change , disdained not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume ; As when he washed his servants feet ; so now , As father of his family , he clad Their nakedness with skins of beasts , or slain , Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid ; And thought not much to clothe his enemies ; Nor he their outward only with the skins Of beasts , but inward nakedness , much more .
It cannot be But that success attends him ; if mishap , Ere this he had returned , with fury driven By his avengers ; since no place like this Can fit his punishment , or their revenge .
Thou , my shade Inseparable , must with me along ; For Death from Sin no power can separate .
Then both from out Hell - gates , into the waste Wide anarchy of Chaos , damp and dark , Flew diverse ; and with power ( their power was great ) Hovering upon the waters , what they met Solid or slimy , as in raging sea Tost up and down , together crouded drove , From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell ; As when two polar winds , blowing adverse Upon the Cronian sea , together drive Mountains of ice , that stop the imagined way Beyond Petsora eastward , to the rich Cathaian coast .
Satan , in likeness of an Angel bright , Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering His zenith , while the sun in Aries rose : Disguised he came ; but those his children dear Their parent soon discerned , though in disguise .
Long were to tell What I have done ; what suffered ; with what pain Voyaged th ' unreal , vast , unbounded deep Of horrible confusion ; over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved , To expedite your glorious march ; but I Toiled out my uncouth passage , forced to ride The untractable abyss , plunged in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild ; That , jealous of their secrets , fiercely opposed My journey strange , with clamorous uproar Protesting Fate supreme ; thence how I found The new created world , which fame in Heaven Long had foretold , a fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection !
Thus were they plagued And worn with famine , long and ceaseless hiss , Till their lost shape , permitted , they resumed ; Yearly enjoined , some say , to undergo , This annual humbling certain numbered days , To dash their pride , and joy , for Man seduced .
He ended , and the heavenly audience loud Sung Halleluiah , as the sound of seas , Through multitude that sung : Just are thy ways , Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works ; Who can extenuate thee ?
Next , to the Son , Destined Restorer of mankind , by whom New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise , Or down from Heaven descend .-- Such was their song ; While the Creator , calling forth by name His mighty Angels , gave them several charge , As sorted best with present things .
To the blanc moon Her office they prescribed ; to the other five Their planetary motions , and aspects , In sextile , square , and trine , and opposite , Of noxious efficacy , and when to join In synod unbenign ; and taught the fixed Their influence malignant when to shower , Which of them rising with the sun , or falling , Should prove tempestuous : To the winds they set Their corners , when with bluster to confound Sea , air , and shore ; the thunder when to roll With terrour through the dark aereal hall .
O voice , once heard Delightfully , Encrease and multiply ; Now death to hear !
for what can I encrease , Or multiply , but curses on my head ?
How glad would lay me down As in my mother ' s lap !
Fond wish ! couldst thou support That burden , heavier than the earth to bear ; Than all the world much heavier , though divided With that bad Woman ?
into what abyss of fears And horrours hast thou driven me ; out of which I find no way , from deep to deeper plunged !
Why comes not Death , Said he , with one thrice - acceptable stroke To end me ?
He added not , and from her turned ; but Eve , Not so repulsed , with tears that ceased not flowing And tresses all disordered , at his feet Fell humble ; and , embracing them , besought His peace , and thus proceeded in her plaint .
She ended weeping ; and her lowly plight , Immoveable , till peace obtained from fault Acknowledged and deplored , in Adam wrought Commiseration : Soon his heart relented Towards her , his life so late , and sole delight , Now at his feet submissive in distress ; Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking , His counsel , whom she had displeased , his aid : As one disarmed , his anger all he lost , And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon .
But rise ;-- let us no more contend , nor blame Each other , blamed enough elsewhere ; but strive In offices of love , how we may lighten Each other ' s burden , in our share of woe ; Since this day ' s death denounced , if aught I see , Will prove no sudden , but a slow - paced evil ; A long day ' s dying , to augment our pain ; And to our seed ( O hapless seed !
) derived .
To whom thus Eve , recovering heart , replied .
Now therefore , bend thine ear To supplication ; hear his sighs , though mute ; Unskilful with what words to pray , let me Interpret for him ; me , his advocate And propitiation ; all his works on me , Good , or not good , ingraft ; my merit those Shall perfect , and for these my death shall pay .
Accept me ; and , in me , from these receive The smell of peace toward mankind : let him live Before thee reconciled , at least his days Numbered , though sad ; till death , his doom , ( which I To mitigate thus plead , not to reverse ,) To better life shall yield him : where with me All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss ; Made one with me , as I with thee am one .
Michael , this my behest have thou in charge ; Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming warriours , lest the Fiend , Or in behalf of Man , or to invade Vacant possession , some new trouble raise : Haste thee , and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful pair ; From hallowed ground the unholy ; and denounce To them , and to their progeny , from thence Perpetual banishment .
If patiently thy bidding they obey , Dismiss them not disconsolate ; reveal To Adam what shall come in future days , As I shall thee enlighten ; intermix My covenant in the Woman ' s seed renewed ; So send them forth , though sorrowing , yet in peace : And on the east side of the garden place , Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs , Cherubick watch ; and of a sword the flame Wide - waving ; all approach far off to fright , And guard all passage to the tree of life : Lest Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foul , and all my trees their prey ; With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude .
Mean while , To re - salute the world with sacred light , Leucothea waked ; and with fresh dews imbalmed The earth ; when Adam and first matron Eve Had ended now their orisons , and found Strength added from above ; new hope to spring Out of despair ; joy , but with fear yet linked ; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed .
why in the east Darkness ere day ' s mid - course , and morning - light More orient in yon western cloud , that draws O ' er the blue firmament a radiant white , And slow descends with something heavenly fraught ?
The princely Hierarch In their bright stand there left his Powers , to seise Possession of the garden ; he alone , To find where Adam sheltered , took his way , Not unperceived of Adam ; who to Eve , While the great visitant approached , thus spake .
He ended : and the Arch - Angel soon drew nigh , Not in his shape celestial , but as man Clad to meet man ; over his lucid arms A military vest of purple flowed , Livelier than Meliboean , or the grain Of Sarra , worn by kings and heroes old In time of truce ; Iris had dipt the woof ; His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime In manhood where youth ended ; by his side , As in a glistering zodiack , hung the sword , Satan ' s dire dread ; and in his hand the spear .
these happy walks and shades , Fit haunt of Gods ?
O flowers , That never will in other climate grow , My early visitation , and my last ; t even , which I bred up with tender hand From the first opening bud , and gave ye names !
Who now shall rear ye to the sun , or rank Your tribes , and water from the ambrosial fount ?
Thee lastly , nuptial bower !
from thee How shall I part , and whither wander down Into a lower world ; to this obscure And wild ?
how shall we breathe in other air Less pure , accustomed to immortal fruits ?
both for the deed , and for the cause !
Dire was the tossing , deep the groans ; Despair Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch ; And over them triumphant Death his dart Shook , but delayed to strike , though oft invoked With vows , as their chief good , and final hope .
Why is life given To be thus wrested from us ?
Why should not Man , Retaining still divine similitude In part , from such deformities be free , And , for his Maker ' s image sake , exempt ?
I yield it just , said Adam , and submit .
Henceforth I fly not death , nor would prolong Life much ; bent rather , how I may be quit , Fairest and easiest , of this cumbrous charge ; Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendering up , and patiently attend My dissolution .
He looked , and saw wide territory spread Before him , towns , and rural works between ; Cities of men with lofty gates and towers , Concourse in arms , fierce faces threatening war , Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise ; Part wield their arms , part curb the foaming steed , Single or in array of battle ranged Both horse and foot , nor idly mustering stood ; One way a band select from forage drives A herd of beeves , fair oxen and fair kine , From a fat meadow ground ; or fleecy flock , Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain , Their booty ; scarce with life the shepherds fly , But call in aid , which makes a bloody fray ; With cruel tournament the squadrons join ; Where cattle pastured late , now scattered lies With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field , Deserted : Others to a city strong Lay siege , encamped ; by battery , scale , and mine , Assaulting ; others from the wall defend With dart and javelin , stones , and sulphurous fire ; On each hand slaughter , and gigantick deeds .
These are the product Of those ill - mated marriages thou sawest ; Where good with bad were matched , who of themselves Abhor to join ; and , by imprudence mixed , Produce prodigious births of body or mind .
At length a reverend sire among them came , And of their doings great dislike declared , And testified against their ways ; he oft Frequented their assemblies , whereso met , Triumphs or festivals ; and to them preached Conversion and repentance , as to souls In prison , under judgements imminent : But all in vain : which when he saw , he ceased Contending , and removed his tents far off ; Then , from the mountain hewing timber tall , Began to build a vessel of huge bulk ; Measured by cubit , length , and breadth , and highth ; Smeared round with pitch ; and in the side a door Contrived ; and of provisions laid in large , For man and beast : when lo , a wonder strange !
How didst thou grieve then , Adam , to behold The end of all thy offspring , end so sad , Depopulation !
Whereat the heart of Adam , erst so sad , Greatly rejoiced ; and thus his joy broke forth .
Or serve they , as a flowery verge , to bind The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud , Lest it again dissolve , and shower the earth ?
To whom the Arch - Angel .
so to aspire Above his brethren ; to himself assuming Authority usurped , from God not given : He gave us only over beast , fish , fowl , Dominion absolute ; that right we hold By his donation ; but man over men He made not lord ; such title to himself Reserving , human left from human free .
To whom thus Michael .
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low From virtue , which is reason , that no wrong , But justice , and some fatal curse annexed , Deprives them of their outward liberty ; Their inward lost : Witness the irreverent son Of him who built the ark ; who , for the shame Done to his father , heard this heavy curse , Servant of servants , on his vicious race .
Thus with ten wounds The river - dragon tamed at length submits To let his sojourners depart , and oft Humbles his stubborn heart ; but still , as ice More hardened after thaw ; till , in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissed , the sea Swallows him with his host ; but them lets pass , As on dry land , between two crystal walls ; Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided , till his rescued gain their shore : Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend , Though present in his Angel ; who shall go Before them in a cloud , and pillar of fire ; By day a cloud , by night a pillar of fire ; To guide them in their journey , and remove Behind them , while the obdurate king pursues : All night he will pursue ; but his approach Darkness defends between till morning watch ; Then through the fiery pillar , and the cloud , God looking forth will trouble all his host , And craze their chariot - wheels : when by command Moses once more his potent rod extends Over the sea ; the sea his rod obeys ; On their embattled ranks the waves return , And overwhelm their war : The race elect Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance Through the wild Desart , not the readiest way ; Lest , entering on the Canaanite alarmed , War terrify them inexpert , and fear Return them back to Egypt , choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude ; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untrained in arms , where rashness leads not on .
Here Adam interposed .
So law appears imperfect ; and but given With purpose to resign them , in full time , Up to a better covenant ; disciplined From shadowy types to truth ; from flesh to spirit ; From imposition of strict laws to free Acceptance of large grace ; from servile fear To filial ; works of law to works of faith .
And therefore shall not Moses , though of God Highly beloved , being but the minister Of law , his people into Canaan lead ; But Joshua , whom the Gentiles Jesus call , His name and office bearing , who shall quell The adversary - Serpent , and bring back Through the world ' s wilderness long - wandered Man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest .
There in captivity he lets them dwell The space of seventy years ; then brings them back , Remembering mercy , and his covenant sworn To David , stablished as the days of Heaven .
A virgin is his mother , but his sire The power of the Most High : He shall ascend The throne hereditary , and bound his reign With Earth ' s wide bounds , his glory with the Heavens .
now clear I understand What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain ; Why our great Expectation should be called The seed of Woman : Virgin Mother , hail , High in the love of Heaven ; yet from my loins Thou shalt proceed , and from thy womb the Son Of God Most High : so God with Man unites !
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend With victory , triumphing through the air Over his foes and thine ; there shall surprise The Serpent , prince of air , and drag in chains Through all his realm , and there confounded leave ; Then enter into glory , and resume His seat at God ' s right hand , exalted high Above all names in Heaven ; and thence shall come , When this world ' s dissolution shall be ripe , With glory and power to judge both quick and dead ; To judge the unfaithful dead , but to reward His faithful , and receive them into bliss , Whether in Heaven or Earth ; for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise , far happier place Than this of Eden , and far happier days .
Who then shall guide His people , who defend ?
Will they not deal Worse with his followers than with him they dealt ?
Whence thou returnest , and whither wentest , I know ; For God is also in sleep ; and dreams advise , Which he hath sent propitious , some great good Presaging , since with sorrow and heart ' s distress Wearied I fell asleep : But now lead on ; In me is no delay ; with thee to go , Is to stay here ; without thee here to stay , Is to go hence unwilling ; thou to me Art all things under $ Heaven , all places thou , Who for my wilful crime art banished hence .
So spake our mother Eve ; and Adam heard Well pleased , but answered not : For now , too nigh The Arch - Angel stood ; and , from the other hill To their fixed station , all in bright array The Cherubim descended ; on the ground Gliding meteorous , as evening - mist Risen from a river o ' er the marish glides , And gathers ground fast at the labourer ' s heel Homeward returning .

Euen by the rule of that Philosophy , By which I did blame Cato , for the death Which he did giue himselfe , I know not how : But I do finde it Cowardly , and vile , For feare of what might fall , so to preuent The time of life , arming my selfe with patience , To stay the prouidence of some high Powers , That gouerne vs below
And whether we shall meete againe , I know not : Therefore our euerlasting farewell take : For euer , and for euer , farewell Cassius , If we do meete againe , why we shall smile ; If not , why then this parting was well made
Come ho , away .
O looke Titinius , looke , the Villaines flye : My selfe haue to mine owne turn ' d Enemy : This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe , I slew the Coward , and did take it from him
This day I breathed first , Time is come round , And where I did begin , there shall I end , My life is run his compasse .

That can I , At least the whisper goes so : Our last King , Whose Image euen but now appear ' d to vs , Was ( as you know ) by Fortinbras of Norway , ( Thereto prick ' d on by a most emulate Pride ) Dar ' d to the Combate .
Or , if thou hast vp - hoorded in thy life Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth , ( For which , they say , you Spirits oft walke in death ) Speake of it .

But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement , is a course Of impious stubbornnesse .
Madam come , This gentle and vnforc ' d accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart ; in grace whereof , No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day , But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell , And the Kings Rouce , the Heauens shall bruite againe , Respeaking earthly Thunder .

And we fooles of Nature , So horridly to shake our disposition , With thoughts beyond thee ; reaches of our Soules , Say , why is this ?

Being a thing immortall as it selfe : It waues me forth againe ; Ile follow it
What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord ?
Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe , That beetles o ' re his base into the Sea , And there assumes some other horrible forme , Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason , And draw you into madnesse thinke of it ?

He tooke me by the wrist , and held me hard ; Then goes he to the length of all his arme ; And with his other hand thus o ' re his brow , He fals to such perusall of my face , As he would draw it .
Long staid he so , At last , a little shaking of mine Arme : And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe ; He rais ' d a sigh , so pittious and profound , That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke , And end his being .

No my good Lord : but as you did command , I did repell his Letters , and deny ' de His accesse to me

You who celebrate bygones , Who have explored the outward , the surfaces of the races , the life that has exhibited itself , Who have treated of man as the creature of politics , aggregates , rulers and priests , I , habitan of the Alleghanies , treating of him as he is in himself in his own rights , Pressing the pulse of the life that has seldom exhibited itself , ( the great pride of man in himself ,) Chanter of Personality , outlining what is yet to be , I project the history of the future .

And so will some one when I am dead and gone write my life ?

Of your real body and any man ' s or woman ' s real body , Item for item it will elude the hands of the corpse - cleaners and pass to fitting spheres , Carrying what has accrued to it from the moment of birth to the moment of death .
land of gold !
Land of the pastoral plains , the grass - fields of the world !
Lands where the north - west Columbia winds , and where the south - west Colorado winds !
land of Vermont and Connecticut !
the experienced sisters and the inexperienced sisters !
my intrepid nations !
O I at any rate include you all with perfect love !
No dainty dolce affettuoso I , Bearded , sun - burnt , gray - neck ' d , forbidding , I have arrived , To be wrestled with as I pass for the solid prizes of the universe , For such I afford whoever can persevere to win them .
These , my voice announcing -- I will sleep no more but arise , You oceans that have been calm within me !
Have you reckon ' d a thousand acres much ?
Loafe with me on the grass , loose the stop from your throat , Not words , not music or rhyme I want , not custom or lecture , not even the best , Only the lull I like , the hum of your valved voice .
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers , Darker than the colorless beards of old men , Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths .
All goes onward and outward , nothing collapses , And to die is different from what any one supposed , and luckier .
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die , and I know it .
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth , I am the mate and companion of people , all just as immortal and fathomless as myself , ( They do not know how immortal , but I know .
you are not guilty to me , nor stale nor discarded , I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no , And am around , tenacious , acquisitive , tireless , and cannot be shaken away .
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west , the bride was a red girl , Her father and his friends sat near cross - legged and dumbly smoking , they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders , On a bank lounged the trapper , he was drest mostly in skins , his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck , he held his bride by the hand , She had long eyelashes , her head was bare , her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach ' d to her feet .
The beards of the young men glisten ' d with wet , it ran from their long hair , Little streams pass ' d all over their bodies .
14 The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night , Ya - honk he says , and sounds it down to me like an invitation , The pert may suppose it meaningless , but I listening close , Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky .
) Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs , the mower mows , and the winter - grain falls in the ground ; Off on the lakes the pike - fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface , The stumps stand thick round the clearing , the squatter strikes deep with his axe , Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton - wood or pecan - trees , Coon - seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain ' d by the Tennessee , or through those of the Arkansas , Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw , Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great - grandsons around them , In walls of adobie , in canvas tents , rest hunters and trappers after their day ' s sport , The city sleeps and the country sleeps , The living sleep for their time , the dead sleep for their time , The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife ; And these tend inward to me , and I tend outward to them , And such as it is to be of these more or less I am , And of these one and all I weave the song of myself .

This is the press of a bashful hand , this the float and odor of hair , This the touch of my lips to yours , this the murmur of yearning , This the far - off depth and height reflecting my own face , This the thoughtful merge of myself , and the outlet again .
Do you take it I would astonish ?
What is a man anyhow ?
Why should I pray ?

I know I am deathless , I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter ' s compass , I know I shall not pass like a child ' s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night .
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue !
Far - swooping elbow ' d earth -- rich apple - blossom ' d earth !
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy ?
And mine a word of the modern , the word En - Masse .
It alone is without flaw , it alone rounds and completes all , That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all .
Hurrah for positive science !

Your facts are useful , and yet they are not my dwelling , I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling .
Unscrew the locks from the doors !
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs !
I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms .
Divine am I inside and out , and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch ' d from , The scent of these arm - pits aroma finer than prayer , This head more than churches , bibles , and all the creeds .
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you !
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you !
Sun so generous it shall be you !
That I walk up my stoop , I pause to consider if it really be , A morning - glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books .
To behold the day - break !
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding , Scooting obliquely high and low .

) The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies , It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess ' d them , It sails me , I dab with bare feet , they are lick ' d by the indolent waves , I am cut by bitter and angry hail , I lose my breath , Steep ' d amid honey ' d morphine , my windpipe throttled in fakes of death , At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles , And that we call Being .

now I see it is true , what I guess ' d at , What I guess ' d when I loaf ' d on the grass , What I guess ' d while I lay alone in my bed , And again as I walk ' d the beach under the paling stars of the morning .
I help myself to material and immaterial , No guard can shut me off , no law prevent me .
I ascend to the foretruck , I take my place late at night in the crow ' s - nest , We sail the arctic sea , it is plenty light enough , Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty , The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them , the scenery is plain in all directions , The white - topt mountains show in the distance , I fling out my fancies toward them , We are approaching some great battle - field in which we are soon to be engaged , We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment , we pass with still feet and caution , Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin ' d city , The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe .
I understand the large hearts of heroes , The courage of present times and all times , How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steamship , and Death chasing it up and down the storm , How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch , and was faithful of days and faithful of nights , And chalk ' d in large letters on a board , Be of good cheer , we will not desert you ; How he follow ' d with them and tack ' d with them three days and would not give it up , How he saved the drifting company at last , How the lank loose - gown ' d women look ' d when boated from the side of their prepared graves , How the silent old - faced infants and the lifted sick , and the sharp - lipp ' d unshaved men ; All this I swallow , it tastes good , I like it well , it becomes mine , I am the man , I suffer ' d , I was there .
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general , he furiously waves with his hand , He gasps through the clot Mind not me -- mind -- the entrenchments .
Retreating they had form ' d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks , Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies , nine times their number , was the price they took in advance , Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone , They treated for an honorable capitulation , receiv ' d writing and seal , gave up their arms and march ' d back prisoners of war .
They were the glory of the race of rangers , Matchless with horse , rifle , song , supper , courtship , Large , turbulent , generous , handsome , proud , and affectionate , Bearded , sunburnt , drest in the free costume of hunters , Not a single one over thirty years of age .
None obey ' d the command to kneel , Some made a mad and helpless rush , some stood stark and straight , A few fell at once , shot in the temple or heart , the living and dead lay together , The maim ' d and mangled dug in the dirt , the new - comers saw them there , Some half - kill ' d attempted to crawl away , These were despatch ' d with bayonets or batter ' d with the blunts of muskets , A youth not seventeen years old seiz ' d his assassin till two more came to release him , The three were all torn and cover ' d with the boy ' s blood .
Fighting at sun - down , fighting at dark , Ten o ' clock at night , the full moon well up , our leaks on the gain , and five feet of water reported , The master - at - arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after - hold to give them a chance for themselves .
Serene stands the little captain , He is not hurried , his voice is neither high nor low , His eyes give more light to us than our battle - lanterns .
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us .

Old age superbly rising !
O welcome , ineffable grace of dying days !
Wider and wider they spread , expanding , always expanding , Outward and outward and forever outward .
It is not far , it is within reach , Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know , Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land .
You are also asking me questions and I hear you , I answer that I cannot answer , you must find out for yourself .
Sit a while dear son , Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink , But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes , I kiss you with a good - by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence .

The soldier camp ' d or upon the march is mine , On the night ere the pending battle many seek me , and I do not fail them , On that solemn night ( it may be their last ) those that know me seek me .

There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them , and in the contact and odor of them , that pleases the soul well , All things please the soul , but these please the soul well .
6 The male is not less the soul nor more , he too is in his place , He too is all qualities , he is action and power , The flush of the known universe is in him , Scorn becomes him well , and appetite and defiance become him well , The wildest largest passions , bliss that is utmost , sorrow that is utmost become him well , pride is for him , The full - spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul , Knowledge becomes him , he likes it always , he brings every thing to the test of himself , Whatever the survey , whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here , ( Where else does he strike soundings except here ?

Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you would soon certainly kill me ?
} I Am He That Aches with Love
Native moments -- when you come upon me -- ah you are here now , Give me now libidinous joys only , Give me the drench of my passions , give me life coarse and rank , To - day I go consort with Nature ' s darlings , to - night too , I am for those who believe in loose delights , I share the midnight orgies of young men , I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers , The echoes ring with our indecent calls , I pick out some low person for my dearest friend , He shall be lawless , rude , illiterate , he shall be one condemn ' d by others for deeds done , I will play a part no longer , why should I exile myself from my companions ?
As Adam early in the morning , Walking forth from the bower refresh ' d with sleep , Behold me where I pass , hear my voice , approach , Touch me , touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass , Be not afraid of my body .
O blossoms of my blood !
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book , Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it , Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me , Nor will the candidates for my love ( unless at most a very few ) prove victorious , Nor will my poems do good only , they will do just as much evil , perhaps more , For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit , that which I hinted at ; Therefore release me and depart on your way .
For you , for you I am trilling these songs .
And who but I should be the poet of comrades ?
) And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut , And stems of currants and plum - blows , and the aromatic cedar , These I compass ' d around by a thick cloud of spirits , Wandering , point to or touch as I pass , or throw them loosely from me , Indicating to each one what he shall have , giving something to each ; But what I drew from the water by the pond - side , that I reserve , I will give of it , but only to them that love as I myself am capable of loving .
Of the terrible doubt of appearances , Of the uncertainty after all , that we may be deluded , That may - be reliance and hope are but speculations after all , That may - be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only , May - be the things I perceive , the animals , plants , men , hills , shining and flowing waters , The skies of day and night , colors , densities , forms , may - be these are ( as doubtless they are ) only apparitions , and the real something has yet to be known , ( How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me !
And now gentlemen , A word I give to remain in your memories and minds , As base and finale too for all metaphysics .

When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv ' d with plaudits in the capitol , still it was not a happy night for me that follow ' d , And else when I carous ' d , or when my plans were accomplish ' d , still I was not happy , But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health , refresh ' d , singing , inhaling the ripe breath of autumn , When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light , When I wander ' d alone over the beach , and undressing bathed , laughing with the cool waters , and saw the sun rise , And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his way coming , O then I was happy , O then each breath tasted sweeter , and all that day my food nourish ' d me more , and the beautiful day pass ' d well , And the next came with equal joy , and with the next at evening came my friend , And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the shores , I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to me whispering to congratulate me , For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night , In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me , And his arm lay lightly around my breast -- and that night I was happy .

Toward you all , in America ' s name , I raise high the perpendicular hand , I make the signal , To remain after me in sight forever , For all the haunts and homes of men .
You flagg ' d walks of the cities !
From all that has touch ' d you I believe you have imparted to yourselves , and now would impart the same secretly to me , From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces , and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me .
Here is the test of wisdom , Wisdom is not finally tested in schools , Wisdom cannot be pass ' d from one having it to another not having it , Wisdom is of the soul , is not susceptible of proof , is its own proof , Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content , Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things , and the excellence of things ; Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul .
Now I re - examine philosophies and religions , They may prove well in lecture - rooms , yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents .

I too many and many a time cross ' d the river of old , Watched the Twelfth - month sea - gulls , saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings , oscillating their bodies , Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow , Saw the slow - wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south , Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water , Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams , Look ' d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water , Look ' d on the haze on the hills southward and south - westward , Look ' d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet , Look ' d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving , Saw their approach , saw aboard those that were near me , Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops , saw the ships at anchor , The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars , The round masts , the swinging motion of the hulls , the slender serpentine pennants , The large and small steamers in motion , the pilots in their pilothouses , The white wake left by the passage , the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels , The flags of all nations , the falling of them at sunset , The scallop - edged waves in the twilight , the ladled cups , the frolic - some crests and glistening , The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer , the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks , On the river the shadowy group , the big steam - tug closely flank ' d on each side by the barges , the hay - boat , the belated lighter , On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night , Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses , and down into the clefts of streets .

Cross from shore to shore , countless crowds of passengers !

But the mother needs to be better , She with thin form presently drest in black , By day her meals untouch ' d , then at night fitfully sleeping , often waking , In the midnight waking , weeping , longing with one deep longing , O that she might withdraw unnoticed , silent from life escape and withdraw , To follow , to seek , to be with her dear dead son .

Bearing the bandages , water and sponge , Straight and swift to my wounded I go , Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in , Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground , Or to the rows of the hospital tent , or under the roof ' d hospital , To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return , To each and all one after another I draw near , not one do I miss , An attendant follows holding a tray , he carries a refuse pail , Soon to be fill ' d with clotted rags and blood , emptied , and fill ' d again .

Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me , And the thought of death close - walking the other side of me , And I in the middle as with companions , and as holding the hands of companions , I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not , Down to the shores of the water , the path by the swamp in the dimness , To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still .
Come lovely and soothing death , Undulate round the world , serenely arriving , arriving , In the day , in the night , to all , to each , Sooner or later delicate death .
Prais ' d be the fathomless universe , For life and joy , and for objects and knowledge curious , And for love , sweet love -- but praise !
For the sure - enwinding arms of cool - enfolding death .
Over the tree - tops I float thee a song , Over the rising and sinking waves , over the myriad fields and the prairies wide , Over the dense - pack ' d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways , I float this carol with joy , with joy to thee O death .
While my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed , As to long panoramas of visions .
Yet each to keep and all , retrievements out of the night , The song , the wondrous chant of the gray - brown bird , And the tallying chant , the echo arous ' d in my soul , With the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe , With the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird , Comrades mine and I in the midst , and their memory ever to keep , for the dead I loved so well , For the sweetest , wisest soul of all my days and lands -- and this for his dear sake , Lilac and star and bird twined with the chant of my soul , There in the fragrant pines and the cedars dusk and dim .
My Captain !
O the bleeding drops of red , Where on the deck my Captain lies , Fallen cold and dead .
Hush ' d be the camps to - day , And soldiers let us drape our war - worn weapons , And each with musing soul retire to celebrate , Our dear commander ' s death .
No more for him life ' s stormy conflicts , Nor victory , nor defeat -- no more time ' s dark events , Charging like ceaseless clouds across the sky .

} Proud Music of the Storm
1 Proud music of the storm , Blast that careers so free , whistling across the prairies , Strong hum of forest tree - tops -- wind of the mountains , Personified dim shapes -- you hidden orchestras , You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert , Blending with Nature ' s rhythmus all the tongues of nations ; You chords left as by vast composers -- you choruses , You formless , free , religious dances -- you from the Orient , You undertone of rivers , roar of pouring cataracts , You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry , Echoes of camps with all the different bugle - calls , Trooping tumultuous , filling the midnight late , bending me powerless , Entering my lonesome slumber - chamber , why have you seiz ' d me ?
A festival song , The duet of the bridegroom and the bride , a marriage - march , With lips of love , and hearts of lovers fill ' d to the brim with love , The red - flush ' d cheeks and perfumes , the cortege swarming full of friendly faces young and old , To flutes ' clear notes and sounding harps ' cantabile .
seest thou in powder - smoke the banners torn but flying ?
the rout of the baffled ?
( Ah soul , the sobs of women , the wounded groaning in agony , The hiss and crackle of flames , the blacken ' d ruins , the embers of cities , The dirge and desolation of mankind .
for earth and heaven ; ( The Almighty leader now for once has signal ' d with his wand .
3 Ah from a little child , Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music , My mother ' s voice in lullaby or hymn , ( The voice , O tender voices , memory ' s loving voices , Last miracle of all , O dearest mother ' s , sister ' s , voices ;) The rain , the growing corn , the breeze among the long - leav ' d corn , The measur ' d sea - surf beating on the sand , The twittering bird , the hawk ' s sharp scream , The wild - fowl ' s notes at night as flying low migrating north or south , The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees , the open air camp - meeting , The fiddler in the tavern , the glee , the long - strung sailor - song , The lowing cattle , bleating sheep , the crowing cock at dawn .
Across the stage with pallor on her face , yet lurid passion , Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand .
And you , sweet singers of old lands , soprani , tenori , bassi !
The Past -- the dark unfathom ' d retrospect !
Eclaircise the myths Asiatic , the primitive fables .
A worship new I sing , You captains , voyagers , explorers , yours , You engineers , you architects , machinists , yours , You , not for trade or transportation only , But in God ' s name , and for thy sake O soul .
In one again , different , ( yet thine , all thine , O soul , the same ,) I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier , I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers , I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring , and the shrill steam - whistle , I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world , I cross the Laramie plains , I note the rocks in grotesque shapes , the buttes , I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions , the barren , colorless , sage - deserts , I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains , I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains , I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle ' s Nest , I pass the Promontory , I ascend the Nevadas , I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base , I see the Humboldt range , I thread the valley and cross the river , I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe , I see forests of majestic pines , Or crossing the great desert , the alkaline plains , I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows , Marking through these and after all , in duplicate slender lines , Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel , Tying the Eastern to the Western sea , The road between Europe and Asia .
Along all history , down the slopes , As a rivulet running , sinking now , and now again to the surface rising , A ceaseless thought , a varied train -- lo , soul , to thee , thy sight , they rise , The plans , the voyages again , the expeditions ; Again Vasco de Gama sails forth , Again the knowledge gain ' d , the mariner ' s compass , Lands found and nations born , thou born America , For purpose vast , man ' s long probation fill ' d , Thou rondure of the world at last accomplish ' d .
Year of the marriage of continents , climates and oceans !
Passage to India !
Swiftly I shrivel at the thought of God , At Nature and its wonders , Time and Space and Death , But that I , turning , call to thee O soul , thou actual Me , And lo , thou gently masterest the orbs , Thou matest Time , smilest content at Death , And fillest , swellest full the vastnesses of Space .
What aspirations , wishes , outvie thine and ours O soul ?
Passage to you , your shores , ye aged fierce enigmas !
You , strew ' d with the wrecks of skeletons , that , living , never reach ' d you .
the blood burns in my veins !
Have we not stood here like trees in the ground long enough ?
O farther farther sail !
O farther , farther , farther sail !
O I am sure they really came from Thee , The urge , the ardor , the unconquerable will , The potent , felt , interior command , stronger than words , A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep , These sped me on .
Is it the prophet ' s thought I speak , or am I raving ?
the fit is whirling me fast !
It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman ' s , I sit low in a straw - bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson ' s stockings .
I cannot aid with my wringing fingers , I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me .
A red squaw came one breakfast - time to the old homestead , On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush - bottoming chairs , Her hair , straight , shiny , coarse , black , profuse , half - envelop ' d her face , Her step was free and elastic , and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke .
The red squaw staid all the forenoon , and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away , O my mother was loth to have her go away , All the week she thought of her , she watch ' d for her many a month , She remember ' d her many a winter and many a summer , But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again .
The myth of heaven indicates the soul , The soul is always beautiful , it appears more or it appears less , it comes or it lags behind , It comes from its embower ' d garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world , Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting , and perfect and clean the womb cohering , The head well - grown proportion ' d and plumb , and the bowels and joints proportion ' d and plumb .
Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you ?
Is to - day nothing ?
is the beginningless past nothing ?
Slow - moving and black lines creep over the whole earth -- they never cease -- they are the burial lines , He that was President was buried , and he that is now President shall surely be buried .
What is called good is perfect , and what is called bad is just as perfect , The vegetables and minerals are all perfect , and the imponderable fluids perfect ; Slowly and surely they have pass ' d on to this , and slowly and surely they yet pass on .
The trees have , rooted in the ground !
That the exquisite scheme is for it , and the nebulous float is for it , and the cohering is for it !

Till when the ties loosen , All but the ties eternal , Time and Space , Nor darkness , gravitation , sense , nor any bounds bounding us .

As I sit with others at a great feast , suddenly while the music is playing , To my mind , ( whence it comes I know not ,) spectral in mist of a wreck at sea , Of certain ships , how they sail from port with flying streamers and wafted kisses , and that is the last of them , Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President , Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder ' d off the Northeast coast and going down -- of the steamship Arctic going down , Of the veil ' d tableau - women gather ' d together on deck , pale , heroic , waiting the moment that draws so close -- O the moment !
Let me glide noiselessly forth ; With the key of softness unlock the locks -- with a whisper , Set ope the doors O soul .

This face is an epilepsy , its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry , Its veins down the neck distend , its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites , Its teeth grit , the palms of the hands are cut by the turn ' d - in nails , The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground , while he speculates well .

} All Is Truth
Where has fail ' d a perfect return indifferent of lies or the truth ?
or in the meat and blood ?
Meditating among liars and retreating sternly into myself , I see that there are really no liars or lies after all , And that nothing fails its perfect return , and that what are called lies are perfect returns , And that each thing exactly represents itself and what has preceded it , And that the truth includes all , and is compact just as much as space is compact , And that there is no flaw or vacuum in the amount of the truth -- but that all is truth without exception ; And henceforth I will go celebrate any thing I see or am , And sing and laugh and deny nothing .
In looks of fair unconscious babes , Or strangely in the coffin ' d dead , Or show of breaking dawn or stars by night , As some dissolving delicate film of dreams , Hiding yet lingering .
How , justified by it , the horrors , evils , battles of the earth !
for I would be the most just person of the earth , And who most cautious ?
for I know what it is to receive the passionate love of many friends , And who possesses a perfect and enamour ' d body ?
for I do not believe any one possesses a more perfect or enamour ' d body than mine , And who thinks the amplest thoughts ?
how certain and final !
Of the frivolous Judge -- of the corrupt Congressman , Governor , Mayor -- of such as these standing helpless and exposed , Of the mumbling and screaming priest , ( soon , soon deserted ,) Of the lessening year by year of venerableness , and of the dicta of officers , statutes , pulpits , schools , Of the rising forever taller and stronger and broader of the intuitions of men and women , and of Self - esteem and Personality ; Of the true New World -- of the Democracies resplendent en - masse , Of the conformity of politics , armies , navies , to them , Of the shining sun by them -- of the inherent light , greater than the rest , Of the envelopment of all by them , and the effusion of all from them .

The lyrist ' s measur ' d beat , the wrought - out temple ' s grace -- column and polish ' d arch forgot ?
This is thy hour O Soul , thy free flight into the wordless , Away from books , away from art , the day erased , the lesson done , Thee fully forth emerging , silent , gazing , pondering the themes thou lovest best , Night , sleep , death and the stars .
must all then amount to but this ?
Years of the modern !
) I see Freedom , completely arm ' d and victorious and very haughty , with Law on one side and Peace on the other , A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste ; What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach ?
Your dreams O years , how they penetrate through me !
Ashes of soldiers South or North , As I muse retrospective murmuring a chant in thought , The war resumes , again to my sense your shapes , And again the advance of the armies .
} Thoughts
1 Of these years I sing , How they pass and have pass ' d through convuls ' d pains , as through parturitions , How America illustrates birth , muscular youth , the promise , the sure fulfilment , the absolute success , despite of people -- illustrates evil as well as good , The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one ' s - self , How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed , caste , myths , obedience , compulsion , and to infidelity , How few see the arrived models , the athletes , the Western States , or see freedom or spirituality , or hold any faith in results , ( But I see the athletes , and I see the results of the war glorious and inevitable , and they again leading to other results .
How the water sports and sings !
( Surely there is something more in each of the trees , some living soul .
As I steam ' d down the Mississippi , As I wander ' d over the prairies , As I have lived , as I have look ' d through my windows my eyes , As I went forth in the morning , as I beheld the light breaking in the east , As I bathed on the beach of the Eastern Sea , and again on the beach of the Western Sea , As I roam ' d the streets of inland Chicago , whatever streets I have roam ' d , Or cities or silent woods , or even amid the sights of war , Wherever I have been I have charged myself with contentment and triumph .
As at thy portals also death , Entering thy sovereign , dim , illimitable grounds , To memories of my mother , to the divine blending , maternity , To her , buried and gone , yet buried not , gone not from me , ( I see again the calm benignant face fresh and beautiful still , I sit by the form in the coffin , I kiss and kiss convulsively again the sweet old lips , the cheeks , the closed eyes in the coffin ;) To her , the ideal woman , practical , spiritual , of all of earth , life , love , to me the best , I grave a monumental line , before I go , amid these songs , And set a tombstone here .
Nor alone those camps of white , old comrades of the wars , When as order ' d forward , after a long march , Footsore and weary , soon as the light lessens we halt for the night , Some of us so fatigued carrying the gun and knapsack , dropping asleep in our tracks , Others pitching the little tents , and the fires lit up begin to sparkle , Outposts of pickets posted surrounding alert through the dark , And a word provided for countersign , careful for safety , Till to the call of the drummers at daybreak loudly beating the drums , We rise up refresh ' d , the night and sleep pass ' d over , and resume our journey , Or proceed to battle .
} Joy , Shipmate , Joy !
What are those of the known but to ascend and enter the Unknown ?
And what are those of life but for Death ?
Screaming electric , the atmosphere using , At random glancing , each as I notice absorbing , Swiftly on , but a little while alighting , Curious envelop ' d messages delivering , Sparkles hot , seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping , Myself unknowing , my commission obeying , to question it never daring , To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving , To troops out of the war arising , they the tasks I have set promulging , To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing , their affection me more clearly explaining , To young men my problems offering -- no dallier I -- I the muscle of their brains trying , So I pass , a little time vocal , visible , contrary , Afterward a melodious echo , passionately bent for , ( death making me really undying ,) The best of me then when no longer visible , for toward that I have been incessantly preparing .
What is there more , that I lag and pause and crouch extended with unshut mouth ?
My songs cease , I abandon them , From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely to you .
Camerado , this is no book , Who touches this touches a man , ( Is it night ?
are we here together alone ?
O how your fingers drowse me , Your breath falls around me like dew , your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears , I feel immerged from head to foot , Delicious , enough .
One side thy inland ocean laving , broad , with copious commerce , steamers , sails , And one the Atlantic ' s wind caressing , fierce or gentle -- mighty hulls dark - gliding in the distance .
To those who ' ve fail ' d , in aspiration vast , To unnam ' d soldiers fallen in front on the lead , To calm , devoted engineers -- to over - ardent travelers -- to pilots on their ships , To many a lofty song and picture without recognition -- I ' d rear laurel - cover ' d monument , High , high above the rest -- To all cut off before their time , Possess ' d by some strange spirit of fire , Quench ' d by an early death .
As I sit writing here , sick and grown old , Not my least burden is that dulness of the years , querilities , Ungracious glooms , aches , lethargy , constipation , whimpering ennui , May filter in my dally songs .
Did we count great , O soul , to penetrate the themes of mighty books , Absorbing deep and full from thoughts , plays , speculations ?
Or leave me here as now , Dull , parrot - like and old , with crack ' d voice harping , screeching ?

Not from successful love alone , Nor wealth , nor honor ' d middle age , nor victories of politics or war ; But as life wanes , and all the turbulent passions calm , As gorgeous , vapory , silent hues cover the evening sky , As softness , fulness , rest , suffuse the frame , like freshier , balmier air , As the days take on a mellower light , and the apple at last hangs really finish ' d and indolent - ripe on the tree , Then for the teeming quietest , happiest days of all !
