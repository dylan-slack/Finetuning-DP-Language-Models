But yesterday ' s statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen ' s rise from around 153 to the dollar , the level at the February 22 Paris Accord , to about 145 today .
In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action " extraordinary and urgent ", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals , or economic reality .
Monetary sources said that , privately , West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U . S . unit .
The United States and France , backed by the International Monetary Fund , want the seven to agree on ranges or " norms " for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth , inflation , monetary conditions , trade balances and current account balances .
Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required .
The rate was last adjusted on March 9 , when it was cut to 7 - 3 / 4 pct from the eight pct rate set in January .
IMF officials , discussing their outlook , said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade .

The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that " it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect .

Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education , Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government ' s overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament , the analysts said .
Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1 . 5 pct , while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct .

" Producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable ," he said .
An official at Colombia ' s National Association of Sugar Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets .
Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover .
Plans of nearby Cuba , the world ' s largest cane sugar exporter , to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious , trade sources said .
Output is running well below the record 8 . 6 mln produced in 1970 .
Negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far , the main sticking point being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non - delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace .
