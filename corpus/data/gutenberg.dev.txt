[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]
VOLUME I
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .
"
I could not walk half so far .
" They are to be put into Mr . Weston ' s stable , papa .
We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .
Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .
It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .
" Not at all , sir .
"
" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .
It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .
How did you all behave ?
"
' Tis a sad business .
" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .
"
Mr . Knightley shook his head at her .
Her father fondly replied , " Ah !
Oh dear , no !
A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !
You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said .
" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ," rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .
" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ," said Mr . Knightley , laughing , " and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .
Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .
A complete change of life became desirable .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .
He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .
Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr . Knightley , comprehended many such .
Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .
In that respect Mrs . Weston ' s loss had been important .
Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .
" Well done , Mrs .
"
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
"
" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?
He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can .
He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
He has passed you very often .
" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .
"
Oh yes !
I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well .
" Six years hence !
Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet .
" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet .
What do you think of him ?
"
I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
"
"
But Mr . Knightley is so very fine a man !
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
"
" Which makes his good manners the more valuable .
He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss .
And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ .
Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?
"
" Mr . Weston would undoubtedly support me , if he were here , for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject .
I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .
" I dare say ," replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , " that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ' s omitting to do any thing I wished .
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
"
"
"
I only name possibilities .
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
you would rather talk of her person than her mind , would you ?
She is loveliness itself .
Mr . Knightley , is not she ?
Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .
Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .
It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home .
She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
She was a beautiful creature when she came to you , but , in my opinion , the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature .
" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .
She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture .
But really , I could almost venture , if Harriet would sit to me .
"
Pray , pray attempt it .
"
She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s performances must be capital .
" I had only my own family to study from .
There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike .
He had nestled down his head most conveniently .
That ' s very like .
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s .
Mr . Elton was only too happy .
She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .
Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr . Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism .
"
" I cannot agree with you .
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold .
"
" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .
"
" You , sir , may say any thing ," cried Mr . Elton , " but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !
Any other situation would have been much less in character .
It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr . Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December .
" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love .
But it is his gratitude on Harriet ' s account .
"
CHAPTER VII
She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .
And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
I ' d rather you would .
"
" Yes .
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment .
"
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
"
" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet .
I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you .
You blush , Harriet .-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ?
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
"
It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr . Martin .
"
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself .
" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ," said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; " at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .
"
"
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper .
" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet .
Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves .
I hope he will not mind it so very much .
"
" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried Emma .
" At this moment , perhaps , Mr . Elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters , telling how much more beautiful is the original , and after being asked for it five or six times , allowing them to hear your name , your own dear name .
Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
I treat you without ceremony , Mr . Knightley .
"
" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr . Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey .
"
" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting .
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
"
" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps .
" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !
I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
" I have reason to think ," he replied , " that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage , and from a most unexceptionable quarter :-- Robert Martin is the man .
I was very much pleased with all that he said .
He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .
" Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?
Was not she the whole day with you ?
"
" Nonsense !
" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong .
By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Emma , your infatuation about that girl blinds you .
She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .
" I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing .
What !
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr . Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- The sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- It would be a degradation .
"
"
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
He was thinking .
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain .
He continued ,
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
"
On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs . Goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more .
My first doth affliction denote , Which my second is destin ' d to feel And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal .--
" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr .
" I do not offer it for Miss Smith ' s collection ," said he .
"
To Miss --
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
I have read worse charades .
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
Do try to find it out , Miss Woodhouse .
Do you think it is a good one ?
Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?
Nonsense !
That is _court_ .
But ah !
Read it in comfort to yourself .
There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you .
But she was not wanted to speak .
"
He is so very superior .
"
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls .
And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr . Knightley !
"
" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read .
"
Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear .
You do nothing .
"
She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .
' It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma .
If I had but her memory !
And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through .
We copied it from the Elegant Extracts .
It was Garrick ' s , you know .
Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?
"
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
" Ah !
John , the second , is named after his father .
Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
"
" He appears rough to you ," said Emma , " because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
"
"
He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --
" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two .
" There it is .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much .
"
She pondered , but could think of nothing .
but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall .
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s .
"
" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !
This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .
And as for objects of interest , objects for the affections , which is in truth the great point of inferiority , the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in _not_ marrying , I shall be very well off , with all the children of a sister I love so much , to care about .
" Do you know Miss Bates ' s niece ?
Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .
"
" I do not think it will ," stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place , and recall the still greater within .
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves .
dear , yes ," before the gentleman joined them .
I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
"
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .
The coming of her sister ' s family was so very near at hand , that first in anticipation , and then in reality , it became henceforth her prime object of interest ; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected -- she did not herself expect -- that any thing beyond occasional , fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers .
She could never see a fault in any of them .
She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr . Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr . Perry .
The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his .
Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father .
"
" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well .-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably .
no -- none in the least .
" Oh !
"
Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor .
"
" Where is the young man ?
" said John Knightley .
Whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell .
"
"
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
Mr . Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords .
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
" Yes ," said he , smiling --" and reason good .
" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .
Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it .
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited .
I only want to know that Mr . Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed .
" A man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .
The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits , but principally of those of the elder , whose temper was by much the most communicative , and who was always the greater talker .
My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel .
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing .
" Come , come ," cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , " I must beg you not to talk of the sea .
South End is prohibited , if you please .
" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well .
I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .
" How sorry I am !
Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be .
" No , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .
Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air .
" Ah !
my dear , it is not like Hartfield .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present .
"
" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .
I think Mr . John Knightley very far from looking well .
" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?
"
" said Mrs . John Knightley .-- " It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town !
This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation .
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
"
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty .
"
"
She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly .
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them .
" A sore - throat !-- I hope not infectious .
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
Why does not Perry see her ?
"
" Me !
" she replied with a smile of astonishment , " are you imagining me to be Mr . Elton ' s object ?
"
Mr . Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .
"
"
"
It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- Ha !
Charming people , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ;-- Mrs . Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .
"
"
She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs . Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of " Can it really be as my brother imagined ?
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !
But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January .
I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she cannot calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing .
I used to think she was not capable of being fond of any body , except herself : but she has always been kind to him ( in her way -- allowing for little whims and caprices , and expecting every thing to be as she likes ).
And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper .
" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ," replied Isabella : " and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .
The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better .
They are jealous even of his regard for his father .
" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her .
Now , according to my idea of Mrs . Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all .
He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .
" What is to be done , my dear Emma ?-- what is to be done ?
His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .
"
"
And the bell was rung , and the carriages spoken for .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .
Mr . Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed !-- Oh !
No !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me .
" Charming Miss Woodhouse !
allow me to interpret this interesting silence .
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
"
The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all .
"
How she could have been so deceived !-- He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet -- never !
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
Mr . Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr .
The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr . Elton to Mr . Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr . Elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them .
She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion .
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society .
Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .
For the present , he could not be spared , to his " very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period .
Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount .
We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom .
" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .
Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .
" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father .
A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs . Churchill -- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it .
"
"
I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those , whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life .
" Our amiable young man is a very weak young man , if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others .
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man : I feel sure that he is not .
Mr . Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man ' s perfection .
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
"
CHAPTER I
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !
She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .
Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too .
" replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--" Oh !
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker - work '-- don ' t you , ma ' am ?-- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word .
My mother ' s are really very good indeed .
Ma ' am ," addressing her , " do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane ' s handwriting ?
Jane speaks so distinct !
Yes , next week .
That is what she writes about .
Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .
Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr . Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs . Campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only Mr . Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
They want her ( Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr . Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention .
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !
" I am concerned to hear of it .
"
" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing !
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following -- as you will find from Jane ' s letter .
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
"
She regained the street -- happy in this , that though much had been forced on her against her will , though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax ' s letter , she had been able to escape the letter itself .
By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .
When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her .
The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .
Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .
They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr . Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn .
She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
These were charming feelings -- but not lasting .
The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ' s offences rose again .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .
It did her no service however .
Her caution was thrown away .
"-- " He was generally thought so .
He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement .
" A very pleasant evening ," he began , as soon as Mr . Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ;--" particularly pleasant .
I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation .
I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence .
I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
a great pity indeed !
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you .
"
" Oh !
Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork !
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
" I was with Mr . Cole on business an hour and a half ago .
that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .
my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
We may well say that ` our lot is cast in a goodly heritage .
"-- Here was a sly glance at Emma .
" He had been so fortunate as to -- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .
"
"
Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him .
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
" When I have seen Mr . Elton ," replied Jane , " I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _that_ with me .
Oh !
" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all .
" Very odd !
but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand .
" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"
as for me , my judgment is worth nothing .
Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking .
Oh !
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you .
Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject .
Oh !
And Elizabeth , too .
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
Mr . Elton ' s rights , however , gradually revived .
It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm .
CHAPTER IV
Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little .
Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .
That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins .
She had talked her into love ; but , alas !
And now , poor girl !
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .
She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again ; and Miss Smith receiving her summons , was with her without delay , and unattended by any alarming young man .
In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends .
_He_ had done it .
" This is too bad ," cried Emma , as they turned away .
Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr . and Mrs . Weston , who were standing to speak to her .
" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield ," said he , at the conclusion .
Emma ' s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness ; every thing wore a different air ; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before .
"
They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs . Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
" I hope I should know better ," he replied ; " no , depend upon it , ( with a gallant bow ,) that in addressing Mrs . Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms .
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
She had no doubt of what Mr . Weston was often thinking about .
His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression ; and even , when he might have determined not to look , she was confident that he was often listening .
Do not defer it .
"
You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue .
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way .
"
"
They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
They were all three walking about together for an hour or two -- first round the shrubberies of Hartfield , and afterwards in Highbury .
Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it .
"
" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?
Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion .
"
"
this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me .
You will be adored in Highbury .
They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow .
"
"
I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began .
Dixon is very musical , is he ?
"
" Yes , Mr . Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof .
"
" said Emma , laughing .
" As to that -- I do not --"
They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself .
Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question .
He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting .
With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .
Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield .
Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place .
Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
I am sorry Mr . and Mrs . Cole should have done it .
"
He had a great regard for Mrs . Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
"
"
" But , my dear sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party .
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better .
They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .
My dear Emma , we must consider this .
She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .
If he were , he would have done this differently .
He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it .
He thanked her , observing , " How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !
"
" Yes I should , I am sure I should .
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .
That very dear part of Emma , her fancy , received an amusing supply .
Mrs . Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs . Cole .
"
" Mrs . Dixon !
She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s .
It is Mrs . Dixon , I dare say .
I told you that your suspicions would guide mine .
"
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are .
"
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
"
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business .
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love .
To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill .
Elton .
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
This had happened the year before .
I never knew days fly so fast .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
"
"
" Very likely ," said Emma --" nothing more likely .
"
I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
"
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart .
" Nonsense !
"
How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him ?-- To have her haunting the Abbey , and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane ?-- ` So very kind and obliging !-- But he always had been such a very kind neighbour !
` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .
" For shame , Emma !
You divert me against my conscience .
The interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect !
I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points !-- Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !
" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love .
His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .
" Yes ," he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- " But they would have done better had they given her notice of it .
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .
"
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
The strength of the song falls on the second .
No ; he was talking to Mrs . Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs . Cole .
After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity .
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill .
The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ' s is much beyond it .
"
" Are you sure ?
" Oh !
"
"
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
I was not aware of it myself .
But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
But you had better go with Mrs . Weston and hear the instrument .
She might do very well by herself .
A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood .
" No more it is .
Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs . Goddard ' s -- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
What do you advise ?
"
Goddard ' s .
How do you do , Miss Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs . Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding .
Jane said so .
At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .
Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
Not that I had any doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr . Woodhouse recommend a baked apple .
Jane came back delighted yesterday .
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in .
" I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of .-- Oh !
' said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .
' said he , ` I can fasten the rivet .
.
He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
He would be so very .
Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will .
" Pray take care , Mrs . Weston , there is a step at the turning .
Miss Smith , the step at the turning .
" What !
I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home .
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
" It is not fair ," said Emma , in a whisper ; " mine was a random guess .
Do not distress her .
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .
She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else .
I would have her understand me .
" I am very glad you did , and that you communicated it to me .
Leave shame to her .
"
" I am going to Kingston .
dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs .
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
Can I do any thing for _you_ ?
" No , not now , I thank you .
"
I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs . Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I cannot stay to hear it .
"
.
.
.
.
Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs . Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .
But soon it came to be on one side ,
On another ,
" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?
It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in .
He does not think of the draught .
" No , no ," said she , " you are quite unreasonable .
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
"
Had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough .
A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited .
He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- Oh !
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
"
We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief .
" Have you indeed , sir ?-- Bless me !
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done .
Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .
"
You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention .
"
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
" What does all that signify ?
It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight .
This card - room would be wanted as a card - room now ; or , if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves , still was it not too small for any comfortable supper ?
Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .
We shall not be many , you know .
If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance .
She is still nearer .-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
"
" Both sir !
I did not immediately recollect .
" Very well .
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , I confess .-- Pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not I , indeed -- I never look at it -- I do not know who does .-- Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .
Mrs . Weston added , " that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
and she and her partner the happiest !--" I said it would be so ," was the only consolation .
" This will not be your only visit to Randalls .
"
that ball !-- why did we wait for any thing ?-- why not seize the pleasure at once ?-- How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation !-- You told us it would be so .-- Oh !
"
I would much rather have been merry than wise .
"
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
It was a right thing to do .
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
She hardly knew what to say .
It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish .
She heard him sigh .
What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
Could he have thought himself encouraged , his looks and language at parting would have been different .-- Still , however , I must be on my guard .
His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the " beautiful little friend ," suggested to her the idea of Harriet ' s succeeding her in his affections .
It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet ' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand .
He would soon be among them again ; Mr . Elton and his bride .
Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !
It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity .-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it .-- Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives .
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease .
It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it .
Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
He called her ` Augusta .
Mrs . Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room , the entrance , and all that she could see or imagine .
I really could not help exclaiming !
I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove .
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
Surry is full of beauties .
" Oh !
yes , I am quite aware of that .
It is the garden of England , you know .
" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction .
"
" I never heard any county but Surry called so .
When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr . Suckling is extremely fond of exploring .
We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure .
" Ah !
Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really cannot get this girl to move from the house .
' Many a time has she said so ; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion .
" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr . Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now .
The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood .
"
I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree .
"
Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ' s pause , Mrs . Elton chose another subject .
I like them extremely .
"
" Knightley !
Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man .
They were off ; and Emma could breathe .
" Insufferable woman !
" Worse than I had supposed .
Absolutely insufferable !
And Mrs .
Worse and worse .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
Oh !
How angry and how diverted he would be !
Ah !
"--
However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .
But I ought to have gone before .
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them .
" My dear , you do not understand me .
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .
` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air .
"
" Oh !
And I think she feels it .
I am sure she does .
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
You and I need not be afraid .
_We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
" Poor Jane Fairfax !
Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !
" We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home .
Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome .
"
" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
" I should not wonder ," said Mrs . Weston , " if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting Mrs . Elton ' s civilities for her .
Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married .
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife .
Do not beat me .
" I see how it is ," said she .
I have neglected her too long .
" I went only to the post - office ," said she , " and reached home before the rain was much .
It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out .
A walk before breakfast does me good .
Mr . John Knightley smiled , and replied ,
When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for .
There was a little blush , and then this answer ,
"
" Indifferent !
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
"
Young ladies should take care of themselves .-- Young ladies are delicate plants .
You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
"
" My dear Jane , what is this I hear ?-- Going to the post - office in the rain !-- This must not be , I assure you .-- You sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you .
"
" Oh !
You and I must positively exert our authority .
" Oh !
" We will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .
"
But I do flatter myself , my dear Jane , that my influence is not entirely worn out .
"
" Oh !
If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !
" It is certainly very well regulated .
"
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made .
Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike .
" Yes ," said his brother hesitatingly , " there is a likeness .
I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest .
" Isabella and Emma both write beautifully ," said Mr . Woodhouse ; " and always did .
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw .
"
"
This was not submitted to by either lady .
They vindicated him against the base aspersion .
Knightley .
Jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
" I not aware !
" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly .
"
my dear , human flesh !
"
" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ," replied Mrs . Elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us .
" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest !-- Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- I assure you I like him excessively .
A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery .
A man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .
Mr . Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs . Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .
" Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma .
The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body .
This is precisely what I wanted .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
"
" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing .
Mr . Weston , do not mistake me .
Weston ?-- To Bath , or to Clifton ?
" When Frank left us ," continued he , " it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ' s news doubly welcome .
And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
Oh !
" You were mentioning May .
I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards .
"
"
" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be .
The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great .
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .
She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls .
He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .
She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
" So unreasonably early !
" she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- She could fancy such a man .
They had stopped at Mrs . Bates ' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons .
He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages ,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
" I think she must be here soon ," said he .
Mr . Weston was following ; but Mrs . Elton detained him , to gratify him by her opinion of his son ; and so briskly did she begin , that the young man himself , though by no means moving slowly , could hardly be out of hearing .
Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious !-- I believe we drive faster than any body .-- What a pleasure it is to send one ' s carriage for a friend !-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary .
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them .
Nothing wanting .
" She was now met by Mrs .
Very happy to hear it .
Jane and I quite ready .
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
Dr . Hughes I declare -- and Mrs . Hughes .
Must go and speak to Dr . and Mrs . Hughes for a moment .-- How do you do ?
Don ' t disturb him .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
How do you do , Mr .
Arthur !-- How do you do ?
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
I like him very well .
"-- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- " That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose .
" Then changing from a frown to a smile --" No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean .-- Where is my father ?-- When are we to begin dancing ?
He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?
She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better .-- He seemed often observing her .
The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away .
He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .
She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .
"
" If Mrs . Gilbert wishes to dance ," said he , " I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs .
Gilbert .
" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith .
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr .
Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .
She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,
" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith !-- Very goodnatured , I declare .
The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you ?-- Here is your tippet .
you are too obliging !
Quite the queen of the evening !-- Well , here we are at the passage .
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught .
Bless me !
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure .
" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?
"
An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs . Elton .
Emma was extremely gratified .-- They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again .
" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example .
" I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted .
"
no , indeed .
CHAPTER III
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
Such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain .
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .
Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury .
The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .
The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .
As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me .
" How I could so long a time be fancying myself !
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
"
" Here ," resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , " here is something still more valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did .
" Well , go on .
that ' s all .
"
"
She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made , and could not but hope that the gipsy , though she had _told_ no fortune , might be proved to have made Harriet ' s .-- About a fortnight after the alarm , they came to a sufficient explanation , and quite undesignedly .
" Never marry !-- This is a new resolution .
"
" cried Harriet indignantly .--" Oh !
no "-- and Emma could just catch the words , " so superior to Mr .
Should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .
Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you .
"
Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane .
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
"
really , never !-- Bless me !
how could it be ?-- Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired .
"
" What is this ?-- What is this ?
" cried Mr . Weston , " about Perry and a carriage ?
I am a great dreamer .
"
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
" Why , to own the truth ," cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , " if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr . Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs . Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days .
Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
Jane , don ' t you remember grandmama ' s telling us of it when we got home ?
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
It used to stand here .
This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer .
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
Mr . Knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension .
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
It was done however .
He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other .
"
Oh !
" Oh !
you amuse me excessively .
This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
One cannot have too large a party .
" she cried .--" And such weather for exploring !-- These delays and disappointments are quite odious .
What are we to do ?-- The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .
I should like it of all things ," was not plainer in words than manner .
" You may depend upon me ," said she .
"
"
" I hope you will bring Elton ," said he : " but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations .
" Oh !
now you are looking very sly .
I will invite your guests .
"-- Mrs . Weston , I suppose ," interrupted Mrs . Elton , rather mortified .
"
Don ' t scruple .
Nothing can be more simple , you see .
" Well -- as you please ; only don ' t have a great set out .
" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance .
You can borrow Mrs . Cole ' s .
As I tell Mr . E ., you are a thorough humourist .-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme .
Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr . Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- Mrs . Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .
These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade .
Such , for half an hour , was the conversation -- interrupted only once by Mrs . Weston , who came out , in her solicitude after her son - in - law , to inquire if he were come -- and she was a little uneasy .-- She had some fears of his horse .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc .
" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them ."-- Mrs .
Churchill ' s state , however , as many were ready to remind her , was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence -- and Mrs . Weston was at last persuaded to believe , or to say , that it must be by some attack of Mrs . Churchill that he was prevented coming .-- Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration ; she behaved very well , and betrayed no emotion .
"
I shall be at home in twenty minutes .
" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- I would rather walk .-- And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- I , who may so soon have to guard others !
Mine , I confess , are exhausted .
such an aunt !
He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .
I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !
You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem .
" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland .
" They may be induced to go too .
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad .
I am tired of doing nothing .
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could .
"
" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence .
Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?
I am thwarted in every thing material .
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person .
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
You are my best cure .
" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening .
"
" Then pray stay at Richmond .
I can never bear to think of you all there without me .
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party .
I had quite determined to go away again .
" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .
" Don ' t say I was cross .
" It comes to the same thing .
That is your date .
I thought I had seen you first in February .
"
"
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
I saw you first in February .
What shall we do to rouse them ?
Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .
no , no "-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- " Upon no account in the world .
Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .
" Very true , my love , very true .
"
( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ' s assent )-- Do not you all think I shall ?
"
" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?
you will never guess .
" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady .
"
Peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge .
How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !
"-- She was stopped by a cough .
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
( turning to Emma .
" And make her like myself .
I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
Hazle eyes excepted , two years more might make her all that he wished .
"
We shall soon overtake her .
There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .
Mr . Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ' s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
She has talked of it since .
He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless .
How could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued !
Time did not compose her .
But it should be so no more .
There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough .
But Miss Bates soon came --" Very happy and obliged "-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .
` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
' ` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .
` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .
She spoke as she felt , with earnest regret and solicitude -- sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on , might be as much for Miss Fairfax ' s advantage and comfort as possible .
There was no bearing such an " always ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --
"
" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"
She would not take a denial .
"
Elton ?
" No , not Mr . Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs . Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had .
However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it .
" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?
" Ah !
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
And poor John ' s son came to talk to Mr . Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr . Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr . Frank Churchill to Richmond .
"
I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .
Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,
" I would not go away without seeing you , but I have no time to spare , and therefore must now be gone directly .
While he stood , as if meaning to go , but not going -- her father began his inquiries .
Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr .
Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ' s situation with Mr .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background .
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
poor woman , who would have thought it !
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing .
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?
Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr . Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is .
Which of them is it ?-- I charge you by all that is sacred , not to attempt concealment .
"
" Oh !
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind .
" So far as that it relates to Mr . Frank Churchill , I do guess .
) " He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .
" More than an attachment , indeed ," resumed Mrs . Weston ; " an engagement -- a positive engagement .-- What will you say , Emma -- what will any body say , when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged ;-- nay , that they have been long engaged !
But it is even so .
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
"
"
The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct .
So unlike what a man should be !-- None of that upright integrity , that strict adherence to truth and principle , that disdain of trick and littleness , which a man should display in every transaction of his life .
"
"
" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now .
Let us have patience .
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion .
" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning .
"
" And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy ?-- The Campbells , the Dixons , did none of them know of the engagement ?
"
" Well ," said Emma , " I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy .
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady .
But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe .
" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments .
She was extremely angry with herself .
If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison .
In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs . Weston had just gone through by herself .
" replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
" Why should you caution me ?-- You do not think I care about Mr . Frank Churchill .
" To be sure I am .
" Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .
I am sure the service Mr . Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of .
" Good God !
" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .
But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear --.
Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,
" Have you any idea of Mr . Knightley ' s returning your affection ?
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr . Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
) He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .
No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
You told me to observe him carefully , and let his behaviour be the rule of mine -- and so I have .
" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr . Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does .
The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
had she never brought Harriet forward !
was not that her own doing too ?
She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality .-- How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates !
Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about .
They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady .
The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .
Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
"
" Wrong !
But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .
I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right ; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken , and the kindness I am now receiving , is what my conscience tells me ought not to be .
Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up .
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy .
' She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
They shew her to the greatest advantage .
It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers .
"
The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe .
When it came to such a pitch as this , she was not able to refrain from a start , or a heavy sigh , or even from walking about the room for a few seconds -- and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn , was in the resolution of her own better conduct , and the hope that , however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past , it would yet find her more rational , more acquainted with herself , and leave her less to regret when it were gone .
She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors .
He was silent .
And this belief produced another dread .
Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
"
After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied ,
" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already .
" cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
She went on , however .
They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible .
" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise .
" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself .
"
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
" You are going in , I suppose ?
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?
Say ` No ,' if it is to be said .
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .
" I cannot make speeches , Emma :" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .
_Her_ change was equal .-- This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill .-- He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question .
From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I cannot say ;-- when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .
If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to .
She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
Perhaps it is paid already .
Its effect upon her appears in the immediate resolution it produced : as soon as she found I was really gone from Randalls , she closed with the offer of that officious Mrs . Elton ; the whole system of whose treatment of her , by the bye , has ever filled me with indignation and hatred .
I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness .-- I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at --: in short , the full direction to Mr . Smallridge ' s , near Bristol , stared me in the face .
with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- I felt that it would be of a different sort .-- Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her .
A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away .
But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion .-- Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune .
I hope she is right .-- In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .
"
But that would not do .
"
"
It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --"
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal .-- No judge of his own manners by you .-- Always deceived in fact by his own wishes , and regardless of little besides his own convenience .-- Fancying you to have fathomed his secret .
My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?
Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .
" I perfectly agree with you , sir ,"-- was then his remark .
" You did behave very shamefully .
"
actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --"
"
What a letter the man writes !
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him .
" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it .
"
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
" Part only of this answer , however , was admitted .
He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr . Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr . Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
You must get his consent before you ask mine .
It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .
How much worse , had they been obliged to meet !
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
" This is most kind , indeed !-- Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words .
"
I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended .
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?
no ; cautious as a minister of state .
Emma could not doubt .
" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .
" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse ," she shortly afterwards began , " since the party to Box Hill .
Very pleasant party .
What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception .
" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master .
" What !
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
'-- Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight .-- However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all .
"
"
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove .
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
"
My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please .
The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look .
Mr . Elton made his appearance .
"
Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods .-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley !-- Can you explain it ?
" I cannot imagine ," said Mrs . Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do ,) " I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !
Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration .
I have nothing to do with William ' s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose .
"
You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --.
you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ," cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand .
Let us forgive each other at once .
"
"
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it .
The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .
"
"
'-- You always called me , ` Mr . Knightley ;' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- And yet it is formal .
I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what .
"
Knightley .
" John does not even mention your friend ," said Mr . Knightley .
"
" John enters like a brother into my happiness ," continued Mr . Knightley , " but he is no complimenter ; and though I well know him to have , likewise , a most brotherly affection for you , he is so far from making flourishes , that any other young woman might think him rather cool in her praise .
It is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side , but that he is not without hope of my growing , in time , as worthy of your affection , as you think me already .
I am amused by one part of John ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .
As soon as Mrs . Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr . Woodhouse ' s visits , Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause , resolved first to announce it at home , and then at Randalls .-- But how to break it to her father at last !-- She had bound herself to do it , in such an hour of Mr . Knightley ' s absence , or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her , and she must have put it off ; but Mr . Knightley was to come at such a time , and follow up the beginning she was to make .-- She was forced to speak , and to speak cheerfully too .
Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ?
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion .
"-- But Mrs . Elton was very much discomposed indeed .--" Poor Knightley !
It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr . Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .
"
You are trying not to smile .
" Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith .
Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .
" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin .
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .
But in time they will .
"
" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .
" she cried .--" Well !
"
They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley ' s .
The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith .
To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
"
" cried Mr . Knightley .
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day .
"
" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before .
I have often talked to her a good deal .
poor Harriet !
Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .
She must laugh at such a close !
Such a heart -- such a Harriet !
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston ' s letters .
I hope you do not retract what you then said .
" No , indeed ," cried Emma , most happy to begin , " not in the least .
" Is not she looking well ?
" Better than she ever used to do ?-- You see how my father and Mrs . Weston doat upon her .
" The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .
Early , I know , you had none .
I was once very near -- and I wish I had -- it would have been better .
"
by the bye ," then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment --" I hope Mr . Knightley is well ?
" Did you ever see such a skin ?-- such smoothness !
"
"
" No , not true on your side .
They are to be new set .
She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry .
"
"
The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
"
This friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne .
To Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god - daughter , favourite , and friend .
All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .
It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty - nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost .
Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .
Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self - possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .
For thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing - rooms and dining - rooms in the country .
The heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq ., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .
The following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married .
It had not been possible for him to spend less ; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do ; but blameless as he was , he was not only growing dreadfully in debt , but was hearing of it so often , that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer , even partially , from his daughter .
Their two confidential friends , Mr Shepherd , who lived in the neighbouring market town , and Lady Russell , were called to advise them ; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure , without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride .
But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth .
Every emendation of Anne ' s had been on the side of honesty against importance .
What will he be doing , in fact , but what very many of our first families have done , or ought to do ?
I have great hope of prevailing .
She rated Lady Russell ' s influence highly ; and as to the severe degree of self - denial which her own conscience prompted , she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete , than to half a reformation .
How Anne ' s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence .
No , he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once , than remain in it on such disgraceful terms .
"
In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself ; and would be looked up to , as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household .
But the usual fate of Anne attended her , in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on .
Sir Walter had at first thought more of London ; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London , and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it , and make Bath preferred .
Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight : its more convenient distance from Kellynch , only fifty miles , and Lady Russell ' s spending some part of every winter there ; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell , whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath , Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there .
It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood .
Anne had been too little from home , too little seen .
A larger society would improve them .
This , however , was a profound secret , not to be breathed beyond their own circle .
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd , who had returned , after an unprosperous marriage , to her father ' s house , with the additional burden of two children .
This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore .
They will be all wanting a home .
Could not be a better time , Sir Walter , for having a choice of tenants , very responsible tenants .
" There are few among the gentlemen of the navy , I imagine , who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description .
Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of !
You need not be afraid , Miss Elliot , of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected .
" The profession has its utility , but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it .
"
" Indeed !
First , as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction , and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of ; and secondly , as it cuts up a man ' s youth and vigour most horribly ; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man .
A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father , his father might have disdained to speak to , and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself , than in any other line .
' ` Sixty ,' said I , ` or perhaps sixty - two .
" Nay , Sir Walter ," cried Mrs Clay , " this is being severe indeed .
Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject ; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral ' s family , which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant .
He was a married man , and without children ; the very state to be wished for .
A house was never taken good care of , Mr Shepherd observed , without a lady : he did not know , whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady , as where there were many children .
A lady , without a family , was the very best preserver of furniture in the world .
" And a very well - spoken , genteel , shrewd lady , she seemed to be ," continued he ; " asked more questions about the house , and terms , and taxes , than the Admiral himself , and seemed more conversant with business ; and moreover , Sir Walter , I found she was not quite unconnected in this country , any more than her husband ; that is to say , she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once ; she told me so herself : sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford .
"
" Bless me !
I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose .
After waiting another moment --
" Wentworth ?
ay ,-- Mr Wentworth , the curate of Monkford .
In all their dealings and intercourse , Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence .
Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act ; and no sooner had such an end been reached , than Anne , who had been a most attentive listener to the whole , left the room , to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks ; and as she walked along a favourite grove , said , with a gentle sigh , " A few months more , and he , perhaps , may be walking here .
They were gradually acquainted , and when acquainted , rapidly and deeply in love .
Anne Elliot , with all her claims of birth , beauty , and mind , to throw herself away at nineteen ; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man , who had nothing but himself to recommend him , and no hopes of attaining affluence , but in the chances of a most uncertain profession , and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession , would be , indeed , a throwing away , which she grieved to think of !
Captain Wentworth had no fortune .
Lady Russell had little taste for wit , and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror .
The belief of being prudent , and self - denying , principally for his advantage , was her chief consolation , under the misery of a parting , a final parting ; and every consolation was required , for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions , on his side , totally unconvinced and unbending , and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment .
She had been solicited , when about two - and - twenty , to change her name , by the young man , who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister ; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal ; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man , whose landed property and general importance were second in that country , only to Sir Walter ' s , and of good character and appearance ; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more , while Anne was nineteen , she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty - two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father ' s house , and settled so permanently near herself .
But in this case , Anne had left nothing for advice to do ; and though Lady Russell , as satisfied as ever with her own discretion , never wished the past undone , she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne ' s being tempted , by some man of talents and independence , to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits .
She did not blame Lady Russell , she did not blame herself for having been guided by her ; but she felt that were any young person , in similar circumstances , to apply to her for counsel , they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness , such uncertain future good .
"
It would be most right , and most wise , and , therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others .
Mary , often a little unwell , and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints , and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter , was indisposed ; and foreseeing that she should not have a day ' s health all the autumn , entreated , or rather required her , for it was hardly entreaty , to come to Uppercross Cottage , and bear her company as long as she should want her , instead of going to Bath .
To be claimed as a good , though in an improper style , is at least better than being rejected as no good at all ; and Anne , glad to be thought of some use , glad to have anything marked out as a duty , and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country , and her own dear country , readily agreed to stay .
But poor Mrs Clay who , with all her merits , can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty , I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety .
However , at any rate , as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have , I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me .
"
Anne had done ; glad that it was over , and not absolutely hopeless of doing good .
Their respectability was as dear to her as her own , and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit .
Accordingly their removal was made together , and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage , in the first stage of Lady Russell ' s journey .
Little Charles does not mind a word I say , and Walter is growing quite as bad .
"
It is early .
"
You wrote in the cheerfullest manner , and said you were perfectly well , and in no hurry for me ; and that being the case , you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last : and besides what I felt on her account , I have really been so busy , have had so much to do , that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner .
I have had all my own little concerns to arrange , books and music to divide , and all my trunks to repack , from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons : and one thing I have had to do , Mary , of a more trying nature : going to almost every house in the parish , as a sort of take - leave .
I have made no enquiries , because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party .
" Nothing remarkable .
They are both so very large , and take up so much room ; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward .
To the Great House accordingly they went , to sit the full half hour in the old - fashioned square parlour , with a small carpet and shining floor , to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano - forte and a harp , flower - stands and little tables placed in every direction .
The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment .
Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people ; friendly and hospitable , not much educated , and not at all elegant .
Their dress had every advantage , their faces were rather pretty , their spirits extremely good , their manner unembarrassed and pleasant ; they were of consequence at home , and favourites abroad .
Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family , which was generally , as Anne very well knew , the least to blame .
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable ; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife , but not of powers , or conversation , or grace , to make the past , as they were connected together , at all a dangerous contemplation ; though , at the same time , Anne could believe , with Lady Russell , that a more equal match might have greatly improved him ; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character , and more usefulness , rationality , and elegance to his habits and pursuits .
" I could manage them very well , if it were not for Mary ' s interference ," was what Anne often heard him say , and had a good deal of faith in ; but when listening in turn to Mary ' s reproach of " Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order ," she never had the smallest temptation to say , " Very true .
One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties , and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house .
Miss Anne , I cannot help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children .
I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener ; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment ; " don ' t do this ," and " don ' t do that ;" or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them .
I meet them wherever I go ; and I declare , I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them .
If Jemima were not the trustiest , steadiest creature in the world , it would be enough to spoil her ; for she tells me , they are always tempting her to take a walk with them .
In all other respects , her visit began and proceeded very well .
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going .
Her manners were open , easy , and decided , like one who had no distrust of herself , and no doubts of what to do ; without any approach to coarseness , however , or any want of good humour .
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing ; but the age of emotion she certainly had not .
She immediately felt how reasonable it was , that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward , and not of Frederick ; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour ' s present state with proper interest .
The rest was all tranquillity ; till , just as they were moving , she heard the Admiral say to Mary --
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys , clinging to him like an old friend , and declaring he should not go ; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets , & c ., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun , Anne was left to persuade herself , as well as she could , that the same brother must still be in question .
So we must be as merry as we can , that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things .
She found , however , that it was one to which she must inure herself .
Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove ' s civility , and she was all but calling there in the same half hour .
His collar - bone was found to be dislocated , and such injury received in the back , as roused the most alarming ideas .
The same story and the same raptures were repeated , when the two girls came with their father , through the gloom of the evening , to make enquiries ; and Mr Musgrove , no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir , could add his confirmation and praise , and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off , and only be sorry to think that the cottage party , probably , would not like to leave the little boy , to give him the meeting .
" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife , with " Oh !
no , indeed , Charles , I cannot bear to have you go away .
Mary knew , from Charles ' s manner of speaking , that he was quite determined on going , and that it would be of no use to teaze him .
She said nothing , therefore , till he was out of the room , but as soon as there was only Anne to hear --
So here he is to go away and enjoy himself , and because I am the poor mother , I am not to be allowed to stir ; and yet , I am sure , I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child .
A sick child is always the mother ' s property : her own feelings generally make it so .
Jemima is so careful ; and she could send us word every hour how he was .
It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima .
" This is very kind of Anne ," was her husband ' s answer , " and I should be very glad to have you go ; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself , to nurse our sick child .
He must be either indifferent or unwilling .
Mary , very much gratified by this attention , was delighted to receive him , while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne , of which this was the most consoling , that it would soon be over .
And it was soon over .
How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness !
What might not eight years do ?
And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question .
On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented , she was soon spared all suspense ; for , after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary : --
'"
She had already acknowledged it to herself , and she could not think differently , let him think of her as he would .
They were of sobering tendency ; they allayed agitation ; they composed , and consequently must make her happier .
It was now his object to marry .
He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves , if they could catch it ; a heart , in short , for any pleasing young woman who came in his way , excepting Anne Elliot .
Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking .
Should not this be enough for a sailor , who has had no society among women to make him nice ?
From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle .
They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove ' s , for the little boy ' s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself ; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings .
With the exception , perhaps , of Admiral and Mrs Croft , who seemed particularly attached and happy , ( Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples ), there could have been no two hearts so open , no tastes so similar , no feelings so in unison , no countenances so beloved .
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party ; and he was very much questioned , and especially by the two Miss Musgroves , who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him , as to the manner of living on board , daily regulations , food , hours , & c ., and their surprise at his accounts , at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable , drew from him some pleasant ridicule , which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant , and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat , or any cook to dress it if there were , or any servant to wait , or any knife and fork to use .
When she could let her attention take its natural course again , she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List ( their own navy list , the first that had ever been at Uppercross ), and sitting down together to pore over it , with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded .
Reported fit for home service for a year or two , and so I was sent off to the West Indies .
The girls looked all amazement .
What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together ?
She did all that I wanted .
I knew that we should either go to the bottom together , or that she would be the making of me ; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her ; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining , I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn , to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted .
" And so then , I suppose ," said Mrs Musgrove , in a low voice , as if thinking aloud , " so then he went away to the Laconia , and there he met with our poor boy .
I always forgot .
" Ah !
A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands .
I shall never forget his happiness .
" And I am sure , Sir .
" My brother ," whispered one of the girls ; " mamma is thinking of poor Richard .
it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you .
" But , if I know myself ," said he , " this is from no want of gallantry towards them .
I hate to hear of women on board , or to see them on board ; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere , if I can help it .
Frederick !
" I might not like them the better for that perhaps .
"
When he is married , if we have the good luck to live to another war , we shall see him do as you and I , and a great many others , have done .
" What a great traveller you must have been , ma ' am !
" Pretty well , ma ' am in the fifteen years of my marriage ; though many women have done more .
We do not call Bermuda or Bahama , you know , the West Indies .
When you come to a frigate , of course , you are more confined ; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them ; and I can safely say , that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship .
A little disordered always the first twenty - four hours of going to sea , but never knew what sickness was afterwards .
The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind , the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell , or had any ideas of danger , was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal , when the Admiral ( Captain Croft then ) was in the North Seas .
"
The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come , particularly in the morning , when he had no companion at home , for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together , interesting themselves in their new possessions , their grass , and their sheep , and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person , or driving out in a gig , lately added to their establishment .
He was in orders ; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood , where residence was not required , lived at his father ' s house , only two miles from Uppercross .
A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period , and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners , and of seeing Captain Wentworth .
Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters .
They had each had money , but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence .
Mr Hayter had some property of his own , but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove ' s ; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country , the young Hayters would , from their parents ' inferior , retired , and unpolished way of living , and their own defective education , have been hardly in any class at all , but for their connexion with Uppercross , this eldest son of course excepted , who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman , and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest .
"
If he should ever be made a baronet !
` Lady Wentworth ' sounds very well .
That would be a noble thing , indeed , for Henrietta !
She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday .
I wish you had been with us yesterday , for then you might have decided between us ; and I am sure you would have thought as I did , unless you had been determined to give it against me .
A dinner at Mr Musgrove ' s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne ; but she had staid at home , under the mixed plea of a headache of her own , and some return of indisposition in little Charles .
She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth ; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening .
She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope , and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross : but there was such a change as became very alarming , when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause .
The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross , instead of going six miles another way ; of his having , in every respect , a better curacy ; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley , and of dear , good Dr Shirley ' s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue , had been a great deal , even to Louisa , but had been almost everything to Henrietta .
When he came back , alas !
" Well , I am very glad indeed : but I always thought you would have it ; I always thought you sure .
She only attempted to say , " How do you do ?
"
" Walter ," said she , " get down this moment .
But not a bit did Walter stir .
But neither Charles Hayter ' s feelings , nor anybody ' s feelings , could interest her , till she had a little better arranged her own .
Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about , and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to .
It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning .
He had , probably , never heard , and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter .
Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross ; a most decided change .
Anne ' s object was , not to be in the way of anybody ; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary , to keep with her brother and sister .
It was mere lively chat , such as any young persons , on an intimate footing , might fall into .
He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta .
Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister .
" Ah !
If I loved a man , as she loves the Admiral , I would always be with him , nothing should ever separate us , and I would rather be overturned by him , than driven safely by anybody else .
" Had you ?
Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again .
" said Charles Musgrove , and " No , no !
" It is very unpleasant , having such connexions !
They were speaking as they drew near .
"
"
" Happy for her , to have such a mind as yours at hand !
" Then returning to his former earnest tone -- " My first wish for all whom I am interested in , is that they should be firm .
" Mary is good - natured enough in many respects ," said she ; " but she does sometimes provoke me excessively , by her nonsense and pride -- the Elliot pride .
yes ; certainly .
"
We should all have liked her a great deal better ; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell ' s doing , that she did not .
They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell , and that therefore , she persuaded Anne to refuse him .
The sounds were retreating , and Anne distinguished no more .
As soon as she could , she went after Mary , and having found , and walked back with her to their former station , by the stile , felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected , and once more in motion together .
Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth ; nothing could be plainer ; and where many divisions were necessary , or even where they were not , they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two .
She joined Charles and Mary , and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles ' s other arm ; but Charles , though in very good humour with her , was out of temper with his wife .
The walking party had crossed the lane , and were surmounting an opposite stile , and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again , when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister .
" Miss Elliot , I am sure you are tired ," cried Mrs Croft .
"
Yes ; he had done it .
"
" We had better not talk about it , my dear ," replied Mrs Croft , pleasantly ; " for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding , she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together .
"
" Well , and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl , and what were we to wait for besides ?
"
But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger ; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut , nor ran foul of a dung - cart ; and Anne , with some amusement at their style of driving , which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs , found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage .
This was against her ; but on the other hand , he spent so much of his time at Uppercross , that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind , than as going towards him ; and , upon the whole , she believed she must , on this interesting question , be the gainer , almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society , in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell .
The young people were all wild to see Lyme .
He had been engaged to Captain Harville ' s sister , and was now mourning her loss .
To finish the interest of the story , the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed , if possible , augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance , and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely .
Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year ; his taste , and his health , and his fortune , all directing him to a residence inexpensive , and by the sea ; and the grandeur of the country , and the retirement of Lyme in the winter , appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick ' s state of mind .
He is younger than I am ; younger in feeling , if not in fact ; younger as a man .
Mrs Harville , a degree less polished than her husband , seemed , however , to have the same good feelings ; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own , because the friends of Captain Wentworth , or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them .
On quitting the Cobb , they all went in - doors with their new friends , and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many .
Captain Harville was no reader ; but he had contrived excellent accommodations , and fashioned very pretty shelves , for a tolerable collection of well - bound volumes , the property of Captain Benwick .
Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house ; and Louisa , by whom she found herself walking , burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy ; their friendliness , their brotherliness , their openness , their uprightness ; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England ; that they only knew how to live , and they only deserved to be respected and loved .
His looks shewing him not pained , but pleased with this allusion to his situation , she was emboldened to go on ; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind , she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study ; and on being requested to particularize , mentioned such works of our best moralists , such collections of the finest letters , such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering , as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts , and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances .
They went to the sands , to watch the flowing of the tide , which a fine south - easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted .
Do not you agree with me , that it is the best thing he could do , both for himself and Mrs Shirley ?
I really think they ought .
My only doubt is , whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish .
"
Anne was amused by Henrietta ' s manner of being grateful , and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta ' s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family ; she had only time , however , for a general answer , and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross , before all subjects suddenly ceased , on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them .
He seemed about thirty , and though not handsome , had an agreeable person .
It was a gentleman ' s carriage , a curricle , but only coming round from the stable - yard to the front door ; somebody must be going away .
" Ah !
Dare say you heard the carriage , sir , while you were at dinner ; and going on now for Crewkherne , in his way to Bath and London .
the great - coat was hanging over the panel , and hid the arms , so it did ; otherwise , I am sure , I should have observed them , and the livery too ; if the servant had not been in mourning , one should have known him by the livery .
When she could command Mary ' s attention , Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not , for many years , been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable .
"
Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her , as soon as they were all fairly in the street .
There the news must follow him , but who was to tell it ?
Nobody could do it , but that good fellow " ( pointing to Captain Wentworth .
You may think , Miss Elliot , whether he is dear to us !
There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies , and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower , and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight , excepting Louisa ; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth .
In all their walks , he had had to jump her from the stiles ; the sensation was delightful to her .
she is dead !
" Go to him , go to him ," cried Anne , " for heaven ' s sake go to him .
"
" Captain Benwick , would not it be better for Captain Benwick ?
By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb , and many were collected near them , to be useful if wanted , at any rate , to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady , nay , two dead young ladies , for it proved twice as fine as the first report .
That Louisa must remain where she was , however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble , did not admit a doubt .
The Harvilles silenced all scruples ; and , as much as they could , all gratitude .
Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly .
But as to the rest , as to the others , if one stays to assist Mrs Harville , I think it need be only one .
Mrs Charles Musgrove will , of course , wish to get back to her children ; but if Anne will stay , no one so proper , so capable as Anne .
The other two warmly agreed with what he said , and she then appeared .
" You will stay , I am sure ; you will stay and nurse her ;" cried he , turning to her and speaking with a glow , and yet a gentleness , which seemed almost restoring the past .
" It was what she had been thinking of , and wishing to be allowed to do .
She was so wretched and so vehement , complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne ; Anne , who was nothing to Louisa , while she was her sister , and had the best right to stay in Henrietta ' s stead !
He was devoted to Henrietta ; always turning towards her ; and when he spoke at all , always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits .
In a low , cautious voice , he said : --
"
The remainder of Anne ' s time at Uppercross , comprehending only two days , was spent entirely at the Mansion House ; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there , both as an immediate companion , and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future , which , in Mr and Mrs Musgrove ' s distressed state of spirits , would have been difficulties .
He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before ; but the truth was , that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do .
"
Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious .
She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath .
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross ; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears , and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place , which had been taken , and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them , Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove , and all her acquaintance there ; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick , than her own father ' s house in Camden Place , or her own sister ' s intimacy with Mrs Clay .
This was handsome , and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done .
As to the sad catastrophe itself , it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady , sensible women , whose judgements had to work on ascertained events ; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence ; that its effects were most alarming , and that it was frightful to think , how long Miss Musgrove ' s recovery might yet be doubtful , and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter !
But ," ( checking himself ), " you will not think it a good place , for yours were always kept in the butler ' s room .
We told you about the laundry - door , at Uppercross .
You will tell Sir Walter what we have done , and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had .
I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking - glasses from my dressing - room , which was your father ' s .
A very good man , and very much the gentleman I am sure : but I should think , Miss Elliot ," ( looking with serious reflection ), " I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life .
oh Lord !
there was no getting away from one ' s self .
Pray say so , with my compliments .
Charles laughed .
We asked him to come home with us for a day or two : Charles undertook to give him some shooting , and he seemed quite delighted , and , for my part , I thought it was all settled ; when behold !
) " He fancied that if he went with us , he should find you close by : he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross ; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off , his heart failed him , and he had not courage to come .
" Oh !
" Any acquaintance of Anne ' s will always be welcome to me ," was Lady Russell ' s kind answer .
" There we differ , Mary ," said Anne .
He is just Lady Russell ' s sort .
"
" exclaimed Mary , tauntingly .
" You will not like him , I will answer for it .
His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family , has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me .
Henrietta remained with Louisa ; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters .
On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls , cutting up silk and gold paper ; and on the other were tressels and trays , bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies , where riotous boys were holding high revel ; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire , which seemed determined to be heard , in spite of all the noise of the others .
Anne , judging from her own temperament , would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves , which Louisa ' s illness must have so greatly shaken .
Captain Wentworth was gone , for the present , to see his brother in Shropshire .
" I hope I shall remember , in future ," said Lady Russell , as soon as they were reseated in the carriage , " not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays .
"
Anne did not share these feelings .
This was very wonderful if it were true ; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot , already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary , of his being " a man whom she had no wish to see .
" She had a great wish to see him .
She was put down in Camden Place ; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings , in Rivers Street .
" A degree of unexpected cordiality , however , in the welcome she received , did her good .
After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood , which Anne could not pay , they had only a few faint enquiries to make , before the talk must be all their own .
Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place ; their drawing - rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of , and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting - up , or the taste of the furniture .
Everybody was wanting to visit them .
But this was not all which they had to make them happy .
He was astonished , indeed , but his character and general conduct must refute it .
Mr Elliot had called repeatedly , had dined with them once , evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked , for they gave no dinners in general ; delighted , in short , by every proof of cousinly notice , and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place .
Anne listened , but without quite understanding it .
He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance , his air of elegance and fashion , his good shaped face , his sensible eye ; but , at the same time , " must lament his being very much under - hung , a defect which time seemed to have increased ; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse .
" and there was a Mrs Wallis , at present known only to them by description , as she was in daily expectation of her confinement ; but Mr Elliot spoke of her as " a most charming woman , quite worthy of being known in Camden Place ," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted .
He was not allowed to escape , however .
Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown , or a cap , would not be liable to any such misuse , when a knock at the door suspended everything .
" A knock at the door !
It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did .
It was the same , the very same man , with no difference but of dress .
He looked completely astonished , but not more astonished than pleased ; his eyes brightened !
Ten minutes were enough to certify that .
As yet , you have seen nothing of Bath .
He spoke and looked so much in earnest , that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself .
" " No , nothing .
" " Ha !
As for herself , she might always command a home with Lady Russell .
His manners were an immediate recommendation ; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial , that she was at first , as she told Anne , almost ready to exclaim , " Can this be Mr Elliot ?
She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage .
Colonel Wallis said it , and Lady Russell saw it ; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind , nor ( she began pretty soon to suspect ) to prevent his thinking of a second choice .
In that house Elizabeth must be first ; and she was in the habit of such general observance as " Miss Elliot ," that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible .
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times .
They did not always think alike .
Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility , and she must acknowledge herself disappointed .
She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life , and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen ; a wish that they had more pride ; for " our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret ;" " our cousins , the Dalrymples ," sounded in her ears all day long .
" She was very much honoured , and should be happy in their acquaintance .
" The toils of the business were over , the sweets began .
Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable , she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created , but they were nothing .
Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of " a charming woman ," because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody .
Miss Carteret , with still less to say , was so plain and so awkward , that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth .
Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better ; but yet " it was an acquaintance worth having ;" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot , he agreed to their being nothing in themselves , but still maintained that , as a family connexion , as good company , as those who would collect good company around them , they had their value .
Will it make you happy ?
But here you are in Bath , and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot .
Miss Hamilton had left school , had married not long afterwards , was said to have married a man of fortune , and this was all that Anne had known of her , till now that their governess ' s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form .
Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith , and Anne therefore lost no time in going .
She only consulted Lady Russell , who entered thoroughly into her sentiments , and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith ' s lodgings in Westgate Buildings , as Anne chose to be taken .
Twelve years were gone since they had parted , and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined .
Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming , silent , unformed girl of fifteen , to the elegant little woman of seven - and - twenty , with every beauty except bloom , and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle ; and twelve years had transformed the fine - looking , well - grown Miss Hamilton , in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority , into a poor , infirm , helpless widow , receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour ; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away , and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times .
Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour , and a dark bedroom behind , with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance , which there was only one servant in the house to afford , and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath .
It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands .
She always takes the right time for applying .
And it is not merely in its follies , that they are well read ; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting .
I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis , however .
She has plenty of money , and I intend she shall buy all the high - priced things I have in hand now .
Everything that revolts other people , low company , paltry rooms , foul air , disgusting associations are inviting to you .
" But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance ?
Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot .
Anne heard her , and made no violent exclamations ; she only smiled , blushed , and gently shook her head .
" Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man , and in many respects I think highly of him ," said Anne ; " but we should not suit .
"
Lady Russell said not another word , willing to leave the matter to its own operation ; and believing that , could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself !-- she believed , in short , what Anne did not believe .
Various as were the tempers in her father ' s house , he pleased them all .
It was the beginning of February ; and Anne , having been a month in Bath , was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme .
They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally .
" The Crofts have arrived in Bath ?
" A letter from Uppercross Cottage , Sir .
I know what is due to my tenant .
I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable , and wish I could be acquainted with him too ; but I have my usual luck : I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on ; always the last of my family to be noticed .
But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant , we might not be invited .
I can leave them at the Great House very well , for a month or six weeks .
The Admiral does not seem very ill , and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants .
I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little .
Happily for her , they were not many .
Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses , and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in ; but had little curiosity beyond .
"
The Crofts will associate with them .
Perhaps he had quitted the field , had given Louisa up , had ceased to love , had found he did not love her .
Their minds most dissimilar !
Where could have been the attraction ?
She longed to see the Crofts ; but when the meeting took place , it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them .
Knowing their feelings as she did , it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her .
Here I am , you see , staring at a picture .
And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease , and looking about them at the rocks and mountains , as if they were not to be upset the next moment , which they certainly must be .
Can I be of any use ?
" None , I thank you , unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together .
"
She , poor soul , is tied by the leg .
Sophy cannot bear them .
Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did ; but now she could safely suggest the name of " Louisa .
Instead of staying at Lyme , he went off to Plymouth , and then he went off to see Edward .
" Oh !
" Well , well , ladies are the best judges ; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me ; and though very likely it is all our partiality , Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick ' s manners better than his .
" No , no ; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain ; he has too much spirit for that .
" Yes , yes , I understand you .
He does not give the least fling at Benwick ; does not so much as say , ` I wonder at it , I have a reason of my own for wondering at it .
"
" Poor Frederick !
Sophy must write , and beg him to come to Bath .
It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again , for that other Miss Musgrove , I find , is bespoke by her cousin , the young parson .
Her ladyship ' s carriage was a barouche , and did not hold more than four with any comfort .
Time had changed him , or Louisa had changed him .
" Oh !
very little , Nothing that I regard .
He came in with eagerness , appeared to see and think only of her , apologised for his stay , was grieved to have kept her waiting , and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased ; and in another moment they walked off together , her arm under his , a gentle and embarrassed glance , and a " Good morning to you !
It is not the fashion to say so , but I confess I admire her more than her sister .
But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot .
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet .
Would she recollect him ?
No , it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite .
She looked at her however , from time to time , anxiously ; and when the moment approached which must point him out , though not daring to look again ( for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen ), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell ' s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him -- of her being , in short , intently observing him .
"
It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple .
She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her ; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off , with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow .
Mrs Smith gave a most good - humoured acquiescence .
" By all means ," said she ; " only tell me all about it , when you do come .
But it appears -- I should hope it would be a very happy match .
"
She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak .
" Indeed !
I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling .
I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust .
"
Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret , escorted by Mr Elliot and Colonel Wallis , who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant , advanced into the room .
She had learnt , in the last ten minutes , more of his feelings towards Louisa , more of all his feelings than she dared to think of ; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party , to the needful civilities of the moment , with exquisite , though agitated sensations .
She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all , and to pity every one , as being less happy than herself .
The delightful emotions were a little subdued , when on stepping back from the group , to be joined again by Captain Wentworth , she saw that he was gone .
He would look for her , he would find her out before the evening were over , and at present , perhaps , it was as well to be asunder .
Upon Lady Russell ' s appearance soon afterwards , the whole party was collected , and all that remained was to marshal themselves , and proceed into the Concert Room ; and be of all the consequence in their power , draw as many eyes , excite as many whispers , and disturb as many people as they could .
Very , very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in .
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret , and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her , had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach ; and Anne -- but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne ' s felicity , to draw any comparison between it and her sister ' s ; the origin of one all selfish vanity , of the other all generous attachment .
Yes , some share of the tenderness of the past .
She could not contemplate the change as implying less .
I am a very poor Italian scholar .
I see you know nothing of the matter .
" I will not oppose such kind politeness ; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient .
this is too much flattery .
" Indeed !
"
No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery .
" The name of Anne Elliot ," said he , " has long had an interesting sound to me .
Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking .
" A well - looking man ," said Sir Walter , " a very well - looking man .
"
Such was her situation , with a vacant space at hand , when Captain Wentworth was again in sight .
He saw her too ; yet he looked grave , and seemed irresolute , and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her .
Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung .
" He must wish her good night ; he was going ; he should get home as fast as he could .
" said Anne , suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging .
It was the only intelligible motive .
How was the truth to reach him ?
Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith , meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call ; for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object .
In spite of the mischief of his attentions , she owed him gratitude and regard , perhaps compassion .
She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance , of the right which he seemed to have to interest her , by everything in situation , by his own sentiments , by his early prepossession .
" The little Durands were there , I conclude ," said she , " with their mouths open to catch the music , like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed .
" Yes ; I did not see them myself , but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room .
"
"
I need not ask after her .
I see it in your eye .
Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world , the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together .
She could say nothing .
" I have been a good deal acquainted with him ," replied Mrs Smith , gravely , " but it seems worn out now .
It is a great while since we met .
" I was not at all aware of this .
If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me .
"
Mrs Smith looked at her again , looked earnestly , smiled , shook her head , and exclaimed --
Let me plead for my -- present friend I cannot call him , but for my former friend .
I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis ; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis ?
"
" Oh !
Do not forget me when you are married , that ' s all .
And , upon my word , he is nothing to me .
"
I observed no one in particular .
"
She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself , which did not seem bad authority .
"
Mrs Smith said nothing .
Shall I take any message ?
"
" Intimately .
"
We were principally in town , living in very good style .
It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister .
" I know it all , I know it all ," cried Mrs Smith .
I can satisfy you , perhaps , on points which you would little expect ; and as to his marriage , I knew all about it at the time .
My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him .
That was his motive for drawing back , I can assure you .
He told me the whole story .
" This explains it .
Mr Elliot married then completely for money ?
those things are too common .
" You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago .
Here it is ; I would not burn it , because being even then very little satisfied with Mr Elliot , I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy .
Your kindness almost overpowers me .
I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common , but I have lived three - and - twenty years in the world , and have seen none like it .
The name of Walter I can drop , thank God !
and I desire you will never insult me with my second W . again , meaning , for the rest of my life , to be only yours truly ,-- Wm .
"
Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow ; and Mrs Smith , observing the high colour in her face , said --
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour , that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies , that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others , before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over , and say --
" Colonel Wallis !
you are acquainted with him ?
"
It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that ; it takes a bend or two , but nothing of consequence .
I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived .
If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable , stop me .
He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William .
This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done ; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could .
I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot , who would have difficulty in believing it ; but I have never been satisfied .
' And , indeed , to own the truth , I do not think nurse , in her heart , is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter ' s making a second match .
" I am very glad to know all this ," said Anne , after a little thoughtfulness .
My line of conduct will be more direct .
Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous , artificial , worldly man , who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness .
Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction , and Anne had forgotten , in the interest of her own family concerns , how much had been originally implied against him ; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints , and she listened to a recital which , if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith , proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her ; very deficient both in justice and compassion .
Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself , and was most tender of throwing any on her husband ; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living , and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance .
From his wife ' s account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings , easy temper , careless habits , and not strong understanding , much more amiable than his friend , and very unlike him , led by him , and probably despised by him .
She had a great deal to listen to ; all the particulars of past sad scenes , all the minutiae of distress upon distress , which in former conversations had been merely hinted at , were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence .
Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief , and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend ' s usual state of mind .
After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot , Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith ' s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation .
" She had seemed to recommend and praise him !
" My dear ," was Mrs Smith ' s reply , " there was nothing else to be done .
But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect , and he had never loved her .
It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell !
It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived ; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference , which carried them through the greater part of the morning , was , that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith , in which his conduct was involved .
Anne went home to think over all that she had heard .
She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith , but here was a reward indeed springing from it !
But this was a vain idea .
She must talk to Lady Russell , tell her , consult with her , and having done her best , wait the event with as much composure as possible ; and after all , her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell ; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself .
"
" Oh !
"
But , upon my word , I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men .
Anne admired the good acting of the friend , in being able to shew such pleasure as she did , in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object .
It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight of Mr Elliot ; and yet she could assume a most obliging , placid look , and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise .
It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her ; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party , seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort .
It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth ; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them !
She saw Mrs Clay fairly off , therefore , before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street .
If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen ; but last time I called , I observed the blinds were let down immediately .
My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer , but he has no other fault to find .
Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery , both in young and old .
I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now ?
If one happens only to shut the door a little hard , she starts and wriggles like a young dab - chick in the water ; and Benwick sits at her elbow , reading verses , or whispering to her , all day long .
"
" To be sure he is .
These were her internal persuasions : " Old fashioned notions ; country hospitality ; we do not profess to give dinners ; few people in Bath do ; Lady Alicia never does ; did not even ask her own sister ' s family , though they were here a month : and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove ; put her quite out of her way .
I am sure she would rather not come ; she cannot feel easy with us .
It shall be a regular party , small , but most elegant .
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes ; but Anne convinced herself that a day ' s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence , and hastened forward to the White Hart , to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn , with an eagerness of good - will which many associations contributed to form .
They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within , and by themselves , and Anne had the kindest welcome from each .
I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now .
"
The visitors took their leave ; and Charles , having civilly seen them off , and then made a face at them , and abused them for coming , began with --
A ' n ' t I a good boy ?
I know you love a play ; and there is room for us all .
It holds nine .
I have engaged Captain Wentworth .
Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to - morrow night ?
" Phoo !
I only smirked and bowed , and said the word ` happy .
It would be unpardonable to fail .
Consider , my father ' s heir : the future representative of the family .
If I would not go for the sake of your father , I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir .
What is Mr Elliot to me ?
Charles , you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday .
It would be a pity to be divided , and we should be losing Miss Anne , too , if there is a party at her father ' s ; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play , if Miss Anne could not be with us .
"
Captain Wentworth left his seat , and walked to the fire - place ; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards , and taking a station , with less bare - faced design , by Anne .
"
You did not use to like cards ; but time makes many changes .
" I am not yet so much changed ," cried Anne , and stopped , fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction .
"
Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne ' s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour ; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered , she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta , eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out , and calling on her companions to lose no time , lest somebody else should come in .
Their preparations , however , were stopped short .
" It was all said very gracefully , and the cards with which she had provided herself , the " Miss Elliot at home ," were laid on the table , with a courteous , comprehensive smile to all , and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth .
The card was pointedly given , and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared .
" Only think of Elizabeth ' s including everybody !
He was full of ` to - morrow ,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too , ever since I entered the house , and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened , or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head .
Chapter 23
She could not keep her appointment punctually , however ; the weather was unfavourable , and she had grieved over the rain on her friends ' account , and felt it very much on her own , before she was able to attempt the walk .
The party before her were , Mrs Musgrove , talking to Mrs Croft , and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth ; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta , too impatient to wait , had gone out the moment it had cleared , but would be back again soon , and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned .
At any rate , said I , it will be better than a long engagement .
" I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once , and have to struggle with a few difficulties together , than be involved in a long engagement .
"
As she joined him , Captain Harville ' s countenance re - assumed the serious , thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character .
Miss Elliot , do you remember our walking together at Lyme , and grieving for him ?
It was a commission to me !
" No ," replied Anne , in a low , feeling voice .
"
"
"
" No , no , it is not man ' s nature .
" Perhaps I shall .
I will not allow books to prove anything .
God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow - creatures !
No , I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives .
She could not immediately have uttered another sentence ; her heart was too full , her breath too much oppressed .
" You are a good soul ," cried Captain Harville , putting his hand on her arm , quite affectionately .
" There is no quarrelling with you .
Their attention was called towards the others .
"
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick , he had been also addressing her !
Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table ; to their protection she must trust , and sinking into the chair which he had occupied , succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written , her eyes devoured the following words :
Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman , that his love has an earlier death .
Half and hour ' s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her ; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted , with all the restraints of her situation , could do nothing towards tranquillity .
Charles , ring and order a chair .
She must not walk .
Anxious to omit no possible precaution , Anne struggled , and said --
" Oh !
"
But she could not be long ungrateful ; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith ' s , to be of use to her ; and she set off with him , with no feeling but gratitude apparent .
Only to Gay Street , or farther up the town ?
She is rather done for this morning , and must not go so far without help , and I ought to be at that fellow ' s in the Market Place .
He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off ; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment , that I might see it ; and if I do not turn back now , I have no chance .
By his description , a good deal like the second size double - barrel of mine , which you shot with one day round Winthrop .
There could not be an objection .
And there , as they slowly paced the gradual ascent , heedless of every group around them , seeing neither sauntering politicians , bustling housekeepers , flirting girls , nor nursery - maids and children , they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements , and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment , which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest .
She had never been supplanted .
He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa ' s accident , no sooner begun to feel himself alive again , than he had begun to feel himself , though alive , not at liberty .
"
" Here ," said he , " ended the worst of my state ; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness ; I could exert myself ; I could do something .
and to arrive with some degree of hope ?
The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him : the moment of Mr Elliot ' s appearing and tearing her away , and one or two subsequent moments , marked by returning hope or increasing despondency , were dwelt on with energy .
Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared ?
When I yielded , I thought it was to duty , but no duty could be called in aid here .
" I should have thought ," said Anne , " that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this .
Mr Elliot was there ; she avoided , but she could pity him .
" Not yet .
" Good God !
" he cried , " you would !
It is not that I did not think of it , or desire it , as what could alone crown all my other success ; but I was proud , too proud to ask again .
Sir Walter made no objection , and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned .
Captain Wentworth , with five - and - twenty thousand pounds , and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him , was no longer nobody .
There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do , than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong , and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes .
She had something to suffer , perhaps , when they came into contact again , in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority , and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette ; but she had a future to look forward to , of powerful consolation .
Mrs Smith ' s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income , with some improvement of health , and the acquisition of such friends to be often with , for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her ; and while these prime supplies of good remained , she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity .
The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex .
The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters .
His father was rendered easy by such an assurance , and Mr . John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them .
It would be enough to make them completely easy .
Three thousand pounds !
" It was my father ' s last request to me ," replied her husband , " that I should assist his widow and daughters .
"
"
But as he required the promise , I could not do less than give it ; at least I thought so at the time .
"
Consider ," she added , " that when the money is once parted with , it never can return .
" Perhaps , then , it would be better for all parties , if the sum were diminished one half .-- Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes !
"
No one , at least , can think I have not done enough for them : even themselves , they can hardly expect more .
" There is no knowing what THEY may expect ," said the lady , " but we are not to think of their expectations : the question is , what you can afford to do .
"
They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them .
" Fifteen years !
"
An annuity is a very serious business ; it comes over and over every year , and there is no getting rid of it .
My mother was quite sick of it .
" It is certainly an unpleasant thing ," replied Mr . Dashwood , " to have those kind of yearly drains on one ' s income .
"
It will certainly be much the best way .
They will have no carriage , no horses , and hardly any servants ; they will keep no company , and can have no expenses of any kind !
" But , however , ONE thing must be considered .
A valuable legacy indeed !
It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality .
His mother wished to interest him in political concerns , to get him into parliament , or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day .
" I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love .
Her manners were attaching , and soon banished his reserve .
" Oh !
" My love , it will be scarcely a separation .
You will gain a brother , a real , affectionate brother .
"
" Perhaps ," said Marianne , " I may consider it with some surprise .
But it would have broke MY heart , had I loved him , to hear him read with so little sensibility .
Mama , the more I know of the world , the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love .
" Remember , my love , that you are not seventeen .
Marianne was afraid of offending , and said no more on the subject ; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people , was very far from that rapturous delight , which , in her opinion , could alone be called taste .
He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together , while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother .
His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person .
" I do not attempt to deny ," said she , " that I think very highly of him -- that I greatly esteem , that I like him .
Cold - hearted Elinor !
Oh !
Ashamed of being otherwise .
Believe them to be stronger than I have declared ; believe them , in short , to be such as his merit , and the suspicion -- the hope of his affection for me may warrant , without imprudence or folly .
But farther than this you must not believe .
" And you really are not engaged to him !
I shall not lose you so soon , and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity .
A doubt of her regard , supposing him to feel it , need not give him more than inquietude .
It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him .
The letter was from this gentleman himself , and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation .
To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter - in - law ' s guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress .
She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness , and her acceptance of his proposal ; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters , that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent .
So far from hence !
And to what part of it ?
" It is but a cottage ," she continued , " but I hope to see many of my friends in it .
"
Now was the time when her son - in - law ' s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled .
He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping , and of the perpetual demands upon his purse , which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to , that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away .
In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton ' s first letter to Norland , every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs . Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey .
In comparison of Norland , it was poor and small indeed !-- but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away .
With the size and furniture of the house Mrs . Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied ; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable , yet to add and improve was a delight to her ; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments .
He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family , and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home , that , though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility , they could not give offence .
They were , of course , very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend ; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes .
Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty ; her face was handsome , her figure tall and striking , and her address graceful .
In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley , but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill .
They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .
Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .
Continual engagements at home and abroad , however , supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education ; supported the good spirits of Sir John , and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife .
But Sir John ' s satisfaction in society was much more real ; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold , and the noisier they were the better was he pleased .
The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him , and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton .
In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart ; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage , he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman ; for a sportsman , though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise , is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor .
Marianne was vexed at it for her sister ' s sake , and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks , with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common - place raillery as Mrs . Jennings ' s .
There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods ; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive , that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon , and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother - in - law was interesting .
Colonel Brandon alone , of all the party , heard her without being in raptures .
Mrs . Dashwood , who could not think a man five years younger than herself , so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter , ventured to clear Mrs . Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age .
He may live twenty years longer .
But thirty - five has nothing to do with matrimony .
"
"
In my eyes it would be no marriage at all , but that would be nothing .
"
On the contrary , if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject , it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation , when I talked of his coming to Barton .
Does Elinor expect him already ?
"
what can be the meaning of it !
Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning , and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room .
Even now her self - command is invariable .
"
He put down his gun and ran to her assistance .
Had he been even old , ugly , and vulgar , the gratitude and kindness of Mrs . Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child ; but the influence of youth , beauty , and elegance , gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings .
A very decent shot , and there is not a bolder rider in England .
"
Sir John was rather puzzled .
But he is a pleasant , good humoured fellow , and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw .
"
Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself .
It is not an employment to which they have been brought up .
"
"
" That is an expression , Sir John ," said Marianne , warmly , " which I particularly dislike .
Poor Brandon !
He was received by Mrs . Dashwood with more than politeness ; with a kindness which Sir John ' s account of him and her own gratitude prompted ; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense , elegance , mutual affection , and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him .
Marianne was still handsomer .
It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk .
They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual , and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either .
You have already ascertained Mr . Willoughby ' s opinion in almost every matter of importance .
are my ideas so scanty ?
I have been too much at my ease , too happy , too frank .
To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne ' s perfect recovery .
In Mrs . Dashwood ' s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne ' s ; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity , in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister , of saying too much what he thought on every occasion , without attention to persons or circumstances .
" That is exactly what I think of him ," cried Marianne .
If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust .
"
I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects ; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good - breeding and good nature .
"
"
"
Every thing he did , was right .
Her insipidity was invariable , for even her spirits were always the same ; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband , provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her , she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home ;-- and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others , by any share in their conversation , that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys .
I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister , who thought and judged like her , but who from an inforced change -- from a series of unfortunate circumstances "-- Here he stopt suddenly ; appeared to think that he had said too much , and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures , which might not otherwise have entered Elinor ' s head .
Marianne told her , with the greatest delight , that Willoughby had given her a horse , one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire , and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman .
You shall share its use with me .
From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other ; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she , or any of their friends , should be left by tempers so frank , to discover it by accident .
" You have said so ," replied Elinor , " almost every day since they first met on High - church Down ; and they had not known each other a week , I believe , before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck ; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle .
Margaret ' s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister .
This increased the mirth of the company , and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more .
"
" Well , then , he is lately dead , Marianne , for I am sure there was such a man once , and his name begins with an F ."
But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her .
The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful , and Sir John , who was particularly warm in their praise , might be allowed to be a tolerable judge , for he had formed parties to visit them , at least , twice every summer for the last ten years .
Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
" I hope he has had no bad news ," said Lady Middleton .
" No , ma ' am .
Come , come , this won ' t do , Colonel ; so let us hear the truth of it .
" Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married ?
" Oh !
" What can you have to do in town at this time of year ?
What a blow upon them all was this !
" I wish it could be so easily settled .
" If you would but let us know what your business is ," said Mrs . Jennings , " we might see whether it could be put off or not .
Brandon is one of them .
"
But , however , I hope you will think better of it .
" Well , then , when will you come back again ?
" I hope we shall see you at Barton ," added her ladyship , " as soon as you can conveniently leave town ; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return .
" Ay , so do , Sir John ," cried Mrs . Jennings , " and then perhaps you may find out what his business is .
Only to Honiton .
"
" I assure you it is not in my power .
"
" asked Marianne .
I am sure you must have heard of her before .
She is a relation of the Colonel ' s , my dear ; a very near relation .
" Yes , Marianne , but I would not go while Mrs . Smith was there , and with no other companion than Mr .
" On the contrary , nothing can be a stronger proof of it , Elinor ; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did , I should have been sensible of it at the time , for we always know when we are acting wrong , and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure .
" But , my dear Marianne , as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks , do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct ?
Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others , she would have described every room in the house with equal delight .
She wondered , with little intermission what could be the reason of it ; was sure there must be some bad news , and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him , with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all .
I do think he must have been sent for about money matters , for what else can it be ?
Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and , by the bye , I dare say it is , because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her .
Well , I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart , and a good wife into the bargain .
No .
"
" There certainly are circumstances ," said Willoughby , " which might greatly endear it to me ; but this place will always have one claim of my affection , which no other can possibly share .
How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs . Smith , when I next came into the country , would be that Barton cottage was taken : and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event , which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it , can account for .
" speaking to her in a lowered voice .
You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement !
"
Tell me that not only your house will remain the same , but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling ; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me .
"
On their return from the park they found Willoughby ' s curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage , and Mrs . Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just .
" cried Mrs . Dashwood as she entered --" is she ill ?
" I hope not ," he replied , trying to look cheerful ; and with a forced smile presently added , " It is I who may rather expect to be ill -- for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment !
"
"
"
" My engagements at present ," replied Willoughby , confusedly , " are of such a nature -- that -- I dare not flatter myself "--
I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy .
She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust .
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister ;-- the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for , though when she considered what Marianne ' s love for him was , a quarrel seemed almost impossible .
And last night he was with us so happy , so cheerful , so affectionate ?
YOU must have seen the difference as well as I .
What can it be ?
Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here ?
I have thought it all over I assure you , and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you .
I am persuaded that Mrs . Smith suspects his regard for Marianne , disapproves of it , ( perhaps because she has other views for him ,) and on that account is eager to get him away ;-- and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him .
Oh , Elinor , how incomprehensible are your feelings !
And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence , or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment ?
Are no probabilities to be accepted , merely because they are not certainties ?
Secrecy may be advisable ; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him .
" Concealing it from us !
"
" I want no proof of their affection ," said Elinor ; " but of their engagement I do .
"
"
" A mighty concession indeed !
Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt ; no secrecy has been attempted ; all has been uniformly open and unreserved .
But why ?
I was startled , I confess , by the alteration in his manners this morning ;-- he did not speak like himself , and did not return your kindness with any cordiality .
"
Elinor could not deny the truth of this , and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence .
" I would not ask such a question for the world .
Supposing it possible that they are not engaged , what distress would not such an enquiry inflict !
I know Marianne ' s heart : I know that she dearly loves me , and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known , when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible .
It was several days before Willoughby ' s name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family ; Sir John and Mrs . Jennings , indeed , were not so nice ; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour ;-- but one evening , Mrs . Dashwood , accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare , exclaimed ,
"
Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles .
If her sisters intended to walk on the downs , she directly stole away towards the lanes ; if they talked of the valley , she was as speedy in climbing the hills , and could never be found when the others set off .
In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman ; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed ,
"
"
" Have you been lately in Sussex ?
" said Elinor .
The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves .
" Marianne ," cried her sister , " how can you say so ?
"
" No ," said Marianne , in a low voice , " nor how many painful moments .
His coldness and reserve mortified her severely ; she was vexed and half angry ; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present , she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure , and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection .
They had begun to fail him before he entered the house , and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs . Dashwood .
He was not in spirits , however ; he praised their house , admired its prospect , was attentive , and kind ; but still he was not in spirits .
I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life !
" But how is your fame to be established ?
I have no wish to be distinguished ; and have every reason to hope I never shall .
" Strange that it would !
" What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness ?
" Grandeur has but little ," said Elinor , " but wealth has much to do with it .
"
" said Marianne , " money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it .
" Perhaps ," said Elinor , smiling , " we may come to the same point .
Your ideas are only more noble than mine .
Come , what is your competence ?
" I wish ," said Margaret , striking out a novel thought , " that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece !
" Oh that they would !
" I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself ," said Mrs . Dashwood , " if my children were all to be rich my help .
" No , Edward , I should have something else to do with it .
" She is only grown a little more grave than she was .
"
You are not very gay yourself .
" replied he , with a sigh .
"
" No , Marianne , never .
" My judgment ," he returned , " is all on your side of the question ; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister ' s .
" Yes , very .
Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast , and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself ?
"
Edward made no answer .
Elinor saw , with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend .
His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction , while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect .
He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast - room the next morning before the others were down ; and Marianne , who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could , soon left them to themselves .
" I suspect ," said Elinor , " that to avoid one kind of affectation , Edward here falls into another .
He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own .
Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was .
But , in return , your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess .
She was sitting by Edward , and in taking his tea from Mrs . Dashwood , his hand passed so directly before her , as to make a ring , with a plait of hair in the centre , very conspicuous on one of his fingers .
"
But , as it was , she only learned , from some very significant looks , how far their penetration , founded on Margaret ' s instructions , extended .
" Who !
why yourselves , and the Careys , and Whitakers to be sure .-- What !
" Shall I tell you .
"
How can you ?-- But the time will come I hope ... I am sure you will like him .
Edward remained a week at the cottage ; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs . Dashwood to stay longer ; but , as if he were bent only on self - mortification , he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height .
Never had any week passed so quickly -- he could hardly believe it to be gone .
He said so repeatedly ; other things he said too , which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions .
Disappointed , however , and vexed as she was , and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself , she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications , which had been rather more painfully extorted from her , for Willoughby ' s service , by her mother .
She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease , this opposition was to yield ,-- when Mrs . Ferrars would be reformed , and her son be at liberty to be happy .
Some inconvenience to your friends , indeed , might result from it -- you would not be able to give them so much of your time .
"
" I do assure you ," he replied , " that I have long thought on this point , as you think now .
But that was not smart enough for my family .
I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since .
You want nothing but patience -- or give it a more fascinating name , call it hope .
How much may not a few months do ?
"
"
It is only the Palmers .
" She is walking , I believe .
"
She came hallooing to the window , " How do you do , my dear ?
What !
I thought I heard a carriage last night , while we were drinking our tea , but it never entered my head that it could be them .
I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again ; so I said to Sir John , I do think I hear a carriage ; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again "--
Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty , with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife , but of less willingness to please or be pleased .
Only think , Mamma , how it is improved since I was here last !
Mr . Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper .
" She expects to be confined in February ," continued Mrs . Jennings .
He immediately went into the passage , opened the front door , and ushered her in himself .
" Oh !
dear , how beautiful these are !
" They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now ," said Elinor , " by these frequent invitations , than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago .
"
Marianne looked very grave and said nothing .
" Is it very ugly ?
So there I have the whip hand of you .
"
I am sure you will like it of all things .
it is very fatiguing to him !
Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation .
" He cannot bear writing , you know ," she continued -- " he says it is quite shocking .
"
She began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr . Willoughby at Cleveland , and whether they were intimately acquainted with him .
"
" My dear Mrs .
Surely you must be mistaken .
To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it , even if it were true , is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do .
Is it true , pray ?
'"
"
"
It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage !
I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna .
However , I am much happier as I am .
Sir John ' s confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise , and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles ' arrival , and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world .
It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself .
The children are all hanging about her already , as if she was an old acquaintance .
She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted .
" said she , on his taking Miss Steeles ' s pocket handkerchief , and throwing it out of window --" He is full of monkey tricks .
" And here is my sweet little Annamaria ," she added , tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old , who had not made a noise for the last two minutes ; " And she is always so gentle and quiet -- Never was there such a quiet little thing !
"
Here too , Miss Dashwood ' s commendation , being only simple and just , came in without any eclat .
" I confess ," replied Elinor , " that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence .
" I think every one MUST admire it ," replied Elinor , " who ever saw the place ; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do .
I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world ; for my part , I think they are a vast addition always .
For my part , I think they are vastly agreeable , provided they dress smart and behave civil .
Now there ' s Mr . Rose at Exeter , a prodigious smart young man , quite a beau , clerk to Mr . Simpson , you know , and yet if you do but meet him of a morning , he is not fit to be seen .-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau , Miss Dashwood , before he married , as he was so rich ?
"
Anne ," cried her sister , " you can talk of nothing but beaux ;-- you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else .
And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon ,-- but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already .
Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward , than he had been with respect to Marianne ; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two , as being somewhat newer and more conjectural ; and since Edward ' s visit , they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks , as to excite general attention .
" repeated Miss Steele ; " Mr . Ferrars is the happy man , is he ?
The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward , increased her curiosity ; for it struck her as being rather ill - natured , and suggested the suspicion of that lady ' s knowing , or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage .-- But her curiosity was unavailing , for no farther notice was taken of Mr . Ferrars ' s name by Miss Steele when alluded to , or even openly mentioned by Sir John .
Marianne , who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence , vulgarity , inferiority of parts , or even difference of taste from herself , was at this time particularly ill - disposed , from the state of her spirits , to be pleased with the Miss Steeles , or to encourage their advances ; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them , which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side , Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both , but especially of Lucy , who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation , or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments .
Ferrars ?
Elinor DID think the question a very odd one , and her countenance expressed it , as she answered that she had never seen Mrs . Ferrars .
" I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious .
" Good heavens !
What felt Elinor at that moment ?
" We have been engaged these four years .
" I think I have ," replied Elinor , with an exertion of spirits , which increased with her increase of emotion .
Ferrars .
"
"
"
" You are quite in the right ," replied Elinor calmly .
I shall have no fortune , and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman .
"
Your secret is safe with me ; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication .
As she said this , she looked earnestly at Lucy , hoping to discover something in her countenance ; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying ; but Lucy ' s countenance suffered no change .
She does not know how to hold her tongue , as you must perceive , and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t ' other day , when Edward ' s name was mentioned by Sir John , lest she should out with it all .
I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke .
" But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it .-- I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable , as I know the very mention of such a thing would do .
"
" To be sure ," continued Lucy , after a few minutes silence on both sides , " his mother must provide for him sometime or other ; but poor Edward is so cast down by it !
Did you not think him dreadful low - spirited when he was at Barton ?
" She remembered too , her own surprise at the time , at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends , at his total silence with respect even to their names .
"
I heard from him just before I left Exeter ;" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor .
Yes , I have one other comfort in his picture , but poor Edward has not even THAT .
I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last , and that was some comfort to him , he said , but not equal to a picture .
[ At this point in the first and second editions , Volume 1 ends .
These difficulties , indeed , with a heart so alienated from Lucy , might not press very hard upon his patience ; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness , could be felt as a relief !
Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one .
She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again , she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward , whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him , and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy , by her readiness to enter on the matter again , and her calmness in conversing on it , that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend , which she very much feared her involuntary agitation , in their morning discourse , must have left at least doubtful .
" I am glad ," said Lady Middleton to Lucy , " you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria ' s basket this evening ; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight .
I shall go to the piano - forte ; I have not touched it since it was tuned .
" And without farther ceremony , she turned away and walked to the instrument .
I should like the work exceedingly , if she would allow me a share in it .
" Oh !
"
In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began .
How could you suppose so ?
Could you have a motive for the trust , that was not honourable and flattering to me ?
" And yet I do assure you ," replied Lucy , her little sharp eyes full of meaning , " there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable .
"
Mr . Ferrars , I believe , is entirely dependent on his mother .
"
If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed , as between many people , and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years ' engagement , your situation would have been pitiable , indeed .
" All this ," thought Elinor , " is very pretty ; but it can impose upon neither of us .
But Mrs . Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman , and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it , would very likely secure every thing to Robert , and the idea of that , for Edward ' s sake , frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures .
"
" And for your own sake too , or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason .
"
But you will not give me your advice , Miss Dashwood ?
" No ," answered Elinor , with a smile , which concealed very agitated feelings , " on such a subject I certainly will not .
You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you , unless it were on the side of your wishes .
"
" Indeed you wrong me ," replied Lucy , with great solemnity ; " I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours ; and I do really believe , that if you was to say to me , ' I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars , it will be more for the happiness of both of you ,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately .
It raises my influence much too high ; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person .
" How unlucky that is !
He will be there in February , otherwise London would have no charms for me ; I have not spirits for it .
"
Though Mrs . Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends , she was not without a settled habitation of her own .
I am sure your mother will not object to it ; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you ; and if I don ' t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you , it shall not be my fault .
"
That Marianne , fastidious as she was , thoroughly acquainted with Mrs . Jennings ' manners , and invariably disgusted by them , should overlook every inconvenience of that kind , should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings , in her pursuit of one object , was such a proof , so strong , so full , of the importance of that object to her , as Elinor , in spite of all that had passed , was not prepared to witness .
" I am delighted with the plan ," she cried , " it is exactly what I could wish .
When you and the Middletons are gone , we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music !
You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again !
I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too , which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one .
"
" My objection is this ; though I think very well of Mrs . Jennings ' s heart , she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure , or whose protection will give us consequence .
The Middletons were to follow in about a week .
The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park , and were to quit it only with the rest of the family .
The house was handsome , and handsomely fitted up , and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment .
Her spirits still continued very high ; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister , and this agitation increased as the evening drew on .
Every thing was silent ; this could not be borne many seconds ; she opened the door , advanced a few steps towards the stairs , and after listening half a minute , returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce ; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming , " Oh , Elinor , it is Willoughby , indeed it is !
In this calm kind of way , with very little interest on either side , they continued to talk , both of them out of spirits , and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere .
Colonel ," said she , with her usual noisy cheerfulness , " I am monstrous glad to see you -- sorry I could not come before -- beg your pardon , but I have been forced to look about me a little , and settle my matters ; for it is a long while since I have been at home , and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time ; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with -- Lord , I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner !
" Mrs . Palmer appeared quite well , and I am commissioned to tell you , that you will certainly see her to - morrow .
"
poor man !
So surprised at their coming to town , though it was what she had rather expected all along ; so angry at their accepting her mother ' s invitation after having declined her own , though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come !
Restless and dissatisfied every where , her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase , however it might equally concern them both : she received no pleasure from anything ; was only impatient to be at home again , and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs . Palmer , whose eye was caught by every thing pretty , expensive , or new ; who was wild to buy all , could determine on none , and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision .
"
Marianne was of no use on these occasions , as she would never learn the game ; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal , the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor , for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment .
"
" It is charming weather for THEM indeed ," she continued , as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance .
"
The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs . Jennings ' s style of living , and set of acquaintance , than with her behaviour to themselves , which was invariably kind .
This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation .
" It is indeed for Mrs . Jennings ; how provoking !
"
Elinor found , when the evening was over , that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode , for although scarcely settled in town , Sir John had contrived to collect around him , nearly twenty young people , and to amuse them with a ball .
" I thought you were both in Devonshire ," said he .
" Did you ?
" cried Marianne .
Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother , relating all that had passed , her suspicions of Willoughby ' s inconstancy , urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him .
He tried to smile as he replied , " your sister ' s engagement to Mr . Willoughby is very generally known .
"
Is every thing finally settled ?
But I have no right , and I could have no chance of succeeding .
They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party , from which Mrs . Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter ; and for this party , Marianne , wholly dispirited , careless of her appearance , and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid , prepared , without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure .
She sat by the drawing - room fire after tea , till the moment of Lady Middleton ' s arrival , without once stirring from her seat , or altering her attitude , lost in her own thoughts , and insensible of her sister ' s presence ; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door , she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected .
"
Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address , and was unable to say a word .
Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil .
My card was not lost , I hope .
" How can that be done ?
She was soon undressed and in bed , and as she seemed desirous of being alone , her sister then left her , and while she waited the return of Mrs . Jennings , had leisure enough for thinking over the past .
It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter , and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her , at intervals , to withhold her pen , were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby .
That good lady , however , saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby , which appeared to her a very good joke , and which she treated accordingly , by hoping , with a laugh , that she would find it to her liking .
Of Elinor ' s distress , she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug , to see any thing at all ; and calmly continuing her talk , as soon as Marianne disappeared , she said ,
I hope , from the bottom of my heart , he won ' t keep her waiting much longer , for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn .
"
how can you talk so ?
I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation ; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you , I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional .
My esteem for your whole family is very sincere ; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt , or meant to express , I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem .
In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter , on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it , and probably , on the very different mind of a very different person , who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed , Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister , forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread , and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room , that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door , she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early , she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs . Jennings ' s chariot , which she knew had not been ordered till one .
Think of your mother ; think of her misery while YOU suffer : for her sake you must exert yourself .
"
Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation ?
Elinor said no more , and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before , directly ran over the contents of all .
Berkeley Street , January .
Her second note , which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons ', was in these words :--
Pray call again as soon as possible , and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain .
" M . D .
"
"
"
" By all the world , rather than by his own heart .
"
I care not who knows that I am wretched .
" Elinor , I must go home .
"
Well , said I , all I can say is , that if this be true , he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill , and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out .
Well , poor thing !
I won ' t disturb her any longer , for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with .
She then went away , walking on tiptoe out of the room , as if she supposed her young friend ' s affliction could be increased by noise .
Had she tried to speak , or had she been conscious of half Mrs . Jennings ' s well - meant but ill - judged attentions to her , this calmness could not have been maintained ; but not a syllable escaped her lips ; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her .
She treated her therefore , with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays .
Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day .
" cried Mrs . Jennings , as soon as she was gone , " how it grieves me to see her !
nothing seems to do her any good .
they care no more about such things !--"
Is she said to be amiable ?
"--
But now she is of age and may choose for herself ; and a pretty choice she has made !-- What now ," after pausing a moment --" your poor sister is gone to her own room , I suppose , to moan by herself .
What shall we play at ?
no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two , for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that .
I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter , and you know young people like to be laughed at about them .
" In this affair it can only do harm ; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind , for it has been attended by circumstances which , for the sake of every one concerned in it , make it unfit to become the public conversation .
" Ay , if we can do THAT , Ma ' am ," said Elinor , " we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon .
" I will leave you ," said Elinor , " if you will go to bed .
Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout , he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world .
"
"
" In a stationer ' s shop in Pall Mall , where I had business .
The name of Willoughby , John Willoughby , frequently repeated , first caught my attention ; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey -- it was no longer to be a secret -- it would take place even within a few weeks , with many particulars of preparations and other matters .
One thing , especially , I remember , because it served to identify the man still more :-- as soon as the ceremony was over , they were to go to Combe Magna , his seat in Somersetshire .
My astonishment !-- but it would be impossible to describe what I felt .
In that , if in any thing , we may find an explanation .
Till yesterday , I believe , she never doubted his regard ; and even now , perhaps -- but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her .
From a night of more sleep than she had expected , Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes .
Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others , by the irritable refinement of her own mind , and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility , and the graces of a polished manner .
" Now , my dear , I bring you something that I am sure will do you good .
The cruelty of Mrs . Jennings no language , within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence , could have expressed ; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence -- a reproach , however , so entirely lost on its object , that after many expressions of pity , she withdrew , still referring her to the letter of comfort .
Elinor , with a very heavy heart , aware of the pain she was going to communicate , and perceiving , by Marianne ' s letter , how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it , then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed , and entreat her directions for the future ; while Marianne , who came into the drawing - room on Mrs . Jennings ' s going away , remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote , watching the advancement of her pen , grieving over her for the hardship of such a task , and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother .
"
" It is Colonel Brandon !
" I will not trust to THAT ," retreating to her own room .
" You shall ; and , to be brief , when I quitted Barton last October ,-- but this will give you no idea -- I must go farther back .
Our ages were nearly the same , and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends .
Her fortune was large , and our family estate much encumbered .
My brother did not deserve her ; he did not even love her .
But can we wonder that , with such a husband to provoke inconstancy , and without a friend to advise or restrain her ( for my father lived only a few months after their marriage , and I was with my regiment in the East Indies ) she should fall ?
Elinor , affected by his relation , and still more by his distress , could not speak .
Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune , nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance , and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person .
hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me , to be the remains of the lovely , blooming , healthful girl , on whom I had once doted .
Life could do nothing for her , beyond giving time for a better preparation for death ; and that was given .
" Your sister , I hope , cannot be offended ," said he , " by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation .
I had allowed her , ( imprudently , as it has since turned out ,) at her earnest desire , to go to Bath with one of her young friends , who was attending her father there for his health .
In short , I could learn nothing but that she was gone ; all the rest , for eight long months , was left to conjecture .
" Good heavens !
He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address !
" exclaimed Elinor .
My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then ; but now you will comprehend it .
They proceed from no misconduct , and can bring no disgrace .
Eliza had confessed to me , though most reluctantly , the name of her lover ; and when he returned to town , which was within a fortnight after myself , we met by appointment , he to defend , I to punish his conduct .
"
But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind , though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it , in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called , in her speaking to him , even voluntarily speaking , with a kind of compassionate respect , and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before , she did not see her less wretched .
Her mind did become settled , but it was settled in a gloomy dejection .
She felt the loss of Willoughby ' s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart ; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams , the misery of that poor girl , and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself , preyed altogether so much on her spirits , that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor ; and , brooding over her sorrows in silence , gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them .
She recommended it to her daughters , therefore , by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs . Jennings ; the length of which , though never exactly fixed , had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks .
It was an unaccountable business .
" She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately , and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all .
Their presence always gave her pain , and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town .
" Oh , oh !
" cried Mrs . Jennings ; " very pretty , indeed !
and the Doctor is a single man , I warrant you .
here comes your beau , Nancy ,' my cousin said t ' other day , when she saw him crossing the street to the house .
"
" Why , their visit is but just begun !
My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you ; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head - aches , which make her unfit for company or conversation .
"
" I wished very much to call upon you yesterday ," said he , " but it was impossible , for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange ; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs . Ferrars .
Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother ; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him , by the arrival of Mrs . Jennings ' s servant , who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door .
Mr . Dashwood attended them down stairs , was introduced to Mrs . Jennings at the door of her carriage , and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day , took leave .
His visit was duly paid .
" Two thousand a - year ;" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity , he added , " Elinor , I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much , for your sake .
" You are mistaken , Elinor ; you are very much mistaken .
Mrs . Ferrars , with the utmost liberality , will come forward , and settle on him a thousand a year , if the match takes place .
A very desirable connection on both sides , and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time .
To give you another instance of her liberality :-- The other day , as soon as we came to town , aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now , she put bank - notes into Fanny ' s hands to the amount of two hundred pounds .
The enclosure of Norland Common , now carrying on , is a most serious drain .
" Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland .
"
But , my dear Elinor , what is the matter with Marianne ?-- she looks very unwell , has lost her colour , and is grown quite thin .
I know very little of Dorsetshire ; but , my dear Elinor , I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it ; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors .
He dared not come to Bartlett ' s Buildings for fear of detection , and though their mutual impatience to meet , was not to be told , they could do nothing at present but write .
Twice was his card found on the table , when they returned from their morning ' s engagements .
" Pity me , dear Miss Dashwood !
Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton ' s mother , rather than her own , whom they were about to behold ; but instead of doing that , she assured her , and with great sincerity , that she did pity her -- to the utter amazement of Lucy , who , though really uncomfortable herself , hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor .
Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour .-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs . Ferrars ' power to distress her by it now ;-- and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her .
When the ladies withdrew to the drawing - room after dinner , this poverty was particularly evident , for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety -- the variety of politics , inclosing land , and breaking horses -- but then it was all over ; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in , which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood , and Lady Middleton ' s second son William , who were nearly of the same age .
Had both the children been there , the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once ; but as Harry only was present , it was all conjectural assertion on both sides ; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion , and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked .
The parties stood thus :
Lucy , who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other , thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age , and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them ; and Miss Steele , with yet greater address gave it , as fast as she could , in favour of each .
Before her removing from Norland , Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister - in - law , which being now just mounted and brought home , ornamented her present drawing room ; and these screens , catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room , were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration .
" But then again , the dread of having been too civil , too encouraging herself , probably came over her , for she presently added ,
" Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton ' s style of painting , Ma ' am ?-- She DOES paint most delightfully !-- How beautifully her last landscape is done !
Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne ' s warmth than she had been by what produced it ; but Colonel Brandon ' s eyes , as they were fixed on Marianne , declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it , the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point .
poor dear ," immediately gave her her salts ; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress , that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele , and gave her , in a whisper , a brief account of the whole shocking affair .
CHAPTER 35
They all looked exceedingly foolish ; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again , as to advance farther into it .
The very circumstance , in its unpleasantest form , which they would each have been most anxious to avoid , had fallen on them .-- They were not only all three together , but were together without the relief of any other person .
Lucy , with a demure and settled air , seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others , and would not say a word ; and almost every thing that WAS said , proceeded from Elinor , who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother ' s health , their coming to town , & c . which Edward ought to have inquired about , but never did .
When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne ' s joy hurried her into the drawing - room immediately .
" she cried , " this is a moment of great happiness !-- This would almost make amends for every thing ?
"
Edward was the first to speak , and it was to notice Marianne ' s altered looks , and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her .
"
This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy , nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy , who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression .
"
" But why were you not there , Edward ?-- Why did you not come ?
are you never to hear yourself praised !-- Then you must be no friend of mine ; for those who will accept of my love and esteem , must submit to my open commendation .
"
And drawing him a little aside , she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer .
For their own comfort they would much rather have remained , at least all the morning , in Mrs . Jennings ' s house ; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody .
One thing DID disturb her ; and of that she made her daily complaint .
Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity ; she saw every thing , and asked every thing ; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne ' s dress ; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself , and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted , how much her washing cost per week , and how much she had every year to spend upon herself .
As Elinor was neither musical , nor affecting to be so , she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte , whenever it suited her , and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp , and violoncello , would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room .
He addressed her with easy civility , and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done , that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy .
If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself , instead of sending him to Mr . Pratt ' s , all this would have been prevented .
" You reside in Devonshire , I think ,"-- was his next observation , " in a cottage near Dawlish .
He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house .
I was to decide on the best of them .
I was last month at my friend Elliott ' s , near Dartford .
Lady Elliott wished to give a dance .
' said she ; ' my dear Ferrars , do tell me how it is to be managed .
"
Elinor agreed to it all , for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition .
The consideration of Mrs . Dennison ' s mistake , in supposing his sisters their guests , had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such , while Mrs . Jenning ' s engagements kept her from home .
Fanny was startled at the proposal .
But they are Lady Middleton ' s visitors .
How can I ask them away from her ?
Fanny paused a moment , and then , with fresh vigor , said ,
I am sure you will like them ; indeed , you DO like them , you know , very much already , and so does my mother ; and they are such favourites with Harry !
"
This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy .
Mrs . Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life , as she was with them ; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant ; called Lucy by her Christian name ; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them .
" No , ma ' am .
" That is exactly what I said , my dear .
' Lord !
So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride .
And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away , and they were just stepping in as he came off ; poor Lucy in such a condition , he says , she could hardly walk ; and Nancy , she was almost as bad .
" How long has this been known to you , Elinor ?
" Four months !
" By feeling that I was doing my duty .-- My promise to Lucy , obliged me to be secret .
Marianne seemed much struck .
" I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother ," added Elinor ; " and once or twice I have attempted it ;-- but without betraying my trust , I never could have convinced you .
"
But I did not love only him ;-- and while the comfort of others was dear to me , I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt .
The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter , the consolation that I have been willing to admit , have been the effect of constant and painful exertion ;-- they did not spring up of themselves ;-- they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first .-- No , Marianne .-- THEN , if I had not been bound to silence , perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely -- not even what I owed to my dearest friends -- from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy .
" Oh !
In such a frame of mind as she was now in , Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required ; and at her request , Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness ;-- to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her ;-- and even to see Edward himself , if chance should bring them together , without any diminution of her usual cordiality .-- These were great concessions ;-- but where Marianne felt that she had injured , no reparation could be too much for her to make .
"-- She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another , and when Mrs . Jennings talked of Edward ' s affection , it cost her only a spasm in her throat .-- Such advances towards heroism in her sister , made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself .
" You have heard , I suppose ," said he with great solemnity , as soon as he was seated , " of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday .
Mrs . Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome .
But I would not alarm you too much .
And now to be so rewarded !
If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere , it could not be in THAT quarter .
Your exclamation is very natural .
"
" What , indeed , ma ' am !
We must all feel for him ; and the more so , because it is totally out of our power to assist him .
" Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man ," continued John , " than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own ?
Nothing new was heard by them , for a day or two afterwards , of affairs in Harley Street , or Bartlett ' s Buildings .
Mrs . Jennings and Elinor were of the number ; but Marianne , who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town , and had a constant dread of meeting them , chose rather to stay at home , than venture into so public a place .
"
"
She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet , nor do any thing else for me again , so long as she lived ; but now she is quite come to , and we are as good friends as ever .
I do not care if it IS the Doctor ' s favourite colour .
I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them .
" I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them ," said Elinor ; " you were all in the same room together , were not you ?
La !
"
" How !
" cried Elinor ; " have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door ?
there is nothing in THAT .
I only stood at the door , and heard what I could .
Elinor tried to talk of something else ; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes , from what was uppermost in her mind .
' I shall say directly , ' I wonder how you could think of such a thing ?
I write to the Doctor , indeed !
" Well ," said Elinor , " it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst .
" Oh , la !
I suppose Lady Middleton won ' t ask us any more this bout .
Remember me kindly to her .
"
Such was her parting concern ; for after this , she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs . Jennings , before her company was claimed by Mrs . Richardson ; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time , though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind .
The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two - penny post from Lucy herself .
I wish I COULD get him a living , with all my heart .-- She calls me dear Mrs . Jennings , you see .
CHAPTER 39
The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town , and Marianne ' s impatience to be gone increased every day .
This would not , in itself , have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood ;-- but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr . Palmer himself , as , joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy , induced her to accept it with pleasure .
When she told Marianne what she had done , however , her first reply was not very auspicious .
From Cleveland , which was within a few miles of Bristol , the distance to Barton was not beyond one day , though a long day ' s journey ; and their mother ' s servant might easily come there to attend them down ; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland , they might now be at home in little more than three weeks ' time .
As Marianne ' s affection for her mother was sincere , it must triumph with little difficulty , over the imaginary evils she had started .
She wondered , indeed , at his thinking it necessary to do so ; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette .
" I am afraid it cannot take place very soon .
"
What had really passed between them was to this effect .
But at the same time , she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself .
She could undertake therefore to inform him of it , in the course of the day .
I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this ; and my interest is hardly more extensive .
CHAPTER 40
" Thank you , ma ' am ," said Elinor .
Few people who have so compassionate a heart !
"
why don ' t he repair it ?-- who should do it but himself ?
"
very well ," said Mrs . Jennings rather disappointed .
" No , ma ' am , not even Lucy if you please .
" Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man , that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr . Ferrars than himself .
"
" I have just been thinking of Betty ' s sister , my dear .
But whether she would do for a lady ' s maid , I am sure I can ' t tell .
"
" You are very much mistaken .
As a friend of mine , of my family , he may , perhaps -- indeed I know he HAS , still greater pleasure in bestowing it ; but , upon my word , you owe nothing to my solicitation .
Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action , but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward , that she acknowledged it with hesitation ; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it .
" Indeed ," replied Elinor , " I believe that you will find him , on farther acquaintance , all that you have heard him to be , and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house ,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this .
Elinor told him the number of the house .
Elinor did not offer to detain him ; and they parted , with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him ; on HIS , with rather an attempt to return the same good will , than the power of expressing it .
" Really ," said Elinor , " I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination .
Lord bless me !-- I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience !-- And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr . Ferrars , I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him .
" Lord bless you , my dear !-- Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr .
" But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living ' s being enough to allow them to marry .
Edward , having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon , proceeded with his happiness to Lucy ; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett ' s Buildings , that she was able to assure Mrs . Jennings , who called on her again the next day with her congratulations , that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life .
So far was she , at the same time , from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her , that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth , was ready to own all their obligation to her , and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood ' s part , either present or future , would ever surprise her , for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued .
The consequence was , that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit , for which no one could really have less inclination , and to run the risk of a tete - a - tete with a woman , whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike .
This living of Colonel Brandon ' s -- can it be true ?-- has he really given it to Edward ?-- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it .
"
" About two hundred a year .
" A very simple one -- to be of use to Mr .
"
" We think NOW ,"-- said Mr . Dashwood , after a short pause , " of ROBERT ' S marrying Miss Morton .
" I only mean that I suppose , from your manner of speaking , it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert .
" Of ONE thing , my dear sister ," kindly taking her hand , and speaking in an awful whisper ,--" I may assure you ;-- and I WILL do it , because I know it must gratify you .
I have good reason to think -- indeed I have it from the best authority , or I should not repeat it , for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it -- but I have it from the very best authority -- not that I ever precisely heard Mrs . Ferrars say it herself -- but her daughter DID , and I have it from her -- That in short , whatever objections there might be against a certain -- a certain connection -- you understand me -- it would have been far preferable to her , it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does .
But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you .
There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well -- quite as well , or better , perhaps , all things considered .
"
Elinor , while she waited in silence and immovable gravity , the conclusion of such folly , could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited .
" Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her .
' My dear fellow ,' I should have said , ' consider what you are doing .
"
For the convenience of Charlotte and her child , they were to be more than two days on their journey , and Mr . Palmer , travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon , was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival .
Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained , busy in new engagements , and new schemes , in which SHE could have no share , without shedding many tears .
She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on , she left no creature behind , from whom it would give her a moment ' s regret to be divided for ever , she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy ' s friendship , she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage , and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne ' s peace of mind , and confirming her own .
The second day brought them into the cherished , or the prohibited , county of Somerset , for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne ' s imagination ; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland .
For the rest of his character and habits , they were marked , as far as Elinor could perceive , with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life .
Of Edward , or at least of some of his concerns , she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon , who had been into Dorsetshire lately ; and who , treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr . Ferrars , and the kind of confidant of himself , talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford , described its deficiencies , and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them .-- His behaviour to her in this , as well as in every other particular , his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days , his readiness to converse with her , and his deference for her opinion , might very well justify Mrs . Jennings ' s persuasion of his attachment , and would have been enough , perhaps , had not Elinor still , as from the first , believed Marianne his real favourite , to make her suspect it herself .
Prescriptions poured in from all quarters , and as usual , were all declined .
But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began .-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again , growing more heavy , restless , and uncomfortable than before .
Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it .
" I shall never see her , if she goes by London .
"
and Marianne , still talking wildly of mama , her alarm increased so rapidly , as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr . Harris , and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother .
She thanked him with brief , though fervent gratitude , and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr . Harris , and an order for post - horses directly , she wrote a few lines to her mother .
HE , meanwhile , whatever he might feel , acted with all the firmness of a collected mind , made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch , and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return .
Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind .
It was then about twelve o ' clock , and she returned to her sister ' s apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .
The distress of her sister too , particularly a favourite , was before her ;-- and as for their mother , when Mrs . Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself , her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere .
Elinor , catching all , and more than all , his fears in a moment , proposed to call in further advice .
She was calm , except when she thought of her mother ; but she was almost hopeless ; and in this state she continued till noon , scarcely stirring from her sister ' s bed , her thoughts wandering from one image of grief , one suffering friend to another , and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs . Jennings , who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne ' s disappointment had brought on .
Mrs . Jennings , perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm , allowed herself to trust in his judgment , and admitted , with unfeigned joy , and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness , the probability of an entire recovery .
Mrs . Jennings would have persuaded her , at its conclusion , to take some rest before her mother ' s arrival , and allow HER to take her place by Marianne ; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue , no capability of sleep at that moment about her , and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant .
Mrs . Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber , to satisfy herself that all continued right , left her there again to her charge and her thoughts , and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep .
She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her .
Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm , as at that moment .
"
" Had they told me ," he cried with vehemence , " that Mr . Palmer and all his relations were at the devil , it would not have turned me from the door .
"
" Pray be quick , sir ,"-- said Elinor , impatiently ;-- " I have no time to spare .
" Your sister ," said he , with abruptness , a moment afterwards --" is out of danger .
He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness .
" For God ' s sake tell me , is she out of danger , or is she not ?
" Had I known as much half an hour ago -- But since I AM here ,"-- speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat --" what does it signify ?-- For once , Miss Dashwood -- it will be the last time , perhaps -- let us be cheerful together .-- I am in a fine mood for gaiety .-- Tell me honestly "-- a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks -- " do you think me most a knave or a fool ?
"
Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever .
"
" Mr . Willoughby , you OUGHT to feel , and I certainly DO -- that after what has passed -- your coming here in this manner , and forcing yourself upon my notice , requires a very particular excuse .-- What is it , that you mean by it ?
" I mean ,"-- said he , with serious energy --" if I can , to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW .
I mean to offer some kind of explanation , some kind of apology , for the past ; to open my whole heart to you , and by convincing you , that though I have been always a blockhead , I have not been always a rascal , to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma -- from your sister .
Your sister ' s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me ; and her behaviour to me almost from the first , was of a kind -- It is astonishing , when I reflect on what it was , and what SHE was , that my heart should have been so insensible !
"
"
Even THEN , however , when fully determined on paying my addresses to her , I allowed myself most improperly to put off , from day to day , the moment of doing it , from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed .
"
And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business , I confess is beyond my comprehension .
Could it be an impartial one ?
Her affection for me deserved better treatment , and I often , with great self - reproach , recall the tenderness which , for a very short time , had the power of creating any return .
"
The matter itself I could not deny , and vain was every endeavour to soften it .
The night following this affair -- I was to go the next morning -- was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be .
The struggle was great -- but it ended too soon .
You were all gone I do not know where .
"
" Did you tell her that you should soon return ?
it DID torture me .
I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid , rascally folly of my own heart , that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now .
He stopped .
"
To know that Marianne was in town was -- in the same language -- a thunderbolt .-- Thunderbolts and daggers !-- what a reproof would she have given me !-- her taste , her opinions -- I believe they are better known to me than my own ,-- and I am sure they are dearer .
" This is not right , Mr .
Willoughby .-- Remember that you are married .
'-- But this note made me know myself better .
I sent no answer to Marianne , intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice ; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street ;-- but at last , judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool , common acquaintance than anything else , I watched you all safely out of the house one morning , and left my name .
"
She read what made her wretched .
Her wretchedness I could have borne , but her passion -- her malice -- At all events it must be appeased .
And after all , what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends , in what language my answer was couched ?-- It must have been only to one end .
And the lock of hair -- that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket - book , which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence ,-- the dear lock -- all , every memento was torn from me .
You had made your own choice .
"
Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart , and of my present feelings , will draw from her a more spontaneous , more natural , more gentle , less dignified , forgiveness .
" I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called , your justification .
"
" There is no use in staying here ; I must be off .
"
" As to that ," said he , " I must rub through the world as well as I can .
Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever .
Elinor stopped him with a reproof .
And with these words , he almost ran out of the room .
CHAPTER 45
Willoughby , he , whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men , Willoughby , in spite of all his faults , excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them , which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family , with a tenderness , a regret , rather in proportion , as she soon acknowledged within herself -- to his wishes than to his merits .
She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight ; by that person of uncommon attraction , that open , affectionate , and lively manner which it was no merit to possess ; and by that still ardent love for Marianne , which it was not even innocent to indulge .
When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne , she found her just awaking , refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes .
She was supported into the drawing - room between her daughter and her friend ;-- and there , shedding tears of joy , though still unable to speak , embraced Elinor again and again , turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon ' s hand , with a look which spoke at once her gratitude , and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment .
He shared it , however , in a silence even greater than her own .
Elinor could not hear the declaration , nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward .
" You are never like me , dear Elinor , or I should wonder at your composure now .
Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family , I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon ' s marrying one of you as the object most desirable .
"
I , you may well believe , could talk of nothing but my child ;-- he could not conceal his distress ; I saw that it equalled my own , and he perhaps , thinking that mere friendship , as the world now goes , would not justify so warm a sympathy -- or rather , not thinking at all , I suppose -- giving way to irresistible feelings , made me acquainted with his earnest , tender , constant , affection for Marianne .
He has loved her , my Elinor , ever since the first moment of seeing her .
my love , I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself .
Marianne might at that moment be dying .
"
" His fortune too !-- for at my time of life you know , everybody cares about THAT ;-- and though I neither know nor desire to know , what it really is , I am sure it must be a good one .
When there , at her own particular request , for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother , Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her .
His emotion on entering the room , in seeing her altered looks , and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him , was such , as , in Elinor ' s conjecture , must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne , or the consciousness of its being known to others ; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister , the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind , brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged , and now strengthened by the hollow eye , the sickly skin , the posture of reclining weakness , and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation .
The Dashwoods were two days on the road , and Marianne bore her journey on both , without essential fatigue .
But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise .
The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms .
I mean never to be later in rising than six , and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading .
Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self - control .
Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled , and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne , and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity .
But at last a soft , genial morning appeared ; such as might tempt the daughter ' s wishes and the mother ' s confidence ; and Marianne , leaning on Elinor ' s arm , was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue , in the lane before the house .
Her voice sunk with the word , but presently reviving she added ,
"--
" As for regret ," said Marianne , " I have done with that , as far as HE is concerned .
"
"
"
Here ceased the rapid flow of her self - reproving spirit ; and Elinor , impatient to soothe , though too honest to flatter , gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved .
I shall now live solely for my family .
Elinor , who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration , without feeling at all nearer decision than at first , heard this ; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing , resolution must do all , soon found herself leading to the fact .
A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart , but she dared not urge one .
As soon as they entered the house , Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears , " Tell mama ," withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs .
Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought ; and with a mind anxiously pre - arranging its result , and a resolution of reviving the subject again , should Marianne fail to do it , she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction .
Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means , nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza .
" It is a great relief to me -- what Elinor told me this morning -- I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear .
"
"
His demands and your inexperience together , on a small , very small income , must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you , from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before .
" The whole of his behaviour ," replied Elinor , " from the beginning to the end of the affair , has been grounded on selfishness .
But does it follow that had he married you , he would have been happy ?-- The inconveniences would have been different .
" I have not a doubt of it ," said Marianne ; " and I have nothing to regret -- nothing but my own folly .
"
Marianne would not let her proceed ;-- and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister ' s spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued ,
"
Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark ; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon ' s injuries and merits , warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate .
Margaret returned , and the family were again all restored to each other , again quietly settled at the cottage ; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton , at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future .
She was not doomed , however , to be long in ignorance of his measures .
The servant , who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill , had sense enough to call one of the maids , who , with Mrs . Dashwood ' s assistance , supported her into the other room .
They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn , as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother , who is one of the post - boys .
I happened to look up as I went by the chaise , and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele ; so I took off my hat , and she knew me and called to me , and inquired after you , ma ' am , and the young ladies , especially Miss Marianne , and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr . Ferrars ' s , their best compliments and service , and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you , but they was in a great hurry to go forwards , for they was going further down for a little while , but howsever , when they come back , they ' d make sure to come and see you .
"
"
She observed in a low voice , to her mother , that they were probably going down to Mr . Pratt ' s , near Plymouth .
Thomas ' s intelligence seemed over .
" Did you see them off , before you came away ?
"
Mrs . Dashwood feared to hazard any remark , and ventured not to offer consolation .
She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor ;-- that Marianne ' s affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self - provocation , and greater fortitude .
What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton , on seeing her mother ' s servant , on hearing Lucy ' s message !
Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event , and give farther particulars ,-- but day after day passed off , and brought no letter , no tidings .
Though uncertain that any one were to blame , she found fault with every absent friend .
" was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on .
I WILL be calm ; I WILL be mistress of myself .
She saw her mother and Marianne change colour ; saw them look at herself , and whisper a few sentences to each other .
He coloured , and stammered out an unintelligible reply .
" At Longstaple !
"
"
"
"-- was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement ;-- and though Elinor could not speak , even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder .
"
She almost ran out of the room , and as soon as the door was closed , burst into tears of joy , which at first she thought would never cease .
How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution , however , how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred , in what manner he expressed himself , and how he was received , need not be particularly told .
Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr . Pratt , I think -- nay , I am sure , it would never have happened ; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought , at the time , a most unconquerable preference for his niece , yet had I then had any pursuit , any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months , I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment , especially by mixing more with the world , as in such case I must have done .
I had therefore nothing in the world to do , but to fancy myself in love ; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable , as I had no friend , no companion in my brother , and disliked new acquaintance , it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple , where I always felt myself at home , and was always sure of a welcome ; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen : Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging .
"
But Elinor -- how are HER feelings to be described ?-- From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing , that , perhaps , at first accidentally meeting , the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other , as to lead by degrees to all the rest .
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street , of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother ' s affairs might have done , if applied to in time .
" THAT was exactly like Robert ,"-- was his immediate observation .--" And THAT ," he presently added , " might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began .
Sincerely wish you happy in your choice , and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends , as our near relationship now makes proper .
He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood ; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate , it is to be supposed , in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon , in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts , and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts , he did not , upon the whole , expect a very cruel reception .
And even now , I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted , or what fancied advantage it could be to her , to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard , and who had only two thousand pounds in the world .
But so little interest had be taken in the matter , that he owed all his knowledge of the house , garden , and glebe , extent of the parish , condition of the land , and rate of the tithes , to Elinor herself , who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon , and heard it with so much attention , as to be entirely mistress of the subject .
They were brought together by mutual affection , with the warmest approbation of their real friends ; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain -- and they only wanted something to live upon .
But Elinor had no such dependence ; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton , and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs . Ferrars ' s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele , she feared that Robert ' s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny .
A three weeks ' residence at Delaford , where , in his evening hours at least , he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty - six and seventeen , brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne ' s looks , all the kindness of her welcome , and all the encouragement of her mother ' s language , to make it cheerful .
I cannot get him out of my head , but you must send for him to Barton , and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him .
Perhaps , however , he is kept silent by his fear of offending , and I shall , therefore , give him a hint , by a line to Oxford , that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him , addressed perhaps to Fanny , and by her shewn to her mother , might not be taken amiss ; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs . Ferrars ' s heart , and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children .
With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed , and he was listened to with unexpected calmness .
It was as much , however , as was desired , and more than was expected , by Edward and Elinor ; and Mrs . Ferrars herself , by her shuffling excuses , seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more .
Mrs . Jennings ' s prophecies , though rather jumbled together , were chiefly fulfilled ; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas , and she found in Elinor and her husband , as she really believed , one of the happiest couples in the world .
" I will not say that I am disappointed , my dear sister ," said John , as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House , " THAT would be saying too much , for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world , as it is .
His property here , his place , his house , every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition !-- and his woods !-- I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire , as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger !-- And though , perhaps , Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him -- yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you , for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home , nobody can tell what may happen -- for , when people are much thrown together , and see little of anybody else -- and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage , and so forth ;-- in short , you may as well give her a chance -- You understand me .
He was proud of his conquest , proud of tricking Edward , and very proud of marrying privately without his mother ' s consent .
The forgiveness , at first , indeed , as was reasonable , comprehended only Robert ; and Lucy , who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none , still remained some weeks longer unpardoned .
It was an arrangement , however , justified in its effects , if not in its cause ; for nothing ever appeared in Robert ' s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income , as either leaving his brother too little , or bringing himself too much ;-- and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular , from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home , and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits , he might be supposed no less contented with his lot , no less free from every wish of an exchange .
Precious as was the company of her daughter to her , she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend ; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion - house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor .
They each felt his sorrows , and their own obligations , and Marianne , by general consent , was to be the reward of all .
Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate .
She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen , and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship , voluntarily to give her hand to another !-- and THAT other , a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment , whom , two years before , she had considered too old to be married ,-- and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat !
The Old Testament of the King James Bible
1 : 2 And the earth was without form , and void ; and darkness was upon the face of the deep .
1 : 3 And God said , Let there be light : and there was light .
And the evening and the morning were the second day .
1 : 9 And God said , Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place , and let the dry land appear : and it was so .
1 : 24 And God said , Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind , cattle , and creeping thing , and beast of the earth after his kind : and it was so .
1 : 26 And God said , Let us make man in our image , after our likeness : and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
1 : 27 So God created man in his own image , in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them .
2 : 14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel : that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria .
2 : 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air ; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof .
2 : 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air , and to every beast of the field ; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him .
2 : 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall cleave unto his wife : and they shall be one flesh .
3 : 2 And the woman said unto the serpent , We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden : 3 : 3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat of it , neither shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
3 : 8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day : and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden .
3 : 11 And he said , Who told thee that thou wast naked ?
3 : 21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins , and clothed them .
3 : 22 And the LORD God said , Behold , the man is become as one of us , to know good and evil : and now , lest he put forth his hand , and take also of the tree of life , and eat , and live for ever : 3 : 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden , to till the ground from whence he was taken .
4 : 3 And in process of time it came to pass , that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD .
4 : 7 If thou doest well , shalt thou not be accepted ?
And unto thee shall be his desire , and thou shalt rule over him .
4 : 8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother : and it came to pass , when they were in the field , that Cain rose up against Abel his brother , and slew him .
the voice of thy brother ' s blood crieth unto me from the ground .
4 : 25 And Adam knew his wife again ; and she bare a son , and called his name Seth : For God , said she , hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel , whom Cain slew .
5 : 32 And Noah was five hundred years old : and Noah begat Shem , Ham , and Japheth .
6 : 3 And the LORD said , My spirit shall not always strive with man , for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years .
6 : 11 The earth also was corrupt before God , and the earth was filled with violence .
6 : 16 A window shalt thou make to the ark , and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above ; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof ; with lower , second , and third stories shalt thou make it .
6 : 21 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten , and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee , and for them .
7 : 4 For yet seven days , and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights ; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth .
7 : 18 And the waters prevailed , and were increased greatly upon the earth ; and the ark went upon the face of the waters .
7 : 23 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground , both man , and cattle , and the creeping things , and the fowl of the heaven ; and they were destroyed from the earth : and Noah only remained alive , and they that were with him in the ark .
8 : 8 Also he sent forth a dove from him , to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground ; 8 : 9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot , and she returned unto him into the ark , for the waters were on the face of the whole earth : then he put forth his hand , and took her , and pulled her in unto him into the ark .
8 : 10 And he stayed yet other seven days ; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ; 8 : 11 And the dove came in to him in the evening ; and , lo , in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth .
8 : 15 And God spake unto Noah , saying , 8 : 16 Go forth of the ark , thou , and thy wife , and thy sons , and thy sons ' wives with thee .
8 : 17 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee , of all flesh , both of fowl , and of cattle , and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth ; that they may breed abundantly in the earth , and be fruitful , and multiply upon the earth .
9 : 1 And God blessed Noah and his sons , and said unto them , Be fruitful , and multiply , and replenish the earth .
9 : 11 And I will establish my covenant with you , neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood ; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth .
9 : 12 And God said , This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you , for perpetual generations : 9 : 13 I do set my bow in the cloud , and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth .
9 : 19 These are the three sons of Noah : and of them was the whole earth overspread .
9 : 22 And Ham , the father of Canaan , saw the nakedness of his father , and told his two brethren without .
9 : 28 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years .
10 : 3 And the sons of Gomer ; Ashkenaz , and Riphath , and Togarmah .
10 : 9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD : wherefore it is said , Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD .
10 : 25 And unto Eber were born two sons : the name of one was Peleg ; for in his days was the earth divided ; and his brother ' s name was Joktan .
11 : 2 And it came to pass , as they journeyed from the east , that they found a plain in the land of Shinar ; and they dwelt there .
11 : 4 And they said , Go to , let us build us a city and a tower , whose top may reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name , lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth .
11 : 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth : and they left off to build the city .
11 : 10 These are the generations of Shem : Shem was an hundred years old , and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood : 11 : 11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
11 : 22 And Serug lived thirty years , and begat Nahor : 11 : 23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years , and begat sons and daughters .
12 : 4 So Abram departed , as the LORD had spoken unto him ; and Lot went with him : and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran .
And the Canaanite was then in the land .
12 : 10 And there was a famine in the land : and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there ; for the famine was grievous in the land .
12 : 11 And it came to pass , when he was come near to enter into Egypt , that he said unto Sarai his wife , Behold now , I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon : 12 : 12 Therefore it shall come to pass , when the Egyptians shall see thee , that they shall say , This is his wife : and they will kill me , but they will save thee alive .
13 : 9 Is not the whole land before thee ?
13 : 12 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan , and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain , and pitched his tent toward Sodom .
14 : 7 And they returned , and came to Enmishpat , which is Kadesh , and smote all the country of the Amalekites , and also the Amorites , that dwelt in Hazezontamar .
14 : 11 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah , and all their victuals , and went their way .
14 : 12 And they took Lot , Abram ' s brother ' s son , who dwelt in Sodom , and his goods , and departed .
15 : 5 And he brought him forth abroad , and said , Look now toward heaven , and tell the stars , if thou be able to number them : and he said unto him , So shall thy seed be .
15 : 8 And he said , LORD God , whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it ?
16 : 6 But Abram said unto Sarai , Behold , thy maid is in thine hand ; do to her as it pleaseth thee .
and whither wilt thou go ?
16 : 11 And the angel of the LORD said unto her , Behold , thou art with child and shalt bear a son , and shalt call his name Ishmael ; because the LORD hath heard thy affliction .
17 : 5 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram , but thy name shall be Abraham ; for a father of many nations have I made thee .
17 : 16 And I will bless her , and give thee a son also of her : yea , I will bless her , and she shall be a mother of nations ; kings of people shall be of her .
and shall Sarah , that is ninety years old , bear ?
And Sarah heard it in the tent door , which was behind him .
At the time appointed I will return unto thee , according to the time of life , and Sarah shall have a son .
18 : 24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city : wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein ?
18 : 27 And Abraham answered and said , Behold now , I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD , which am but dust and ashes : 18 : 28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous : wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five ?
19 : 4 But before they lay down , the men of the city , even the men of Sodom , compassed the house round , both old and young , all the people from every quarter : 19 : 5 And they called unto Lot , and said unto him , Where are the men which came in to thee this night ?
19 : 10 But the men put forth their hand , and pulled Lot into the house to them , and shut to the door .
19 : 14 And Lot went out , and spake unto his sons in law , which married his daughters , and said , Up , get you out of this place ; for the LORD will destroy this city .
19 : 15 And when the morning arose , then the angels hastened Lot , saying , Arise , take thy wife , and thy two daughters , which are here ; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city .
) and my soul shall live .
Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar .
19 : 23 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar .
19 : 31 And the firstborn said unto the younger , Our father is old , and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth : 19 : 32 Come , let us make our father drink wine , and we will lie with him , that we may preserve seed of our father .
19 : 35 And they made their father drink wine that night also : and the younger arose , and lay with him ; and he perceived not when she lay down , nor when she arose .
19 : 37 And the first born bare a son , and called his name Moab : the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day .
19 : 38 And the younger , she also bare a son , and called his name Benammi : the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day .
20 : 1 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country , and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur , and sojourned in Gerar .
20 : 2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife , She is my sister : and Abimelech king of Gerar sent , and took Sarah .
20 : 13 And it came to pass , when God caused me to wander from my father ' s house , that I said unto her , This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me ; at every place whither we shall come , say of me , He is my brother .
20 : 17 So Abraham prayed unto God : and God healed Abimelech , and his wife , and his maidservants ; and they bare children .
21 : 2 For Sarah conceived , and bare Abraham a son in his old age , at the set time of which God had spoken to him .
21 : 6 And Sarah said , God hath made me to laugh , so that all that hear will laugh with me .
for I have born him a son in his old age .
21 : 10 Wherefore she said unto Abraham , Cast out this bondwoman and her son : for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son , even with Isaac .
22 : 6 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering , and laid it upon Isaac his son ; and he took the fire in his hand , and a knife ; and they went both of them together .
22 : 9 And they came to the place which God had told him of ; and Abraham built an altar there , and laid the wood in order , and bound Isaac his son , and laid him on the altar upon the wood .
23 : 12 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land .
23 : 14 And Ephron answered Abraham , saying unto him , 23 : 15 My lord , hearken unto me : the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver ; what is that betwixt me and thee ?
23 : 19 And after this , Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre : the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan .
24 : 11 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening , even the time that women go out to draw water .
24 : 12 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham , I pray thee , send me good speed this day , and shew kindness unto my master Abraham .
24 : 13 Behold , I stand here by the well of water ; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water : 24 : 14 And let it come to pass , that the damsel to whom I shall say , Let down thy pitcher , I pray thee , that I may drink ; and she shall say , Drink , and I will give thy camels drink also : let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac ; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master .
24 : 21 And the man wondering at her held his peace , to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not .
24 : 29 And Rebekah had a brother , and his name was Laban : and Laban ran out unto the man , unto the well .
24 : 47 And I asked her , and said , Whose daughter art thou ?
24 : 52 And it came to pass , that , when Abraham ' s servant heard their words , he worshipped the LORD , bowing himself to the earth .
24 : 53 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment , and gave them to Rebekah : he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things .
25 : 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael , an hundred and thirty and seven years : and he gave up the ghost and died ; and was gathered unto his people .
And Isaac said unto him , Because I said , Lest I die for her .
26 : 18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water , which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father ; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham : and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them .
26 : 24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night , and said , I am the God of Abraham thy father : fear not , for I am with thee , and will bless thee , and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham ' s sake .
26 : 31 And they rose up betimes in the morning , and sware one to another : and Isaac sent them away , and they departed from him in peace .
27 : 21 And Isaac said unto Jacob , Come near , I pray thee , that I may feel thee , my son , whether thou be my very son Esau or not .
27 : 22 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father ; and he felt him , and said , The voice is Jacob ' s voice , but the hands are the hands of Esau .
27 : 23 And he discerned him not , because his hands were hairy , as his brother Esau ' s hands : so he blessed him .
27 : 24 And he said , Art thou my very son Esau ?
27 : 25 And he said , Bring it near to me , and I will eat of my son ' s venison , that my soul may bless thee .
27 : 26 And his father Isaac said unto him , Come near now , and kiss me , my son .
27 : 34 And when Esau heard the words of his father , he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry , and said unto his father , Bless me , even me also , O my father .
27 : 46 And Rebekah said to Isaac , I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth : if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth , such as these which are of the daughters of the land , what good shall my life do me ?
28 : 17 And he was afraid , and said , How dreadful is this place !
29 : 19 And Laban said , It is better that I give her to thee , than that I should give her to another man : abide with me .
did not I serve with thee for Rachel ?
29 : 30 And he went in also unto Rachel , and he loved also Rachel more than Leah , and served with him yet seven other years .
29 : 35 And she conceived again , and bare a son : and she said , Now will I praise the LORD : therefore she called his name Judah ; and left bearing .
30 : 3 And she said , Behold my maid Bilhah , go in unto her ; and she shall bear upon my knees , that I may also have children by her .
30 : 5 And Bilhah conceived , and bare Jacob a son .
30 : 12 And Zilpah Leah ' s maid bare Jacob a second son .
And Rachel said , Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son ' s mandrakes .
30 : 17 And God hearkened unto Leah , and she conceived , and bare Jacob the fifth son .
30 : 21 And afterwards she bare a daughter , and called her name Dinah .
30 : 35 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted , and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted , and every one that had some white in it , and all the brown among the sheep , and gave them into the hand of his sons .
30 : 43 And the man increased exceedingly , and had much cattle , and maidservants , and menservants , and camels , and asses .
Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount : and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead .
31 : 28 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters ?
For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them .
31 : 33 And Laban went into Jacob ' s tent , and into Leah ' s tent , and into the two maidservants ' tents ; but he found them not .
God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands , and rebuked thee yesternight .
And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac .
32 : 9 And Jacob said , O God of my father Abraham , and God of my father Isaac , the LORD which saidst unto me , Return unto thy country , and to thy kindred , and I will deal well with thee : 32 : 10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies , and of all the truth , which thou hast shewed unto thy servant ; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan ; and now I am become two bands .
32 : 23 And he took them , and sent them over the brook , and sent over that he had .
32 : 25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him , he touched the hollow of his thigh ; and the hollow of Jacob ' s thigh was out of joint , as he wrestled with him .
33 : 10 And Jacob said , Nay , I pray thee , if now I have found grace in thy sight , then receive my present at my hand : for therefore I have seen thy face , as though I had seen the face of God , and thou wast pleased with me .
And he said , What needeth it ?
34 : 5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter : now his sons were with his cattle in the field : and Jacob held his peace until they were come .
34 : 18 And their words pleased Hamor , and Shechem Hamor ' s son .
34 : 19 And the young man deferred not to do the thing , because he had delight in Jacob ' s daughter : and he was more honourable than all the house of his father .
only let us consent unto them , and they will dwell with us .
34 : 28 They took their sheep , and their oxen , and their asses , and that which was in the city , and that which was in the field , 34 : 29 And all their wealth , and all their little ones , and their wives took they captive , and spoiled even all that was in the house .
35 : 6 So Jacob came to Luz , which is in the land of Canaan , that is , Bethel , he and all the people that were with him .
35 : 7 And he built there an altar , and called the place Elbethel : because there God appeared unto him , when he fled from the face of his brother .
35 : 14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him , even a pillar of stone : and he poured a drink offering thereon , and he poured oil thereon .
35 : 19 And Rachel died , and was buried in the way to Ephrath , which is Bethlehem .
36 : 24 And these are the children of Zibeon ; both Ajah , and Anah : this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness , as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father .
36 : 32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom : and the name of his city was Dinhabah .
36 : 37 And Samlah died , and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead .
36 : 38 And Saul died , and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead .
37 : 4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren , they hated him , and could not speak peaceably unto him .
37 : 10 And he told it to his father , and to his brethren : and his father rebuked him , and said unto him , What is this dream that thou hast dreamed ?
37 : 12 And his brethren went to feed their father ' s flock in Shechem .
37 : 23 And it came to pass , when Joseph was come unto his brethren , that they stript Joseph out of his coat , his coat of many colours that was on him ; 37 : 24 And they took him , and cast him into a pit : and the pit was empty , there was no water in it .
38 : 1 And it came to pass at that time , that Judah went down from his brethren , and turned in to a certain Adullamite , whose name was Hirah .
38 : 2 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite , whose name was Shuah ; and he took her , and went in unto her .
38 : 10 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD : wherefore he slew him also .
38 : 15 When Judah saw her , he thought her to be an harlot ; because she had covered her face .
38 : 17 And he said , I will send thee a kid from the flock .
And she said , Thy signet , and thy bracelets , and thy staff that is in thine hand .
39 : 1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt ; and Potiphar , an officer of Pharaoh , captain of the guard , an Egyptian , bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites , which had brought him down thither .
39 : 2 And the LORD was with Joseph , and he was a prosperous man ; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian .
39 : 7 And it came to pass after these things , that his master ' s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph ; and she said , Lie with me .
39 : 13 And it came to pass , when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand , and was fled forth , 39 : 14 That she called unto the men of her house , and spake unto them , saying , See , he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us ; he came in unto me to lie with me , and I cried with a loud voice : 39 : 15 And it came to pass , when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried , that he left his garment with me , and fled , and got him out .
40 : 1 And it came to pass after these things , that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt .
And Joseph said unto them , Do not interpretations belong to God ?
40 : 16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good , he said unto Joseph , I also was in my dream , and , behold , I had three white baskets on my head : 40 : 17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh ; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head .
41 : 1 And it came to pass at the end of two full years , that Pharaoh dreamed : and , behold , he stood by the river .
41 : 8 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled ; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt , and all the wise men thereof : and Pharaoh told them his dream ; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh .
41 : 12 And there was there with us a young man , an Hebrew , servant to the captain of the guard ; and we told him , and he interpreted to us our dreams ; to each man according to his dream he did interpret .
41 : 25 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh , The dream of Pharaoh is one : God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do .
41 : 33 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise , and set him over the land of Egypt .
41 : 42 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand , and put it upon Joseph ' s hand , and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen , and put a gold chain about his neck ; 41 : 43 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had ; and they cried before him , Bow the knee : and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt .
And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh , and went throughout all the land of Egypt .
41 : 50 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came , which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him .
42 : 10 And they said unto him , Nay , my lord , but to buy food are thy servants come .
42 : 14 And Joseph said unto them , That is it that I spake unto you , saying , Ye are spies : 42 : 15 Hereby ye shall be proved : By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence , except your youngest brother come hither .
42 : 17 And he put them all together into ward three days .
42 : 18 And Joseph said unto them the third day , This do , and live ; for I fear God : 42 : 19 If ye be true men , let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison : go ye , carry corn for the famine of your houses : 42 : 20 But bring your youngest brother unto me ; so shall your words be verified , and ye shall not die .
And they did so .
42 : 22 And Reuben answered them , saying , Spake I not unto you , saying , Do not sin against the child ; and ye would not hear ?
43 : 4 If thou wilt send our brother with us , we will go down and buy thee food : 43 : 5 But if thou wilt not send him , we will not go down : for the man said unto us , Ye shall not see my face , except your brother be with you .
43 : 17 And the man did as Joseph bade ; and the man brought the men into Joseph ' s house .
43 : 19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph ' s house , and they communed with him at the door of the house , 43 : 20 And said , O sir , we came indeed down at the first time to buy food : 43 : 21 And it came to pass , when we came to the inn , that we opened our sacks , and , behold , every man ' s money was in the mouth of his sack , our money in full weight : and we have brought it again in our hand .
And he said , God be gracious unto thee , my son .
43 : 30 And Joseph made haste ; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother : and he sought where to weep ; and he entered into his chamber , and wept there .
And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken .
44 : 3 As soon as the morning was light , the men were sent away , they and their asses .
44 : 14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph ' s house ; for he was yet there : and they fell before him on the ground .
44 : 24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father , we told him the words of my lord .
44 : 25 And our father said , Go again , and buy us a little food .
44 : 27 And thy servant my father said unto us , Ye know that my wife bare me two sons : 44 : 28 And the one went out from me , and I said , Surely he is torn in pieces ; and I saw him not since : 44 : 29 And if ye take this also from me , and mischief befall him , ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave .
44 : 33 Now therefore , I pray thee , let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord ; and let the lad go up with his brethren .
45 : 4 And Joseph said unto his brethren , Come near to me , I pray you .
45 : 6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land : and yet there are five years , in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest .
45 : 12 And , behold , your eyes see , and the eyes of my brother Benjamin , that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you .
45 : 13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt , and of all that ye have seen ; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither .
46 : 1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had , and came to Beersheba , and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac .
46 : 8 And these are the names of the children of Israel , which came into Egypt , Jacob and his sons : Reuben , Jacob ' s firstborn .
46 : 13 And the sons of Issachar ; Tola , and Phuvah , and Job , and Shimron .
46 : 17 And the sons of Asher ; Jimnah , and Ishuah , and Isui , and Beriah , and Serah their sister : and the sons of Beriah ; Heber , and Malchiel .
46 : 22 These are the sons of Rachel , which were born to Jacob : all the souls were fourteen .
46 : 28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph , to direct his face unto Goshen ; and they came into the land of Goshen .
46 : 30 And Israel said unto Joseph , Now let me die , since I have seen thy face , because thou art yet alive .
47 : 10 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh , and went out from before Pharaoh .
47 : 27 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt , in the country of Goshen ; and they had possessions therein , and grew , and multiplied exceedingly .
And he sware unto him .
48 : 2 And one told Jacob , and said , Behold , thy son Joseph cometh unto thee : and Israel strengthened himself , and sat upon the bed .
48 : 8 And Israel beheld Joseph ' s sons , and said , Who are these ?
48 : 15 And he blessed Joseph , and said , God , before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk , the God which fed me all my life long unto this day , 48 : 16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil , bless the lads ; and let my name be named on them , and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac ; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth .
49 : 5 Simeon and Levi are brethren ; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations .
49 : 6 O my soul , come not thou into their secret ; unto their assembly , mine honour , be not thou united : for in their anger they slew a man , and in their selfwill they digged down a wall .
49 : 28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel : and this is it that their father spake unto them , and blessed them ; every one according to his blessing he blessed them .
49 : 31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife ; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife ; and there I buried Leah .
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him .
50 : 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim ' s children of the third generation : the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph ' s knees .
1 : 11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens .
And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities , Pithom and Raamses .
1 : 12 But the more they afflicted them , the more they multiplied and grew .
1 : 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people , saying , Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river , and every daughter ye shall save alive .
2 : 4 And his sister stood afar off , to wit what would be done to him .
2 : 5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river ; and her maidens walked along by the river ' s side ; and when she saw the ark among the flags , she sent her maid to fetch it .
2 : 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh ' s daughter , Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women , that she may nurse the child for thee ?
And she called his name Moses : and she said , Because I drew him out of the water .
2 : 13 And when he went out the second day , behold , two men of the Hebrews strove together : and he said to him that did the wrong , Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow ?
2 : 20 And he said unto his daughters , And where is he ?
call him , that he may eat bread .
3 : 1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb .
And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God .
3 : 15 And God said moreover unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , the LORD God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name for ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations .
And he put his hand into his bosom again ; and plucked it out of his bosom , and , behold , it was turned again as his other flesh .
4 : 21 And the LORD said unto Moses , When thou goest to return into Egypt , see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh , which I have put in thine hand : but I will harden his heart , that he shall not let the people go .
5 : 16 There is no straw given unto thy servants , and they say to us , Make brick : and , behold , thy servants are beaten ; but the fault is in thine own people .
5 : 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name , he hath done evil to this people ; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all .
6 : 2 And God spake unto Moses , and said unto him , I am the LORD : 6 : 3 And I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty , but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them .
6 : 6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel , I am the LORD , and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians , and I will rid you out of their bondage , and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm , and with great judgments : 6 : 7 And I will take you to me for a people , and I will be to you a God : and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God , which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians .
6 : 25 And Eleazar Aaron ' s son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife ; and she bare him Phinehas : these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families .
7 : 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you , that I may lay my hand upon Egypt , and bring forth mine armies , and my people the children of Israel , out of the land of Egypt by great judgments .
7 : 5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD , when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt , and bring out the children of Israel from among them .
7 : 7 And Moses was fourscore years old , and Aaron fourscore and three years old , when they spake unto Pharaoh .
7 : 22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments : and Pharaoh ' s heart was hardened , neither did he hearken unto them ; as the LORD had said .
8 : 14 And they gathered them together upon heaps : and the land stank .
8 : 21 Else , if thou wilt not let my people go , behold , I will send swarms of flies upon thee , and upon thy servants , and upon thy people , and into thy houses : and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies , and also the ground whereon they are .
8 : 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh , and intreated the LORD .
9 : 5 And the LORD appointed a set time , saying , To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land .
9 : 27 And Pharaoh sent , and called for Moses and Aaron , and said unto them , I have sinned this time : the LORD is righteous , and I and my people are wicked .
9 : 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten : for the barley was in the ear , and the flax was bolled .
9 : 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased , he sinned yet more , and hardened his heart , he and his servants .
10 : 11 Not so : go now ye that are men , and serve the LORD ; for that ye did desire .
10 : 13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt , and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day , and all that night ; and when it was morning , the east wind brought the locusts .
10 : 19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind , which took away the locusts , and cast them into the Red sea ; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt .
11 : 4 And Moses said , Thus saith the LORD , About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt : 11 : 5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die , from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne , even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill ; and all the firstborn of beasts .
11 : 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh : and the LORD hardened Pharaoh ' s heart , so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land .
12 : 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses : for whosoever eateth that which is leavened , even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel , whether he be a stranger , or born in the land .
12 : 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt , for it was not leavened ; because they were thrust out of Egypt , and could not tarry , neither had they prepared for themselves any victual .
12 : 40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel , who dwelt in Egypt , was four hundred and thirty years .
12 : 46 In one house shall it be eaten ; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house ; neither shall ye break a bone thereof .
12 : 51 And it came to pass the selfsame day , that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies .
13 : 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread , and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD .
13 : 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days ; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee , neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters .
13 : 16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand , and for frontlets between thine eyes : for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt .
And they did so .
wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us , to carry us forth out of Egypt ?
14 : 17 And I , behold , I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians , and they shall follow them : and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh , and upon all his host , upon his chariots , and upon his horsemen .
14 : 23 And the Egyptians pursued , and went in after them to the midst of the sea , even all Pharaoh ' s horses , his chariots , and his horsemen .
14 : 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea , and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared ; and the Egyptians fled against it ; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea .
14 : 29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea ; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand , and on their left .
14 : 30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians ; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore .
14 : 31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the LORD , and believed the LORD , and his servant Moses .
15 : 6 Thy right hand , O LORD , is become glorious in power : thy right hand , O LORD , hath dashed in pieces the enemy .
15 : 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind , the sea covered them : they sank as lead in the mighty waters .
15 : 14 The people shall hear , and be afraid : sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina .
15 : 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea , and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them ; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea .
15 : 22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea , and they went out into the wilderness of Shur ; and they went three days in the wilderness , and found no water .
16 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in ; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily .
16 : 6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel , At even , then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt : 16 : 7 And in the morning , then ye shall see the glory of the LORD ; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD : and what are we , that ye murmur against us ?
16 : 17 And the children of Israel did so , and gathered , some more , some less .
16 : 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses ; but some of them left of it until the morning , and it bred worms , and stank : and Moses was wroth with them .
16 : 24 And they laid it up till the morning , as Moses bade : and it did not stink , neither was there any worm therein .
16 : 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years , until they came to a land inhabited ; they did eat manna , until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan .
16 : 36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah .
And Moses said unto them , Why chide ye with me ?
17 : 5 And the LORD said unto Moses , Go on before the people , and take with thee of the elders of Israel ; and thy rod , wherewith thou smotest the river , take in thine hand , and go .
17 : 12 But Moses hands were heavy ; and they took a stone , and put it under him , and he sat thereon ; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands , the one on the one side , and the other on the other side ; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun .
18 : 14 And when Moses ' father in law saw all that he did to the people , he said , What is this thing that thou doest to the people ?
18 : 19 Hearken now unto my voice , I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee : Be thou for the people to God - ward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God : 18 : 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws , and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk , and the work that they must do .
18 : 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men , such as fear God , men of truth , hating covetousness ; and place such over them , to be rulers of thousands , and rulers of hundreds , rulers of fifties , and rulers of tens : 18 : 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons : and it shall be , that every great matter they shall bring unto thee , but every small matter they shall judge : so shall it be easier for thyself , and they shall bear the burden with thee .
18 : 26 And they judged the people at all seasons : the hard causes they brought unto Moses , but every small matter they judged themselves .
19 : 8 And all the people answered together , and said , All that the LORD hath spoken we will do .
19 : 24 And the LORD said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD , lest he break forth upon them .
20 : 19 And they said unto Moses , Speak thou with us , and we will hear : but let not God speak with us , lest we die .
20 : 21 And the people stood afar off , and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was .
20 : 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar , that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon .
21 : 17 And he that curseth his father , or his mother , shall surely be put to death .
21 : 23 And if any mischief follow , then thou shalt give life for life , 21 : 24 Eye for eye , tooth for tooth , hand for hand , foot for foot , 21 : 25 Burning for burning , wound for wound , stripe for stripe .
21 : 31 Whether he have gored a son , or have gored a daughter , according to this judgment shall it be done unto him .
21 : 32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant ; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver , and the ox shall be stoned .
22 : 13 If it be torn in pieces , then let him bring it for witness , and he shall not make good that which was torn .
22 : 26 If thou at all take thy neighbour ' s raiment to pledge , thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down : 22 : 27 For that is his covering only , it is his raiment for his skin : wherein shall he sleep ?
23 : 1 Thou shalt not raise a false report : put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness .
23 : 5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden , and wouldest forbear to help him , thou shalt surely help with him .
23 : 10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land , and shalt gather in the fruits thereof : 23 : 11 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still ; that the poor of thy people may eat : and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat .
In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard , and with thy oliveyard .
23 : 18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread ; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning .
24 : 13 And Moses rose up , and his minister Joshua : and Moses went up into the mount of God .
25 : 30 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway .
25 : 37 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof : and they shall light the lamps thereof , that they may give light over against it .
26 : 8 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits , and the breadth of one curtain four cubits : and the eleven curtains shall be all of one measure .
26 : 15 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood standing up .
26 : 17 Two tenons shall there be in one board , set in order one against another : thus shalt thou make for all the boards of the tabernacle .
26 : 19 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
26 : 31 And thou shalt make a vail of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen of cunning work : with cherubims shall it be made : 26 : 32 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold : their hooks shall be of gold , upon the four sockets of silver .
27 : 5 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath , that the net may be even to the midst of the altar .
27 : 6 And thou shalt make staves for the altar , staves of shittim wood , and overlay them with brass .
27 : 7 And the staves shall be put into the rings , and the staves shall be upon the two sides of the altar , to bear it .
27 : 11 And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long , and his twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
27 : 18 The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits , and the breadth fifty every where , and the height five cubits of fine twined linen , and their sockets of brass .
28 : 1 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother , and his sons with him , from among the children of Israel , that he may minister unto me in the priest ' s office , even Aaron , Nadab and Abihu , Eleazar and Ithamar , Aaron ' s sons .
28 : 5 And they shall take gold , and blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine linen .
28 : 7 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two edges thereof ; and so it shall be joined together .
28 : 8 And the curious girdle of the ephod , which is upon it , shall be of the same , according to the work thereof ; even of gold , of blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
28 : 24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastplate .
28 : 28 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue , that it may be above the curious girdle of the ephod , and that the breastplate be not loosed from the ephod .
29 : 1 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow them , to minister unto me in the priest ' s office : Take one young bullock , and two rams without blemish , 29 : 2 And unleavened bread , and cakes unleavened tempered with oil , and wafers unleavened anointed with oil : of wheaten flour shalt thou make them .
29 : 5 And thou shalt take the garments , and put upon Aaron the coat , and the robe of the ephod , and the ephod , and the breastplate , and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod : 29 : 6 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head , and put the holy crown upon the mitre .
29 : 8 And thou shalt bring his sons , and put coats upon them .
29 : 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock .
29 : 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar : it is a burnt offering unto the LORD : it is a sweet savour , an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
29 : 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram , and take of his blood , and put it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron , and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons , and upon the thumb of their right hand , and upon the great toe of their right foot , and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
29 : 22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump , and the fat that covereth the inwards , and the caul above the liver , and the two kidneys , and the fat that is upon them , and the right shoulder ; for it is a ram of consecration : 29 : 23 And one loaf of bread , and one cake of oiled bread , and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD : 29 : 24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron , and in the hands of his sons ; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before the LORD .
29 : 26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron ' s consecration , and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD : and it shall be thy part .
29 : 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram , and the bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
29 : 35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron , and to his sons , according to all things which I have commanded thee : seven days shalt thou consecrate them .
30 : 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony , before the mercy seat that is over the testimony , where I will meet with thee .
30 : 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith , and the ark of the testimony , 30 : 27 And the table and all his vessels , and the candlestick and his vessels , and the altar of incense , 30 : 28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels , and the laver and his foot .
30 : 33 Whosoever compoundeth any like it , or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger , shall even be cut off from his people .
32 : 5 And when Aaron saw it , he built an altar before it ; and Aaron made proclamation , and said , To morrow is a feast to the LORD .
32 : 11 And Moses besought the LORD his God , and said , LORD , why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people , which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power , and with a mighty hand ?
32 : 13 Remember Abraham , Isaac , and Israel , thy servants , to whom thou swarest by thine own self , and saidst unto them , I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven , and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed , and they shall inherit it for ever .
32 : 16 And the tables were the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God , graven upon the tables .
And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him .
32 : 27 And he said unto them , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour .
32 : 28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men .
32 : 34 Therefore now go , lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee : behold , mine Angel shall go before thee : nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them .
32 : 35 And the LORD plagued the people , because they made the calf , which Aaron made .
33 : 8 And it came to pass , when Moses went out unto the tabernacle , that all the people rose up , and stood every man at his tent door , and looked after Moses , until he was gone into the tabernacle .
33 : 18 And he said , I beseech thee , shew me thy glory .
33 : 19 And he said , I will make all my goodness pass before thee , and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee ; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious , and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy .
34 : 3 And no man shall come up with thee , neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount ; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount .
34 : 4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first ; and Moses rose up early in the morning , and went up unto mount Sinai , as the LORD had commanded him , and took in his hand the two tables of stone .
34 : 12 Take heed to thyself , lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest , lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee : 34 : 13 But ye shall destroy their altars , break their images , and cut down their groves : 34 : 14 For thou shalt worship no other god : for the LORD , whose name is Jealous , is a jealous God : 34 : 15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land , and they go a whoring after their gods , and do sacrifice unto their gods , and one call thee , and thou eat of his sacrifice ; 34 : 16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons , and their daughters go a whoring after their gods , and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods .
34 : 17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods .
34 : 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks , of the firstfruits of wheat harvest , and the feast of ingathering at the year ' s end .
35 : 1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together , and said unto them , These are the words which the LORD hath commanded , that ye should do them .
35 : 10 And every wise hearted among you shall come , and make all that the LORD hath commanded ; 35 : 11 The tabernacle , his tent , and his covering , his taches , and his boards , his bars , his pillars , and his sockets , 35 : 12 The ark , and the staves thereof , with the mercy seat , and the vail of the covering , 35 : 13 The table , and his staves , and all his vessels , and the shewbread , 35 : 14 The candlestick also for the light , and his furniture , and his lamps , with the oil for the light , 35 : 15 And the incense altar , and his staves , and the anointing oil , and the sweet incense , and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the tabernacle , 35 : 16 The altar of burnt offering , with his brasen grate , his staves , and all his vessels , the laver and his foot , 35 : 17 The hangings of the court , his pillars , and their sockets , and the hanging for the door of the court , 35 : 18 The pins of the tabernacle , and the pins of the court , and their cords , 35 : 19 The cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , the holy garments for Aaron the priest , and the garments of his sons , to minister in the priest ' s office .
35 : 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones , and stones to be set , for the ephod , and for the breastplate ; 35 : 28 And spice , and oil for the light , and for the anointing oil , and for the sweet incense .
36 : 1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary , according to all that the LORD had commanded .
36 : 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab , and every wise hearted man , in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom , even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it : 36 : 3 And they received of Moses all the offering , which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary , to make it withal .
36 : 19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams ' skins dyed red , and a covering of badgers ' skins above that .
36 : 21 The length of a board was ten cubits , and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half .
36 : 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle ; twenty boards for the south side southward : 36 : 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards ; two sockets under one board for his two tenons , and two sockets under another board for his two tenons .
36 : 25 And for the other side of the tabernacle , which is toward the north corner , he made twenty boards , 36 : 26 And their forty sockets of silver ; two sockets under one board , and two sockets under another board .
36 : 36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood , and overlaid them with gold : their hooks were of gold ; and he cast for them four sockets of silver .
37 : 23 And he made his seven lamps , and his snuffers , and his snuffdishes , of pure gold .
38 : 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass , to be places for the staves .
38 : 11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits , their pillars were twenty , and their sockets of brass twenty ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver .
38 : 17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass ; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver ; and the overlaying of their chapiters of silver ; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver .
38 : 23 And with him was Aholiab , son of Ahisamach , of the tribe of Dan , an engraver , and a cunning workman , and an embroiderer in blue , and in purple , and in scarlet , and fine linen .
39 : 1 And of the blue , and purple , and scarlet , they made cloths of service , to do service in the holy place , and made the holy garments for Aaron ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
39 : 2 And he made the ephod of gold , blue , and purple , and scarlet , and fine twined linen .
39 : 6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold , graven , as signets are graven , with the names of the children of Israel .
39 : 7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod , that they should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
39 : 19 And they made two rings of gold , and put them on the two ends of the breastplate , upon the border of it , which was on the side of the ephod inward .
39 : 20 And they made two other golden rings , and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath , toward the forepart of it , over against the other coupling thereof , above the curious girdle of the ephod .
39 : 22 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work , all of blue .
40 : 17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year , on the first day of the month , that the tabernacle was reared up .
40 : 18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle , and fastened his sockets , and set up the boards thereof , and put in the bars thereof , and reared up his pillars .
40 : 19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle , and put the covering of the tent above upon it ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
40 : 28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle .
40 : 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle , the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys : 40 : 37 But if the cloud were not taken up , then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up .
1 : 5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD : and the priests , Aaron ' s sons , shall bring the blood , and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
2 : 5 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan , it shall be of fine flour unleavened , mingled with oil .
2 : 8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD : and when it is presented unto the priest , he shall bring it unto the altar .
2 : 14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD , thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire , even corn beaten out of full ears .
3 : 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering , and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and Aaron ' s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about .
3 : 5 And Aaron ' s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice , which is upon the wood that is on the fire : it is an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
3 : 11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar : it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD .
4 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 4 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and shall do against any of them : 4 : 3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people ; then let him bring for his sin , which he hath sinned , a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering .
4 : 4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD ; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock ' s head , and kill the bullock before the LORD .
4 : 7 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD , which is in the tabernacle of the congregation ; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering , which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
4 : 27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance , while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done , and be guilty ; 4 : 28 Or if his sin , which he hath sinned , come to his knowledge : then he shall bring his offering , a kid of the goats , a female without blemish , for his sin which he hath sinned .
5 : 17 And if a soul sin , and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD ; though he wist it not , yet is he guilty , and shall bear his iniquity .
5 : 18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock , with thy estimation , for a trespass offering , unto the priest : and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not , and it shall be forgiven him .
6 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 2 If a soul sin , and commit a trespass against the LORD , and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep , or in fellowship , or in a thing taken away by violence , or hath deceived his neighbour ; 6 : 3 Or have found that which was lost , and lieth concerning it , and sweareth falsely ; in any of all these that a man doeth , sinning therein : 6 : 4 Then it shall be , because he hath sinned , and is guilty , that he shall restore that which he took violently away , or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten , or that which was delivered him to keep , or the lost thing which he found , 6 : 5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely ; he shall even restore it in the principal , and shall add the fifth part more thereto , and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth , in the day of his trespass offering .
6 : 23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt : it shall not be eaten .
6 : 24 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , saying , This is the law of the sin offering : In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD : it is most holy .
7 : 7 As the sin offering is , so is the trespass offering : there is one law for them : the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it .
7 : 19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten ; it shall be burnt with fire : and as for the flesh , all that be clean shall eat thereof .
7 : 28 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 7 : 29 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings .
8 : 17 But the bullock , and his hide , his flesh , and his dung , he burnt with fire without the camp ; as the LORD commanded Moses .
8 : 31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons , Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation : and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations , as I commanded , saying , Aaron and his sons shall eat it .
8 : 36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
9 : 3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak , saying , Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering ; and a calf and a lamb , both of the first year , without blemish , for a burnt offering ; 9 : 4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings , to sacrifice before the LORD ; and a meat offering mingled with oil : for to day the LORD will appear unto you .
9 : 13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him , with the pieces thereof , and the head : and he burnt them upon the altar .
9 : 15 And he brought the people ' s offering , and took the goat , which was the sin offering for the people , and slew it , and offered it for sin , as the first .
10 : 1 And Nadab and Abihu , the sons of Aaron , took either of them his censer , and put fire therein , and put incense thereon , and offered strange fire before the LORD , which he commanded them not .
And Aaron held his peace .
10 : 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan , the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron , and said unto them , Come near , carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp .
10 : 12 And Moses spake unto Aaron , and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar , his sons that were left , Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire , and eat it without leaven beside the altar : for it is most holy : 10 : 13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place , because it is thy due , and thy sons ' due , of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire : for so I am commanded .
10 : 16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering , and , behold , it was burnt : and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar , the sons of Aaron which were left alive , saying , 10 : 17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place , seeing it is most holy , and God hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation , to make atonement for them before the LORD ?
11 : 3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
11 : 23 But all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
12 : 8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb , then she shall bring two turtles , or two young pigeons ; the one for the burnt offering , and the other for a sin offering : and the priest shall make an atonement for her , and she shall be clean .
13 : 14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him , he shall be unclean .
13 : 15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh , and pronounce him to be unclean : for the raw flesh is unclean : it is a leprosy .
13 : 18 The flesh also , in which , even in the skin thereof , was a boil , and is healed , 13 : 19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising , or a bright spot , white , and somewhat reddish , and it be shewed to the priest ; 13 : 20 And if , when the priest seeth it , behold , it be in sight lower than the skin , and the hair thereof be turned white ; the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil .
13 : 29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard ; 13 : 30 Then the priest shall see the plague : and , behold , if it be in sight deeper than the skin ; and there be in it a yellow thin hair ; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean : it is a dry scall , even a leprosy upon the head or beard .
13 : 43 Then the priest shall look upon it : and , behold , if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head , or in his bald forehead , as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh ; 13 : 44 He is a leprous man , he is unclean : the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean ; his plague is in his head .
13 : 52 He shall therefore burn that garment , whether warp or woof , in woollen or in linen , or any thing of skin , wherein the plague is : for it is a fretting leprosy ; it shall be burnt in the fire .
14 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 14 : 2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing : He shall be brought unto the priest : 14 : 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp ; and the priest shall look , and , behold , if the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper ; 14 : 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive and clean , and cedar wood , and scarlet , and hyssop : 14 : 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water : 14 : 6 As for the living bird , he shall take it , and the cedar wood , and the scarlet , and the hyssop , and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water : 14 : 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times , and shall pronounce him clean , and shall let the living bird loose into the open field .
14 : 10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish , and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish , and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , and one log of oil .
14 : 32 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy , whose hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his cleansing .
15 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying , 15 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When any man hath a running issue out of his flesh , because of his issue he is unclean .
15 : 9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be unclean .
15 : 23 And if it be on her bed , or on any thing whereon she sitteth , when he toucheth it , he shall be unclean until the even .
15 : 24 And if any man lie with her at all , and her flowers be upon him , he shall be unclean seven days ; and all the bed whereon he lieth shall be unclean .
15 : 29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles , or two young pigeons , and bring them unto the priest , to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
16 : 9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD ' s lot fell , and offer him for a sin offering .
16 : 11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering , which is for himself , and shall make an atonement for himself , and for his house , and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself : 16 : 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD , and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small , and bring it within the vail : 16 : 13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD , that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the testimony , that he die not : 16 : 14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward ; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times .
16 : 15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering , that is for the people , and bring his blood within the vail , and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock , and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat , and before the mercy seat : 16 : 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place , because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel , and because of their transgressions in all their sins : and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation , that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness .
16 : 27 And the bullock for the sin offering , and the goat for the sin offering , whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place , shall one carry forth without the camp ; and they shall burn in the fire their skins , and their flesh , and their dung .
16 : 31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you , and ye shall afflict your souls , by a statute for ever .
17 : 7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils , after whom they have gone a whoring .
18 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 18 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , I am the LORD your God .
18 : 19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness , as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness .
18 : 22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination .
18 : 23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith : neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto : it is confusion .
18 : 26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments , and shall not commit any of these abominations ; neither any of your own nation , nor any stranger that sojourneth among you : 18 : 27 ( For all these abominations have the men of the land done , which were before you , and the land is defiled ;) 18 : 28 That the land spue not you out also , when ye defile it , as it spued out the nations that were before you .
19 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 19 : 2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say unto them , Ye shall be holy : for I the LORD your God am holy .
19 : 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day , it is abominable ; it shall not be accepted .
19 : 26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood : neither shall ye use enchantment , nor observe times .
19 : 35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment , in meteyard , in weight , or in measure .
20 : 10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man ' s wife , even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour ' s wife , the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death .
20 : 15 And if a man lie with a beast , he shall surely be put to death : and ye shall slay the beast .
20 : 20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle ' s wife , he hath uncovered his uncle ' s nakedness : they shall bear their sin ; they shall die childless .
20 : 26 And ye shall be holy unto me : for I the LORD am holy , and have severed you from other people , that ye should be mine .
21 : 3 And for his sister a virgin , that is nigh unto him , which hath had no husband ; for her may he be defiled .
21 : 10 And he that is the high priest among his brethren , upon whose head the anointing oil was poured , and that is consecrated to put on the garments , shall not uncover his head , nor rend his clothes ; 21 : 11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body , nor defile himself for his father , or for his mother ; 21 : 12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary , nor profane the sanctuary of his God ; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him : I am the LORD .
21 : 14 A widow , or a divorced woman , or profane , or an harlot , these shall he not take : but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife .
21 : 24 And Moses told it unto Aaron , and to his sons , and unto all the children of Israel .
22 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 22 : 2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons , that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel , and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me : I am the LORD .
22 : 3 Say unto them , Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations , that goeth unto the holy things , which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD , having his uncleanness upon him , that soul shall be cut off from my presence : I am the LORD .
22 : 12 If the priest ' s daughter also be married unto a stranger , she may not eat of an offering of the holy things .
22 : 26 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 22 : 27 When a bullock , or a sheep , or a goat , is brought forth , then it shall be seven days under the dam ; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD .
23 : 7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation : ye shall do no servile work therein .
23 : 22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land , thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest , neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest : thou shalt leave them unto the poor , and to the stranger : I am the LORD your God .
23 : 44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD .
24 : 18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good ; beast for beast .
25 : 20 And if ye shall say , What shall we eat the seventh year ?
25 : 38 I am the LORD your God , which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt , to give you the land of Canaan , and to be your God .
25 : 41 And then shall he depart from thee , both he and his children with him , and shall return unto his own family , and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return .
25 : 43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour ; but shalt fear thy God .
25 : 53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him : and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight .
25 : 55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants ; they are my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt : I am the LORD your God .
26 : 8 And five of you shall chase an hundred , and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight : and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword .
26 : 9 For I will have respect unto you , and make you fruitful , and multiply you , and establish my covenant with you .
26 : 14 But if ye will not hearken unto me , and will not do all these commandments ; 26 : 15 And if ye shall despise my statutes , or if your soul abhor my judgments , so that ye will not do all my commandments , but that ye break my covenant : 26 : 16 I also will do this unto you ; I will even appoint over you terror , consumption , and the burning ague , that shall consume the eyes , and cause sorrow of heart : and ye shall sow your seed in vain , for your enemies shall eat it .
26 : 30 And I will destroy your high places , and cut down your images , and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols , and my soul shall abhor you .
26 : 32 And I will bring the land into desolation : and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it .
26 : 35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest ; because it did not rest in your sabbaths , when ye dwelt upon it .
26 : 40 If they shall confess their iniquity , and the iniquity of their fathers , with their trespass which they trespassed against me , and that also they have walked contrary unto me ; 26 : 41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them , and have brought them into the land of their enemies ; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled , and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity : 26 : 42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob , and also my covenant with Isaac , and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember ; and I will remember the land .
26 : 43 The land also shall be left of them , and shall enjoy her sabbaths , while she lieth desolate without them : and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity : because , even because they despised my judgments , and because their soul abhorred my statutes .
27 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 27 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When a man shall make a singular vow , the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation .
27 : 8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation , then he shall present himself before the priest , and the priest shall value him ; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him .
27 : 16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field of his possession , then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof : an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver .

6 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 6 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite , to separate themselves unto the LORD : 6 : 3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink , and shall drink no vinegar of wine , or vinegar of strong drink , neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes , nor eat moist grapes , or dried .
6 : 4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree , from the kernels even to the husk .
6 : 7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father , or for his mother , for his brother , or for his sister , when they die : because the consecration of his God is upon his head .

8 : 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 8 : 6 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel , and cleanse them .
8 : 16 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel ; instead of such as open every womb , even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel , have I taken them unto me .
8 : 20 And Moses , and Aaron , and all the congregation of the children of Israel , did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites , so did the children of Israel unto them .
9 : 6 And there were certain men , who were defiled by the dead body of a man , that they could not keep the passover on that day : and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day : 9 : 7 And those men said unto him , We are defiled by the dead body of a man : wherefore are we kept back , that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel ?
9 : 17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle , then after that the children of Israel journeyed : and in the place where the cloud abode , there the children of Israel pitched their tents .

10 : 27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan .
10 : 32 And it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee .
11 : 2 And the people cried unto Moses ; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD , the fire was quenched .
and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight , that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ?
11 : 29 And Moses said unto him , Enviest thou for my sake ?
11 : 31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD , and brought quails from the sea , and let them fall by the camp , as it were a day ' s journey on this side , and as it were a day ' s journey on the other side , round about the camp , and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth .
11 : 33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth , ere it was chewed , the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people , and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague .
12 : 2 And they said , Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses ?
12 : 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches ; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold : wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ?
13 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 13 : 2 Send thou men , that they may search the land of Canaan , which I give unto the children of Israel : of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man , every one a ruler among them .
13 : 6 Of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
13 : 12 Of the tribe of Dan , Ammiel the son of Gemalli .
13 : 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan , and said unto them , Get you up this way southward , and go up into the mountain : 13 : 18 And see the land , what it is , and the people that dwelleth therein , whether they be strong or weak , few or many ; 13 : 19 And what the land is that they dwell in , whether it be good or bad ; and what cities they be that they dwell in , whether in tents , or in strong holds ; 13 : 20 And what the land is , whether it be fat or lean , whether there be wood therein , or not .
13 : 32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel , saying , The land , through which we have gone to search it , is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof ; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature .
13 : 33 And there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , which come of the giants : and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so we were in their sight .
14 : 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel .
14 : 6 And Joshua the son of Nun , and Caleb the son of Jephunneh , which were of them that searched the land , rent their clothes : 14 : 7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel , saying , The land , which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land .
14 : 22 Because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , and have tempted me now these ten times , and have not hearkened to my voice ; 14 : 23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it : 14 : 24 But my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and hath followed me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he went ; and his seed shall possess it .
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against me .
14 : 33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years , and bear your whoredoms , until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness .
14 : 35 I the LORD have said , I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation , that are gathered together against me : in this wilderness they shall be consumed , and there they shall die .
15 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , and say unto them , When ye be come into the land of your habitations , which I give unto you , 15 : 3 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD , a burnt offering , or a sacrifice in performing a vow , or in a freewill offering , or in your solemn feasts , to make a sweet savour unto the LORD , of the herd or of the flock : 15 : 4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil .
15 : 6 Or for a ram , thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil .
15 : 8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering , or for a sacrifice in performing a vow , or peace offerings unto the LORD : 15 : 9 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil .
15 : 10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine , for an offering made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD .
15 : 37 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 15 : 38 Speak unto the children of Israel , and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations , and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue : 15 : 39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe , that ye may look upon it , and remember all the commandments of the LORD , and do them ; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes , after which ye use to go a whoring : 15 : 40 That ye may remember , and do all my commandments , and be holy unto your God .
15 : 41 I am the LORD your God , which brought you out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : I am the LORD your God .
16 : 4 And when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face : 16 : 5 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company , saying , Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his , and who is holy ; and will cause him to come near unto him : even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him .
16 : 15 And Moses was very wroth , and said unto the LORD , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them .
16 : 18 And they took every man his censer , and put fire in them , and laid incense thereon , and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron .
16 : 22 And they fell upon their faces , and said , O God , the God of the spirits of all flesh , shall one man sin , and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation ?
16 : 25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram ; and the elders of Israel followed him .
16 : 44 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 16 : 45 Get you up from among this congregation , that I may consume them as in a moment .
17 : 7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness .
17 : 10 And the LORD said unto Moses , Bring Aaron ' s rod again before the testimony , to be kept for a token against the rebels ; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me , that they die not .
18 : 3 And they shall keep thy charge , and the charge of all the tabernacle : only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar , that neither they , nor ye also , die .
18 : 4 And they shall be joined unto thee , and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation , for all the service of the tabernacle : and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you .
18 : 9 This shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of theirs , every meat offering of theirs , and every sin offering of theirs , and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons .
18 : 17 But the firstling of a cow , or the firstling of a sheep , or the firstling of a goat , thou shalt not redeem ; they are holy : thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar , and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire , for a sweet savour unto the LORD .
18 : 22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation , lest they bear sin , and die .
18 : 23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation , and they shall bear their iniquity : it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations , that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance .
18 : 30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them , When ye have heaved the best thereof from it , then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor , and as the increase of the winepress .
19 : 12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day , and on the seventh day he shall be clean : but if he purify not himself the third day , then the seventh day he shall not be clean .
20 : 12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron , Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them .
20 : 20 And he said , Thou shalt not go through .
And Edom came out against him with much people , and with a strong hand .
20 : 27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded : and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation .
21 : 5 And the people spake against God , and against Moses , Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness ?
21 : 12 From thence they removed , and pitched in the valley of Zared .
21 : 30 We have shot at them ; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon , and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah , which reacheth unto Medeba .
21 : 31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites .
21 : 33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan : and Og the king of Bashan went out against them , he , and all his people , to the battle at Edrei .
22 : 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites .
22 : 4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian , Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us , as the ox licketh up the grass of the field .
22 : 18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak , If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God , to do less or more .
22 : 19 Now therefore , I pray you , tarry ye also here this night , that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more .
22 : 22 And God ' s anger was kindled because he went : and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him .
Now he was riding upon his ass , and his two servants were with him .
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak .
22 : 37 And Balak said unto Balaam , Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee ?
And he went to an high place .
23 : 7 And he took up his parable , and said , Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram , out of the mountains of the east , saying , Come , curse me Jacob , and come , defy Israel .
23 : 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob , and the number of the fourth part of Israel ?
23 : 13 And Balak said unto him , Come , I pray thee , with me unto another place , from whence thou mayest see them : thou shalt see but the utmost part of them , and shalt not see them all : and curse me them from thence .
23 : 17 And when he came to him , behold , he stood by his burnt offering , and the princes of Moab with him .
or hath he spoken , and shall he not make it good ?
23 : 29 And Balaam said unto Balak , Build me here seven altars , and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams .
24 : 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes , and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes ; and the spirit of God came upon him .
24 : 12 And Balaam said unto Balak , Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me , saying , 24 : 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold , I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD , to do either good or bad of mine own mind ; but what the LORD saith , that will I speak ?
24 : 20 And when he looked on Amalek , he took up his parable , and said , Amalek was the first of the nations ; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever .
24 : 25 And Balaam rose up , and went and returned to his place : and Balak also went his way .
25 : 5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel , Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor .
25 : 6 And , behold , one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses , and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel , who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation .
25 : 12 Wherefore say , Behold , I give unto him my covenant of peace : 25 : 13 And he shall have it , and his seed after him , even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood ; because he was zealous for his God , and made an atonement for the children of Israel .
25 : 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain , even that was slain with the Midianitish woman , was Zimri , the son of Salu , a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites .
26 : 11 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not .
26 : 18 These are the families of the children of Gad according to those that were numbered of them , forty thousand and five hundred .

26 : 58 These are the families of the Levites : the family of the Libnites , the family of the Hebronites , the family of the Mahlites , the family of the Mushites , the family of the Korathites .
27 : 22 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him : and he took Joshua , and set him before Eleazar the priest , and before all the congregation : 27 : 23 And he laid his hands upon him , and gave him a charge , as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses .
28 : 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 28 : 2 Command the children of Israel , and say unto them , My offering , and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire , for a sweet savour unto me , shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season .
28 : 11 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD ; two young bullocks , and one ram , seven lambs of the first year without spot ; 28 : 12 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one bullock ; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering , mingled with oil , for one ram ; 28 : 13 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb ; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour , a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD .
28 : 14 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock , and the third part of an hin unto a ram , and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb : this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year .
28 : 24 After this manner ye shall offer daily , throughout the seven days , the meat of the sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD : it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering , and his drink offering .
29 : 1 And in the seventh month , on the first day of the month , ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work : it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you .
29 : 12 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an holy convocation ; ye shall do no servile work , and ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days : 29 : 13 And ye shall offer a burnt offering , a sacrifice made by fire , of a sweet savour unto the LORD ; thirteen young bullocks , two rams , and fourteen lambs of the first year ; they shall be without blemish : 29 : 14 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil , three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks , two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams , 29 : 15 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs : 29 : 16 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering ; beside the continual burnt offering , his meat offering , and his drink offering .
30 : 3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD , and bind herself by a bond , being in her father ' s house in her youth ; 30 : 4 And her father hear her vow , and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul , and her father shall hold his peace at her ; then all her vows shall stand , and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand .
31 : 7 And they warred against the Midianites , as the LORD commanded Moses ; and they slew all the males .
31 : 8 And they slew the kings of Midian , beside the rest of them that were slain ; namely , Evi , and Rekem , and Zur , and Hur , and Reba , five kings of Midian : Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword .
31 : 9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives , and their little ones , and took the spoil of all their cattle , and all their flocks , and all their goods .
31 : 15 And Moses said unto them , Have ye saved all the women alive ?
31 : 21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle , This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses ; 31 : 22 Only the gold , and the silver , the brass , the iron , the tin , and the lead , 31 : 23 Every thing that may abide the fire , ye shall make it go through the fire , and it shall be clean : nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation : and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water .
31 : 38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand ; of which the LORD ' s tribute was threescore and twelve .
31 : 40 And the persons were sixteen thousand ; of which the LORD ' s tribute was thirty and two persons .
31 : 48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host , the captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds , came near unto Moses : 31 : 49 And they said unto Moses , Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge , and there lacketh not one man of us .
32 : 26 Our little ones , our wives , our flocks , and all our cattle , shall be there in the cities of Gilead : 32 : 27 But thy servants will pass over , every man armed for war , before the LORD to battle , as my lord saith .
32 : 42 And Nobah went and took Kenath , and the villages thereof , and called it Nobah , after his own name .
33 : 8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth , and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness , and went three days ' journey in the wilderness of Etham , and pitched in Marah .
33 : 23 And they went from Kehelathah , and pitched in mount Shapher .
33 : 33 And they went from Horhagidgad , and pitched in Jotbathah .
33 : 38 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD , and died there , in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the first day of the fifth month .
33 : 43 And they departed from Punon , and pitched in Oboth .
33 : 44 And they departed from Oboth , and pitched in Ijeabarim , in the border of Moab .
34 : 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses , saying , 34 : 17 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you : Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun .
34 : 19 And the names of the men are these : Of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son of Jephunneh .
34 : 29 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan .
35 : 29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings .
36 : 3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel , then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers , and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received : so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance .
36 : 6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad , saying , Let them marry to whom they think best ; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry .
36 : 9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe ; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance .
1 : 2 ( There are eleven days ' journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea .
) 1 : 3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year , in the eleventh month , on the first day of the month , that Moses spake unto the children of Israel , according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them ; 1 : 4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites , which dwelt in Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei : 1 : 5 On this side Jordan , in the land of Moab , began Moses to declare this law , saying , 1 : 6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb , saying , Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount : 1 : 7 Turn you , and take your journey , and go to the mount of the Amorites , and unto all the places nigh thereunto , in the plain , in the hills , and in the vale , and in the south , and by the sea side , to the land of the Canaanites , and unto Lebanon , unto the great river , the river Euphrates .
1 : 15 So I took the chief of your tribes , wise men , and known , and made them heads over you , captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , and captains over fifties , and captains over tens , and officers among your tribes .
1 : 22 And ye came near unto me every one of you , and said , We will send men before us , and they shall search us out the land , and bring us word again by what way we must go up , and into what cities we shall come .
1 : 30 The LORD your God which goeth before you , he shall fight for you , according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes ; 1 : 31 And in the wilderness , where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee , as a man doth bear his son , in all the way that ye went , until ye came into this place .
2 : 6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money , that ye may eat ; and ye shall also buy water of them for money , that ye may drink .
2 : 12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime ; but the children of Esau succeeded them , when they had destroyed them from before them , and dwelt in their stead ; as Israel did unto the land of his possession , which the LORD gave unto them .
2 : 13 Now rise up , said I , and get you over the brook Zered .
2 : 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him : for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit , and made his heart obstinate , that he might deliver him into thy hand , as appeareth this day .
2 : 33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us ; and we smote him , and his sons , and all his people .
3 : 8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan , from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon ; 3 : 9 ( Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion ; and the Amorites call it Shenir ;) 3 : 10 All the cities of the plain , and all Gilead , and all Bashan , unto Salchah and Edrei , cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan .
3 : 22 Ye shall not fear them : for the LORD your God he shall fight for you .
3 : 23 And I besought the LORD at that time , saying , 3 : 24 O Lord GOD , thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness , and thy mighty hand : for what God is there in heaven or in earth , that can do according to thy works , and according to thy might ?
3 : 29 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor .
4 : 5 Behold , I have taught you statutes and judgments , even as the LORD my God commanded me , that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it .
4 : 15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves ; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire : 4 : 16 Lest ye corrupt yourselves , and make you a graven image , the similitude of any figure , the likeness of male or female , 4 : 17 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth , the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air , 4 : 18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground , the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth : 4 : 19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun , and the moon , and the stars , even all the host of heaven , shouldest be driven to worship them , and serve them , which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven .
4 : 24 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire , even a jealous God .
4 : 25 When thou shalt beget children , and children ' s children , and ye shall have remained long in the land , and shall corrupt yourselves , and make a graven image , or the likeness of any thing , and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God , to provoke him to anger : 4 : 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day , that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it ; ye shall not prolong your days upon it , but shall utterly be destroyed .
4 : 39 Know therefore this day , and consider it in thine heart , that the LORD he is God in heaven above , and upon the earth beneath : there is none else .
4 : 40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes , and his commandments , which I command thee this day , that it may go well with thee , and with thy children after thee , and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth , which the LORD thy God giveth thee , for ever .
4 : 41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising ; 4 : 42 That the slayer might flee thither , which should kill his neighbour unawares , and hated him not in times past ; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live : 4 : 43 Namely , Bezer in the wilderness , in the plain country , of the Reubenites ; and Ramoth in Gilead , of the Gadites ; and Golan in Bashan , of the Manassites .
5 : 20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour .
5 : 21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour ' s wife , neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour ' s house , his field , or his manservant , or his maidservant , his ox , or his ass , or any thing that is thy neighbour ' s .
5 : 22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire , of the cloud , and of the thick darkness , with a great voice : and he added no more .
5 : 30 Go say to them , Get you into your tents again .
5 : 33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you , that ye may live , and that it may be well with you , and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess .
6 : 1 Now these are the commandments , the statutes , and the judgments , which the LORD your God commanded to teach you , that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it : 6 : 2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God , to keep all his statutes and his commandments , which I command thee , thou , and thy son , and thy son ' s son , all the days of thy life ; and that thy days may be prolonged .
6 : 25 And it shall be our righteousness , if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God , as he hath commanded us .
8 : 6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , and to fear him .
8 : 11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God , in not keeping his commandments , and his judgments , and his statutes , which I command thee this day : 8 : 12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full , and hast built goodly houses , and dwelt therein ; 8 : 13 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply , and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied , and all that thou hast is multiplied ; 8 : 14 Then thine heart be lifted up , and thou forget the LORD thy God , which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt , from the house of bondage ; 8 : 15 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness , wherein were fiery serpents , and scorpions , and drought , where there was no water ; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint ; 8 : 16 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna , which thy fathers knew not , that he might humble thee , and that he might prove thee , to do thee good at thy latter end ; 8 : 17 And thou say in thine heart , My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth .
9 : 3 Understand therefore this day , that the LORD thy God is he which goeth over before thee ; as a consuming fire he shall destroy them , and he shall bring them down before thy face : so shalt thou drive them out , and destroy them quickly , as the LORD hath said unto thee .
9 : 12 And the LORD said unto me , Arise , get thee down quickly from hence ; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves ; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them ; they have made them a molten image .
9 : 19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure , wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you .
9 : 20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him : and I prayed for Aaron also the same time .
9 : 29 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance , which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm .
10 : 6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera : there Aaron died , and there he was buried ; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest ' s office in his stead .
10 : 11 And the LORD said unto me , Arise , take thy journey before the people , that they may go in and possess the land , which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them .
10 : 12 And now , Israel , what doth the LORD thy God require of thee , but to fear the LORD thy God , to walk in all his ways , and to love him , and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul , 10 : 13 To keep the commandments of the LORD , and his statutes , which I command thee this day for thy good ?
11 : 10 For the land , whither thou goest in to possess it , is not as the land of Egypt , from whence ye came out , where thou sowedst thy seed , and wateredst it with thy foot , as a garden of herbs : 11 : 11 But the land , whither ye go to possess it , is a land of hills and valleys , and drinketh water of the rain of heaven : 11 : 12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for : the eyes of the LORD thy God are always upon it , from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year .
11 : 15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle , that thou mayest eat and be full .
12 : 15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates , whatsoever thy soul lusteth after , according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee : the unclean and the clean may eat thereof , as of the roebuck , and as of the hart .
12 : 16 Only ye shall not eat the blood ; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water .
12 : 23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood : for the blood is the life ; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh .
12 : 26 Only thy holy things which thou hast , and thy vows , thou shalt take , and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose : 12 : 27 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings , the flesh and the blood , upon the altar of the LORD thy God : and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God , and thou shalt eat the flesh .
14 : 9 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters : all that have fins and scales shall ye eat : 14 : 10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat ; it is unclean unto you .
14 : 21 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself : thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates , that he may eat it ; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien : for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God .
Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother ' s milk .
15 : 2 And this is the manner of the release : Every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it ; he shall not exact it of his neighbour , or of his brother ; because it is called the LORD ' s release .
16 : 3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it ; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith , even the bread of affliction ; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste : that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life .
17 : 14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee , and shalt possess it , and shalt dwell therein , and shalt say , I will set a king over me , like as all the nations that are about me ; 17 : 15 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee , whom the LORD thy God shall choose : one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee : thou mayest not set a stranger over thee , which is not thy brother .
17 : 16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself , nor cause the people to return to Egypt , to the end that he should multiply horses : forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you , Ye shall henceforth return no more that way .
18 : 5 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes , to stand to minister in the name of the LORD , him and his sons for ever .
18 : 10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire , or that useth divination , or an observer of times , or an enchanter , or a witch .
18 : 14 For these nations , which thou shalt possess , hearkened unto observers of times , and unto diviners : but as for thee , the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do .
19 : 7 Wherefore I command thee , saying , Thou shalt separate three cities for thee .
19 : 8 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast , as he hath sworn unto thy fathers , and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers ; 19 : 9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them , which I command thee this day , to love the LORD thy God , and to walk ever in his ways ; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee , beside these three : 19 : 10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance , and so blood be upon thee .
20 : 12 And if it will make no peace with thee , but will make war against thee , then thou shalt besiege it : 20 : 13 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands , thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword : 20 : 14 But the women , and the little ones , and the cattle , and all that is in the city , even all the spoil thereof , shalt thou take unto thyself ; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies , which the LORD thy God hath given thee .
20 : 15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee , which are not of the cities of these nations .
21 : 8 Be merciful , O LORD , unto thy people Israel , whom thou hast redeemed , and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel ' s charge .
22 : 25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field , and the man force her , and lie with her : then the man only that lay with her shall die .
23 : 1 He that is wounded in the stones , or hath his privy member cut off , shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD .
23 : 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel , nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel .
23 : 19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother ; usury of money , usury of victuals , usury of any thing that is lent upon usury : 23 : 20 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury ; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury : that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it .
24 : 3 And if the latter husband hate her , and write her a bill of divorcement , and giveth it in her hand , and sendeth her out of his house ; or if the latter husband die , which took her to be his wife ; 24 : 4 Her former husband , which sent her away , may not take her again to be his wife , after that she is defiled ; for that is abomination before the LORD : and thou shalt not cause the land to sin , which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance .
24 : 7 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel , and maketh merchandise of him , or selleth him ; then that thief shall die ; and thou shalt put evil away from among you .
24 : 21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard , thou shalt not glean it afterward : it shall be for the stranger , for the fatherless , and for the widow .
25 : 3 Forty stripes he may give him , and not exceed : lest , if he should exceed , and beat him above these with many stripes , then thy brother should seem vile unto thee .
25 : 8 Then the elders of his city shall call him , and speak unto him : and if he stand to it , and say , I like not to take her ; 25 : 9 Then shall his brother ' s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders , and loose his shoe from off his foot , and spit in his face , and shall answer and say , So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother ' s house .
25 : 15 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight , a perfect and just measure shalt thou have : that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee .
26 : 5 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God , A Syrian ready to perish was my father , and he went down into Egypt , and sojourned there with a few , and became there a nation , great , mighty , and populous : 26 : 6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us , and afflicted us , and laid upon us hard bondage : 26 : 7 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers , the LORD heard our voice , and looked on our affliction , and our labour , and our oppression : 26 : 8 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand , and with an outstretched arm , and with great terribleness , and with signs , and with wonders : 26 : 9 And he hath brought us into this place , and hath given us this land , even a land that floweth with milk and honey .
27 : 4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan , that ye shall set up these stones , which I command you this day , in mount Ebal , and thou shalt plaister them with plaister .
27 : 6 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones : and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God : 27 : 7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings , and shalt eat there , and rejoice before the LORD thy God .
27 : 11 And Moses charged the people the same day , saying , 27 : 12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people , when ye are come over Jordan ; Simeon , and Levi , and Judah , and Issachar , and Joseph , and Benjamin : 27 : 13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse ; Reuben , Gad , and Asher , and Zebulun , Dan , and Naphtali .
And all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
27 : 25 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person .
28 : 1 And it shall come to pass , if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the LORD thy God , to observe and to do all his commandments which I command thee this day , that the LORD thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth : 28 : 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee , and overtake thee , if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God .
28 : 24 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust : from heaven shall it come down upon thee , until thou be destroyed .
28 : 31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes , and thou shalt not eat thereof : thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face , and shall not be restored to thee : thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies , and thou shalt have none to rescue them .
28 : 33 The fruit of thy land , and all thy labours , shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up ; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway : 28 : 34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
28 : 41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters , but thou shalt not enjoy them ; for they shall go into captivity .
28 : 65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease , neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest : but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart , and failing of eyes , and sorrow of mind : 28 : 66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee ; and thou shalt fear day and night , and shalt have none assurance of thy life : 28 : 67 In the morning thou shalt say , Would God it were even !
for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear , and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see .
28 : 68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships , by the way whereof I spake unto thee , Thou shalt see it no more again : and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen , and no man shall buy you .
29 : 7 And when ye came unto this place , Sihon the king of Heshbon , and Og the king of Bashan , came out against us unto battle , and we smote them : 29 : 8 And we took their land , and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites , and to the Gadites , and to the half tribe of Manasseh .
30 : 13 Neither is it beyond the sea , that thou shouldest say , Who shall go over the sea for us , and bring it unto us , that we may hear it , and do it ?
31 : 3 The LORD thy God , he will go over before thee , and he will destroy these nations from before thee , and thou shalt possess them : and Joshua , he shall go over before thee , as the LORD hath said .
31 : 14 And the LORD said unto Moses , Behold , thy days approach that thou must die : call Joshua , and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation , that I may give him a charge .
And Moses and Joshua went , and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation .
31 : 29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves , and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you ; and evil will befall you in the latter days ; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD , to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands .
32 : 6 Do ye thus requite the LORD , O foolish people and unwise ?
is not he thy father that hath bought thee ?
32 : 10 He found him in a desert land , and in the waste howling wilderness ; he led him about , he instructed him , he kept him as the apple of his eye .
32 : 20 And he said , I will hide my face from them , I will see what their end shall be : for they are a very froward generation , children in whom is no faith .
32 : 22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger , and shall burn unto the lowest hell , and shall consume the earth with her increase , and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .
32 : 32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom , and of the fields of Gomorrah : their grapes are grapes of gall , their clusters are bitter : 32 : 33 Their wine is the poison of dragons , and the cruel venom of asps .
32 : 37 And he shall say , Where are their gods , their rock in whom they trusted , 32 : 38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices , and drank the wine of their drink offerings ?
32 : 47 For it is not a vain thing for you ; because it is your life : and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land , whither ye go over Jordan to possess it .
33 : 3 Yea , he loved the people ; all his saints are in thy hand : and they sat down at thy feet ; every one shall receive of thy words .
33 : 7 And this is the blessing of Judah : and he said , Hear , LORD , the voice of Judah , and bring him unto his people : let his hands be sufficient for him ; and be thou an help to him from his enemies .
33 : 10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments , and Israel thy law : they shall put incense before thee , and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar .
33 : 12 And of Benjamin he said , The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him ; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long , and he shall dwell between his shoulders .
33 : 25 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass ; and as thy days , so shall thy strength be .
33 : 26 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun , who rideth upon the heaven in thy help , and in his excellency on the sky .
3 : 5 And Joshua said unto the people , Sanctify yourselves : for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you .
3 : 12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel , out of every tribe a man .
3 : 13 And it shall come to pass , as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD , the LORD of all the earth , shall rest in the waters of Jordan , that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above ; and they shall stand upon an heap .
4 : 1 And it came to pass , when all the people were clean passed over Jordan , that the LORD spake unto Joshua , saying , 4 : 2 Take you twelve men out of the people , out of every tribe a man , 4 : 3 And command ye them , saying , Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan , out of the place where the priests ' feet stood firm , twelve stones , and ye shall carry them over with you , and leave them in the lodging place , where ye shall lodge this night .
4 : 14 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel ; and they feared him , as they feared Moses , all the days of his life .
4 : 17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests , saying , Come ye up out of Jordan .
4 : 21 And he spake unto the children of Israel , saying , When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come , saying , What mean these stones ?
4 : 22 Then ye shall let your children know , saying , Israel came over this Jordan on dry land .
5 : 1 And it came to pass , when all the kings of the Amorites , which were on the side of Jordan westward , and all the kings of the Canaanites , which were by the sea , heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel , until we were passed over , that their heart melted , neither was there spirit in them any more , because of the children of Israel .
5 : 10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal , and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho .
5 : 12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land ; neither had the children of Israel manna any more ; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year .
6 : 5 And it shall come to pass , that when they make a long blast with the ram ' s horn , and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet , all the people shall shout with a great shout ; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat , and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him .
6 : 23 And the young men that were spies went in , and brought out Rahab , and her father , and her mother , and her brethren , and all that she had ; and they brought out all her kindred , and left them without the camp of Israel .
7 : 11 Israel hath sinned , and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them : for they have even taken of the accursed thing , and have also stolen , and dissembled also , and they have put it even among their own stuff .
7 : 24 And Joshua , and all Israel with him , took Achan the son of Zerah , and the silver , and the garment , and the wedge of gold , and his sons , and his daughters , and his oxen , and his asses , and his sheep , and his tent , and all that he had : and they brought them unto the valley of Achor .
7 : 25 And Joshua said , Why hast thou troubled us ?
8 : 9 Joshua therefore sent them forth : and they went to lie in ambush , and abode between Bethel and Ai , on the west side of Ai : but Joshua lodged that night among the people .
and from whence come ye ?
9 : 12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you ; but now , behold , it is dry , and it is mouldy : 9 : 13 And these bottles of wine , which we filled , were new ; and , behold , they be rent : and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey .
Now their cities were Gibeon , and Chephirah , and Beeroth , and Kirjathjearim .
9 : 19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation , We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel : now therefore we may not touch them .
10 : 36 And Joshua went up from Eglon , and all Israel with him , unto Hebron ; and they fought against it : 10 : 37 And they took it , and smote it with the edge of the sword , and the king thereof , and all the cities thereof , and all the souls that were therein ; he left none remaining , according to all that he had done to Eglon ; but destroyed it utterly , and all the souls that were therein .
11 : 1 And it came to pass , when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things , that he sent to Jobab king of Madon , and to the king of Shimron , and to the king of Achshaph , 11 : 2 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains , and of the plains south of Chinneroth , and in the valley , and in the borders of Dor on the west , 11 : 3 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west , and to the Amorite , and the Hittite , and the Perizzite , and the Jebusite in the mountains , and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh .
11 : 7 So Joshua came , and all the people of war with him , against them by the waters of Merom suddenly ; and they fell upon them .
11 : 20 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts , that they should come against Israel in battle , that he might destroy them utterly , and that they might have no favour , but that he might destroy them , as the LORD commanded Moses .
And the land rested from war .
14 : 1 And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan , which Eleazar the priest , and Joshua the son of Nun , and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel , distributed for inheritance to them .
14 : 4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes , Manasseh and Ephraim : therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land , save cities to dwell in , with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance .
14 : 6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal : and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him , Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea .
14 : 7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land ; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart .
14 : 14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day , because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel .
14 : 15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba ; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims .
15 : 2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea , from the bay that looketh southward : 15 : 3 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim , and passed along to Zin , and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea , and passed along to Hezron , and went up to Adar , and fetched a compass to Karkaa : 15 : 4 From thence it passed toward Azmon , and went out unto the river of Egypt ; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea : this shall be your south coast .
15 : 63 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem , the children of Judah could not drive them out ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day .
17 : 13 Yet it came to pass , when the children of Israel were waxen strong , that they put the Canaanites to tribute , but did not utterly drive them out .
17 : 16 And the children of Joseph said , The hill is not enough for us : and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron , both they who are of Bethshean and her towns , and they who are of the valley of Jezreel .
18 : 2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes , which had not yet received their inheritance .
18 : 3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel , How long are ye slack to go to possess the land , which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you ?
19 : 23 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families , the cities and their villages .
19 : 39 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families , the cities and their villages .
19 : 48 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families , these cities with their villages .
21 : 6 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar , and out of the tribe of Asher , and out of the tribe of Naphtali , and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan , thirteen cities .
21 : 10 Which the children of Aaron , being of the families of the Kohathites , who were of the children of Levi , had : for theirs was the first lot .
21 : 17 And out of the tribe of Benjamin , Gibeon with her suburbs , Geba with her suburbs , 21 : 18 Anathoth with her suburbs , and Almon with her suburbs ; four cities .
21 : 19 All the cities of the children of Aaron , the priests , were thirteen cities with their suburbs .
21 : 21 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim , to be a city of refuge for the slayer ; and Gezer with her suburbs , 21 : 22 And Kibzaim with her suburbs , and Bethhoron with her suburbs ; four cities .
22 : 12 And when the children of Israel heard of it , the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh , to go up to war against them .
22 : 34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed : for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God .
23 : 12 Else if ye do in any wise go back , and cleave unto the remnant of these nations , even these that remain among you , and shall make marriages with them , and go in unto them , and they to you : 23 : 13 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you ; but they shall be snares and traps unto you , and scourges in your sides , and thorns in your eyes , until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you .
24 : 6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt : and ye came unto the sea ; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea .
24 : 8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites , which dwelt on the other side Jordan ; and they fought with you : and I gave them into your hand , that ye might possess their land ; and I destroyed them from before you .
And they said , We are witnesses .
24 : 23 Now therefore put away , said he , the strange gods which are among you , and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel .
24 : 27 And Joshua said unto all the people , Behold , this stone shall be a witness unto us ; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us : it shall be therefore a witness unto you , lest ye deny your God .
24 : 33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died ; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son , which was given him in mount Ephraim .
And the name of the city was called Hormah .
1 : 19 And the LORD was with Judah ; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain ; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley , because they had chariots of iron .
1 : 21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem ; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day .
2 : 8 And Joshua the son of Nun , the servant of the LORD , died , being an hundred and ten years old .
3 : 11 And the land had rest forty years .
3 : 12 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD : and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel , because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD .
3 : 13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek , and went and smote Israel , and possessed the city of palm trees .
And all that stood by him went out from him .
And the land had rest fourscore years .
4 : 3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD : for he had nine hundred chariots of iron ; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel .
4 : 4 And Deborah , a prophetess , the wife of Lapidoth , she judged Israel at that time .
4 : 9 And she said , I will surely go with thee : notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour ; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman .
4 : 14 And Deborah said unto Barak , Up ; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand : is not the LORD gone out before thee ?
4 : 24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered , and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan , until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan .
5 : 1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day , saying , 5 : 2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel , when the people willingly offered themselves .
5 : 5 The mountains melted from before the LORD , even that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel .
5 : 10 Speak , ye that ride on white asses , ye that sit in judgment , and walk by the way .
5 : 17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan : and why did Dan remain in ships ?
5 : 20 They fought from heaven ; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera .
5 : 22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings , the pransings of their mighty ones .
5 : 25 He asked water , and she gave him milk ; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish .
5 : 28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window , and cried through the lattice , Why is his chariot so long in coming ?
5 : 31 So let all thine enemies perish , O LORD : but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might .
but now the LORD hath forsaken us , and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites .
And he said , I will tarry until thou come again .
6 : 20 And the angel of God said unto him , Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes , and lay them upon this rock , and pour out the broth .
6 : 21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand , and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes ; and there rose up fire out of the rock , and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes .
for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face .
6 : 27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants , and did as the LORD had said unto him : and so it was , because he feared his father ' s household , and the men of the city , that he could not do it by day , that he did it by night .
6 : 31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him , Will ye plead for Baal ?
7 : 3 Now therefore go to , proclaim in the ears of the people , saying , Whosoever is fearful and afraid , let him return and depart early from mount Gilead .
7 : 13 And when Gideon was come , behold , there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow , and said , Behold , I dreamed a dream , and , lo , a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian , and came unto a tent , and smote it that it fell , and overturned it , that the tent lay along .
7 : 16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies , and he put a trumpet in every man ' s hand , with empty pitchers , and lamps within the pitchers .
7 : 22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets , and the LORD set every man ' s sword against his fellow , even throughout all the host : and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath , and to the border of Abelmeholah , unto Tabbath .
7 : 25 And they took two princes of the Midianites , Oreb and Zeeb ; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb , and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb , and pursued Midian , and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan .
Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer ?
8 : 11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah , and smote the host ; for the host was secure .
8 : 18 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna , What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ?
8 : 19 And he said , They were my brethren , even the sons of my mother : as the LORD liveth , if ye had saved them alive , I would not slay you .
But the youth drew not his sword : for he feared , because he was yet a youth .
And Gideon arose , and slew Zebah and Zalmunna , and took away the ornaments that were on their camels ' necks .
) 8 : 25 And they answered , We will willingly give them .
9 : 1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother ' s brethren , and communed with them , and with all the family of the house of his mother ' s father , saying , 9 : 2 Speak , I pray you , in the ears of all the men of Shechem , Whether is better for you , either that all the sons of Jerubbaal , which are threescore and ten persons , reign over you , or that one reign over you ?
remember also that I am your bone and your flesh .
9 : 13 And the vine said unto them , Should I leave my wine , which cheereth God and man , and go to be promoted over the trees ?
9 : 25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains , and they robbed all that came along that way by them : and it was told Abimelech .
is not he the son of Jerubbaal ?
And he said to Abimelech , Increase thine army , and come out .
go out , I pray now , and fight with them .
10 : 5 And Jair died , and was buried in Camon .
and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress ?
11 : 9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead , If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon , and the LORD deliver them before me , shall I be your head ?
11 : 11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead , and the people made him head and captain over them : and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh .
And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab : but he would not consent : and Israel abode in Kadesh .
11 : 18 Then they went along through the wilderness , and compassed the land of Edom , and the land of Moab , and came by the east side of the land of Moab , and pitched on the other side of Arnon , but came not within the border of Moab : for Arnon was the border of Moab .
11 : 34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house , and , behold , his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances : and she was his only child ; beside her he had neither son nor daughter .
And it was a custom in Israel , 11 : 40 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year .
12 : 3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not , I put my life in my hands , and passed over against the children of Ammon , and the LORD delivered them into my hand : wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day , to fight against me ?
Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD .
13 : 25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol .
14 : 11 And it came to pass , when they saw him , that they brought thirty companions to be with him .
14 : 14 And he said unto them , Out of the eater came forth meat , and out of the strong came forth sweetness .
14 : 19 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him , and he went down to Ashkelon , and slew thirty men of them , and took their spoil , and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle .
15 : 1 But it came to pass within a while after , in the time of wheat harvest , that Samson visited his wife with a kid ; and he said , I will go in to my wife into the chamber .
15 : 3 And Samson said concerning them , Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines , though I do them a displeasure .
15 : 11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam , and said to Samson , Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us ?
15 : 15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass , and put forth his hand , and took it , and slew a thousand men therewith .
16 : 10 And Delilah said unto Samson , Behold , thou hast mocked me , and told me lies : now tell me , I pray thee , wherewith thou mightest be bound .
16 : 12 Delilah therefore took new ropes , and bound him therewith , and said unto him , The Philistines be upon thee , Samson .
And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber .
16 : 24 And when the people saw him , they praised their god : for they said , Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy , and the destroyer of our country , which slew many of us .
16 : 27 Now the house was full of men and women ; and all the lords of the Philistines were there ; and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women , that beheld while Samson made sport .
16 : 28 And Samson called unto the LORD , and said , O Lord God , remember me , I pray thee , and strengthen me , I pray thee , only this once , O God , that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes .
16 : 29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood , and on which it was borne up , of the one with his right hand , and of the other with his left .
16 : 31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down , and took him , and brought him up , and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father .
17 : 2 And he said unto his mother , The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee , about which thou cursedst , and spakest of also in mine ears , behold , the silver is with me ; I took it .
17 : 12 And Micah consecrated the Levite ; and the young man became his priest , and was in the house of Micah .
18 : 1 In those days there was no king in Israel : and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in ; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel .
18 : 12 And they went up , and pitched in Kirjathjearim , in Judah : wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day : behold , it is behind Kirjathjearim .
18 : 18 And these went into Micah ' s house , and fetched the carved image , the ephod , and the teraphim , and the molten image .
And they built a city , and dwelt therein .
19 : 10 But the man would not tarry that night , but he rose up and departed , and came over against Jebus , which is Jerusalem ; and there were with him two asses saddled , his concubine also was with him .
Then the man took her up upon an ass , and the man rose up , and gat him unto his place .
19 : 30 And it was so , that all that saw it said , There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day : consider of it , take advice , and speak your minds .
20 : 3 ( Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh .
) Then said the children of Israel , Tell us , how was this wickedness ?
20 : 12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin , saying , What wickedness is this that is done among you ?
And the LORD said , Judah shall go up first .
20 : 20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin ; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah .
21 : 8 And they said , What one is there of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD ?
21 : 10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest , and commanded them , saying , Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword , with the women and the children .
21 : 11 And this is the thing that ye shall do , Ye shall utterly destroy every male , and every woman that hath lain by man .
21 : 20 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin , saying , Go and lie in wait in the vineyards ; 21 : 21 And see , and , behold , if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances , then come ye out of the vineyards , and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh , and go to the land of Benjamin .
1 : 3 And Elimelech Naomi ' s husband died ; and she was left , and her two sons .
1 : 5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them ; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband .
1 : 10 And they said unto her , Surely we will return with thee unto thy people .
1 : 21 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty : why then call ye me Naomi , seeing the LORD hath testified against me , and the Almighty hath afflicted me ?
2 : 15 And when she was risen up to glean , Boaz commanded his young men , saying , Let her glean even among the sheaves , and reproach her not : 2 : 16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her , and leave them , that she may glean them , and rebuke her not .
and where wroughtest thou ?
2 : 21 And Ruth the Moabitess said , He said unto me also , Thou shalt keep fast by my young men , until they have ended all my harvest .
2 : 22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law , It is good , my daughter , that thou go out with his maidens , that they meet thee not in any other field .
3 : 2 And now is not Boaz of our kindred , with whose maidens thou wast ?
3 : 8 And it came to pass at midnight , that the man was afraid , and turned himself : and , behold , a woman lay at his feet .
And they sat down .
4 : 7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing , for to confirm all things ; a man plucked off his shoe , and gave it to his neighbour : and this was a testimony in Israel .
1 : 3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh .
put away thy wine from thee .
1 : 24 And when she had weaned him , she took him up with her , with three bullocks , and one ephah of flour , and a bottle of wine , and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh : and the child was young .
1 : 26 And she said , Oh my lord , as thy soul liveth , my lord , I am the woman that stood by thee here , praying unto the LORD .
2 : 6 The LORD killeth , and maketh alive : he bringeth down to the grave , and bringeth up .
2 : 16 And if any man said unto him , Let them not fail to burn the fat presently , and then take as much as thy soul desireth ; then he would answer him , Nay ; but thou shalt give it me now : and if not , I will take it by force .
2 : 17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD : for men abhorred the offering of the LORD .
2 : 18 But Samuel ministered before the LORD , being a child , girded with a linen ephod .
2 : 19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat , and brought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice .
2 : 25 If one man sin against another , the judge shall judge him : but if a man sin against the LORD , who shall intreat for him ?
2 : 30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith , I said indeed that thy house , and the house of thy father , should walk before me for ever : but now the LORD saith , Be it far from me ; for them that honour me I will honour , and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed .
2 : 34 And this shall be a sign unto thee , that shall come upon thy two sons , on Hophni and Phinehas ; in one day they shall die both of them .
3 : 10 And the LORD came , and stood , and called as at other times , Samuel , Samuel .
4 : 10 And the Philistines fought , and Israel was smitten , and they fled every man into his tent : and there was a very great slaughter ; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen .
4 : 13 And when he came , lo , Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching : for his heart trembled for the ark of God .
5 : 4 And when they arose early on the morrow morning , behold , Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD ; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold ; only the stump of Dagon was left to him .
5 : 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon , nor any that come into Dagon ' s house , tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day .
And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither .
6 : 3 And they said , If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel , send it not empty ; but in any wise return him a trespass offering : then ye shall be healed , and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you .
They answered , Five golden emerods , and five golden mice , according to the number of the lords of the Philistines : for one plague was on you all , and on your lords .
6 : 16 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it , they returned to Ekron the same day .
6 : 21 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim , saying , The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD ; come ye down , and fetch it up to you .
7 : 10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering , the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel : but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines , and discomfited them ; and they were smitten before Israel .
7 : 13 So the Philistines were subdued , and they came no more into the coast of Israel : and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel .
8 : 22 And the LORD said to Samuel , Hearken unto their voice , and make them a king .
9 : 1 Now there was a man of Benjamin , whose name was Kish , the son of Abiel , the son of Zeror , the son of Bechorath , the son of Aphiah , a Benjamite , a mighty man of power .
9 : 4 And he passed through mount Ephraim , and passed through the land of Shalisha , but they found them not : then they passed through the land of Shalim , and there they were not : and he passed through the land of the Benjamites , but they found them not .
9 : 6 And he said unto him , Behold now , there is in this city a man of God , and he is an honourable man ; all that he saith cometh surely to pass : now let us go thither ; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go .
) 9 : 10 Then said Saul to his servant , Well said ; come , let us go .
9 : 12 And they answered them , and said , He is ; behold , he is before you : make haste now , for he came to day to the city ; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place : 9 : 13 As soon as ye be come into the city , ye shall straightway find him , before he go up to the high place to eat : for the people will not eat until he come , because he doth bless the sacrifice ; and afterwards they eat that be bidden .
9 : 15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came , saying , 9 : 16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin , and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel , that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines : for I have looked upon my people , because their cry is come unto me .
9 : 17 And when Samuel saw Saul , the LORD said unto him , Behold the man whom I spake to thee of !
9 : 19 And Samuel answered Saul , and said , I am the seer : go up before me unto the high place ; for ye shall eat with me to day , and to morrow I will let thee go , and will tell thee all that is in thine heart .
and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin ?
9 : 26 And they arose early : and it came to pass about the spring of the day , that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house , saying , Up , that I may send thee away .
10 : 1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil , and poured it upon his head , and kissed him , and said , Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance ?
10 : 12 And one of the same place answered and said , But who is their father ?
10 : 15 And Saul ' s uncle said , Tell me , I pray thee , what Samuel said unto you .
11 : 11 And it was so on the morrow , that Saul put the people in three companies ; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch , and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day : and it came to pass , that they which remained were scattered , so that two of them were not left together .
12 : 2 And now , behold , the king walketh before you : and I am old and grayheaded ; and , behold , my sons are with you : and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day .
12 : 9 And when they forgat the LORD their God , he sold them into the hand of Sisera , captain of the host of Hazor , and into the hand of the Philistines , and into the hand of the king of Moab , and they fought against them .
12 : 13 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen , and whom ye have desired !
12 : 25 But if ye shall still do wickedly , ye shall be consumed , both ye and your king .
13 : 3 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba , and the Philistines heard of it .
As for Saul , he was yet in Gilgal , and all the people followed him trembling .
And he offered the burnt offering .
13 : 11 And Samuel said , What hast thou done ?
13 : 13 And Samuel said to Saul , Thou hast done foolishly : thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God , which he commanded thee : for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever .
13 : 19 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel : for the Philistines said , Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears : 13 : 20 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines , to sharpen every man his share , and his coulter , and his axe , and his mattock .
14 : 4 And between the passages , by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines ' garrison , there was a sharp rock on the one side , and a sharp rock on the other side : and the name of the one was Bozez , and the name of the other Seneh .
14 : 5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash , and the other southward over against Gibeah .
14 : 10 But if they say thus , Come up unto us ; then we will go up : for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand : and this shall be a sign unto us .
14 : 22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim , when they heard that the Philistines fled , even they also followed hard after them in the battle .
14 : 24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day : for Saul had adjured the people , saying , Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening , that I may be avenged on mine enemies .
And the people were faint .
14 : 31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon : and the people were very faint .
14 : 43 Then Saul said to Jonathan , Tell me what thou hast done .
15 : 1 Samuel also said unto Saul , The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD .
15 : 5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
15 : 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag , and the best of the sheep , and of the oxen , and of the fatlings , and the lambs , and all that was good , and would not utterly destroy them : but every thing that was vile and refuse , that they destroyed utterly .
And it grieved Samuel ; and he cried unto the LORD all night .
15 : 21 But the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal .
15 : 24 And Saul said unto Samuel , I have sinned : for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD , and thy words : because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
15 : 30 Then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God .
15 : 31 So Samuel turned again after Saul ; and Saul worshipped the LORD .
16 : 1 And the LORD said unto Samuel , How long wilt thou mourn for Saul , seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel ?
16 : 4 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake , and came to Bethlehem .
16 : 5 And he said , Peaceably : I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD : sanctify yourselves , and come with me to the sacrifice .
16 : 7 But the LORD said unto Samuel , Look not on his countenance , or on the height of his stature ; because I have refused him : for the LORD seeth not as man seeth ; for man looketh on the outward appearance , but the LORD looketh on the heart .
And he said , Neither hath the LORD chosen this .
16 : 11 And Samuel said unto Jesse , Are here all thy children ?
16 : 18 Then answered one of the servants , and said , Behold , I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite , that is cunning in playing , and a mighty valiant man , and a man of war , and prudent in matters , and a comely person , and the LORD is with him .
17 : 4 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines , named Goliath , of Gath , whose height was six cubits and a span .
17 : 5 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head , and he was armed with a coat of mail ; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass .
17 : 16 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening , and presented himself forty days .
I know thy pride , and the naughtiness of thine heart ; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle .
17 : 30 And he turned from him toward another , and spake after the same manner : and the people answered him again after the former manner .
And Saul said unto David , Go , and the LORD be with thee .
17 : 47 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear : for the battle is the LORD ' s , and he will give you into our hands .
17 : 48 And it came to pass , when the Philistine arose , and came , and drew nigh to meet David , that David hastened , and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
17 : 58 And Saul said to him , Whose son art thou , thou young man ?
18 : 19 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul ' s daughter should have been given to David , that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife .
And David said , Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king ' s son in law , seeing that I am a poor man , and lightly esteemed ?
18 : 27 Wherefore David arose and went , he and his men , and slew of the Philistines two hundred men ; and David brought their foreskins , and they gave them in full tale to the king , that he might be the king ' s son in law .
19 : 8 And there was war again : and David went out , and fought with the Philistines , and slew them with a great slaughter ; and they fled from him .
19 : 16 And when the messengers were come in , behold , there was an image in the bed , with a pillow of goats ' hair for his bolster .
And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth .
19 : 20 And Saul sent messengers to take David : and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying , and Samuel standing as appointed over them , the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul , and they also prophesied .
19 : 22 Then went he also to Ramah , and came to a great well that is in Sechu : and he asked and said , Where are Samuel and David ?
And one said , Behold , they be at Naioth in Ramah .
Wherefore they say , Is Saul also among the prophets ?
and what is my sin before thy father , that he seeketh my life ?
20 : 7 If he say thus , It is well ; thy servant shall have peace : but if he be very wroth , then be sure that evil is determined by him .
20 : 21 And , behold , I will send a lad , saying , Go , find out the arrows .
20 : 25 And the king sat upon his seat , as at other times , even upon a seat by the wall : and Jonathan arose , and Abner sat by Saul ' s side , and David ' s place was empty .
20 : 35 And it came to pass in the morning , that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David , and a little lad with him .
20 : 36 And he said unto his lad , Run , find out now the arrows which I shoot .
And he arose and departed : and Jonathan went into the city .
21 : 8 And David said unto Ahimelech , And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword ?
21 : 14 Then said Achish unto his servants , Lo , ye see the man is mad : wherefore then have ye brought him to me ?
22 : 1 David therefore departed thence , and escaped to the cave Adullam : and when his brethren and all his father ' s house heard it , they went down thither to him .
22 : 10 And he enquired of the LORD for him , and gave him victuals , and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine .
22 : 12 And Saul said , Hear now , thou son of Ahitub .
be it far from me : let not the king impute any thing unto his servant , nor to all the house of my father : for thy servant knew nothing of all this , less or more .
22 : 18 And the king said to Doeg , Turn thou , and fall upon the priests .
23 : 2 Therefore David enquired of the LORD , saying , Shall I go and smite these Philistines ?
And the LORD answered him and said , Arise , go down to Keilah ; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
O LORD God of Israel , I beseech thee , tell thy servant .
And the LORD said , He will come down .
And Saul sought him every day , but God delivered him not into his hand .
23 : 26 And Saul went on this side of the mountain , and David and his men on that side of the mountain : and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul ; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them .
23 : 29 And David went up from thence , and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi .
24 : 9 And David said to Saul , Wherefore hearest thou men ' s words , saying , Behold , David seeketh thy hurt ?
And Saul lifted up his voice , and wept .
25 : 4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep .
25 : 8 Ask thy young men , and they will shew thee .
Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes : for we come in a good day : give , I pray thee , whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants , and to thy son David .
and who is the son of Jesse ?
25 : 11 Shall I then take my bread , and my water , and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers , and give it unto men , whom I know not whence they be ?
25 : 13 And David said unto his men , Gird ye on every man his sword .
25 : 18 Then Abigail made haste , and took two hundred loaves , and two bottles of wine , and five sheep ready dressed , and five measures of parched corn , and an hundred clusters of raisins , and two hundred cakes of figs , and laid them on asses .
25 : 23 And when Abigail saw David , she hasted , and lighted off the ass , and fell before David on her face , and bowed herself to the ground , 25 : 24 And fell at his feet , and said , Upon me , my lord , upon me let this iniquity be : and let thine handmaid , I pray thee , speak in thine audience , and hear the words of thine handmaid .
25 : 25 Let not my lord , I pray thee , regard this man of Belial , even Nabal : for as his name is , so is he ; Nabal is his name , and folly is with him : but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord , whom thou didst send .
25 : 38 And it came to pass about ten days after , that the LORD smote Nabal , that he died .
25 : 39 And when David heard that Nabal was dead , he said , Blessed be the LORD , that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal , and hath kept his servant from evil : for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head .
And David sent and communed with Abigail , to take her to him to wife .
26 : 9 And David said to Abishai , Destroy him not : for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD ' s anointed , and be guiltless ?
26 : 12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul ' s bolster ; and they gat them away , and no man saw it , nor knew it , neither awaked : for they were all asleep ; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them .
And now see where the king ' s spear is , and the cruse of water that was at his bolster .
And David said , It is my voice , my lord , O king .
26 : 18 And he said , Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant ?
26 : 21 Then said Saul , I have sinned : return , my son David : for I will no more do thee harm , because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day : behold , I have played the fool , and have erred exceedingly .
26 : 24 And , behold , as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes , so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD , and let him deliver me out of all tribulation .
26 : 25 Then Saul said to David , Blessed be thou , my son David : thou shalt both do great things , and also shalt still prevail .
27 : 2 And David arose , and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish , the son of Maoch , king of Gath .
27 : 4 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath : and he sought no more again for him .
27 : 9 And David smote the land , and left neither man nor woman alive , and took away the sheep , and the oxen , and the asses , and the camels , and the apparel , and returned , and came to Achish .
And David said , Against the south of Judah , and against the south of the Jerahmeelites , and against the south of the Kenites .
28 : 7 Then said Saul unto his servants , Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit , that I may go to her , and enquire of her .
should it not be with the heads of these men ?
29 : 5 Is not this David , of whom they sang one to another in dances , saying , Saul slew his thousands , and David his ten thousands ?
30 : 6 And David was greatly distressed ; for the people spake of stoning him , because the soul of all the people was grieved , every man for his sons and for his daughters : but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God .
30 : 16 And when he had brought him down , behold , they were spread abroad upon all the earth , eating and drinking , and dancing , because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines , and out of the land of Judah .
30 : 17 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day : and there escaped not a man of them , save four hundred young men , which rode upon camels , and fled .
31 : 5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead , he fell likewise upon his sword , and died with him .
31 : 13 And they took their bones , and buried them under a tree at Jabesh , and fasted seven days .
1 : 14 And David said unto him , How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD ' s anointed ?
1 : 24 Ye daughters of Israel , weep over Saul , who clothed you in scarlet , with other delights , who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel .
2 : 3 And his men that were with him did David bring up , every man with his household : and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron .
2 : 4 And the men of Judah came , and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah .
2 : 23 Howbeit he refused to turn aside : wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib , that the spear came out behind him ; and he fell down there , and died in the same place : and it came to pass , that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still .
2 : 25 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner , and became one troop , and stood on the top of an hill .
2 : 29 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain , and passed over Jordan , and went through all Bithron , and they came to Mahanaim .
3 : 6 And it came to pass , while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David , that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul .
3 : 13 And he said , Well ; I will make a league with thee : but one thing I require of thee , that is , Thou shalt not see my face , except thou first bring Michal Saul ' s daughter , when thou comest to see my face .
Then said Abner unto him , Go , return .
3 : 23 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come , they told Joab , saying , Abner the son of Ner came to the king , and he hath sent him away , and he is gone in peace .
3 : 28 And afterward when David heard it , he said , I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner : 3 : 29 Let it rest on the head of Joab , and on all his father ' s house ; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue , or that is a leper , or that leaneth on a staff , or that falleth on the sword , or that lacketh bread .
And king David himself followed the bier .
3 : 39 And I am this day weak , though anointed king ; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me : the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness .
4 : 3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim , and were sojourners there until this day .
4 : 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite , Rechab and Baanah , went , and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth , who lay on a bed at noon .
4 : 8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron , and said to the king , Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy , which sought thy life ; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul , and of his seed .
shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand , and take you away from the earth ?
And David built round about from Millo and inward .
5 : 12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel , and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel ' s sake .
5 : 14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem ; Shammuah , and Shobab , and Nathan , and Solomon , 5 : 15 Ibhar also , and Elishua , and Nepheg , and Japhia , 5 : 16 And Elishama , and Eliada , and Eliphalet .
And the LORD said unto David , Go up : for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand .
6 : 1 Again , David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel , thirty thousand .
6 : 12 And it was told king David , saying , The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom , and all that pertaineth unto him , because of the ark of God .
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness .
7 : 8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I took thee from the sheepcote , from following the sheep , to be ruler over my people , over Israel : 7 : 9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest , and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight , and have made thee a great name , like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth .
7 : 12 And when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers , I will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy bowels , and I will establish his kingdom .
If he commit iniquity , I will chasten him with the rod of men , and with the stripes of the children of men : 7 : 15 But my mercy shall not depart away from him , as I took it from Saul , whom I put away before thee .
And is this the manner of man , O Lord GOD ?
7 : 26 And let thy name be magnified for ever , saying , The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel : and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee .
7 : 28 And now , O Lord GOD , thou art that God , and thy words be true , and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant : 7 : 29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant , that it may continue for ever before thee : for thou , O Lord GOD , hast spoken it : and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever .
9 : 5 Then king David sent , and fetched him out of the house of Machir , the son of Ammiel , from Lodebar .
And David said , Mephibosheth .
And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth .
10 : 4 Wherefore Hanun took David ' s servants , and shaved off the one half of their beards , and cut off their garments in the middle , even to their buttocks , and sent them away .
10 : 13 And Joab drew nigh , and the people that were with him , unto the battle against the Syrians : and they fled before him .
10 : 15 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel , they gathered themselves together .
10 : 16 And Hadarezer sent , and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river : and they came to Helam ; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them .
10 : 17 And when it was told David , he gathered all Israel together , and passed over Jordan , and came to Helam .
11 : 3 And David sent and enquired after the woman .
11 : 16 And it came to pass , when Joab observed the city , that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were .
11 : 21 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth ?
And he came unto him , and said unto him , There were two men in one city ; the one rich , and the other poor .
thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword , and hast taken his wife to be thy wife , and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon .
12 : 13 And David said unto Nathan , I have sinned against the LORD .
12 : 14 Howbeit , because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme , the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die .
12 : 16 David therefore besought God for the child ; and David fasted , and went in , and lay all night upon the earth .
And they said , He is dead .
12 : 23 But now he is dead , wherefore should I fast ?
12 : 27 And Joab sent messengers to David , and said , I have fought against Rabbah , and have taken the city of waters .
wilt thou not tell me ?
13 : 5 And Jonadab said unto him , Lay thee down on thy bed , and make thyself sick : and when thy father cometh to see thee , say unto him , I pray thee , let my sister Tamar come , and give me meat , and dress the meat in my sight , that I may see it , and eat it at her hand .
13 : 6 So Amnon lay down , and made himself sick : and when the king was come to see him , Amnon said unto the king , I pray thee , let Tamar my sister come , and make me a couple of cakes in my sight , that I may eat at her hand .
And they went out every man from him .
13 : 11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat , he took hold of her , and said unto her , Come lie with me , my sister .
Now therefore , I pray thee , speak unto the king ; for he will not withhold me from thee .
And Amnon said unto her , Arise , be gone .
But he would not hearken unto her .
Then his servant brought her out , and bolted the door after her .
13 : 20 And Absalom her brother said unto her , Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee ?
but hold now thy peace , my sister : he is thy brother ; regard not this thing .
13 : 21 But when king David heard of all these things , he was very wroth .
13 : 24 And Absalom came to the king , and said , Behold now , thy servant hath sheepshearers ; let the king , I beseech thee , and his servants go with thy servant .
13 : 30 And it came to pass , while they were in the way , that tidings came to David , saying , Absalom hath slain all the king ' s sons , and there is not one of them left .
13 : 31 Then the king arose , and tare his garments , and lay on the earth ; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent .
13 : 37 But Absalom fled , and went to Talmai , the son of Ammihud , king of Geshur .
13 : 38 So Absalom fled , and went to Geshur , and was there three years .
So Joab put the words in her mouth .
14 : 8 And the king said unto the woman , Go to thine house , and I will give charge concerning thee .
14 : 10 And the king said , Whoever saith ought unto thee , bring him to me , and he shall not touch thee any more .
14 : 19 And the king said , Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this ?
So Absalom returned to his own house , and saw not the king ' s face .
And he said , Thy servant is of one of the tribes of Israel .
15 : 8 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria , saying , If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem , then I will serve the LORD .
15 : 28 See , I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness , until there come word from you to certify me .
therefore it shall be , that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king ' s house , thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests .
15 : 37 So Hushai David ' s friend came into the city , and Absalom came into Jerusalem .
16 : 1 And when David was a little past the top of the hill , behold , Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him , with a couple of asses saddled , and upon them two hundred loaves of bread , and an hundred bunches of raisins , and an hundred of summer fruits , and a bottle of wine .
let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
16 : 15 And Absalom , and all the people the men of Israel , came to Jerusalem , and Ahithophel with him .
why wentest thou not with thy friend ?
17 : 12 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found , and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground : and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one .
And the woman said unto them , They be gone over the brook of water .
18 : 1 And David numbered the people that were with him , and set captains of thousands , and captains of hundreds over them .
18 : 2 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab , and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah , Joab ' s brother , and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite .
18 : 9 And Absalom met the servants of David .
18 : 13 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life : for there is no matter hid from the king , and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me .
18 : 14 Then said Joab , I may not tarry thus with thee .
18 : 22 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab , But howsoever , let me , I pray thee , also run after Cushi .
And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king , and said , Blessed be the LORD thy God , which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king .
And Cushi answered , The enemies of my lord the king , and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt , be as that young man is .
19 : 4 But the king covered his face , and the king cried with a loud voice , O my son Absalom , O Absalom , my son , my son !
19 : 12 Ye are my brethren , ye are my bones and my flesh : wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king ?
can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink ?
19 : 42 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel , Because the king is near of kin to us : wherefore then be ye angry for this matter ?
20 : 1 And there happened to be there a man of Belial , whose name was Sheba , the son of Bichri , a Benjamite : and he blew a trumpet , and said , We have no part in David , neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse : every man to his tents , O Israel .
20 : 2 So every man of Israel went up from after David , and followed Sheba the son of Bichri : but the men of Judah clave unto their king , from Jordan even to Jerusalem .
20 : 3 And David came to his house at Jerusalem ; and the king took the ten women his concubines , whom he had left to keep the house , and put them in ward , and fed them , but went not in unto them .
20 : 12 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway .
20 : 15 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah , and they cast up a bank against the city , and it stood in the trench : and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall , to throw it down .
And he answered , I am he .
20 : 19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel : thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel : why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD ?
21 : 1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years , year after year ; and David enquired of the LORD .
) 21 : 3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites , What shall I do for you ?
21 : 7 But the king spared Mephibosheth , the son of Jonathan the son of Saul , because of the LORD ' s oath that was between them , between David and Jonathan the son of Saul .
21 : 14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah , in the sepulchre of Kish his father : and they performed all that the king commanded .
21 : 15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel ; and David went down , and his servants with him , and fought against the Philistines : and David waxed faint .
22 : 15 And he sent out arrows , and scattered them ; lightning , and discomfited them .
22 : 25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness ; according to my cleanness in his eye sight .
22 : 31 As for God , his way is perfect ; the word of the LORD is tried : he is a buckler to all them that trust in him .
22 : 36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation : and thy gentleness hath made me great .
23 : 8 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had : The Tachmonite that sat in the seat , chief among the captains ; the same was Adino the Eznite : he lift up his spear against eight hundred , whom he slew at one time .
23 : 11 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite .
23 : 24 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty ; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem , 23 : 25 Shammah the Harodite , Elika the Harodite , 23 : 26 Helez the Paltite , Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite , 23 : 27 Abiezer the Anethothite , Mebunnai the Hushathite , 23 : 28 Zalmon the Ahohite , Maharai the Netophathite , 23 : 29 Heleb the son of Baanah , a Netophathite , Ittai the son of Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin , 23 : 30 Benaiah the Pirathonite , Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash , 23 : 31 Abialbon the Arbathite , Azmaveth the Barhumite , 23 : 32 Eliahba the Shaalbonite , of the sons of Jashen , Jonathan , 23 : 33 Shammah the Hararite , Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite , 23 : 34 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai , the son of the Maachathite , Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite , 23 : 35 Hezrai the Carmelite , Paarai the Arbite , 23 : 36 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah , Bani the Gadite , 23 : 37 Zelek the Ammonite , Nahari the Beerothite , armourbearer to Joab the son of Zeruiah , 23 : 38 Ira an Ithrite , Gareb an Ithrite , 23 : 39 Uriah the Hittite : thirty and seven in all .
And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king , to number the people of Israel .
or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies , while they pursue thee ?
or that there be three days ' pestilence in thy land ?
24 : 15 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed : and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men .
24 : 16 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it , the LORD repented him of the evil , and said to the angel that destroyed the people , It is enough : stay now thine hand .
24 : 20 And Araunah looked , and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him : and Araunah went out , and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground .
1 : 2 Wherefore his servants said unto him , Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin : and let her stand before the king , and let her cherish him , and let her lie in thy bosom , that my lord the king may get heat .
1 : 3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel , and found Abishag a Shunammite , and brought her to the king .
1 : 4 And the damsel was very fair , and cherished the king , and ministered to him : but the king knew her not .
and he also was a very goodly man ; and his mother bare him after Absalom .
1 : 7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah , and with Abiathar the priest : and they following Adonijah helped him .
1 : 8 But Zadok the priest , and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada , and Nathan the prophet , and Shimei , and Rei , and the mighty men which belonged to David , were not with Adonijah .
And the king said , What wouldest thou ?
1 : 23 And they told the king , saying , Behold Nathan the prophet .
1 : 24 And Nathan said , My lord , O king , hast thou said , Adonijah shall reign after me , and he shall sit upon my throne ?
1 : 31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth , and did reverence to the king , and said , Let my lord king David live for ever .
1 : 36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king , and said , Amen : the LORD God of my lord the king say so too .
1 : 49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid , and rose up , and went every man his way .
2 : 1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die ; and he charged Solomon his son , saying , 2 : 2 I go the way of all the earth : be thou strong therefore , and shew thyself a man ; 2 : 3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God , to walk in his ways , to keep his statutes , and his commandments , and his judgments , and his testimonies , as it is written in the law of Moses , that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest , and whithersoever thou turnest thyself : 2 : 4 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me , saying , If thy children take heed to their way , to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul , there shall not fail thee ( said he ) a man on the throne of Israel .
2 : 10 So David slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David .
2 : 14 He said moreover , I have somewhat to say unto thee .
2 : 15 And he said , Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine , and that all Israel set their faces on me , that I should reign : howbeit the kingdom is turned about , and is become my brother ' s : for it was his from the LORD .
2 : 19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon , to speak unto him for Adonijah .
And the king said unto her , Ask on , my mother : for I will not say thee nay .
2 : 22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother , And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah ?
And they told Shimei , saying , Behold , thy servants be in Gath .
2 : 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei , and said unto him , Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD , and protested unto thee , saying , Know for a certain , on the day thou goest out , and walkest abroad any whither , that thou shalt surely die ?
and thou saidst unto me , The word that I have heard is good .
3 : 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places , because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD , until those days .
3 : 3 And Solomon loved the LORD , walking in the statutes of David his father : only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places .
3 : 13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked , both riches , and honour : so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days .
And he came to Jerusalem , and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD , and offered up burnt offerings , and offered peace offerings , and made a feast to all his servants .
3 : 20 And she arose at midnight , and took my son from beside me , while thine handmaid slept , and laid it in her bosom , and laid her dead child in my bosom .
Thus they spake before the king .
And they brought a sword before the king .
3 : 27 Then the king answered and said , Give her the living child , and in no wise slay it : she is the mother thereof .
4 : 2 And these were the princes which he had ; Azariah the son of Zadok the priest , 4 : 3 Elihoreph and Ahiah , the sons of Shisha , scribes ; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud , the recorder .
4 : 20 Judah and Israel were many , as the sand which is by the sea in multitude , eating and drinking , and making merry .
4 : 27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon , and for all that came unto king Solomon ' s table , every man in his month : they lacked nothing .
4 : 34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon , from all kings of the earth , which had heard of his wisdom .
5 : 4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side , so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent .
5 : 12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom , as he promised him : and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon ; and they two made a league together .
5 : 13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel ; and the levy was thirty thousand men .
6 : 1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt , in the fourth year of Solomon ' s reign over Israel , in the month Zif , which is the second month , that he began to build the house of the LORD .
6 : 3 And the porch before the temple of the house , twenty cubits was the length thereof , according to the breadth of the house ; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house .
6 : 14 So Solomon built the house , and finished it .
6 : 30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold , within and without .
6 : 32 The two doors also were of olive tree ; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers , and overlaid them with gold , and spread gold upon the cherubims , and upon the palm trees .
So was he seven years in building it .
7 : 3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams , that lay on forty five pillars , fifteen in a row .
7 : 7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge , even the porch of judgment : and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other .
7 : 21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple : and he set up the right pillar , and called the name thereof Jachin : and he set up the left pillar , and called the name thereof Boaz .
7 : 22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work : so was the work of the pillars finished .
7 : 27 And he made ten bases of brass ; four cubits was the length of one base , and four cubits the breadth thereof , and three cubits the height of it .
7 : 35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high : and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same .
7 : 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD : the altar of gold , and the table of gold , whereupon the shewbread was , 7 : 49 And the candlesticks of pure gold , five on the right side , and five on the left , before the oracle , with the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs of gold , 7 : 50 And the bowls , and the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers of pure gold ; and the hinges of gold , both for the doors of the inner house , the most holy place , and for the doors of the house , to wit , of the temple .
8 : 18 And the LORD said unto David my father , Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name , thou didst well that it was in thine heart .
8 : 27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth ?
So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD .
9 : 3 And the LORD said unto him , I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication , that thou hast made before me : I have hallowed this house , which thou hast built , to put my name there for ever ; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually .
9 : 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen : but they were men of war , and his servants , and his princes , and his captains , and rulers of his chariots , and his horsemen .
9 : 24 But Pharaoh ' s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her : then did he build Millo .
10 : 1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD , she came to prove him with hard questions .
10 : 7 Howbeit I believed not the words , until I came , and mine eyes had seen it : and , behold , the half was not told me : thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard .
10 : 9 Blessed be the LORD thy God , which delighted in thee , to set thee on the throne of Israel : because the LORD loved Israel for ever , therefore made he thee king , to do judgment and justice .
So she turned and went to her own country , she and her servants .
10 : 17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold ; three pound of gold went to one shield : and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
10 : 20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps : there was not the like made in any kingdom .
11 : 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians , and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites .
11 : 12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father ' s sake : but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son .
11 : 18 And they arose out of Midian , and came to Paran : and they took men with them out of Paran , and they came to Egypt , unto Pharaoh king of Egypt ; which gave him an house , and appointed him victuals , and gave him land .
11 : 19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh , so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife , the sister of Tahpenes the queen .
11 : 21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers , and that Joab the captain of the host was dead , Hadad said to Pharaoh , Let me depart , that I may go to mine own country .
12 : 2 And it came to pass , when Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who was yet in Egypt , heard of it , ( for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon , and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt ;) 12 : 3 That they sent and called him .
And the people departed .
12 : 8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men , which they had given him , and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him , and which stood before him : 12 : 9 And he said unto them , What counsel give ye that we may answer this people , who have spoken to me , saying , Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter ?
12 : 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them , the people answered the king , saying , What portion have we in David ?
13 : 7 And the king said unto the man of God , Come home with me , and refresh thyself , and I will give thee a reward .
13 : 20 And it came to pass , as they sat at the table , that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back : 13 : 21 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah , saying , Thus saith the LORD , Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD , and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee , 13 : 22 But camest back , and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place , of the which the Lord did say to thee , Eat no bread , and drink no water ; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers .
13 : 27 And he spake to his sons , saying , Saddle me the ass .
But Ahijah could not see ; for his eyes were set by reason of his age .
14 : 20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years : and he slept with his fathers , and Nadab his son reigned in his stead .
And his mother ' s name was Naamah an Ammonitess .
15 : 1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah .
15 : 2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem .
15 : 4 Nevertheless for David ' s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem , to set up his son after him , and to establish Jerusalem : 15 : 5 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD , and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life , save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite .
15 : 21 And it came to pass , when Baasha heard thereof , that he left off building of Ramah , and dwelt in Tirzah .
15 : 29 And it came to pass , when he reigned , that he smote all the house of Jeroboam ; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed , until he had destroyed him , according unto the saying of the LORD , which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite : 15 : 30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned , and which he made Israel sin , by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger .
15 : 33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah , twenty and four years .
16 : 4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat ; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat .
16 : 10 And Zimri went in and smote him , and killed him , in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah , and reigned in his stead .
16 : 11 And it came to pass , when he began to reign , as soon as he sat on his throne , that he slew all the house of Baasha : he left him not one that pisseth against a wall , neither of his kinsfolks , nor of his friends .
16 : 15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah .
16 : 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri , and his treason that he wrought , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
16 : 27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did , and his might that he shewed , are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel ?
16 : 31 And it came to pass , as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians , and went and served Baal , and worshipped him .
17 : 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah : and she , and he , and her house , did eat many days .
17 : 24 And the woman said to Elijah , Now by this I know that thou art a man of God , and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth .
( Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly : 18 : 4 For it was so , when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD , that Obadiah took an hundred prophets , and hid them by fifty in a cave , and fed them with bread and water .
) 18 : 5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah , Go into the land , unto all fountains of water , and unto all brooks : peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive , that we lose not all the beasts .
18 : 26 And they took the bullock which was given them , and they dressed it , and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon , saying , O Baal , hear us .
18 : 41 And Elijah said unto Ahab , Get thee up , eat and drink ; for there is a sound of abundance of rain .
18 : 42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink .
19 : 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah , saying , So let the gods do to me , and more also , if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time .
19 : 3 And when he saw that , he arose , and went for his life , and came to Beersheba , which belongeth to Judah , and left his servant there .
And he did eat and drink , and laid him down again .
And , behold , the LORD passed by , and a great and strong wind rent the mountains , and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD ; but the LORD was not in the wind : and after the wind an earthquake ; but the LORD was not in the earthquake : 19 : 12 And after the earthquake a fire ; but the LORD was not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice .
20 : 5 And the messengers came again , and said , Thus speaketh Benhadad , saying , Although I have sent unto thee , saying , Thou shalt deliver me thy silver , and thy gold , and thy wives , and thy children ; 20 : 6 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time , and they shall search thine house , and the houses of thy servants ; and it shall be , that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes , they shall put it in their hand , and take it away .
20 : 17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first ; and Benhadad sent out , and they told him , saying , There are men come out of Samaria .
And he hearkened unto their voice , and did so .
Then Benhadad came forth to him ; and he caused him to come up into the chariot .
20 : 34 And Ben - hadad said unto him , The cities , which my father took from thy father , I will restore ; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus , as my father made in Samaria .
20 : 35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD , Smite me , I pray thee .
20 : 37 Then he found another man , and said , Smite me , I pray thee .
20 : 40 And as thy servant was busy here and there , he was gone .
And the king of Israel said unto him , So shall thy judgment be ; thyself hast decided it .
20 : 41 And he hasted , and took the ashes away from his face ; and the king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets .
20 : 43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased , and came to Samaria .
21 : 2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth , saying , Give me thy vineyard , that I may have it for a garden of herbs , because it is near unto my house : and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it ; or , if it seem good to thee , I will give thee the worth of it in money .
21 : 9 And she wrote in the letters , saying , Proclaim a fast , and set Naboth on high among the people : 21 : 10 And set two men , sons of Belial , before him , to bear witness against him , saying , Thou didst blaspheme God and the king .
21 : 11 And the men of his city , even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city , did as Jezebel had sent unto them , and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them .
21 : 13 And there came in two men , children of Belial , and sat before him : and the men of Belial witnessed against him , even against Naboth , in the presence of the people , saying , Naboth did blaspheme God and the king .
And he answered , I have found thee : because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD .
22 : 4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat , Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead ?
And Jehoshaphat said , Let not the king say so .
22 : 9 Then the king of Israel called an officer , and said , Hasten hither Micaiah the son of Imlah .
22 : 11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron : and he said , Thus saith the LORD , With these shalt thou push the Syrians , until thou have consumed them .
22 : 13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him , saying , Behold now , the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth : let thy word , I pray thee , be like the word of one of them , and speak that which is good .
22 : 26 And the king of Israel said , Take Micaiah , and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city , and to Joash the king ' s son ; 22 : 27 And say , Thus saith the king , Put this fellow in the prison , and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction , until I come in peace .
22 : 34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture , and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness : wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot , Turn thine hand , and carry me out of the host ; for I am wounded .
22 : 42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign ; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem .
22 : 47 There was then no king in Edom : a deputy was king .
22 : 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold : but they went not ; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber .
But Jehoshaphat would not .
22 : 52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD , and walked in the way of his father , and in the way of his mother , and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat , who made Israel to sin : 22 : 53 For he served Baal , and worshipped him , and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel , according to all that his father had done .
1 : 8 And they answered him , He was an hairy man , and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins .
And Elisha said unto him , As the LORD liveth , and as thy soul liveth , I will not leave thee .
So they came to Jericho .
2 : 6 And Elijah said unto him , Tarry , I pray thee , here ; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan .
3 : 10 And the king of Israel said , Alas !
3 : 17 For thus saith the LORD , Ye shall not see wind , neither shall ye see rain ; yet that valley shall be filled with water , that ye may drink , both ye , and your cattle , and your beasts .
3 : 27 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead , and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall .
4 : 1 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha , saying , Thy servant my husband is dead ; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD : and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen .
4 : 6 And it came to pass , when the vessels were full , that she said unto her son , Bring me yet a vessel .
And when he had called her , she stood before him .
wouldest thou be spoken for to the king , or to the captain of the host ?
4 : 14 And he said , What then is to be done for her ?
4 : 23 And he said , Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day ?
And she said , It shall be well .
4 : 29 Then he said to Gehazi , Gird up thy loins , and take my staff in thine hand , and go thy way : if thou meet any man , salute him not ; and if any salute thee , answer him not again : and lay my staff upon the face of the child .
4 : 35 Then he returned , and walked in the house to and fro ; and went up , and stretched himself upon him : and the child sneezed seven times , and the child opened his eyes .
And he cast it into the pot ; and he said , Pour out for the people , that they may eat .
5 : 1 Now Naaman , captain of the host of the king of Syria , was a great man with his master , and honourable , because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria : he was also a mighty man in valour , but he was a leper .
And he departed , and took with him ten talents of silver , and six thousand pieces of gold , and ten changes of raiment .
may I not wash in them , and be clean ?
5 : 16 But he said , As the LORD liveth , before whom I stand , I will receive none .
My master hath sent me , saying , Behold , even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets : give them , I pray thee , a talent of silver , and two changes of garments .
And he urged him , and bound two talents of silver in two bags , with two changes of garments , and laid them upon two of his servants ; and they bare them before him .
5 : 24 And when he came to the tower , he took them from their hand , and bestowed them in the house : and he let the men go , and they departed .
5 : 25 But he went in , and stood before his master .
And he said , Thy servant went no whither .
6 : 1 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha , Behold now , the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us .
And he answered , I will go .
But he led them to Samaria .
6 : 21 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha , when he saw them , My father , shall I smite them ?
6 : 22 And he answered , Thou shalt not smite them : wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow ?
6 : 24 And it came to pass after this , that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host , and went up , and besieged Samaria .
7 : 4 If we say , We will enter into the city , then the famine is in the city , and we shall die there : and if we sit still here , we die also .
Now therefore come , and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians : if they save us alive , we shall live ; and if they kill us , we shall but die .
7 : 12 And the king arose in the night , and said unto his servants , I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us .
8 : 3 And it came to pass at the seven years ' end , that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines : and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land .
8 : 4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God , saying , Tell me , I pray thee , all the great things that Elisha hath done .
8 : 6 And when the king asked the woman , she told him .
8 : 7 And Elisha came to Damascus ; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick ; and it was told him , saying , The man of God is come hither .
8 : 13 And Hazael said , But what , is thy servant a dog , that he should do this great thing ?
8 : 21 So Joram went over to Zair , and all the chariots with him : and he rose by night , and smote the Edomites which compassed him about , and the captains of the chariots : and the people fled into their tents .
8 : 25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign .
8 : 27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab , and did evil in the sight of the LORD , as did the house of Ahab : for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab .
9 : 6 And he arose , and went into the house ; and he poured the oil on his head , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD God of Israel , I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD , even over Israel .
And he opened the door , and fled .
And he said unto them , Ye know the man , and his communication .
9 : 14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram .
9 : 15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him , when he fought with Hazael king of Syria .
9 : 16 So Jehu rode in a chariot , and went to Jezreel ; for Joram lay there .
turn thee behind me .
9 : 20 And the watchman told , saying , He came even unto them , and cometh not again : and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi ; for he driveth furiously .
And he answered , What peace , so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many ?
9 : 23 And Joram turned his hands , and fled , and said to Ahaziah , There is treachery , O Ahaziah .
who ?
9 : 36 Wherefore they came again , and told him .
And he said , This is the word of the LORD , which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite , saying , In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel : 9 : 37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel ; so that they shall not say , This is Jezebel .
And they answered , We are the brethren of Ahaziah ; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen .

12 : 7 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest , and the other priests , and said unto them , Why repair ye not the breaches of the house ?
12 : 15 Moreover they reckoned not with the men , into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen : for they dealt faithfully .

17 : 14 Notwithstanding they would not hear , but hardened their necks , like to the neck of their fathers , that did not believe in the LORD their God .

21 : 18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David , that David should go up , and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite .
21 : 22 Then David said to Ornan , Grant me the place of this threshingfloor , that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD : thou shalt grant it me for the full price : that the plague may be stayed from the people .

22 : 9 Behold , a son shall be born to thee , who shall be a man of rest ; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about : for his name shall be Solomon , and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days .
22 : 14 Now , behold , in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold , and a thousand thousand talents of silver ; and of brass and iron without weight ; for it is in abundance : timber also and stone have I prepared ; and thou mayest add thereto .
22 : 15 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance , hewers and workers of stone and timber , and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work .
23 : 1 So when David was old and full of days , he made Solomon his son king over Israel .

28 : 4 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever : for he hath chosen Judah to be the ruler ; and of the house of Judah , the house of my father ; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all Israel : 28 : 5 And of all my sons , ( for the LORD hath given me many sons ,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel .
28 : 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD , and in the audience of our God , keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God : that ye may possess this good land , and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever .
28 : 10 Take heed now ; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary : be strong , and do it .
28 : 19 All this , said David , the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me , even all the works of this pattern .
29 : 15 For we are strangers before thee , and sojourners , as were all our fathers : our days on the earth are as a shadow , and there is none abiding .
1 : 2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel , to the captains of thousands and of hundreds , and to the judges , and to every governor in all Israel , the chief of the fathers .
1 : 8 And Solomon said unto God , Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father , and hast made me to reign in his stead .
1 : 14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen : and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots , and twelve thousand horsemen , which he placed in the chariot cities , and with the king at Jerusalem .
1 : 17 And they fetched up , and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver , and an horse for an hundred and fifty : and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites , and for the kings of Syria , by their means .
2 : 6 But who is able to build him an house , seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him ?
2 : 8 Send me also cedar trees , fir trees , and algum trees , out of Lebanon : for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon ; and , behold , my servants shall be with thy servants , 2 : 9 Even to prepare me timber in abundance : for the house which I am about to build shall be wonderful great .
2 : 12 Huram said moreover , Blessed be the LORD God of Israel , that made heaven and earth , who hath given to David the king a wise son , endued with prudence and understanding , that might build an house for the LORD , and an house for his kingdom .
The length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits , and the breadth twenty cubits .
3 : 13 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits : and they stood on their feet , and their faces were inward .
4 : 4 It stood upon twelve oxen , three looking toward the north , and three looking toward the west , and three looking toward the south , and three looking toward the east : and the sea was set above upon them , and all their hinder parts were inward .
4 : 7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form , and set them in the temple , five on the right hand , and five on the left .
And he made an hundred basons of gold .
4 : 19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God , the golden altar also , and the tables whereon the shewbread was set ; 4 : 20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps , that they should burn after the manner before the oracle , of pure gold ; 4 : 21 And the flowers , and the lamps , and the tongs , made he of gold , and that perfect gold ; 4 : 22 And the snuffers , and the basons , and the spoons , and the censers , of pure gold : and the entry of the house , the inner doors thereof for the most holy place , and the doors of the house of the temple , were of gold .
5 : 7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place , to the oracle of the house , into the most holy place , even under the wings of the cherubims : 5 : 8 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark , and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above .
6 : 3 And the king turned his face , and blessed the whole congregation of Israel : and all the congregation of Israel stood .
6 : 11 And in it have I put the ark , wherein is the covenant of the LORD , that he made with the children of Israel .
6 : 12 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands : 6 : 13 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long , and five cubits broad , and three cubits high , and had set it in the midst of the court : and upon it he stood , and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel , and spread forth his hands toward heaven .
6 : 21 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant , and of thy people Israel , which they shall make toward this place : hear thou from thy dwelling place , even from heaven ; and when thou hearest , forgive .
6 : 28 If there be dearth in the land , if there be pestilence , if there be blasting , or mildew , locusts , or caterpillers ; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land ; whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be : 6 : 29 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man , or of all thy people Israel , when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief , and shall spread forth his hands in this house : 6 : 30 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place , and forgive , and render unto every man according unto all his ways , whose heart thou knowest ; ( for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men :) 6 : 31 That they may fear thee , to walk in thy ways , so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers .
7 : 13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain , or if I command the locusts to devour the land , or if I send pestilence among my people ; 7 : 14 If my people , which are called by my name , shall humble themselves , and pray , and seek my face , and turn from their wicked ways ; then will I hear from heaven , and will forgive their sin , and will heal their land .
7 : 17 And as for thee , if thou wilt walk before me , as David thy father walked , and do according to all that I have commanded thee , and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments ; 7 : 18 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom , according as I have covenanted with David thy father , saying , There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel .
7 : 21 And this house , which is high , shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it ; so that he shall say , Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land , and unto this house ?
8 : 3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah , and prevailed against it .
8 : 4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness , and all the store cities , which he built in Hamath .
8 : 14 And he appointed , according to the order of David his father , the courses of the priests to their service , and the Levites to their charges , to praise and minister before the priests , as the duty of every day required : the porters also by their courses at every gate : for so had David the man of God commanded .
9 : 1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon , she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem , with a very great company , and camels that bare spices , and gold in abundance , and precious stones : and when she was come to Solomon , she communed with him of all that was in her heart .
And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon .
9 : 20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold , and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold : none were of silver ; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon .
10 : 11 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you , I will put more to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips , but I will chastise you with scorpions .
) 11 : 22 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief , to be ruler among his brethren : for he thought to make him king .
12 : 1 And it came to pass , when Rehoboam had established the kingdom , and had strengthened himself , he forsook the law of the LORD , and all Israel with him .
12 : 9 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem , and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD , and the treasures of the king ' s house ; he took all : he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made .
12 : 14 And he did evil , because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD .
12 : 15 Now the acts of Rehoboam , first and last , are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet , and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies ?
13 : 2 He reigned three years in Jerusalem .
13 : 6 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat , the servant of Solomon the son of David , is risen up , and hath rebelled against his lord .
so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams , the same may be a priest of them that are no gods .
13 : 12 And , behold , God himself is with us for our captain , and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you .
14 : 5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images : and the kingdom was quiet before him .
14 : 8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears , out of Judah three hundred thousand ; and out of Benjamin , that bare shields and drew bows , two hundred and fourscore thousand : all these were mighty men of valour .
14 : 13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar : and the Ethiopians were overthrown , that they could not recover themselves ; for they were destroyed before the LORD , and before his host ; and they carried away very much spoil .
14 : 15 They smote also the tents of cattle , and carried away sheep and camels in abundance , and returned to Jerusalem .
15 : 6 And nation was destroyed of nation , and city of city : for God did vex them with all adversity .
15 : 14 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice , and with shouting , and with trumpets , and with cornets .
17 : 2 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah , and set garrisons in the land of Judah , and in the cities of Ephraim , which Asa his father had taken .
17 : 3 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat , because he walked in the first ways of his father David , and sought not unto Baalim ; 17 : 4 But sought to the Lord God of his father , and walked in his commandments , and not after the doings of Israel .
17 : 5 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand ; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents ; and he had riches and honour in abundance .
18 : 3 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah , Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead ?
18 : 4 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel , Enquire , I pray thee , at the word of the LORD to day .
18 : 10 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron , and said , Thus saith the LORD , With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed .
And one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
18 : 28 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead .
18 : 29 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat , I will disguise myself , and I will go to the battle ; but put thou on thy robes .
18 : 30 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him , saying , Fight ye not with small or great , save only with the king of Israel .
18 : 31 And it came to pass , when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat , that they said , It is the king of Israel .
20 : 1 It came to pass after this also , that the children of Moab , and the children of Ammon , and with them other beside the Ammonites , came against Jehoshaphat to battle .
20 : 12 O our God , wilt thou not judge them ?
for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us ; neither know we what to do : but our eyes are upon thee .
20 : 13 And all Judah stood before the LORD , with their little ones , their wives , and their children .
20 : 23 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir , utterly to slay and destroy them : and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir , every one helped to destroy another .
20 : 34 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat , first and last , behold , they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani , who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel .
20 : 37 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat , saying , Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah , the LORD hath broken thy works .
21 : 19 And it came to pass , that in process of time , after the end of two years , his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness : so he died of sore diseases .
His mother ' s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri .
22 : 8 And it came to pass , that , when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab , and found the princes of Judah , and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah , that ministered to Ahaziah , he slew them .
22 : 10 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah .
23 : 11 Then they brought out the king ' s son , and put upon him the crown , and gave him the testimony , and made him king .
And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him , and said , God save the king .
Then Athaliah rent her clothes , and said , Treason , Treason .
23 : 14 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host , and said unto them , Have her forth of the ranges : and whoso followeth her , let him be slain with the sword .
For the priest said , Slay her not in the house of the LORD .
23 : 20 And he took the captains of hundreds , and the nobles , and the governors of the people , and all the people of the land , and brought down the king from the house of the LORD : and they came through the high gate into the king ' s house , and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom .
25 : 5 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together , and made them captains over thousands , and captains over hundreds , according to the houses of their fathers , throughout all Judah and Benjamin : and he numbered them from twenty years old and above , and found them three hundred thousand choice men , able to go forth to war , that could handle spear and shield .
25 : 18 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah , saying , The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon , saying , Give thy daughter to my son to wife : and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon , and trode down the thistle .
25 : 19 Thou sayest , Lo , thou hast smitten the Edomites ; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast : abide now at home ; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt , that thou shouldest fall , even thou , and Judah with thee ?
25 : 25 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years .
26 : 5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah , who had understanding in the visions of God : and as long as he sought the LORD , God made him to prosper .
26 : 15 And he made in Jerusalem engines , invented by cunning men , to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks , to shoot arrows and great stones withal .
And his name spread far abroad ; for he was marvellously helped , till he was strong .
26 : 22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah , first and last , did Isaiah the prophet , the son of Amoz , write .
26 : 23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers , and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings ; for they said , He is a leper : and Jotham his son reigned in his stead .
27 : 1 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign , and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem .
And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver , and ten thousand measures of wheat , and ten thousand of barley .
28 : 15 And the men which were expressed by name rose up , and took the captives , and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them , and arrayed them , and shod them , and gave them to eat and to drink , and anointed them , and carried all the feeble of them upon asses , and brought them to Jericho , the city of palm trees , to their brethren : then they returned to Samaria .
28 : 23 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus , which smote him : and he said , Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them , therefore will I sacrifice to them , that they may help me .
29 : 9 For , lo , our fathers have fallen by the sword , and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this .
29 : 10 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel , that his fierce wrath may turn away from us .
29 : 29 And when they had made an end of offering , the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves , and worshipped .
30 : 7 And be not ye like your fathers , and like your brethren , which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers , who therefore gave them up to desolation , as ye see .
But Hezekiah prayed for them , saying , The good LORD pardon every one 30 : 19 That prepareth his heart to seek God , the LORD God of his fathers , though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary .
30 : 23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days : and they kept other seven days with gladness .
31 : 2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses , every man according to his service , the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings , to minister , and to give thanks , and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD .
31 : 21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God , and in the law , and in the commandments , to seek his God , he did it with all his heart , and prospered .
32 : 11 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst , saying , The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria ?
32 : 19 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem , as against the gods of the people of the earth , which were the work of the hands of man .
And when he was come into the house of his god , they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword .
33 : 5 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD .
Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God .
33 : 14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David , on the west side of Gihon , in the valley , even to the entering in at the fish gate , and compassed about Ophel , and raised it up a very great height , and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah .
33 : 22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD , as did Manasseh his father : for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made , and served them ; 33 : 23 And humbled not himself before the LORD , as Manasseh his father had humbled himself ; but Amon trespassed more and more .
34 : 5 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars , and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem .
34 : 6 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh , and Ephraim , and Simeon , even unto Naphtali , with their mattocks round about .
34 : 10 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD , and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD , to repair and amend the house : 34 : 11 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it , to buy hewn stone , and timber for couplings , and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed .
34 : 28 Behold , I will gather thee to thy fathers , and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace , neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place , and upon the inhabitants of the same .
And all his days they departed not from following the LORD , the God of their fathers .
35 : 2 And he set the priests in their charges , and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD , 35 : 3 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel , which were holy unto the LORD , Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build ; it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders : serve now the LORD your God , and his people Israel , 35 : 4 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers , after your courses , according to the writing of David king of Israel , and according to the writing of Solomon his son .
I come not against thee this day , but against the house wherewith I have war : for God commanded me to make haste : forbear thee from meddling with God , who is with me , that he destroy thee not .
35 : 22 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him , but disguised himself , that he might fight with him , and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God , and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo .
35 : 25 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah : and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day , and made them an ordinance in Israel : and , behold , they are written in the lamentations .
36 : 8 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim , and his abominations which he did , and that which was found in him , behold , they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah : and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead .
36 : 10 And when the year was expired , king Nebuchadnezzar sent , and brought him to Babylon , with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD , and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem .
36 : 11 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign , and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem .
36 : 20 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon ; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia : 36 : 21 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah , until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths : for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath , to fulfil threescore and ten years .
1 : 7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD , which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem , and had put them in the house of his gods ; 1 : 8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer , and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar , the prince of Judah .
2 : 8 The children of Zattu , nine hundred forty and five .
2 : 10 The children of Bani , six hundred forty and two .
2 : 19 The children of Hashum , two hundred twenty and three .
2 : 21 The children of Bethlehem , an hundred twenty and three .
2 : 22 The men of Netophah , fifty and six .
2 : 23 The men of Anathoth , an hundred twenty and eight .
2 : 64 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore , 2 : 65 Beside their servants and their maids , of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven : and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women .
3 : 1 And when the seventh month was come , and the children of Israel were in the cities , the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem .
And all the people shouted with a great shout , when they praised the LORD , because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid .
4 : 3 But Zerubbabel , and Jeshua , and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel , said unto them , Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God ; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel , as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us .
4 : 16 We certify the king that , if this city be builded again , and the walls thereof set up , by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river .
4 : 21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease , and that this city be not builded , until another commandment shall be given from me .
5 : 1 Then the prophets , Haggai the prophet , and Zechariah the son of Iddo , prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel , even unto them .
5 : 5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews , that they could not cause them to cease , till the matter came to Darius : and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter .
5 : 13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God .
6 : 2 And there was found at Achmetha , in the palace that is in the province of the Medes , a roll , and therein was a record thus written : 6 : 3 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem , Let the house be builded , the place where they offered sacrifices , and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid ; the height thereof threescore cubits , and the breadth thereof threescore cubits ; 6 : 4 With three rows of great stones , and a row of new timber : and let the expenses be given out of the king ' s house : 6 : 5 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God , which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem , and brought unto Babylon , be restored , and brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem , every one to his place , and place them in the house of God .
I Darius have made a decree ; let it be done with speed .
6 : 14 And the elders of the Jews builded , and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo .
6 : 16 And the children of Israel , the priests , and the Levites , and the rest of the children of the captivity , kept the dedication of this house of God with joy .
6 : 21 And the children of Israel , which were come again out of captivity , and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land , to seek the LORD God of Israel , did eat , 6 : 22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy : for the LORD had made them joyful , and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them , to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God , the God of Israel .
7 : 9 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon , and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem , according to the good hand of his God upon him .
7 : 10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD , and to do it , and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments .
7 : 13 I make a decree , that all they of the people of Israel , and of his priests and Levites , in my realm , which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem , go with thee .
7 : 19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God , those deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem .
7 : 21 And I , even I Artaxerxes the king , do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river , that whatsoever Ezra the priest , the scribe of the law of the God of heaven , shall require of you , it be done speedily , 7 : 22 Unto an hundred talents of silver , and to an hundred measures of wheat , and to an hundred baths of wine , and to an hundred baths of oil , and salt without prescribing how much .
8 : 2 Of the sons of Phinehas ; Gershom : of the sons of Ithamar ; Daniel : of the sons of David ; Hattush .
8 : 10 And of the sons of Shelomith ; the son of Josiphiah , and with him an hundred and threescore males .
9 : 3 And when I heard this thing , I rent my garment and my mantle , and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard , and sat down astonied .
9 : 10 And now , O our God , what shall we say after this ?
10 : 2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel , one of the sons of Elam , answered and said unto Ezra , We have trespassed against our God , and have taken strange wives of the people of the land : yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing .
10 : 7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity , that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem ; 10 : 8 And that whosoever would not come within three days , according to the counsel of the princes and the elders , all his substance should be forfeited , and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away .
10 : 9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days .
10 : 12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice , As thou hast said , so must we do .
10 : 18 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives : namely , of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak , and his brethren ; Maaseiah , and Eliezer , and Jarib , and Gedaliah .
10 : 23 Also of the Levites ; Jozabad , and Shimei , and Kelaiah , ( the same is Kelita ,) Pethahiah , Judah , and Eliezer .
10 : 24 Of the singers also ; Eliashib : and of the porters ; Shallum , and Telem , and Uri .
10 : 29 And of the sons of Bani ; Meshullam , Malluch , and Adaiah , Jashub , and Sheal , and Ramoth .
10 : 31 And of the sons of Harim ; Eliezer , Ishijah , Malchiah , Shemaiah , Shimeon , 10 : 32 Benjamin , Malluch , and Shemariah .
2 : 5 And I said unto the king , If it please the king , and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight , that thou wouldest send me unto Judah , unto the city of my fathers ' sepulchres , that I may build it .
2 : 13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley , even before the dragon well , and to the dung port , and viewed the walls of Jerusalem , which were broken down , and the gates thereof were consumed with fire .
So they strengthened their hands for this good work .
3 : 3 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build , who also laid the beams thereof , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
3 : 11 Malchijah the son of Harim , and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab , repaired the other piece , and the tower of the furnaces .
3 : 14 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab , the ruler of part of Bethhaccerem ; he built it , and set up the doors thereof , the locks thereof , and the bars thereof .
3 : 19 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua , the ruler of Mizpah , another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall .
4 : 7 But it came to pass , that when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and the Arabians , and the Ammonites , and the Ashdodites , heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up , and that the breaches began to be stopped , then they were very wroth , 4 : 8 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem , and to hinder it .
4 : 10 And Judah said , The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed , and there is much rubbish ; so that we are not able to build the wall .
4 : 13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall , and on the higher places , I even set the people after their families with their swords , their spears , and their bows .
4 : 16 And it came to pass from that time forth , that the half of my servants wrought in the work , and the other half of them held both the spears , the shields , and the bows , and the habergeons ; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah .
4 : 21 So we laboured in the work : and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared .
5 : 4 There were also that said , We have borrowed money for the king ' s tribute , and that upon our lands and vineyards .
5 : 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words .
5 : 16 Yea , also I continued in the work of this wall , neither bought we any land : and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work .
5 : 19 Think upon me , my God , for good , according to all that I have done for this people .
6 : 1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat , and Tobiah , and Geshem the Arabian , and the rest of our enemies , heard that I had builded the wall , and that there was no breach left therein ; ( though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates ;) 6 : 2 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me , saying , Come , let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono .
6 : 3 And I sent messengers unto them , saying , I am doing a great work , so that I cannot come down : why should the work cease , whilst I leave it , and come down to you ?
6 : 4 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort ; and I answered them after the same manner .
and who is there , that , being as I am , would go into the temple to save his life ?
6 : 12 And , lo , I perceived that God had not sent him ; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me : for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him .
7 : 9 The children of Shephatiah , three hundred seventy and two .
7 : 18 The children of Adonikam , six hundred threescore and seven .
7 : 19 The children of Bigvai , two thousand threescore and seven .
7 : 21 The children of Ater of Hezekiah , ninety and eight .
7 : 43 The Levites : the children of Jeshua , of Kadmiel , and of the children of Hodevah , seventy and four .
7 : 64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy , but it was not found : therefore were they , as polluted , put from the priesthood .
7 : 68 Their horses , seven hundred thirty and six : their mules , two hundred forty and five : 7 : 69 Their camels , four hundred thirty and five : six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses .
8 : 10 Then he said unto them , Go your way , eat the fat , and drink the sweet , and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared : for this day is holy unto our LORD : neither be ye sorry ; for the joy of the LORD is your strength .
8 : 11 So the Levites stilled all the people , saying , Hold your peace , for the day is holy ; neither be ye grieved .
8 : 14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses , that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month : 8 : 15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities , and in Jerusalem , saying , Go forth unto the mount , and fetch olive branches , and pine branches , and myrtle branches , and palm branches , and branches of thick trees , to make booths , as it is written .
8 : 16 So the people went forth , and brought them , and made themselves booths , every one upon the roof of his house , and in their courts , and in the courts of the house of God , and in the street of the water gate , and in the street of the gate of Ephraim .
9 : 32 Now therefore , our God , the great , the mighty , and the terrible God , who keepest covenant and mercy , let not all the trouble seem little before thee , that hath come upon us , on our kings , on our princes , and on our priests , and on our prophets , and on our fathers , and on all thy people , since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day .
10 : 28 And the rest of the people , the priests , the Levites , the porters , the singers , the Nethinims , and all they that had separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law of God , their wives , their sons , and their daughters , every one having knowledge , and having understanding ; 10 : 29 They clave to their brethren , their nobles , and entered into a curse , and into an oath , to walk in God ' s law , which was given by Moses the servant of God , and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord , and his judgments and his statutes ; 10 : 30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land , not take their daughters for our sons : 10 : 31 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell , that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath , or on the holy day : and that we would leave the seventh year , and the exaction of every debt .
11 : 6 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred threescore and eight valiant men .
11 : 7 And these are the sons of Benjamin ; Sallu the son of Meshullam , the son of Joed , the son of Pedaiah , the son of Kolaiah , the son of Maaseiah , the son of Ithiel , the son of Jesaiah .
11 : 20 And the residue of Israel , of the priests , and the Levites , were in all the cities of Judah , every one in his inheritance .
And they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom .
12 : 1 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , and Jeshua : Seraiah , Jeremiah , Ezra , 12 : 2 Amariah , Malluch , Hattush , 12 : 3 Shechaniah , Rehum , Meremoth , 12 : 4 Iddo , Ginnetho , Abijah , 12 : 5 Miamin , Maadiah , Bilgah , 12 : 6 Shemaiah , and Joiarib , Jedaiah , 12 : 7 Sallu , Amok , Hilkiah , Jedaiah .
12 : 8 Moreover the Levites : Jeshua , Binnui , Kadmiel , Sherebiah , Judah , and Mattaniah , which was over the thanksgiving , he and his brethren .
12 : 31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall , and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks , whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate : 12 : 32 And after them went Hoshaiah , and half of the princes of Judah , 12 : 33 And Azariah , Ezra , and Meshullam , 12 : 34 Judah , and Benjamin , and Shemaiah , and Jeremiah , 12 : 35 And certain of the priests ' sons with trumpets ; namely , Zechariah the son of Jonathan , the son of Shemaiah , the son of Mattaniah , the son of Michaiah , the son of Zaccur , the son of Asaph : 12 : 36 And his brethren , Shemaiah , and Azarael , Milalai , Gilalai , Maai , Nethaneel , and Judah , Hanani , with the musical instruments of David the man of God , and Ezra the scribe before them .
12 : 45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God , and the ward of the purification , according to the commandment of David , and of Solomon his son .
13 : 3 Now it came to pass , when they had heard the law , that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude .
13 : 14 Remember me , O my God , concerning this , and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God , and for the offices thereof .
13 : 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things ?
Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath .
1 : 19 If it please the king , let there go a royal commandment from him , and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes , that it be not altered , That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus ; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she .
1 : 20 And when the king ' s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire , ( for it is great ,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour , both to great and small .
2 : 9 And the maiden pleased him , and she obtained kindness of him ; and he speedily gave her her things for purification , with such things as belonged to her , and seven maidens , which were meet to be given her , out of the king ' s house : and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women .
2 : 10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred : for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it .
2 : 14 In the evening she went , and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women , to the custody of Shaashgaz , the king ' s chamberlain , which kept the concubines : she came in unto the king no more , except the king delighted in her , and that she were called by name .
2 : 20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people ; as Mordecai had charged her : for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai , like as when she was brought up with him .
3 : 4 Now it came to pass , when they spake daily unto him , and he hearkened not unto them , that they told Haman , to see whether Mordecai ' s matters would stand : for he had told them that he was a Jew .
3 : 7 In the first month , that is , the month Nisan , in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus , they cast Pur , that is , the lot , before Haman from day to day , and from month to month , to the twelfth month , that is , the month Adar .
3 : 13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king ' s provinces , to destroy , to kill , and to cause to perish , all Jews , both young and old , little children and women , in one day , even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar , and to take the spoil of them for a prey .
4 : 7 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him , and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king ' s treasuries for the Jews , to destroy them .
4 : 15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer , 4 : 16 Go , gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan , and fast ye for me , and neither eat nor drink three days , night or day : I also and my maidens will fast likewise ; and so will I go in unto the king , which is not according to the law : and if I perish , I perish .
even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed .
5 : 12 Haman said moreover , Yea , Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself ; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king .
Now Haman was come into the outward court of the king ' s house , to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him .
6 : 12 And Mordecai came again to the king ' s gate .
and it shall be performed , even to the half of the kingdom .
7 : 7 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden : and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen ; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king .
And Mordecai came before the king ; for Esther had told what he was unto her .
8 : 8 Write ye also for the Jews , as it liketh you , in the king ' s name , and seal it with the king ' s ring : for the writing which is written in the king ' s name , and sealed with the king ' s ring , may no man reverse .
8 : 10 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus ' name , and sealed it with the king ' s ring , and sent letters by posts on horseback , and riders on mules , camels , and young dromedaries : 8 : 11 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to gather themselves together , and to stand for their life , to destroy , to slay and to cause to perish , all the power of the people and province that would assault them , both little ones and women , and to take the spoil of them for a prey , 8 : 12 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus , namely , upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month , which is the month Adar .
And many of the people of the land became Jews ; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them .
9 : 6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men .
9 : 7 And Parshandatha , and Dalphon , and Aspatha , 9 : 8 And Poratha , and Adalia , and Aridatha , 9 : 9 And Parmashta , and Arisai , and Aridai , and Vajezatha , 9 : 10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha , the enemy of the Jews , slew they ; but on the spoil laid they not their hand .
9 : 13 Then said Esther , If it please the king , let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day ' s decree , and let Haman ' s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows .
9 : 26 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur .
9 : 29 Then Esther the queen , the daughter of Abihail , and Mordecai the Jew , wrote with all authority , to confirm this second letter of Purim .
10 : 3 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus , and great among the Jews , and accepted of the multitude of his brethren , seeking the wealth of his people , and speaking peace to all his seed .
1 : 5 And it was so , when the days of their feasting were gone about , that Job sent and sanctified them , and rose up early in the morning , and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all : for Job said , It may be that my sons have sinned , and cursed God in their hearts .
Thus did Job continually .
Then Satan answered the LORD , and said , From going to and fro in the earth , and from walking up and down in it .
1 : 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him , and about his house , and about all that he hath on every side ?
1 : 13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ' s house : 1 : 14 And there came a messenger unto Job , and said , The oxen were plowing , and the asses feeding beside them : 1 : 15 And the Sabeans fell upon them , and took them away ; yea , they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
1 : 16 While he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The fire of God is fallen from heaven , and hath burned up the sheep , and the servants , and consumed them ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
1 : 17 While he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , The Chaldeans made out three bands , and fell upon the camels , and have carried them away , yea , and slain the servants with the edge of the sword ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
1 : 18 While he was yet speaking , there came also another , and said , Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother ' s house : 1 : 19 And , behold , there came a great wind from the wilderness , and smote the four corners of the house , and it fell upon the young men , and they are dead ; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee .
2 : 3 And the LORD said unto Satan , Hast thou considered my servant Job , that there is none like him in the earth , a perfect and an upright man , one that feareth God , and escheweth evil ?
2 : 5 But put forth thine hand now , and touch his bone and his flesh , and he will curse thee to thy face .
3 : 4 Let that day be darkness ; let not God regard it from above , neither let the light shine upon it .
3 : 18 There the prisoners rest together ; they hear not the voice of the oppressor .
3 : 26 I was not in safety , neither had I rest , neither was I quiet ; yet trouble came .
but who can withhold himself from speaking ?
4 : 5 But now it is come upon thee , and thou faintest ; it toucheth thee , and thou art troubled .
4 : 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey , and the stout lion ' s whelps are scattered abroad .
5 : 12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty , so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise .
5 : 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace ; and thou shalt visit thy habitation , and shalt not sin .
5 : 27 Lo this , we have searched it , so it is ; hear it , and know thou it for thy good .
6 : 5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass ?
and what is mine end , that I should prolong my life ?
6 : 12 Is my strength the strength of stones ?
and is wisdom driven quite from me ?
6 : 14 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend ; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty .
6 : 15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook , and as the stream of brooks they pass away ; 6 : 16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice , and wherein the snow is hid : 6 : 17 What time they wax warm , they vanish : when it is hot , they are consumed out of their place .
6 : 18 The paths of their way are turned aside ; they go to nothing , and perish .
6 : 19 The troops of Tema looked , the companies of Sheba waited for them .
6 : 20 They were confounded because they had hoped ; they came thither , and were ashamed .
are not his days also like the days of an hireling ?
7 : 8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more : thine eyes are upon me , and I am not .
7 : 12 Am I a sea , or a whale , that thou settest a watch over me ?
8 : 7 Though thy beginning was small , yet thy latter end should greatly increase .
8 : 8 For enquire , I pray thee , of the former age , and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers : 8 : 9 ( For we are but of yesterday , and know nothing , because our days upon earth are a shadow :) 8 : 10 Shall not they teach thee , and tell thee , and utter words out of their heart ?
8 : 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap , and seeth the place of stones .
8 : 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame ; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought .
9 : 6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place , and the pillars thereof tremble .
10 : 9 Remember , I beseech thee , that thou hast made me as the clay ; and wilt thou bring me into dust again ?
and should a man full of talk be justified ?
and when thou mockest , shall no man make thee ashamed ?
11 : 5 But oh that God would speak , and open his lips against thee ; 11 : 6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom , that they are double to that which is !
12 : 23 He increaseth the nations , and destroyeth them : he enlargeth the nations , and straiteneth them again .
13 : 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty , and I desire to reason with God .
13 : 6 Hear now my reasoning , and hearken to the pleadings of my lips .
13 : 16 He also shall be my salvation : for an hypocrite shall not come before him .
make me to know my transgression and my sin .
13 : 25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro ?
14 : 3 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one , and bringest me into judgment with thee ?
14 : 10 But man dieth , and wasteth away : yea , man giveth up the ghost , and where is he ?
14 : 14 If a man die , shall he live again ?
14 : 22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain , and his soul within him shall mourn .
15 : 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite , and said , 15 : 2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge , and fill his belly with the east wind ?
15 : 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk ?
or with speeches wherewith he can do no good ?
15 : 7 Art thou the first man that was born ?
15 : 9 What knowest thou , that we know not ?
15 : 10 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men , much elder than thy father .
15 : 17 I will shew thee , hear me ; and that which I have seen I will declare ; 15 : 18 Which wise men have told from their fathers , and have not hid it : 15 : 19 Unto whom alone the earth was given , and no stranger passed among them .
he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand .
15 : 31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity : for vanity shall be his recompence .
15 : 32 It shall be accomplished before his time , and his branch shall not be green .
16 : 4 I also could speak as ye do : if your soul were in my soul ' s stead , I could heap up words against you , and shake mine head at you .
16 : 7 But now he hath made me weary : thou hast made desolate all my company .
17 : 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow , and all my members are as a shadow .
17 : 11 My days are past , my purposes are broken off , even the thoughts of my heart .
18 : 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet , and he walketh upon a snare .
18 : 9 The gin shall take him by the heel , and the robber shall prevail against him .
18 : 12 His strength shall be hungerbitten , and destruction shall be ready at his side .
18 : 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle , because it is none of his : brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation .
18 : 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people , nor any remaining in his dwellings .
18 : 20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day , as they that went before were affrighted .
19 : 18 Yea , young children despised me ; I arose , and they spake against me .
19 : 28 But ye should say , Why persecute we him , seeing the root of the matter is found in me ?
19 : 29 Be ye afraid of the sword : for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword , that ye may know there is a judgment .
20 : 17 He shall not see the rivers , the floods , the brooks of honey and butter .
20 : 22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits : every hand of the wicked shall come upon him .
20 : 26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places : a fire not blown shall consume him ; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle .
20 : 29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God , and the heritage appointed unto him by God .
21 : 5 Mark me , and be astonished , and lay your hand upon your mouth .
21 : 10 Their bull gendereth , and faileth not ; their cow calveth , and casteth not her calf .
21 : 15 What is the Almighty , that we should serve him ?
21 : 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children : he rewardeth him , and he shall know it .
seeing he judgeth those that are high .
21 : 27 Behold , I know your thoughts , and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me .
21 : 34 How then comfort ye me in vain , seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood ?
22 : 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said , 22 : 2 Can a man be profitable unto God , as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself ?
22 : 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee ?
22 : 8 But as for the mighty man , he had the earth ; and the honourable man dwelt in it .
22 : 10 Therefore snares are round about thee , and sudden fear troubleth thee ; 22 : 11 Or darkness , that thou canst not see ; and abundance of waters cover thee .
22 : 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty , and shalt lift up thy face unto God .
22 : 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him , and he shall hear thee , and thou shalt pay thy vows .
22 : 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing , and it shall be established unto thee : and the light shall shine upon thy ways .
23 : 7 There the righteous might dispute with him ; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge .
23 : 16 For God maketh my heart soft , and the Almighty troubleth me : 23 : 17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness , neither hath he covered the darkness from my face .
24 : 2 Some remove the landmarks ; they violently take away flocks , and feed thereof .
24 : 4 They turn the needy out of the way : the poor of the earth hide themselves together .
24 : 12 Men groan from out of the city , and the soul of the wounded crieth out : yet God layeth not folly to them .
24 : 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy , and in the night is as a thief .
24 : 21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not : and doeth not good to the widow .
24 : 23 Though it be given him to be in safety , whereon he resteth ; yet his eyes are upon their ways .
26 : 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof .
27 : 14 If his children be multiplied , it is for the sword : and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread .
27 : 16 Though he heap up silver as the dust , and prepare raiment as the clay ; 27 : 17 He may prepare it , but the just shall put it on , and the innocent shall divide the silver .
28 : 5 As for the earth , out of it cometh bread : and under it is turned up as it were fire .
28 : 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir , with the precious onyx , or the sapphire .
28 : 18 No mention shall be made of coral , or of pearls : for the price of wisdom is above rubies .
and where is the place of understanding ?
29 : 10 The nobles held their peace , and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth .
29 : 16 I was a father to the poor : and the cause which I knew not I searched out .
29 : 17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked , and plucked the spoil out of his teeth .
30 : 8 They were children of fools , yea , children of base men : they were viler than the earth .
30 : 14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters : in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me .
30 : 17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season : and my sinews take no rest .
30 : 18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed : it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat .
30 : 26 When I looked for good , then evil came unto me : and when I waited for light , there came darkness .
30 : 28 I went mourning without the sun : I stood up , and I cried in the congregation .
30 : 31 My harp also is turned to mourning , and my organ into the voice of them that weep .
31 : 2 For what portion of God is there from above ?
31 : 24 If I have made gold my hope , or have said to the fine gold , Thou art my confidence ; 31 : 25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great , and because mine hand had gotten much ; 31 : 26 If I beheld the sun when it shined , or the moon walking in brightness ; 31 : 27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed , or my mouth hath kissed my hand : 31 : 28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge : for I should have denied the God that is above .
31 : 38 If my land cry against me , or that the furrows likewise thereof complain ; 31 : 39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money , or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life : 31 : 40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat , and cockle instead of barley .
32 : 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job , because he was righteous in his own eyes .
32 : 14 Now he hath not directed his words against me : neither will I answer him with your speeches .
32 : 22 For I know not to give flattering titles ; in so doing my maker would soon take me away .
33 : 2 Behold , now I have opened my mouth , my tongue hath spoken in my mouth .
33 : 7 Behold , my terror shall not make thee afraid , neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee .
33 : 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit , and his life from perishing by the sword .
33 : 23 If there be a messenger with him , an interpreter , one among a thousand , to shew unto man his uprightness : 33 : 24 Then he is gracious unto him , and saith , Deliver him from going down to the pit : I have found a ransom .
34 : 1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said , 34 : 2 Hear my words , O ye wise men ; and give ear unto me , ye that have knowledge .
34 : 10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding : far be it from God , that he should do wickedness ; and from the Almighty , that he should commit iniquity .
34 : 12 Yea , surely God will not do wickedly , neither will the Almighty pervert judgment .
and to princes , Ye are ungodly ?
for they all are the work of his hands .
34 : 26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others ; 34 : 27 Because they turned back from him , and would not consider any of his ways : 34 : 28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him , and he heareth the cry of the afflicted .
and , What profit shall I have , if I be cleansed from my sin ?
35 : 4 I will answer thee , and thy companions with thee .
36 : 4 For truly my words shall not be false : he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee .
36 : 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous : but with kings are they on the throne ; yea , he doth establish them for ever , and they are exalted .
36 : 20 Desire not the night , when people are cut off in their place .
37 : 14 Hearken unto this , O Job : stand still , and consider the wondrous works of God .
37 : 16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds , the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge ?
37 : 22 Fair weather cometh out of the north : with God is terrible majesty .
38 : 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man ; for I will demand of thee , and answer thou me .
or who hath stretched the line upon it ?
38 : 17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee ?
38 : 22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow ?
38 : 35 Canst thou send lightnings , that they may go and say unto thee , Here we are ?
38 : 37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom ?
39 : 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow ?
or wilt thou leave thy labour to him ?
39 : 16 She is hardened against her young ones , as though they were not her ' s : her labour is in vain without fear ; 39 : 17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom , neither hath he imparted to her understanding .
39 : 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high , she scorneth the horse and his rider .
39 : 25 He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting .
39 : 26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom , and stretch her wings toward the south ?
or canst thou thunder with a voice like him ?
40 : 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath : and behold every one that is proud , and abase him .
40 : 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food , where all the beasts of the field play .
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down ?
41 : 3 Will he make many supplications unto thee ?
wilt thou take him for a servant for ever ?
41 : 10 None is so fierce that dare stir him up : who then is able to stand before me ?
41 : 12 I will not conceal his parts , nor his power , nor his comely proportion .
41 : 13 Who can discover the face of his garment ?
42 : 6 Wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes .
42 : 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters .
2 : 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath , and vex them in his sore displeasure .
2 : 6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion .
Blessed are all they that put their trust in him .
3 : 2 Many there be which say of my soul , There is no help for him in God .
3 : 3 But thou , O LORD , art a shield for me ; my glory , and the lifter up of mine head .
5 : 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight : thou hatest all workers of iniquity .
5 : 8 Lead me , O LORD , in thy righteousness because of mine enemies ; make thy way straight before my face .
6 : 2 Have mercy upon me , O LORD ; for I am weak : O LORD , heal me ; for my bones are vexed .
6 : 3 My soul is also sore vexed : but thou , O LORD , how long ?
6 : 7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief ; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies .
7 : 17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness : and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high .
9 : 1 I will praise thee , O LORD , with my whole heart ; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works .
9 : 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever : he hath prepared his throne for judgment .
10 : 2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor : let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined .
10 : 5 His ways are always grievous ; thy judgments are far above out of his sight : as for all his enemies , he puffeth at them .
10 : 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud : under his tongue is mischief and vanity .
10 : 12 Arise , O LORD ; O God , lift up thine hand : forget not the humble .
10 : 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God ?
10 : 16 The LORD is King for ever and ever : the heathen are perished out of his land .
11 : 5 The LORD trieth the righteous : but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth .
who shall dwell in thy holy hill ?
15 : 2 He that walketh uprightly , and worketh righteousness , and speaketh the truth in his heart .
16 : 5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup : thou maintainest my lot .
18 : 14 Yea , he sent out his arrows , and scattered them ; and he shot out lightnings , and discomfited them .
18 : 15 Then the channels of waters were seen , and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke , O LORD , at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils .
18 : 18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity : but the LORD was my stay .
18 : 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD , and have not wickedly departed from my God .
18 : 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people ; but wilt bring down high looks .
18 : 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise : they are fallen under my feet .
18 : 44 As soon as they hear of me , they shall obey me : the strangers shall submit themselves unto me .
20 : 3 Remember all thy offerings , and accept thy burnt sacrifice ; Selah .
20 : 5 We will rejoice in thy salvation , and in the name of our God we will set up our banners : the LORD fulfil all thy petitions .
21 : 2 Thou hast given him his heart ' s desire , and hast not withholden the request of his lips .
21 : 4 He asked life of thee , and thou gavest it him , even length of days for ever and ever .
22 : 9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb : thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother ' s breasts .
22 : 23 Ye that fear the LORD , praise him ; all ye the seed of Jacob , glorify him ; and fear him , all ye the seed of Israel .
22 : 31 They shall come , and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born , that he hath done this .
23 : 4 Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil : for thou art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me .
24 : 2 For he hath founded it upon the seas , and established it upon the floods .
Selah .
24 : 7 Lift up your heads , O ye gates ; and be ye lift up , ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in .
Selah .
25 : 4 Shew me thy ways , O LORD ; teach me thy paths .
25 : 10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies .
25 : 20 O keep my soul , and deliver me : let me not be ashamed ; for I put my trust in thee .
26 : 3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes : and I have walked in thy truth .
26 : 4 I have not sat with vain persons , neither will I go in with dissemblers .
26 : 6 I will wash mine hands in innocency : so will I compass thine altar , O LORD :
26 : 12 My foot standeth in an even place : in the congregations will I bless the LORD .
27 : 1 The LORD is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear ?
27 : 5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me ; he shall set me up upon a rock .
27 : 7 Hear , O LORD , when I cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me , and answer me .
27 : 9 Hide not thy face far from me ; put not thy servant away in anger : thou hast been my help ; leave me not , neither forsake me , O God of my salvation .
29 : 1 Give unto the LORD , O ye mighty , give unto the LORD glory and strength .
29 : 4 The voice of the LORD is powerful ; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty .
29 : 6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf ; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn .
29 : 9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve , and discovereth the forests : and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory .
29 : 11 The LORD will give strength unto his people ; the LORD will bless his people with peace .
31 : 3 For thou art my rock and my fortress ; therefore for thy name ' s sake lead me , and guide me .
31 : 4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me : for thou art my strength .
31 : 13 For I have heard the slander of many : fear was on every side : while they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my life .
31 : 22 For I said in my haste , I am cut off from before thine eyes : nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee .
31 : 24 Be of good courage , and he shall strengthen your heart , all ye that hope in the LORD .
32 : 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me : my moisture is turned into the drought of summer .
I said , I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD ; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin .
32 : 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found : surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him .
32 : 9 Be ye not as the horse , or as the mule , which have no understanding : whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle , lest they come near unto thee .
32 : 10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked : but he that trusteth in the LORD , mercy shall compass him about .
33 : 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made ; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth .
33 : 12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD ; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance .
33 : 17 An horse is a vain thing for safety : neither shall he deliver any by his great strength .
34 : 2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD : the humble shall hear thereof , and be glad .
34 : 7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him , and delivereth them .
34 : 10 The young lions do lack , and suffer hunger : but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing .
34 : 12 What man is he that desireth life , and loveth many days , that he may see good ?
34 : 19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous : but the LORD delivereth him out of them all .
34 : 20 He keepeth all his bones : not one of them is broken .
35 : 2 Take hold of shield and buckler , and stand up for mine help .
35 : 10 All my bones shall say , LORD , who is like unto thee , which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him , yea , the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him ?
35 : 11 False witnesses did rise up ; they laid to my charge things that I knew not .
35 : 23 Stir up thyself , and awake to my judgment , even unto my cause , my God and my Lord .
36 : 6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains ; thy judgments are a great deep : O LORD , thou preservest man and beast .
36 : 7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness , O God !
37 : 6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light , and thy judgment as the noonday .
37 : 16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked .
37 : 21 The wicked borroweth , and payeth not again : but the righteous sheweth mercy , and giveth .
37 : 22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth ; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off .
38 : 2 For thine arrows stick fast in me , and thy hand presseth me sore .
38 : 14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not , and in whose mouth are no reproofs .
38 : 16 For I said , Hear me , lest otherwise they should rejoice over me : when my foot slippeth , they magnify themselves against me .
38 : 18 For I will declare mine iniquity ; I will be sorry for my sin .
39 : 4 LORD , make me to know mine end , and the measure of my days , what it is : that I may know how frail I am .
39 : 5 Behold , thou hast made my days as an handbreadth ; and mine age is as nothing before thee : verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity .
39 : 7 And now , Lord , what wait I for ?
39 : 10 Remove thy stroke away from me : I am consumed by the blow of thine hand .
40 : 4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust , and respecteth not the proud , nor such as turn aside to lies .
41 : 11 By this I know that thou favourest me , because mine enemy doth not triumph over me .
Amen , and Amen .
42 : 1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks , so panteth my soul after thee , O God .
42 : 10 As with a sword in my bones , mine enemies reproach me ; while they say daily unto me , Where is thy God ?
43 : 4 Then will I go unto the altar of God , unto God my exceeding joy : yea , upon the harp will I praise thee , O God my God .
44 : 6 For I will not trust in my bow , neither shall my sword save me .
44 : 9 But thou hast cast off , and put us to shame ; and goest not forth with our armies .
44 : 17 All this is come upon us ; yet have we not forgotten thee , neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant .
45 : 3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh , O most mighty , with thy glory and thy majesty .
45 : 10 Hearken , O daughter , and consider , and incline thine ear ; forget also thine own people , and thy father ' s house ;
46 : 7 The LORD of hosts is with us ; the God of Jacob is our refuge .
46 : 8 Come , behold the works of the LORD , what desolations he hath made in the earth .
46 : 10 Be still , and know that I am God : I will be exalted among the heathen , I will be exalted in the earth .
47 : 3 He shall subdue the people under us , and the nations under our feet .
49 : 6 They that trust in their wealth , and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches ;
49 : 8 ( For the redemption of their soul is precious , and it ceaseth for ever :)
Selah .
Selah .
50 : 8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings , to have been continually before me .
51 : 9 Hide thy face from my sins , and blot out all mine iniquities .
51 : 16 For thou desirest not sacrifice ; else would I give it : thou delightest not in burnt offering .
Selah .
52 : 8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God : I trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever .
53 : 5 There were they in great fear , where no fear was : for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee : thou hast put them to shame , because God hath despised them .
55 : 1 Give ear to my prayer , O God ; and hide not thyself from my supplication .
55 : 6 And I said , Oh that I had wings like a dove !
for then would I fly away , and be at rest .
55 : 13 But it was thou , a man mine equal , my guide , and mine acquaintance .
55 : 16 As for me , I will call upon God ; and the LORD shall save me .
55 : 22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD , and he shall sustain thee : he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved .
55 : 23 But thou , O God , shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction : bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days ; but I will trust in thee .
56 : 8 Thou tellest my wanderings : put thou my tears into thy bottle : are they not in thy book ?
57 : 2 I will cry unto God most high ; unto God that performeth all things for me .
57 : 3 He shall send from heaven , and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up .
Selah .
57 : 5 Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens ; let thy glory be above all the earth .
do ye judge uprightly , O ye sons of men ?
58 : 2 Yea , in heart ye work wickedness ; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth .
58 : 4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent : they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear ;
58 : 8 As a snail which melteth , let every one of them pass away : like the untimely birth of a woman , that they may not see the sun .
58 : 10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance : he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked .
59 : 5 Thou therefore , O LORD God of hosts , the God of Israel , awake to visit all the heathen : be not merciful to any wicked transgressors .
59 : 12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride : and for cursing and lying which they speak .
59 : 17 Unto thee , O my strength , will I sing : for God is my defence , and the God of my mercy .
60 : 2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble ; thou hast broken it : heal the breaches thereof ; for it shaketh .
60 : 4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee , that it may be displayed because of the truth .
Selah .
and thou , O God , which didst not go out with our armies ?
60 : 11 Give us help from trouble : for vain is the help of man .
61 : 2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee , when my heart is overwhelmed : lead me to the rock that is higher than I .
61 : 8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever , that I may daily perform my vows .
62 : 3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man ?
Selah .
62 : 10 Trust not in oppression , and become not vain in robbery : if riches increase , set not your heart upon them .
63 : 7 Because thou hast been my help , therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice .
65 : 4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest , and causest to approach unto thee , that he may dwell in thy courts : we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house , even of thy holy temple .
65 : 5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us , O God of our salvation ; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth , and of them that are afar off upon the sea :
65 : 8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens : thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice .
65 : 10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly : thou settlest the furrows thereof : thou makest it soft with showers : thou blessest the springing thereof .
66 : 2 Sing forth the honour of his name : make his praise glorious .
66 : 4 All the earth shall worship thee , and shall sing unto thee ; they shall sing to thy name .
Selah .
Selah .
68 : 7 O God , when thou wentest forth before thy people , when thou didst march through the wilderness ; Selah :
68 : 10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein : thou , O God , hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor .
68 : 18 Thou hast ascended on high , thou hast led captivity captive : thou hast received gifts for men ; yea , for the rebellious also , that the LORD God might dwell among them .
68 : 21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies , and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses .
68 : 34 Ascribe ye strength unto God : his excellency is over Israel , and his strength is in the clouds .
69 : 20 Reproach hath broken my heart ; and I am full of heaviness : and I looked for some to take pity , but there was none ; and for comforters , but I found none .
69 : 36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it : and they that love his name shall dwell therein .
70 : 4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee : and let such as love thy salvation say continually , Let God be magnified .
71 : 12 O God , be not far from me : O my God , make haste for my help .
71 : 20 Thou , which hast shewed me great and sore troubles , shalt quicken me again , and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth .
72 : 13 He shall spare the poor and needy , and shall save the souls of the needy .
73 : 2 But as for me , my feet were almost gone ; my steps had well nigh slipped .
73 : 4 For there are no bands in their death : but their strength is firm .
73 : 10 Therefore his people return hither : and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them .
and is there knowledge in the most High ?
73 : 16 When I thought to know this , it was too painful for me ;
73 : 23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee : thou hast holden me by my right hand .
73 : 24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel , and afterward receive me to glory .
74 : 4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations ; they set up their ensigns for signs .
74 : 17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth : thou hast made summer and winter .
75 : 3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved : I bear up the pillars of it .
75 : 8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup , and the wine is red ; it is full of mixture ; and he poureth out of the same : but the dregs thereof , all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out , and drink them .
76 : 1 In Judah is God known : his name is great in Israel .
76 : 6 At thy rebuke , O God of Jacob , both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep .
77 : 1 I cried unto God with my voice , even unto God with my voice ; and he gave ear unto me .
77 : 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking : I am so troubled that I cannot speak .
Selah .
77 : 12 I will meditate also of all thy work , and talk of thy doings .
Selah .
77 : 19 Thy way is in the sea , and thy path in the great waters , and thy footsteps are not known .
78 : 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness .
78 : 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp , round about their habitations .
But while their meat was yet in their mouths ,
78 : 34 When he slew them , then they sought him : and they returned and enquired early after God .
78 : 41 Yea , they turned back and tempted God , and limited the Holy One of Israel .
78 : 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God , and kept not his testimonies :
78 : 57 But turned back , and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers : they were turned aside like a deceitful bow .
78 : 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places , and moved him to jealousy with their graven images .
78 : 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword ; and was wroth with his inheritance .
78 : 65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep , and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine .
78 : 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts : he put them to a perpetual reproach .
79 : 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven , the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth .
79 : 3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem ; and there was none to bury them .
79 : 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours , a scorn and derision to them that are round about us .
79 : 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee , and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name .
79 : 13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever : we will shew forth thy praise to all generations .
80 : 3 Turn us again , O God , and cause thy face to shine ; and we shall be saved .
81 : 1 Sing aloud unto God our strength : make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob .
81 : 12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts ' lust : and they walked in their own counsels .
81 : 13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me , and Israel had walked in my ways !
81 : 15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him : but their time should have endured for ever .
82 : 2 How long will ye judge unjustly , and accept the persons of the wicked ?
82 : 5 They know not , neither will they understand ; they walk on in darkness : all the foundations of the earth are out of course .
82 : 7 But ye shall die like men , and fall like one of the princes .
83 : 9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites ; as to Sisera , as to Jabin , at the brook of Kison :
83 : 11 Make their nobles like Oreb , and like Zeeb : yea , all their princes as Zebah , and as Zalmunna :
84 : 2 My soul longeth , yea , even fainteth for the courts of the LORD : my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God .
84 : 4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house : they will be still praising thee .
Selah .
84 : 9 Behold , O God our shield , and look upon the face of thine anointed .
85 : 2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people , thou hast covered all their sin .
85 : 9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him ; that glory may dwell in our land .
86 : 3 Be merciful unto me , O Lord : for I cry unto thee daily .
86 : 4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant : for unto thee , O Lord , do I lift up my soul .
86 : 17 Shew me a token for good ; that they which hate me may see it , and be ashamed : because thou , LORD , hast holpen me , and comforted me .
87 : 6 The LORD shall count , when he writeth up the people , that this man was born there .
88 : 2 Let my prayer come before thee : incline thine ear unto my cry ;
88 : 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me , and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves .
88 : 13 But unto thee have I cried , O LORD ; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee .
89 : 4 Thy seed will I establish for ever , and build up thy throne to all generations .
89 : 12 The north and the south thou hast created them : Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name .
89 : 24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him : and in my name shall his horn be exalted .
89 : 27 Also I will make him my firstborn , higher than the kings of the earth .
89 : 38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred , thou hast been wroth with thine anointed .
89 : 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges ; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin .
89 : 46 How long , LORD ?
90 : 4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past , and as a watch in the night .
90 : 7 For we are consumed by thine anger , and by thy wrath are we troubled .
90 : 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee , our secret sins in the light of thy countenance .
91 : 11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways .
91 : 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder : the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet .
92 : 3 Upon an instrument of ten strings , and upon the psaltery ; upon the harp with a solemn sound .
and thy thoughts are very deep .
92 : 13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God .
93 : 2 Thy throne is established of old : thou art from everlasting .
94 : 5 They break in pieces thy people , O LORD , and afflict thine heritage .
he that formed the eye , shall he not see ?
94 : 13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity , until the pit be digged for the wicked .
95 : 3 For the LORD is a great God , and a great King above all gods .
95 : 5 The sea is his , and he made it : and his hands formed the dry land .
95 : 8 Harden not your heart , as in the provocation , and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
96 : 1 O sing unto the LORD a new song : sing unto the LORD , all the earth .
96 : 2 Sing unto the LORD , bless his name ; shew forth his salvation from day to day .
96 : 3 Declare his glory among the heathen , his wonders among all people .
96 : 13 Before the LORD : for he cometh , for he cometh to judge the earth : he shall judge the world with righteousness , and the people with his truth .
98 : 7 Let the sea roar , and the fulness thereof ; the world , and they that dwell therein .
98 : 9 Before the LORD ; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall he judge the world , and the people with equity .
99 : 1 The LORD reigneth ; let the people tremble : he sitteth between the cherubims ; let the earth be moved .
99 : 8 Thou answeredst them , O LORD our God : thou wast a God that forgavest them , though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions .
100 : 2 Serve the LORD with gladness : come before his presence with singing .
100 : 3 Know ye that the LORD he is God : it is he that hath made us , and not we ourselves ; we are his people , and the sheep of his pasture .
100 : 4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving , and into his courts with praise : be thankful unto him , and bless his name .
101 : 7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house : he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight .
102 : 2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble ; incline thine ear unto me : in the day when I call answer me speedily .
102 : 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread , and mingled my drink with weeping .
102 : 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute , and not despise their prayer .
102 : 24 I said , O my God , take me not away in the midst of my days : thy years are throughout all generations .
103 : 2 Bless the LORD , O my soul , and forget not all his benefits :
103 : 8 The LORD is merciful and gracious , slow to anger , and plenteous in mercy .
103 : 12 As far as the east is from the west , so far hath he removed our transgressions from us .
103 : 14 For he knoweth our frame ; he remembereth that we are dust .
103 : 19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens ; and his kingdom ruleth over all .
104 : 1 Bless the LORD , O my soul .
O LORD my God , thou art very great ; thou art clothed with honour and majesty .
104 : 4 Who maketh his angels spirits ; his ministers a flaming fire :
104 : 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys , which run among the hills .
104 : 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle , and herb for the service of man : that he may bring forth food out of the earth ;
104 : 29 Thou hidest thy face , they are troubled : thou takest away their breath , they die , and return to their dust .
104 : 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit , they are created : and thou renewest the face of the earth .
104 : 35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth , and let the wicked be no more .
Praise ye the LORD .
105 : 11 Saying , Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan , the lot of your inheritance :
105 : 12 When they were but a few men in number ; yea , very few , and strangers in it .
105 : 20 The king sent and loosed him ; even the ruler of the people , and let him go free .
105 : 24 And he increased his people greatly ; and made them stronger than their enemies .
105 : 25 He turned their heart to hate his people , to deal subtilly with his servants .
105 : 33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees ; and brake the trees of their coasts .
105 : 40 The people asked , and he brought quails , and satisfied them with the bread of heaven .
O give thanks unto the LORD ; for he is good : for his mercy endureth for ever .
106 : 11 And the waters covered their enemies : there was not one of them left .
106 : 16 They envied Moses also in the camp , and Aaron the saint of the LORD .
106 : 24 Yea , they despised the pleasant land , they believed not his word :
106 : 25 But murmured in their tents , and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD .
106 : 26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them , to overthrow them in the wilderness :
106 : 30 Then stood up Phinehas , and executed judgment : and so the plague was stayed .
106 : 33 Because they provoked his spirit , so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips .
106 : 42 Their enemies also oppressed them , and they were brought into subjection under their hand .
106 : 45 And he remembered for them his covenant , and repented according to the multitude of his mercies .
107 : 7 And he led them forth by the right way , that they might go to a city of habitation .
107 : 26 They mount up to the heaven , they go down again to the depths : their soul is melted because of trouble .
107 : 28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble , and he bringeth them out of their distresses .
107 : 31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness , and for his wonderful works to the children of men !
107 : 33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness , and the watersprings into dry ground ;
107 : 34 A fruitful land into barrenness , for the wickedness of them that dwell therein .
108 : 2 Awake , psaltery and harp : I myself will awake early .
108 : 5 Be thou exalted , O God , above the heavens : and thy glory above all the earth ;
108 : 11 Wilt not thou , O God , who hast cast us off ?
109 : 1 Hold not thy peace , O God of my praise ;
109 : 22 For I am poor and needy , and my heart is wounded within me .
109 : 27 That they may know that this is thy hand ; that thou , LORD , hast done it .
110 : 2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion : rule thou in the midst of thine enemies .
111 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
111 : 7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment ; all his commandments are sure .
111 : 10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom : a good understanding have all they that do his commandments : his praise endureth for ever .
112 : 4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness : he is gracious , and full of compassion , and righteous .
113 : 4 The LORD is high above all nations , and his glory above the heavens .
114 : 2 Judah was his sanctuary , and Israel his dominion .
115 : 10 O house of Aaron , trust in the LORD : he is their help and their shield .
115 : 14 The LORD shall increase you more and more , you and your children .
116 : 5 Gracious is the LORD , and righteous ; yea , our God is merciful .
116 : 8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death , mine eyes from tears , and my feet from falling .
118 : 6 The LORD is on my side ; I will not fear : what can man do unto me ?
118 : 15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous : the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly .
118 : 17 I shall not die , but live , and declare the works of the LORD .
118 : 25 Save now , I beseech thee , O LORD : O LORD , I beseech thee , send now prosperity .
119 : 11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart , that I might not sin against thee .
119 : 16 I will delight myself in thy statutes : I will not forget thy word .
119 : 20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times .
119 : 47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments , which I have loved .
119 : 50 This is my comfort in my affliction : for thy word hath quickened me .
119 : 55 I have remembered thy name , O LORD , in the night , and have kept thy law .
119 : 63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee , and of them that keep thy precepts .
119 : 67 Before I was afflicted I went astray : but now have I kept thy word .
119 : 70 Their heart is as fat as grease ; but I delight in thy law .
119 : 72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver .
119 : 77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me , that I may live : for thy law is my delight .
119 : 78 Let the proud be ashamed ; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause : but I will meditate in thy precepts .
119 : 82 Mine eyes fail for thy word , saying , When wilt thou comfort me ?
119 : 86 All thy commandments are faithful : they persecute me wrongfully ; help thou me .
119 : 96 I have seen an end of all perfection : but thy commandment is exceeding broad .
119 : 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers : for thy testimonies are my meditation .
119 : 100 I understand more than the ancients , because I keep thy precepts .
119 : 101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way , that I might keep thy word .
119 : 102 I have not departed from thy judgments : for thou hast taught me .
119 : 115 Depart from me , ye evildoers : for I will keep the commandments of my God .
119 : 121 I have done judgment and justice : leave me not to mine oppressors .
119 : 147 I prevented the dawning of the morning , and cried : I hoped in thy word .
119 : 150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief : they are far from thy law .
119 : 153 Consider mine affliction , and deliver me : for I do not forget thy law .
119 : 154 Plead my cause , and deliver me : quicken me according to thy word .
119 : 158 I beheld the transgressors , and was grieved ; because they kept not thy word .
119 : 170 Let my supplication come before thee : deliver me according to thy word .
119 : 174 I have longed for thy salvation , O LORD ; and thy law is my delight .
120 : 2 Deliver my soul , O LORD , from lying lips , and from a deceitful tongue .
121 : 7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil : he shall preserve thy soul .
124 : 1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side , now may Israel say ;
124 : 7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers : the snare is broken , and we are escaped .
125 : 2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem , so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever .
126 : 5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy .
127 : 3 Lo , children are an heritage of the LORD : and the fruit of the womb is his reward .
128 : 4 Behold , that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD .
129 : 5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion .
129 : 7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand ; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom .
130 : 6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning : I say , more than they that watch for the morning .
131 : 3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever .
132 : 5 Until I find out a place for the LORD , an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob .
132 : 10 For thy servant David ' s sake turn not away the face of thine anointed .
132 : 17 There will I make the horn of David to bud : I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed .
132 : 18 His enemies will I clothe with shame : but upon himself shall his crown flourish .
133 : 1 Behold , how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity !
133 : 2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard , even Aaron ' s beard : that went down to the skirts of his garments ;
135 : 16 They have mouths , but they speak not ; eyes have they , but they see not ;
136 : 16 To him which led his people through the wilderness : for his mercy endureth for ever .
136 : 21 And gave their land for an heritage : for his mercy endureth for ever :
137 : 9 Happy shall he be , that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones .
138 : 1 I will praise thee with my whole heart : before the gods will I sing praise unto thee .
139 : 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit ?
139 : 15 My substance was not hid from thee , when I was made in secret , and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth .
139 : 16 Thine eyes did see my substance , yet being unperfect ; and in thy book all my members were written , which in continuance were fashioned , when as yet there was none of them .
139 : 20 For they speak against thee wickedly , and thine enemies take thy name in vain .
and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee ?
139 : 24 And see if there be any wicked way in me , and lead me in the way everlasting .
140 : 8 Grant not , O LORD , the desires of the wicked : further not his wicked device ; lest they exalt themselves .
141 : 8 But mine eyes are unto thee , O GOD the Lord : in thee is my trust ; leave not my soul destitute .
Selah .
143 : 8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning ; for in thee do I trust : cause me to know the way wherein I should walk ; for I lift up my soul unto thee .
144 : 7 Send thine hand from above ; rid me , and deliver me out of great waters , from the hand of strange children ;
144 : 10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings : who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword .
145 : 15 The eyes of all wait upon thee ; and thou givest them their meat in due season .
145 : 16 Thou openest thine hand , and satisfiest the desire of every living thing .
146 : 8 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind : the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down : the LORD loveth the righteous :
147 : 3 He healeth the broken in heart , and bindeth up their wounds .
147 : 6 The LORD lifteth up the meek : he casteth the wicked down to the ground .
147 : 16 He giveth snow like wool : he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes .
148 : 12 Both young men , and maidens ; old men , and children :
149 : 5 Let the saints be joyful in glory : let them sing aloud upon their beds .
150 : 1 Praise ye the LORD .
and the scorners delight in their scorning , and fools hate knowledge ?
2 : 1 My son , if thou wilt receive my words , and hide my commandments with thee ; 2 : 2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom , and apply thine heart to understanding ; 2 : 3 Yea , if thou criest after knowledge , and liftest up thy voice for understanding ; 2 : 4 If thou seekest her as silver , and searchest for her as for hid treasures ; 2 : 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD , and find the knowledge of God .
2 : 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth , and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it .
3 : 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes : fear the LORD , and depart from evil .
3 : 11 My son , despise not the chastening of the LORD ; neither be weary of his correction : 3 : 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth ; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth .
3 : 15 She is more precious than rubies : and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her .
3 : 34 Surely he scorneth the scorners : but he giveth grace unto the lowly .
4 : 3 For I was my father ' s son , tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother .
4 : 12 When thou goest , thy steps shall not be straitened ; and when thou runnest , thou shalt not stumble .
4 : 16 For they sleep not , except they have done mischief ; and their sleep is taken away , unless they cause some to fall .
4 : 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth , and perverse lips put far from thee .
5 : 7 Hear me now therefore , O ye children , and depart not from the words of my mouth .
6 : 10 Yet a little sleep , a little slumber , a little folding of the hands to sleep : 6 : 11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth , and thy want as an armed man .
6 : 13 He winketh with his eyes , he speaketh with his feet , he teacheth with his fingers ; 6 : 14 Frowardness is in his heart , he deviseth mischief continually ; he soweth discord .
6 : 15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly ; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy .
6 : 20 My son , keep thy father ' s commandment , and forsake not the law of thy mother : 6 : 21 Bind them continually upon thine heart , and tie them about thy neck .
6 : 23 For the commandment is a lamp ; and the law is light ; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life : 6 : 24 To keep thee from the evil woman , from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman .
6 : 29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour ' s wife ; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent .
6 : 33 A wound and dishonour shall he get ; and his reproach shall not be wiped away .
6 : 34 For jealousy is the rage of a man : therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance .
6 : 35 He will not regard any ransom ; neither will he rest content , though thou givest many gifts .
7 : 1 My son , keep my words , and lay up my commandments with thee .
7 : 2 Keep my commandments , and live ; and my law as the apple of thine eye .
7 : 18 Come , let us take our fill of love until the morning : let us solace ourselves with loves .
8 : 2 She standeth in the top of high places , by the way in the places of the paths .
8 : 5 O ye simple , understand wisdom : and , ye fools , be ye of an understanding heart .
8 : 13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil : pride , and arrogancy , and the evil way , and the froward mouth , do I hate .
8 : 35 For whoso findeth me findeth life , and shall obtain favour of the LORD .
9 : 12 If thou be wise , thou shalt be wise for thyself : but if thou scornest , thou alone shalt bear it .
10 : 19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin : but he that refraineth his lips is wise .
10 : 29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright : but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity .
10 : 30 The righteous shall never be removed : but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth .
11 : 6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them : but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness .
11 : 8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble , and the wicked cometh in his stead .
11 : 10 When it goeth well with the righteous , the city rejoiceth : and when the wicked perish , there is shouting .
11 : 13 A talebearer revealeth secrets : but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter .
11 : 16 A gracious woman retaineth honour : and strong men retain riches .
11 : 23 The desire of the righteous is only good : but the expectation of the wicked is wrath .
12 : 3 A man shall not be established by wickedness : but the root of the righteous shall not be moved .
12 : 4 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband : but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones .
12 : 6 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood : but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them .
12 : 13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips : but the just shall come out of trouble .
12 : 21 There shall no evil happen to the just : but the wicked shall be filled with mischief .
12 : 24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule : but the slothful shall be under tribute .
13 : 14 The law of the wise is a fountain of life , to depart from the snares of death .
13 : 18 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction : but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured .
13 : 24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son : but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes .
but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good .
15 : 16 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith .
15 : 23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth : and a word spoken in due season , how good is it !
16 : 5 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD : though hand join in hand , he shall not be unpunished .
16 : 20 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good : and whoso trusteth in the LORD , happy is he .
16 : 29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour , and leadeth him into the way that is not good .
17 : 1 Better is a dry morsel , and quietness therewith , than an house full of sacrifices with strife .
17 : 2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame , and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren .
17 : 6 Children ' s children are the crown of old men ; and the glory of children are their fathers .
17 : 7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool : much less do lying lips a prince .
18 : 3 When the wicked cometh , then cometh also contempt , and with ignominy reproach .
18 : 19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city : and their contentions are like the bars of a castle .
18 : 20 A man ' s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth ; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled .
18 : 21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue : and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof .
19 : 8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul : he that keepeth understanding shall find good .
19 : 10 Delight is not seemly for a fool ; much less for a servant to have rule over princes .
20 : 9 Who can say , I have made my heart clean , I am pure from my sin ?
21 : 10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil : his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes .
21 : 16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead .
21 : 19 It is better to dwell in the wilderness , than with a contentious and an angry woman .
21 : 26 He coveteth greedily all the day long : but the righteous giveth and spareth not .
21 : 31 The horse is prepared against the day of battle : but safety is of the LORD .
22 : 5 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward : he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them .
22 : 7 The rich ruleth over the poor , and the borrower is servant to the lender .
23 : 3 Be not desirous of his dainties : for they are deceitful meat .
23 : 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from hell .
23 : 15 My son , if thine heart be wise , my heart shall rejoice , even mine .
23 : 17 Let not thine heart envy sinners : but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long .
23 : 19 Hear thou , my son , and be wise , and guide thine heart in the way .
23 : 30 They that tarry long at the wine ; they that go to seek mixed wine .
24 : 7 Wisdom is too high for a fool : he openeth not his mouth in the gate .
24 : 10 If thou faint in the day of adversity , thy strength is small .
and shall not he render to every man according to his works ?
24 : 13 My son , eat thou honey , because it is good ; and the honeycomb , which is sweet to thy taste : 24 : 14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul : when thou hast found it , then there shall be a reward , and thy expectation shall not be cut off .
24 : 23 These things also belong to the wise .
25 : 9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself ; and discover not a secret to another : 25 : 10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame , and thine infamy turn not away .
25 : 18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul , and a sword , and a sharp arrow .
25 : 20 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather , and as vinegar upon nitre , so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart .
25 : 23 The north wind driveth away rain : so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue .
25 : 28 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down , and without walls .
26 : 6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet , and drinketh damage .
26 : 13 The slothful man saith , There is a lion in the way ; a lion is in the streets .
26 : 15 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom ; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth .
26 : 24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips , and layeth up deceit within him ; 26 : 25 When he speaketh fair , believe him not : for there are seven abominations in his heart .
26 : 26 Whose hatred is covered by deceit , his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation .
26 : 28 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it ; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin .
27 : 7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb ; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet .
27 : 10 Thine own friend , and thy father ' s friend , forsake not ; neither go into thy brother ' s house in the day of thy calamity : for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off .
27 : 16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind , and the ointment of his right hand , which bewrayeth itself .
27 : 21 As the fining pot for silver , and the furnace for gold ; so is a man to his praise .
28 : 3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food .
28 : 14 Happy is the man that feareth alway : but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief .
28 : 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings : but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent .
29 : 4 The king by judgment establisheth the land : but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it .
29 : 7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor : but the wicked regardeth not to know it .
29 : 11 A fool uttereth all his mind : but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards .
29 : 12 If a ruler hearken to lies , all his servants are wicked .
who hath established all the ends of the earth ?
30 : 11 There is a generation that curseth their father , and doth not bless their mother .
30 : 13 There is a generation , O how lofty are their eyes !
There are three things that are never satisfied , yea , four things say not , It is enough : 30 : 16 The grave ; and the barren womb ; the earth that is not filled with water ; and the fire that saith not , It is enough .
30 : 20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman ; she eateth , and wipeth her mouth , and saith , I have done no wickedness .
30 : 21 For three things the earth is disquieted , and for four which it cannot bear : 30 : 22 For a servant when he reigneth ; and a fool when he is filled with meat ; 30 : 23 For an odious woman when she is married ; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress .
30 : 24 There be four things which are little upon the earth , but they are exceeding wise : 30 : 25 The ants are a people not strong , yet they prepare their meat in the summer ; 30 : 26 The conies are but a feeble folk , yet make they their houses in the rocks ; 30 : 27 The locusts have no king , yet go they forth all of them by bands ; 30 : 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands , and is in kings ' palaces .
31 : 2 What , my son ?
31 : 9 Open thy mouth , judge righteously , and plead the cause of the poor and needy .
31 : 11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
31 : 18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good : her candle goeth not out by night .
Ecclesiastes
1 : 12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem .
1 : 16 I communed with mine own heart , saying , Lo , I am come to great estate , and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem : yea , my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge .
2 : 4 I made me great works ; I builded me houses ; I planted me vineyards : 2 : 5 I made me gardens and orchards , and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits : 2 : 6 I made me pools of water , to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees : 2 : 7 I got me servants and maidens , and had servants born in my house ; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me : 2 : 8 I gathered me also silver and gold , and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces : I gat me men singers and women singers , and the delights of the sons of men , as musical instruments , and that of all sorts .
2 : 9 So I was great , and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem : also my wisdom remained with me .
2 : 11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought , and on the labour that I had laboured to do : and , behold , all was vanity and vexation of spirit , and there was no profit under the sun .
2 : 13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly , as far as light excelleth darkness .
2 : 17 Therefore I hated life ; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me : for all is vanity and vexation of spirit .
This is also vanity .
2 : 26 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom , and knowledge , and joy : but to the sinner he giveth travail , to gather and to heap up , that he may give to him that is good before God .
3 : 10 I have seen the travail , which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it .
3 : 11 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time : also he hath set the world in their heart , so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end .
3 : 12 I know that there is no good in them , but for a man to rejoice , and to do good in his life .
4 : 3 Yea , better is he than both they , which hath not yet been , who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun .
4 : 16 There is no end of all the people , even of all that have been before them : they also that come after shall not rejoice in him .
5 : 3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business ; and a fool ' s voice is known by multitude of words .
5 : 7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities : but fear thou God .
6 : 5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun , nor known any thing : this hath more rest than the other .
6 : 7 All the labour of man is for his mouth , and yet the appetite is not filled .
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
7 : 2 It is better to go to the house of mourning , than to go to the house of feasting : for that is the end of all men ; and the living will lay it to his heart .
7 : 11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance : and by it there is profit to them that see the sun .
7 : 18 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this ; yea , also from this withdraw not thine hand : for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all .
7 : 27 Behold , this have I found , saith the preacher , counting one by one , to find out the account : 7 : 28 Which yet my soul seeketh , but I find not : one man among a thousand have I found ; but a woman among all those have I not found .
8 : 8 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit ; neither hath he power in the day of death : and there is no discharge in that war ; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it .
8 : 10 And so I saw the wicked buried , who had come and gone from the place of the holy , and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done : this is also vanity .
8 : 15 Then I commended mirth , because a man hath no better thing under the sun , than to eat , and to drink , and to be merry : for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life , which God giveth him under the sun .
9 : 1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this , that the righteous , and the wise , and their works , are in the hand of God : no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them .
10 : 1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour : so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour .
10 : 11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment ; and a babbler is no better .
10 : 14 A fool also is full of words : a man cannot tell what shall be ; and what shall be after him , who can tell him ?
10 : 16 Woe to thee , O land , when thy king is a child , and thy princes eat in the morning !
10 : 20 Curse not the king , no not in thy thought ; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber : for a bird of the air shall carry the voice , and that which hath wings shall tell the matter .
11 : 5 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit , nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child : even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all .
12 : 7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was : and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it .
12 : 8 Vanity of vanities , saith the preacher ; all is vanity .
1 : 4 Draw me , we will run after thee : the king hath brought me into his chambers : we will be glad and rejoice in thee , we will remember thy love more than wine : the upright love thee .
1 : 12 While the king sitteth at his table , my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof .
1 : 14 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi .
2 : 1 I am the rose of Sharon , and the lily of the valleys .
behold , he cometh leaping upon the mountains , skipping upon the hills .
Arise , my love , my fair one , and come away .
3 : 4 It was but a little that I passed from them , but I found him whom my soul loveth : I held him , and would not let him go , until I had brought him into my mother ' s house , and into the chamber of her that conceived me .
4 : 2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn , which came up from the washing ; whereof every one bear twins , and none is barren among them .
4 : 7 Thou art all fair , my love ; there is no spot in thee .
5 : 1 I am come into my garden , my sister , my spouse : I have gathered my myrrh with my spice ; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey ; I have drunk my wine with my milk : eat , O friends ; drink , yea , drink abundantly , O beloved .
5 : 11 His head is as the most fine gold , his locks are bushy , and black as a raven .
5 : 14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl : his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires .
6 : 1 Whither is thy beloved gone , O thou fairest among women ?
that we may seek him with thee .
6 : 10 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning , fair as the moon , clear as the sun , and terrible as an army with banners ?
8 : 1 O that thou wert as my brother , that sucked the breasts of my mother !
ye will revolt more and more : the whole head is sick , and the whole heart faint .
1 : 6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it ; but wounds , and bruises , and putrifying sores : they have not been closed , neither bound up , neither mollified with ointment .
1 : 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard , as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers , as a besieged city .
1 : 19 If ye be willing and obedient , ye shall eat the good of the land : 1 : 20 But if ye refuse and rebel , ye shall be devoured with the sword : for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it .
2 : 1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem .
2 : 3 And many people shall go and say , Come ye , and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD , to the house of the God of Jacob ; and he will teach us of his ways , and we will walk in his paths : for out of Zion shall go forth the law , and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem .
3 : 6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father , saying , Thou hast clothing , be thou our ruler , and let this ruin be under thy hand : 3 : 7 In that day shall he swear , saying , I will not be an healer ; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing : make me not a ruler of the people .
3 : 9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them ; and they declare their sin as Sodom , they hide it not .
3 : 12 As for my people , children are their oppressors , and women rule over them .
3 : 15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces , and grind the faces of the poor ?
saith the Lord GOD of hosts .
3 : 16 Moreover the LORD saith , Because the daughters of Zion are haughty , and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes , walking and mincing as they go , and making a tinkling with their feet : 3 : 17 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion , and the LORD will discover their secret parts .
5 : 3 And now , O inhabitants of Jerusalem , and men of Judah , judge , I pray you , betwixt me and my vineyard .
wherefore , when I looked that it should bring forth grapes , brought it forth wild grapes ?
5 : 11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink ; that continue until night , till wine inflame them !
5 : 12 And the harp , and the viol , the tabret , and pipe , and wine , are in their feasts : but they regard not the work of the LORD , neither consider the operation of his hands .
5 : 13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity , because they have no knowledge : and their honourable men are famished , and their multitude dried up with thirst .
For all this his anger is not turned away , but his hand is stretched out still .
6 : 2 Above it stood the seraphims : each one had six wings ; with twain he covered his face , and with twain he covered his feet , and with twain he did fly .
7 : 24 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither ; because all the land shall become briers and thorns .
7 : 25 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock , there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns : but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen , and for the treading of lesser cattle .
8 : 1 Moreover the LORD said unto me , Take thee a great roll , and write in it with a man ' s pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz .
8 : 5 The LORD spake also unto me again , saying , 8 : 6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly , and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah ' s son ; 8 : 7 Now therefore , behold , the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river , strong and many , even the king of Assyria , and all his glory : and he shall come up over all his channels , and go over all his banks : 8 : 8 And he shall pass through Judah ; he shall overflow and go over , he shall reach even to the neck ; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land , O Immanuel .
8 : 10 Take counsel together , and it shall come to nought ; speak the word , and it shall not stand : for God is with us .
8 : 18 Behold , I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts , which dwelleth in mount Zion .
9 : 2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light : they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death , upon them hath the light shined .
9 : 3 Thou hast multiplied the nation , and not increased the joy : they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest , and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil .
9 : 4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden , and the staff of his shoulder , the rod of his oppressor , as in the day of Midian .
9 : 6 For unto us a child is born , unto us a son is given : and the government shall be upon his shoulder : and his name shall be called Wonderful , Counsellor , The mighty God , The everlasting Father , The Prince of Peace .
9 : 7 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end , upon the throne of David , and upon his kingdom , to order it , and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever .
9 : 14 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail , branch and rush , in one day .
9 : 18 For wickedness burneth as the fire : it shall devour the briers and thorns , and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest , and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke .
10 : 8 For he saith , Are not my princes altogether kings ?
10 : 9 Is not Calno as Carchemish ?
is not Samaria as Damascus ?
10 : 20 And it shall come to pass in that day , that the remnant of Israel , and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob , shall no more again stay upon him that smote them ; but shall stay upon the LORD , the Holy One of Israel , in truth .
10 : 27 And it shall come to pass in that day , that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder , and his yoke from off thy neck , and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing .
10 : 33 Behold , the Lord , the LORD of hosts , shall lop the bough with terror : and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down , and the haughty shall be humbled .
12 : 3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation .
12 : 4 And in that day shall ye say , Praise the LORD , call upon his name , declare his doings among the people , make mention that his name is exalted .
13 : 3 I have commanded my sanctified ones , I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger , even them that rejoice in my highness .
13 : 7 Therefore shall all hands be faint , and every man ' s heart shall melt : 13 : 8 And they shall be afraid : pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them ; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth : they shall be amazed one at another ; their faces shall be as flames .
14 : 11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave , and the noise of thy viols : the worm is spread under thee , and the worms cover thee .
14 : 12 How art thou fallen from heaven , O Lucifer , son of the morning !
how art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken the nations !
14 : 13 For thou hast said in thine heart , I will ascend into heaven , I will exalt my throne above the stars of God : I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north : 14 : 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds ; I will be like the most High .
14 : 18 All the kings of the nations , even all of them , lie in glory , every one in his own house .
14 : 27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed , and who shall disannul it ?
14 : 30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed , and the needy shall lie down in safety : and I will kill thy root with famine , and he shall slay thy remnant .
15 : 1 The burden of Moab .
16 : 3 Take counsel , execute judgment ; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday ; hide the outcasts ; bewray not him that wandereth .
17 : 1 The burden of Damascus .
17 : 9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough , and an uppermost branch , which they left because of the children of Israel : and there shall be desolation .
18 : 4 For so the LORD said unto me , I will take my rest , and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs , and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest .
19 : 5 And the waters shall fail from the sea , and the river shall be wasted and dried up .
19 : 15 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt , which the head or tail , branch or rush , may do .
19 : 17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt , every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself , because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts , which he hath determined against it .
19 : 19 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land of Egypt , and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD .
19 : 23 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria , and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt , and the Egyptian into Assyria , and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians .
20 : 3 And the LORD said , Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia ; 20 : 4 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners , and the Ethiopians captives , young and old , naked and barefoot , even with their buttocks uncovered , to the shame of Egypt .
21 : 1 The burden of the desert of the sea .
As whirlwinds in the south pass through ; so it cometh from the desert , from a terrible land .
22 : 5 For it is a day of trouble , and of treading down , and of perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision , breaking down the walls , and of crying to the mountains .
22 : 17 Behold , the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity , and will surely cover thee .
22 : 18 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country : there shalt thou die , and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord ' s house .
23 : 4 Be thou ashamed , O Zidon : for the sea hath spoken , even the strength of the sea , saying , I travail not , nor bring forth children , neither do I nourish up young men , nor bring up virgins .
23 : 5 As at the report concerning Egypt , so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre .
her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn .
23 : 8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre , the crowning city , whose merchants are princes , whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth ?
23 : 15 And it shall come to pass in that day , that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years , according to the days of one king : after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot .
23 : 17 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years , that the LORD will visit Tyre , and she shall turn to her hire , and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth .
24 : 2 And it shall be , as with the people , so with the priest ; as with the servant , so with his master ; as with the maid , so with her mistress ; as with the buyer , so with the seller ; as with the lender , so with the borrower ; as with the taker of usury , so with the giver of usury to him .
24 : 4 The earth mourneth and fadeth away , the world languisheth and fadeth away , the haughty people of the earth do languish .
24 : 8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth , the noise of them that rejoice endeth , the joy of the harp ceaseth .
25 : 8 He will swallow up death in victory ; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces ; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth : for the LORD hath spoken it .
26 : 3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace , whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee .
26 : 16 LORD , in trouble have they visited thee , they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them .
27 : 1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent , even leviathan that crooked serpent ; and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea .
27 : 4 Fury is not in me : who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle ?
28 : 2 Behold , the Lord hath a mighty and strong one , which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm , as a flood of mighty waters overflowing , shall cast down to the earth with the hand .
28 : 3 The crown of pride , the drunkards of Ephraim , shall be trodden under feet : 28 : 4 And the glorious beauty , which is on the head of the fat valley , shall be a fading flower , and as the hasty fruit before the summer ; which when he that looketh upon it seeth , while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up .
28 : 13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept , precept upon precept ; line upon line , line upon line ; here a little , and there a little ; that they might go , and fall backward , and be broken , and snared , and taken .
28 : 29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts , which is wonderful in counsel , and excellent in working .
29 : 2 Yet I will distress Ariel , and there shall be heaviness and sorrow : and it shall be unto me as Ariel .
29 : 4 And thou shalt be brought down , and shalt speak out of the ground , and thy speech shall be low out of the dust , and thy voice shall be , as of one that hath a familiar spirit , out of the ground , and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust .
29 : 19 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD , and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel .
30 : 1 Woe to the rebellious children , saith the LORD , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin : 30 : 2 That walk to go down into Egypt , and have not asked at my mouth ; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh , and to trust in the shadow of Egypt !
30 : 3 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame , and the trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion .
30 : 12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel , Because ye despise this word , and trust in oppression and perverseness , and stay thereon : 30 : 13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall , swelling out in a high wall , whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant .
30 : 14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters ' vessel that is broken in pieces ; he shall not spare : so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth , or to take water withal out of the pit .
31 : 2 Yet he also is wise , and will bring evil , and will not call back his words : but will arise against the house of the evildoers , and against the help of them that work iniquity .
31 : 8 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword , not of a mighty man ; and the sword , not of a mean man , shall devour him : but he shall flee from the sword , and his young men shall be discomfited .
32 : 17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace ; and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever .
33 : 8 The highways lie waste , the wayfaring man ceaseth : he hath broken the covenant , he hath despised the cities , he regardeth no man .
33 : 15 He that walketh righteously , and speaketh uprightly ; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions , that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes , that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood , and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil ; 33 : 16 He shall dwell on high : his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks : bread shall be given him ; his waters shall be sure .
33 : 24 And the inhabitant shall not say , I am sick : the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity .
34 : 6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood , it is made fat with fatness , and with the blood of lambs and goats , with the fat of the kidneys of rams : for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah , and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea .
34 : 8 For it is the day of the LORD ' s vengeance , and the year of recompences for the controversy of Zion .
34 : 14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island , and the satyr shall cry to his fellow ; the screech owl also shall rest there , and find for herself a place of rest .
34 : 15 There shall the great owl make her nest , and lay , and hatch , and gather under her shadow : there shall the vultures also be gathered , every one with her mate .
35 : 1 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice , and blossom as the rose .
35 : 3 Strengthen ye the weak hands , and confirm the feeble knees .
35 : 8 And an highway shall be there , and a way , and it shall be called The way of holiness ; the unclean shall not pass over it ; but it shall be for those : the wayfaring men , though fools , shall not err therein .
And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller ' s field .
36 : 10 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it ?
where are the gods of Sepharvaim ?
37 : 3 And they said unto him , Thus saith Hezekiah , This day is a day of trouble , and of rebuke , and of blasphemy : for the children are come to the birth , and there is not strength to bring forth .
37 : 13 Where is the king of Hamath , and the king of Arphad , and the king of the city of Sepharvaim , Hena , and Ivah ?
37 : 20 Now therefore , O LORD our God , save us from his hand , that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD , even thou only .
even against the Holy One of Israel .
37 : 26 Hast thou not heard long ago , how I have done it ; and of ancient times , that I have formed it ?
37 : 31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward , and bear fruit upward : 37 : 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant , and they that escape out of mount Zion : the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this .
And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him , and said unto him , Thus saith the LORD , Set thine house in order : for thou shalt die , and not live .
40 : 6 The voice said , Cry .
And he said , What shall I cry ?
40 : 14 With whom took he counsel , and who instructed him , and taught him in the path of judgment , and taught him knowledge , and shewed to him the way of understanding ?
40 : 20 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot ; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image , that shall not be moved .
40 : 21 Have ye not known ?
hath it not been told you from the beginning ?
40 : 26 Lift up your eyes on high , and behold who hath created these things , that bringeth out their host by number : he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might , for that he is strong in power ; not one faileth .
40 : 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary , and the young men shall utterly fall : 40 : 31 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength ; they shall mount up with wings as eagles ; they shall run , and not be weary ; and they shall walk , and not faint .
41 : 3 He pursued them , and passed safely ; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet .
41 : 16 Thou shalt fan them , and the wind shall carry them away , and the whirlwind shall scatter them : and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD , and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel .
41 : 26 Who hath declared from the beginning , that we may know ?
and beforetime , that we may say , He is righteous ?
42 : 1 Behold my servant , whom I uphold ; mine elect , in whom my soul delighteth ; I have put my spirit upon him : he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles .
42 : 11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice , the villages that Kedar doth inhabit : let the inhabitants of the rock sing , let them shout from the top of the mountains .
42 : 15 I will make waste mountains and hills , and dry up all their herbs ; and I will make the rivers islands , and I will dry up the pools .
42 : 18 Hear , ye deaf ; and look , ye blind , that ye may see .
who will hearken and hear for the time to come ?
42 : 24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil , and Israel to the robbers ?
43 : 15 I am the LORD , your Holy One , the creator of Israel , your King .
43 : 18 Remember ye not the former things , neither consider the things of old .
44 : 3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty , and floods upon the dry ground : I will pour my spirit upon thy seed , and my blessing upon thine offspring : 44 : 4 And they shall spring up as among the grass , as willows by the water courses .
44 : 6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel , and his redeemer the LORD of hosts ; I am the first , and I am the last ; and beside me there is no God .
44 : 11 Behold , all his fellows shall be ashamed : and the workmen , they are of men : let them all be gathered together , let them stand up ; yet they shall fear , and they shall be ashamed together .
44 : 22 I have blotted out , as a thick cloud , thy transgressions , and , as a cloud , thy sins : return unto me ; for I have redeemed thee .
45 : 9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker !
45 : 10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father , What begettest thou ?
or to the woman , What hast thou brought forth ?
45 : 13 I have raised him up in righteousness , and I will direct all his ways : he shall build my city , and he shall let go my captives , not for price nor reward , saith the LORD of hosts .
45 : 18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens ; God himself that formed the earth and made it ; he hath established it , he created it not in vain , he formed it to be inhabited : I am the LORD ; and there is none else .
45 : 21 Tell ye , and bring them near ; yea , let them take counsel together : who hath declared this from ancient time ?
46 : 12 Hearken unto me , ye stouthearted , that are far from righteousness : 46 : 13 I bring near my righteousness ; it shall not be far off , and my salvation shall not tarry : and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory .
47 : 11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee ; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth : and mischief shall fall upon thee ; thou shalt not be able to put it off : and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly , which thou shalt not know .
Let now the astrologers , the stargazers , the monthly prognosticators , stand up , and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee .
48 : 4 Because I knew that thou art obstinate , and thy neck is an iron sinew , and thy brow brass ; 48 : 5 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee ; before it came to pass I shewed it thee : lest thou shouldest say , Mine idol hath done them , and my graven image , and my molten image , hath commanded them .
48 : 6 Thou hast heard , see all this ; and will not ye declare it ?
49 : 8 Thus saith the LORD , In an acceptable time have I heard thee , and in a day of salvation have I helped thee : and I will preserve thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , to establish the earth , to cause to inherit the desolate heritages ; 49 : 9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners , Go forth ; to them that are in darkness , Shew yourselves .
or have I no power to deliver ?
50 : 4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned , that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary : he wakeneth morning by morning , he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned .
50 : 11 Behold , all ye that kindle a fire , that compass yourselves about with sparks : walk in the light of your fire , and in the sparks that ye have kindled .
51 : 5 My righteousness is near ; my salvation is gone forth , and mine arms shall judge the people ; the isles shall wait upon me , and on mine arm shall they trust .
51 : 8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment , and the worm shall eat them like wool : but my righteousness shall be for ever , and my salvation from generation to generation .
and where is the fury of the oppressor ?
51 : 18 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth ; neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up .
52 : 10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations ; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God .
54 : 2 Enlarge the place of thy tent , and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations : spare not , lengthen thy cords , and strengthen thy stakes ; 54 : 3 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left ; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles , and make the desolate cities to be inhabited .
54 : 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee ; but with great mercies will I gather thee .
54 : 11 O thou afflicted , tossed with tempest , and not comforted , behold , I will lay thy stones with fair colours , and lay thy foundations with sapphires .
This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD , and their righteousness is of me , saith the LORD .
56 : 2 Blessed is the man that doeth this , and the son of man that layeth hold on it ; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it , and keepeth his hand from doing any evil .
57 : 4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves ?
against whom make ye a wide mouth , and draw out the tongue ?
57 : 7 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed : even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice .
57 : 8 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance : for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me , and art gone up ; thou hast enlarged thy bed , and made thee a covenant with them ; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it .
58 : 1 Cry aloud , spare not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet , and shew my people their transgression , and the house of Jacob their sins .
59 : 3 For your hands are defiled with blood , and your fingers with iniquity ; your lips have spoken lies , your tongue hath muttered perverseness .
59 : 6 Their webs shall not become garments , neither shall they cover themselves with their works : their works are works of iniquity , and the act of violence is in their hands .
59 : 10 We grope for the wall like the blind , and we grope as if we had no eyes : we stumble at noon day as in the night ; we are in desolate places as dead men .
59 : 16 And he saw that there was no man , and wondered that there was no intercessor : therefore his arm brought salvation unto him ; and his righteousness , it sustained him .
59 : 18 According to their deeds , accordingly he will repay , fury to his adversaries , recompence to his enemies ; to the islands he will repay recompence .
59 : 20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion , and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob , saith the LORD .
60 : 9 Surely the isles shall wait for me , and the ships of Tarshish first , to bring thy sons from far , their silver and their gold with them , unto the name of the LORD thy God , and to the Holy One of Israel , because he hath glorified thee .
60 : 12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish ; yea , those nations shall be utterly wasted .
61 : 4 And they shall build the old wastes , they shall raise up the former desolations , and they shall repair the waste cities , the desolations of many generations .
61 : 9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles , and their offspring among the people : all that see them shall acknowledge them , that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed .
62 : 11 Behold , the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world , Say ye to the daughter of Zion , Behold , thy salvation cometh ; behold , his reward is with him , and his work before him .
63 : 3 I have trodden the winepress alone ; and of the people there was none with me : for I will tread them in mine anger , and trample them in my fury ; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments , and I will stain all my raiment .
63 : 4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart , and the year of my redeemed is come .
63 : 8 For he said , Surely they are my people , children that will not lie : so he was their Saviour .
63 : 10 But they rebelled , and vexed his holy Spirit : therefore he was turned to be their enemy , and he fought against them .
where is he that put his holy Spirit within him ?
63 : 13 That led them through the deep , as an horse in the wilderness , that they should not stumble ?
63 : 15 Look down from heaven , and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory : where is thy zeal and thy strength , the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me ?
63 : 19 We are thine : thou never barest rule over them ; they were not called by thy name .
64 : 3 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for , thou camest down , the mountains flowed down at thy presence .
64 : 12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things , O LORD ?
65 : 1 I am sought of them that asked not for me ; I am found of them that sought me not : I said , Behold me , behold me , unto a nation that was not called by my name .
These are a smoke in my nose , a fire that burneth all the day .
66 : 1 Thus saith the LORD , The heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool : where is the house that ye build unto me ?
66 : 6 A voice of noise from the city , a voice from the temple , a voice of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies .
saith thy God .
66 : 16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh : and the slain of the LORD shall be many .
66 : 21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites , saith the LORD .
66 : 24 And they shall go forth , and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me : for their worm shall not die , neither shall their fire be quenched ; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh .
1 : 7 But the LORD said unto me , Say not , I am a child : for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee , and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak .
1 : 11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , Jeremiah , what seest thou ?
1 : 14 Then the LORD said unto me , Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land .
and they that handle the law knew me not : the pastors also transgressed against me , and the prophets prophesied by Baal , and walked after things that do not profit .
2 : 12 Be astonished , O ye heavens , at this , and be horribly afraid , be ye very desolate , saith the LORD .
2 : 27 Saying to a stock , Thou art my father ; and to a stone , Thou hast brought me forth : for they have turned their back unto me , and not their face : but in the time of their trouble they will say , Arise , and save us .
2 : 30 In vain have I smitten your children ; they received no correction : your own sword hath devoured your prophets , like a destroying lion .
Behold , I will plead with thee , because thou sayest , I have not sinned .
3 : 5 Will he reserve his anger for ever ?
she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree , and there hath played the harlot .
and I said , Thou shalt call me , My father ; and shalt not turn away from me .
3 : 22 Return , ye backsliding children , and I will heal your backslidings .
3 : 23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills , and from the multitude of mountains : truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel .
Woe unto us !
4 : 23 I beheld the earth , and , lo , it was without form , and void ; and the heavens , and they had no light .
4 : 25 I beheld , and , lo , there was no man , and all the birds of the heavens were fled .
Though thou clothest thyself with crimson , though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold , though thou rentest thy face with painting , in vain shalt thou make thyself fair ; thy lovers will despise thee , they will seek thy life .
5 : 1 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem , and see now , and know , and seek in the broad places thereof , if ye can find a man , if there be any that executeth judgment , that seeketh the truth ; and I will pardon it .
5 : 5 I will get me unto the great men , and will speak unto them ; for they have known the way of the LORD , and the judgment of their God : but these have altogether broken the yoke , and burst the bonds .
thy children have forsaken me , and sworn by them that are no gods : when I had fed them to the full , they then committed adultery , and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots ' houses .
5 : 16 Their quiver is as an open sepulchre , they are all mighty men .
then shalt thou answer them , Like as ye have forsaken me , and served strange gods in your land , so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not your ' s .
5 : 26 For among my people are found wicked men : they lay wait , as he that setteth snares ; they set a trap , they catch men .
6 : 1 O ye children of Benjamin , gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem , and blow the trumpet in Tekoa , and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem : for evil appeareth out of the north , and great destruction .
6 : 5 Arise , and let us go by night , and let us destroy her palaces .
6 : 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , They shall throughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine : turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets .
6 : 10 To whom shall I speak , and give warning , that they may hear ?
6 : 11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD ; I am weary with holding in : I will pour it out upon the children abroad , and upon the assembly of young men together : for even the husband with the wife shall be taken , the aged with him that is full of days .
6 : 28 They are all grievous revolters , walking with slanders : they are brass and iron ; they are all corrupters .
7 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 7 : 2 Stand in the gate of the LORD ' s house , and proclaim there this word , and say , Hear the word of the LORD , all ye of Judah , that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD .
7 : 3 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel , Amend your ways and your doings , and I will cause you to dwell in this place .
7 : 17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
they hold fast deceit , they refuse to return .
every one turned to his course , as the horse rusheth into the battle .
nay , they were not at all ashamed , neither could they blush : therefore shall they fall among them that fall : in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down , saith the LORD .
8 : 14 Why do we sit still ?
8 : 16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan : the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones ; for they are come , and have devoured the land , and all that is in it ; the city , and those that dwell therein .
why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered ?
9 : 10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing , and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation , because they are burned up , so that none can pass through them ; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle ; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled ; they are gone .
9 : 16 I will scatter them also among the heathen , whom neither they nor their fathers have known : and I will send a sword after them , till I have consumed them .
9 : 23 Thus saith the LORD , Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom , neither let the mighty man glory in his might , let not the rich man glory in his riches : 9 : 24 But let him that glorieth glory in this , that he understandeth and knoweth me , that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness , judgment , and righteousness , in the earth : for in these things I delight , saith the LORD .
10 : 23 O LORD , I know that the way of man is not in himself : it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps .
Then answered I , and said , So be it , O LORD .
wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously ?
the beasts are consumed , and the birds ; because they said , He shall not see our last end .
12 : 9 Mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird , the birds round about are against her ; come ye , assemble all the beasts of the field , come to devour .
13 : 13 Then shalt thou say unto them , Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will fill all the inhabitants of this land , even the kings that sit upon David ' s throne , and the priests , and the prophets , and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , with drunkenness .
13 : 27 I have seen thine adulteries , and thy neighings , the lewdness of thy whoredom , and thine abominations on the hills in the fields .
14 : 4 Because the ground is chapt , for there was no rain in the earth , the plowmen were ashamed , they covered their heads .
14 : 20 We acknowledge , O LORD , our wickedness , and the iniquity of our fathers : for we have sinned against thee .
14 : 21 Do not abhor us , for thy name ' s sake , do not disgrace the throne of thy glory : remember , break not thy covenant with us .
therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
15 : 2 And it shall come to pass , if they say unto thee , Whither shall we go forth ?
15 : 8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas : I have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday : I have caused him to fall upon it suddenly , and terrors upon the city .
15 : 14 And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not : for a fire is kindled in mine anger , which shall burn upon you .
or what is our iniquity ?
16 : 18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double ; because they have defiled my land , they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things .
17 : 7 Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD , and whose hope the LORD is .
17 : 26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah , and from the places about Jerusalem , and from the land of Benjamin , and from the plain , and from the mountains , and from the south , bringing burnt offerings , and sacrifices , and meat offerings , and incense , and bringing sacrifices of praise , unto the house of the LORD .
17 : 27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day , and not to bear a burden , even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day ; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof , and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem , and it shall not be quenched .
18 : 5 Then the word of the LORD came to me , saying , 18 : 6 O house of Israel , cannot I do with you as this potter ?
Behold , as the clay is in the potter ' s hand , so are ye in mine hand , O house of Israel .
18 : 7 At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation , and concerning a kingdom , to pluck up , and to pull down , and to destroy it ; 18 : 8 If that nation , against whom I have pronounced , turn from their evil , I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them .
18 : 11 Now therefore go to , speak to the men of Judah , and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I frame evil against you , and devise a device against you : return ye now every one from his evil way , and make your ways and your doings good .
or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken ?
18 : 23 Yet , LORD , thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me : forgive not their iniquity , neither blot out their sin from thy sight , but let them be overthrown before thee ; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger .
19 : 4 Because they have forsaken me , and have estranged this place , and have burned incense in it unto other gods , whom neither they nor their fathers have known , nor the kings of Judah , and have filled this place with the blood of innocents ; 19 : 5 They have built also the high places of Baal , to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal , which I commanded not , nor spake it , neither came it into my mind : 19 : 6 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that this place shall no more be called Tophet , nor The valley of the son of Hinnom , but The valley of slaughter .
20 : 3 And it came to pass on the morrow , that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks .
20 : 13 Sing unto the LORD , praise ye the LORD : for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers .
20 : 14 Cursed be the day wherein I was born : let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed .
21 : 6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city , both man and beast : they shall die of a great pestilence .
21 : 14 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings , saith the LORD : and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof , and it shall devour all things round about it .
saith the LORD .
22 : 18 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah ; They shall not lament for him , saying , Ah my brother !
saith the LORD .
23 : 3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them , and will bring them again to their folds ; and they shall be fruitful and increase .
23 : 7 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that they shall no more say , The LORD liveth , which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt ; 23 : 8 But , The LORD liveth , which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country , and from all countries whither I had driven them ; and they shall dwell in their own land .
23 : 12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness : they shall be driven on , and fall therein : for I will bring evil upon them , even the year of their visitation , saith the LORD .
23 : 20 The anger of the LORD shall not return , until he have executed , and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart : in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly .
23 : 21 I have not sent these prophets , yet they ran : I have not spoken to them , yet they prophesied .
23 : 28 The prophet that hath a dream , let him tell a dream ; and he that hath my word , let him speak my word faithfully .
23 : 33 And when this people , or the prophet , or a priest , shall ask thee , saying , What is the burden of the LORD ?
23 : 37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet , What hath the LORD answered thee ?
and , What hath the LORD spoken ?
24 : 2 One basket had very good figs , even like the figs that are first ripe : and the other basket had very naughty figs , which could not be eaten , they were so bad .
25 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah , that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon ; 25 : 2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah , and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem , saying , 25 : 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah , even unto this day , that is the three and twentieth year , the word of the LORD hath come unto me , and I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye have not hearkened .
25 : 4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets , rising early and sending them ; but ye have not hearkened , nor inclined your ear to hear .
25 : 10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth , and the voice of gladness , the voice of the bridegroom , and the voice of the bride , the sound of the millstones , and the light of the candle .
25 : 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it , even all that is written in this book , which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations .
25 : 15 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me ; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand , and cause all the nations , to whom I send thee , to drink it .
25 : 27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Drink ye , and be drunken , and spue , and fall , and rise no more , because of the sword which I will send among you .
25 : 32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , Behold , evil shall go forth from nation to nation , and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth .
25 : 38 He hath forsaken his covert , as the lion : for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor , and because of his fierce anger .
26 : 7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD .
26 : 11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people , saying , This man is worthy to die ; for he hath prophesied against this city , as ye have heard with your ears .
26 : 12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people , saying , The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard .
26 : 13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings , and obey the voice of the LORD your God ; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you .
26 : 14 As for me , behold , I am in your hand : do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you .
26 : 15 But know ye for certain , that if ye put me to death , ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves , and upon this city , and upon the inhabitants thereof : for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears .
26 : 19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death ?
26 : 24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah , that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death .
27 : 8 And it shall come to pass , that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon , and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon , that nation will I punish , saith the LORD , with the sword , and with the famine , and with the pestilence , until I have consumed them by his hand .
27 : 19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars , and concerning the sea , and concerning the bases , and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city .
30 : 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD , saying , 30 : 2 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel , saying , Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book .
30 : 13 There is none to plead thy cause , that thou mayest be bound up : thou hast no healing medicines .
30 : 16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured ; and all thine adversaries , every one of them , shall go into captivity ; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil , and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey .
31 : 1 At the same time , saith the LORD , will I be the God of all the families of Israel , and they shall be my people .
31 : 17 And there is hope in thine end , saith the LORD , that thy children shall come again to their own border .
is he a pleasant child ?
31 : 26 Upon this I awaked , and beheld ; and my sleep was sweet unto me .
31 : 39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb , and shall compass about to Goath .
31 : 40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies , and of the ashes , and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron , unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east , shall be holy unto the LORD ; it shall not be plucked up , nor thrown down any more for ever .
32 : 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up , saying , Wherefore dost thou prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD , Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon , and he shall take it ; 32 : 4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans , but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon , and shall speak with him mouth to mouth , and his eyes shall behold his eyes ; 32 : 5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon , and there shall he be until I visit him , saith the LORD : though ye fight with the Chaldeans , ye shall not prosper .
32 : 28 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans , and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon , and he shall take it : 32 : 29 And the Chaldeans , that fight against this city , shall come and set fire on this city , and burn it with the houses , upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal , and poured out drink offerings unto other gods , to provoke me to anger .
32 : 35 And they built the high places of Baal , which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom , to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech ; which I commanded them not , neither came it into my mind , that they should do this abomination , to cause Judah to sin .
32 : 42 For thus saith the LORD ; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people , so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them .
33 : 4 For thus saith the LORD , the God of Israel , concerning the houses of this city , and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah , which are thrown down by the mounts , and by the sword ; 33 : 5 They come to fight with the Chaldeans , but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men , whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury , and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city .
33 : 23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah , saying , 33 : 24 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken , saying , The two families which the LORD hath chosen , he hath even cast them off ?
thus they have despised my people , that they should be no more a nation before them .
for I have pronounced the word , saith the LORD .
34 : 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant , which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me , when they cut the calf in twain , and passed between the parts thereof , 34 : 19 The princes of Judah , and the princes of Jerusalem , the eunuchs , and the priests , and all the people of the land , which passed between the parts of the calf ; 34 : 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies , and into the hand of them that seek their life : and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven , and to the beasts of the earth .
35 : 14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab , that he commanded his sons not to drink wine , are performed ; for unto this day they drink none , but obey their father ' s commandment : notwithstanding I have spoken unto you , rising early and speaking ; but ye hearkened not unto me .
35 : 18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites , Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father , and kept all his precepts , and done according unto all that he hath commanded you : 35 : 19 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever .
36 : 10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD , in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe , in the higher court , at the entry of the new gate of the LORD ' s house , in the ears of all the people .
36 : 25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll : but he would not hear them .
36 : 32 Then took Jeremiah another roll , and gave it to Baruch the scribe , the son of Neriah ; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire : and there were added besides unto them many like words .
37 : 5 Then Pharaoh ' s army was come forth out of Egypt : and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them , they departed from Jerusalem .
37 : 16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon , and into the cabins , and Jeremiah had remained there many days ; 37 : 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent , and took him out : and the king asked him secretly in his house , and said , Is there any word from the LORD ?
And Jeremiah said , There is : for , said he , thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon .
37 : 18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah , What have I offended against thee , or against thy servants , or against this people , that ye have put me in prison ?
38 : 5 Then Zedekiah the king said , Behold , he is in your hand : for the king is not he that can do any thing against you .
38 : 10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian , saying , Take from hence thirty men with thee , and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon , before he die .
38 : 13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords , and took him up out of the dungeon : and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison .
38 : 21 But if thou refuse to go forth , this is the word that the LORD hath shewed me : 38 : 22 And , behold , all the women that are left in the king of Judah ' s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon ' s princes , and those women shall say , Thy friends have set thee on , and have prevailed against thee : thy feet are sunk in the mire , and they are turned away back .
39 : 9 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city , and those that fell away , that fell to him , with the rest of the people that remained .
40 : 2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah , and said unto him , The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place .
40 : 10 As for me , behold , I will dwell at Mizpah , to serve the Chaldeans , which will come unto us : but ye , gather ye wine , and summer fruits , and oil , and put them in your vessels , and dwell in your cities that ye have taken .
40 : 13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields , came to Gedaliah to Mizpah , 40 : 14 And said unto him , Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee ?
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not .
41 : 4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah , and no man knew it , 41 : 5 That there came certain from Shechem , from Shiloh , and from Samaria , even fourscore men , having their beards shaven , and their clothes rent , and having cut themselves , with offerings and incense in their hand , to bring them to the house of the LORD .
41 : 10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah , even the king ' s daughters , and all the people that remained in Mizpah , whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam : and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive , and departed to go over to the Ammonites .
42 : 13 But if ye say , We will not dwell in this land , neither obey the voice of the LORD your God , 42 : 14 Saying , No ; but we will go into the land of Egypt , where we shall see no war , nor hear the sound of the trumpet , nor have hunger of bread ; and there will we dwell : 42 : 15 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD , ye remnant of Judah ; Thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt , and go to sojourn there ; 42 : 16 Then it shall come to pass , that the sword , which ye feared , shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt , and the famine , whereof ye were afraid , shall follow close after you there in Egypt ; and there ye shall die .
42 : 18 For thus saith the LORD of hosts , the God of Israel ; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem ; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you , when ye shall enter into Egypt : and ye shall be an execration , and an astonishment , and a curse , and a reproach ; and ye shall see this place no more .
43 : 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah , and all the captains of the forces , and all the people , obeyed not the voice of the LORD , to dwell in the land of Judah .
43 : 7 So they came into the land of Egypt : for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD : thus came they even to Tahpanhes .
43 : 12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt ; and he shall burn them , and carry them away captives : and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt , as a shepherd putteth on his garment ; and he shall go forth from thence in peace .
44 : 5 But they hearkened not , nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness , to burn no incense unto other gods .
44 : 9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers , and the wickedness of the kings of Judah , and the wickedness of their wives , and your own wickedness , and the wickedness of your wives , which they have committed in the land of Judah , and in the streets of Jerusalem ?
44 : 28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah , and all the remnant of Judah , that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there , shall know whose words shall stand , mine , or their ' s .
46 : 20 Egypt is like a very fair heifer , but destruction cometh ; it cometh out of the north .
47 : 2 Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , waters rise up out of the north , and shall be an overflowing flood , and shall overflow the land , and all that is therein ; the city , and them that dwell therein : then the men shall cry , and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl .
48 : 2 There shall be no more praise of Moab : in Heshbon they have devised evil against it ; come , and let us cut it off from being a nation .
48 : 3 A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim , spoiling and great destruction .
48 : 9 Give wings unto Moab , that it may flee and get away : for the cities thereof shall be desolate , without any to dwell therein .
48 : 10 Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully , and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood .
48 : 12 Therefore , behold , the days come , saith the LORD , that I will send unto him wanderers , that shall cause him to wander , and shall empty his vessels , and break their bottles .
48 : 26 Make ye him drunken : for he magnified himself against the LORD : Moab also shall wallow in his vomit , and he also shall be in derision .
48 : 31 Therefore will I howl for Moab , and I will cry out for all Moab ; mine heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres .
48 : 36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes , and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kirheres : because the riches that he hath gotten are perished .
48 : 46 Woe be unto thee , O Moab !
is counsel perished from the prudent ?
49 : 20 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD , that he hath taken against Edom ; and his purposes , that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman : Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out : surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them .
49 : 23 Concerning Damascus .
49 : 36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven , and will scatter them toward all those winds ; and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come .
49 : 37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies , and before them that seek their life : and I will bring evil upon them , even my fierce anger , saith the LORD ; and I will send the sword after them , till I have consumed them : 49 : 38 And I will set my throne in Elam , and will destroy from thence the king and the princes , saith the LORD .
50 : 7 All that found them have devoured them : and their adversaries said , We offend not , because they have sinned against the LORD , the habitation of justice , even the LORD , the hope of their fathers .
50 : 11 Because ye were glad , because ye rejoiced , O ye destroyers of mine heritage , because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass , and bellow as bulls ; 50 : 12 Your mother shall be sore confounded ; she that bare you shall be ashamed : behold , the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness , a dry land , and a desert .
50 : 28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon , to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God , the vengeance of his temple .
50 : 32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall , and none shall raise him up : and I will kindle a fire in his cities , and it shall devour all round about him .
50 : 33 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together : and all that took them captives held them fast ; they refused to let them go .
50 : 42 They shall hold the bow and the lance : they are cruel , and will not shew mercy : their voice shall roar like the sea , and they shall ride upon horses , every one put in array , like a man to the battle , against thee , O daughter of Babylon .
51 : 1 Thus saith the LORD ; Behold , I will raise up against Babylon , and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me , a destroying wind ; 51 : 2 And will send unto Babylon fanners , that shall fan her , and shall empty her land : for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about .
51 : 17 Every man is brutish by his knowledge ; every founder is confounded by the graven image : for his molten image is falsehood , and there is no breath in them .
51 : 19 The portion of Jacob is not like them ; for he is the former of all things : and Israel is the rod of his inheritance : the LORD of hosts is his name .
51 : 24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight , saith the LORD .
51 : 48 Then the heaven and the earth , and all that is therein , shall sing for Babylon : for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north , saith the LORD .
51 : 50 Ye that have escaped the sword , go away , stand not still : remember the LORD afar off , and let Jerusalem come into your mind .
51 : 58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken , and her high gates shall be burned with fire ; and the people shall labour in vain , and the folk in the fire , and they shall be weary .
And his mother ' s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah .
52 : 5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah .
52 : 26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them , and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah .
52 : 28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive : in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty : 52 : 29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons : 52 : 30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons : all the persons were four thousand and six hundred .
52 : 32 And spake kindly unto him , and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon , 52 : 33 And changed his prison garments : and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life .
1 : 5 Her adversaries are the chief , her enemies prosper ; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions : her children are gone into captivity before the enemy .
behold , and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow , which is done unto me , wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger .
1 : 15 The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me : he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men : the LORD hath trodden the virgin , the daughter of Judah , as in a winepress .
2 : 3 He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel : he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy , and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire , which devoureth round about .
2 : 4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy : he stood with his right hand as an adversary , and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion : he poured out his fury like fire .
2 : 12 They say to their mothers , Where is corn and wine ?
2 : 19 Arise , cry out in the night : in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD : lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children , that faint for hunger in the top of every street .
2 : 20 Behold , O LORD , and consider to whom thou hast done this .
3 : 1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath .
3 : 4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old ; he hath broken my bones .
3 : 8 Also when I cry and shout , he shutteth out my prayer .
3 : 12 He hath bent his bow , and set me as a mark for the arrow .
3 : 13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins .
3 : 17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace : I forgat prosperity .
3 : 24 The LORD is my portion , saith my soul ; therefore will I hope in him .
3 : 29 He putteth his mouth in the dust ; if so be there may be hope .
3 : 30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him : he is filled full with reproach .
3 : 38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good ?
3 : 41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens .
4 : 2 The precious sons of Zion , comparable to fine gold , how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers , the work of the hands of the potter !
4 : 10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children : they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people .
5 : 10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine .
5 : 12 Princes are hanged up by their hand : the faces of elders were not honoured .
5 : 13 They took the young men to grind , and the children fell under the wood .
5 : 17 For this our heart is faint ; for these things our eyes are dim .
1 : 11 Thus were their faces : and their wings were stretched upward ; two wings of every one were joined one to another , and two covered their bodies .
1 : 17 When they went , they went upon their four sides : and they turned not when they went .
1 : 26 And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne , as the appearance of a sapphire stone : and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it .
I do send thee unto them ; and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD .
2 : 9 And when I looked , behold , an hand was sent unto me ; and , lo , a roll of a book was therein ; 2 : 10 And he spread it before me ; and it was written within and without : and there was written therein lamentations , and mourning , and woe .
3 : 8 Behold , I have made thy face strong against their faces , and thy forehead strong against their foreheads .
3 : 9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead : fear them not , neither be dismayed at their looks , though they be a rebellious house .
3 : 11 And go , get thee to them of the captivity , unto the children of thy people , and speak unto them , and tell them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; whether they will hear , or whether they will forbear .
3 : 25 But thou , O son of man , behold , they shall put bands upon thee , and shall bind thee with them , and thou shalt not go out among them : 3 : 26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth , that thou shalt be dumb , and shalt not be to them a reprover : for they are a rebellious house .
3 : 27 But when I speak with thee , I will open thy mouth , and thou shalt say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; He that heareth , let him hear ; and he that forbeareth , let him forbear : for they are a rebellious house .
4 : 8 And , behold , I will lay bands upon thee , and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another , till thou hast ended the days of thy siege .
4 : 11 Thou shalt drink also water by measure , the sixth part of an hin : from time to time shalt thou drink .
4 : 14 Then said I , Ah Lord GOD !
4 : 16 Moreover he said unto me , Son of man , behold , I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem : and they shall eat bread by weight , and with care ; and they shall drink water by measure , and with astonishment : 4 : 17 That they may want bread and water , and be astonied one with another , and consume away for their iniquity .
5 : 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you , and have not walked in my statutes , neither have kept my judgments , neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you ; 5 : 8 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I , even I , am against thee , and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations .
5 : 15 So it shall be a reproach and a taunt , an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee , when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes .
6 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 6 : 2 Son of man , set thy face toward the mountains of Israel , and prophesy against them , 6 : 3 And say , Ye mountains of Israel , hear the word of the Lord GOD ; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains , and to the hills , to the rivers , and to the valleys ; Behold , I , even I , will bring a sword upon you , and I will destroy your high places .
6 : 4 And your altars shall be desolate , and your images shall be broken : and I will cast down your slain men before your idols .
6 : 9 And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives , because I am broken with their whorish heart , which hath departed from me , and with their eyes , which go a whoring after their idols : and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations .
6 : 10 And they shall know that I am the LORD , and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil unto them .
for they shall fall by the sword , by the famine , and by the pestilence .
6 : 13 Then shall ye know that I am the LORD , when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars , upon every high hill , in all the tops of the mountains , and under every green tree , and under every thick oak , the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols .
7 : 9 And mine eye shall not spare , neither will I have pity : I will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee ; and ye shall know that I am the LORD that smiteth .
7 : 11 Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness : none of them shall remain , nor of their multitude , nor of any of their ' s : neither shall there be wailing for them .
7 : 17 All hands shall be feeble , and all knees shall be weak as water .
7 : 24 Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen , and they shall possess their houses : I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease ; and their holy places shall be defiled .
8 : 5 Then said he unto me , Son of man , lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north .
8 : 11 And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel , and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan , with every man his censer in his hand ; and a thick cloud of incense went up .
for they say , the LORD seeth us not ; the LORD hath forsaken the earth .
9 : 2 And , behold , six men came from the way of the higher gate , which lieth toward the north , and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand ; and one man among them was clothed with linen , with a writer ' s inkhorn by his side : and they went in , and stood beside the brasen altar .
wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem ?
10 : 1 Then I looked , and , behold , in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone , as the appearance of the likeness of a throne .
10 : 3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house , when the man went in ; and the cloud filled the inner court .
10 : 6 And it came to pass , that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen , saying , Take fire from between the wheels , from between the cherubims ; then he went in , and stood beside the wheels .
11 : 2 Then said he unto me , Son of man , these are the men that devise mischief , and give wicked counsel in this city : 11 : 3 Which say , It is not near ; let us build houses : this city is the caldron , and we be the flesh .
11 : 7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it , they are the flesh , and this city is the caldron : but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it .
11 : 11 This city shall not be your caldron , neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof ; but I will judge you in the border of Israel : 11 : 12 And ye shall know that I am the LORD : for ye have not walked in my statutes , neither executed my judgments , but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you .
12 : 28 Therefore say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more , but the word which I have spoken shall be done , saith the Lord GOD .
13 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 13 : 2 Son of man , prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy , and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts , Hear ye the word of the LORD ; 13 : 3 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Woe unto the foolish prophets , that follow their own spirit , and have seen nothing !
13 : 5 Ye have not gone up into the gaps , neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD .
13 : 22 Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad , whom I have not made sad ; and strengthened the hands of the wicked , that he should not return from his wicked way , by promising him life : 13 : 23 Therefore ye shall see no more vanity , nor divine divinations : for I will deliver my people out of your hand : and ye shall know that I am the LORD .
14 : 1 Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me , and sat before me .
14 : 12 The word of the LORD came again to me , saying , 14 : 13 Son of man , when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously , then will I stretch out mine hand upon it , and will break the staff of the bread thereof , and will send famine upon it , and will cut off man and beast from it : 14 : 14 Though these three men , Noah , Daniel , and Job , were in it , they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness , saith the Lord GOD .
15 : 1 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 15 : 2 Son of man , what is the vine tree more than any tree , or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest ?
or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon ?
16 : 1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 16 : 2 Son of man , cause Jerusalem to know her abominations , 16 : 3 And say , Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem ; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan ; thy father was an Amorite , and thy mother an Hittite .
16 : 8 Now when I passed by thee , and looked upon thee , behold , thy time was the time of love ; and I spread my skirt over thee , and covered thy nakedness : yea , I sware unto thee , and entered into a covenant with thee , saith the Lord GOD , and thou becamest mine .
16 : 12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead , and earrings in thine ears , and a beautiful crown upon thine head .
16 : 28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians , because thou wast unsatiable ; yea , thou hast played the harlot with them , and yet couldest not be satisfied .
16 : 30 How weak is thine heart , saith the LORD GOD , seeing thou doest all these things , the work of an imperious whorish woman ; 16 : 31 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way , and makest thine high place in every street ; and hast not been as an harlot , in that thou scornest hire ; 16 : 32 But as a wife that committeth adultery , which taketh strangers instead of her husband !
16 : 33 They give gifts to all whores : but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers , and hirest them , that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom .
16 : 38 And I will judge thee , as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged ; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy .
16 : 42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest , and my jealousy shall depart from thee , and I will be quiet , and will be no more angry .
16 : 52 Thou also , which hast judged thy sisters , bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they : they are more righteous than thou : yea , be thou confounded also , and bear thy shame , in that thou hast justified thy sisters .
17 : 9 Say thou , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Shall it prosper ?
it shall wither in the furrows where it grew .
17 : 19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; As I live , surely mine oath that he hath despised , and my covenant that he hath broken , even it will I recompense upon his own head .
18 : 5 But if a man be just , and do that which is lawful and right , 18 : 6 And hath not eaten upon the mountains , neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel , neither hath defiled his neighbour ' s wife , neither hath come near to a menstruous woman , 18 : 7 And hath not oppressed any , but hath restored to the debtor his pledge , hath spoiled none by violence , hath given his bread to the hungry , and hath covered the naked with a garment ; 18 : 8 He that hath not given forth upon usury , neither hath taken any increase , that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity , hath executed true judgment between man and man , 18 : 9 Hath walked in my statutes , and hath kept my judgments , to deal truly ; he is just , he shall surely live , saith the Lord GOD .
he shall not live : he hath done all these abominations ; he shall surely die ; his blood shall be upon him .
When the son hath done that which is lawful and right , and hath kept all my statutes , and hath done them , he shall surely live .
18 : 22 All his transgressions that he hath committed , they shall not be mentioned unto him : in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live .
19 : 4 The nations also heard of him ; he was taken in their pit , and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt .
19 : 6 And he went up and down among the lions , he became a young lion , and learned to catch the prey , and devoured men .
19 : 11 And she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule , and her stature was exalted among the thick branches , and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches .
20 : 10 Wherefore I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt , and brought them into the wilderness .
20 : 12 Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths , to be a sign between me and them , that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them .
20 : 14 But I wrought for my name ' s sake , that it should not be polluted before the heathen , in whose sight I brought them out .
20 : 23 I lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness , that I would scatter them among the heathen , and disperse them through the countries ; 20 : 24 Because they had not executed my judgments , but had despised my statutes , and had polluted my sabbaths , and their eyes were after their fathers ' idols .
20 : 29 Then I said unto them , What is the high place whereunto ye go ?
20 : 31 For when ye offer your gifts , when ye make your sons to pass through the fire , ye pollute yourselves with all your idols , even unto this day : and shall I be enquired of by you , O house of Israel ?
20 : 33 As I live , saith the Lord GOD , surely with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out , will I rule over you : 20 : 34 And I will bring you out from the people , and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered , with a mighty hand , and with a stretched out arm , and with fury poured out .
20 : 39 As for you , O house of Israel , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Go ye , serve ye every one his idols , and hereafter also , if ye will not hearken unto me : but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts , and with your idols .
20 : 43 And there shall ye remember your ways , and all your doings , wherein ye have been defiled ; and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed .
20 : 44 And ye shall know that I am the LORD when I have wrought with you for my name ' s sake , not according to your wicked ways , nor according to your corrupt doings , O ye house of Israel , saith the Lord GOD .
21 : 7 And it shall be , when they say unto thee , Wherefore sighest thou ?
21 : 8 Again the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 21 : 9 Son of man , prophesy , and say , Thus saith the LORD ; Say , A sword , a sword is sharpened , and also furbished : 21 : 10 It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter ; it is furbished that it may glitter : should we then make mirth ?
21 : 13 Because it is a trial , and what if the sword contemn even the rod ?
21 : 16 Go thee one way or other , either on the right hand , or on the left , whithersoever thy face is set .
21 : 30 Shall I cause it to return into his sheath ?
I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created , in the land of thy nativity .
22 : 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 22 : 2 Now , thou son of man , wilt thou judge , wilt thou judge the bloody city ?
yea , thou shalt shew her all her abominations .
22 : 5 Those that be near , and those that be far from thee , shall mock thee , which art infamous and much vexed .
22 : 20 As they gather silver , and brass , and iron , and lead , and tin , into the midst of the furnace , to blow the fire upon it , to melt it ; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury , and I will leave you there , and melt you .
22 : 23 And the word of the LORD came unto me , saying , 22 : 24 Son of man , say unto her , Thou art the land that is not cleansed , nor rained upon in the day of indignation .
22 : 26 Her priests have violated my law , and have profaned mine holy things : they have put no difference between the holy and profane , neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean , and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths , and I am profaned among them .
22 : 27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey , to shed blood , and to destroy souls , to get dishonest gain .
22 : 28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter , seeing vanity , and divining lies unto them , saying , Thus saith the Lord GOD , when the LORD hath not spoken .
23 : 9 Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers , into the hand of the Assyrians , upon whom she doted .
23 : 10 These discovered her nakedness : they took her sons and her daughters , and slew her with the sword : and she became famous among women ; for they had executed judgment upon her .
23 : 19 Yet she multiplied her whoredoms , in calling to remembrance the days of her youth , wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt .
23 : 21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth , in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth .
23 : 22 Therefore , O Aholibah , thus saith the Lord GOD ; Behold , I will raise up thy lovers against thee , from whom thy mind is alienated , and I will bring them against thee on every side ; 23 : 23 The Babylonians , and all the Chaldeans , Pekod , and Shoa , and Koa , and all the Assyrians with them : all of them desirable young men , captains and rulers , great lords and renowned , all of them riding upon horses .
23 : 36 The LORD said moreover unto me ; Son of man , wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah ?
yea , declare unto them their abominations ; 23 : 37 That they have committed adultery , and blood is in their hands , and with their idols have they committed adultery , and have also caused their sons , whom they bare unto me , to pass for them through the fire , to devour them .
24 : 3 And utter a parable unto the rebellious house , and say unto them , Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Set on a pot , set it on , and also pour water into it : 24 : 4 Gather the pieces thereof into it , even every good piece , the thigh , and the shoulder ; fill it with the choice bones .
24 : 10 Heap on wood , kindle the fire , consume the flesh , and spice it well , and let the bones be burned .
24 : 18 So I spake unto the people in the morning : and at even my wife died ; and I did in the morning as I was commanded .
24 : 23 And your tires shall be upon your heads , and your shoes upon your feet : ye shall not mourn nor weep ; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities , and mourn one toward another .
25 : 1 The word of the LORD came again unto me , saying , 25 : 2 Son of man , set thy face against the Ammonites , and prophesy against them ; 25 : 3 And say unto the Ammonites , Hear the word of the Lord GOD ; Thus saith the Lord GOD ; Because thou saidst , Aha , against my sanctuary , when it was profaned ; and against the land of Israel , when it was desolate ; and against the house of Judah , when they went into captivity ; 25 : 4 Behold , therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession , and they shall set their palaces in thee , and make their dwellings in thee : they shall eat thy fruit , and they shall drink thy milk .
26 : 12 And they shall make a spoil of thy riches , and make a prey of thy merchandise : and they shall break down thy walls , and destroy thy pleasant houses : and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water .
26 : 19 For thus saith the Lord GOD ; When I shall make thee a desolate city , like the cities that are not inhabited ; when I shall bring up the deep upon thee , and great waters shall cover thee ; 26 : 20 When I shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit , with the people of old time , and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth , in places desolate of old , with them that go down to the pit , that thou be not inhabited ; and I shall set glory in the land of the living ; 26 : 21 I will make thee a terror , and thou shalt be no more : though thou be sought for , yet shalt thou never be found again , saith the Lord GOD .
27 : 10 They of Persia and of Lud and of Phut were in thine army , thy men of war : they hanged the shield and helmet in thee ; they set forth thy comeliness .
27 : 28 The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots .
27 : 35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee , and their kings shall be sore afraid , they shall be troubled in their countenance .
29 : 5 And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness , thee and all the fish of thy rivers : thou shalt fall upon the open fields ; thou shalt not be brought together , nor gathered : I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven .
29 : 10 Behold , therefore I am against thee , and against thy rivers , and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate , from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia .
30 : 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon .
30 : 13 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; I will also destroy the idols , and I will cause their images to cease out of Noph ; and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt : and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt .
30 : 26 And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations , and disperse them among the countries ; and they shall know that I am the LORD .
31 : 5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field , and his boughs were multiplied , and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters , when he shot forth .
31 : 17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword ; and they that were his arm , that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen .
This is Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
32 : 5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains , and fill the valleys with thy height .
32 : 6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest , even to the mountains ; and the rivers shall be full of thee .
32 : 12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall , the terrible of the nations , all of them : and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt , and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed .
32 : 13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters ; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more , nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them .
32 : 32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living : and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword , even Pharaoh and all his multitude , saith the Lord GOD .
33 : 5 He heard the sound of the trumpet , and took not warning ; his blood shall be upon him .
33 : 14 Again , when I say unto the wicked , Thou shalt surely die ; if he turn from his sin , and do that which is lawful and right ; 33 : 15 If the wicked restore the pledge , give again that he had robbed , walk in the statutes of life , without committing iniquity ; he shall surely live , he shall not die .
33 : 16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him : he hath done that which is lawful and right ; he shall surely live .
O ye house of Israel , I will judge you every one after his ways .
33 : 32 And , lo , thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice , and can play well on an instrument : for they hear thy words , but they do them not .
34 : 16 I will seek that which was lost , and bring again that which was driven away , and will bind up that which was broken , and will strengthen that which was sick : but I will destroy the fat and the strong ; I will feed them with judgment .
34 : 30 Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them , and that they , even the house of Israel , are my people , saith the Lord GOD .
35 : 10 Because thou hast said , These two nations and these two countries shall be mine , and we will possess it ; whereas the LORD was there : 35 : 11 Therefore , as I live , saith the Lord GOD , I will even do according to thine anger , and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them ; and I will make myself known among them , when I have judged thee .
35 : 14 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; When the whole earth rejoiceth , I will make thee desolate .
36 : 25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you , and ye shall be clean : from all your filthiness , and from all your idols , will I cleanse you .
36 : 29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses : and I will call for the corn , and will increase it , and lay no famine upon you .
36 : 31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways , and your doings that were not good , and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations .
37 : 4 Again he said unto me , Prophesy upon these bones , and say unto them , O ye dry bones , hear the word of the LORD .
38 : 7 Be thou prepared , and prepare for thyself , thou , and all thy company that are assembled unto thee , and be thou a guard unto them .
38 : 9 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm , thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land , thou , and all thy bands , and many people with thee .
to carry away silver and gold , to take away cattle and goods , to take a great spoil ?
39 : 11 And it shall come to pass in that day , that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel , the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea : and it shall stop the noses of the passengers : and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude : and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog .
39 : 14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment , passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth , to cleanse it : after the end of seven months shall they search .
39 : 16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah .
40 : 6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east , and went up the stairs thereof , and measured the threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad ; and the other threshold of the gate , which was one reed broad .
40 : 7 And every little chamber was one reed long , and one reed broad ; and between the little chambers were five cubits ; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed .
40 : 10 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side , and three on that side ; they three were of one measure : and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side .
40 : 12 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side , and the space was one cubit on that side : and the little chambers were six cubits on this side , and six cubits on that side .
40 : 19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without , an hundred cubits eastward and northward .
40 : 20 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north , he measured the length thereof , and the breadth thereof .
40 : 30 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long , and five cubits broad .
40 : 35 And he brought me to the north gate , and measured it according to these measures ; 40 : 36 The little chambers thereof , the posts thereof , and the arches thereof , and the windows to it round about : the length was fifty cubits , and the breadth five and twenty cubits .
40 : 37 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court ; and palm trees were upon the posts thereof , on this side , and on that side : and the going up to it had eight steps .
40 : 45 And he said unto me , This chamber , whose prospect is toward the south , is for the priests , the keepers of the charge of the house .
40 : 47 So he measured the court , an hundred cubits long , and an hundred cubits broad , foursquare ; and the altar that was before the house .
41 : 3 Then went he inward , and measured the post of the door , two cubits ; and the door , six cubits ; and the breadth of the door , seven cubits .
41 : 18 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees , so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub ; and every cherub had two faces ; 41 : 19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side , and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side : it was made through all the house round about .
41 : 20 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made , and on the wall of the temple .
41 : 22 The altar of wood was three cubits high , and the length thereof two cubits ; and the corners thereof , and the length thereof , and the walls thereof , were of wood : and he said unto me , This is the table that is before the LORD .
41 : 25 And there were made on them , on the doors of the temple , cherubims and palm trees , like as were made upon the walls ; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without .
42 : 4 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward , a way of one cubit ; and their doors toward the north .
42 : 8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty cubits : and , lo , before the temple were an hundred cubits .
42 : 11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north , as long as they , and as broad as they : and all their goings out were both according to their fashions , and according to their doors .
42 : 13 Then said he unto me , The north chambers and the south chambers , which are before the separate place , they be holy chambers , where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things : there shall they lay the most holy things , and the meat offering , and the sin offering , and the trespass offering ; for the place is holy .
42 : 18 He measured the south side , five hundred reeds , with the measuring reed .
43 : 6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house ; and the man stood by me .
43 : 8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds , and their post by my posts , and the wall between me and them , they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed : wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger .
43 : 26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it ; and they shall consecrate themselves .
44 : 1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east ; and it was shut .
44 : 24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment ; and they shall judge it according to my judgments : and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies ; and they shall hallow my sabbaths .
45 : 10 Ye shall have just balances , and a just ephah , and a just bath .
45 : 12 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs : twenty shekels , five and twenty shekels , fifteen shekels , shall be your maneh .
45 : 16 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel .
46 : 1 Thus saith the Lord GOD ; The gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days ; but on the sabbath it shall be opened , and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened .
46 : 4 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish , and a ram without blemish .
46 : 21 Then he brought me forth into the utter court , and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court ; and , behold , in every corner of the court there was a court .
46 : 24 Then said he unto me , These are the places of them that boil , where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people .
47 : 1 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house ; and , behold , waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward : for the forefront of the house stood toward the east , and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house , at the south side of the altar .
47 : 12 And by the river upon the bank thereof , on this side and on that side , shall grow all trees for meat , whose leaf shall not fade , neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed : it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months , because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary : and the fruit thereof shall be for meat , and the leaf thereof for medicine .
47 : 15 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side , from the great sea , the way of Hethlon , as men go to Zedad ; 47 : 16 Hamath , Berothah , Sibraim , which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath ; Hazarhatticon , which is by the coast of Hauran .
48 : 2 And by the border of Dan , from the east side unto the west side , a portion for Asher .
48 : 14 And they shall not sell of it , neither exchange , nor alienate the firstfruits of the land : for it is holy unto the LORD .
1 : 10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel , I fear my lord the king , who hath appointed your meat and your drink : for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort ?
2 : 4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack , O king , live for ever : tell thy servants the dream , and we will shew the interpretation .
2 : 20 Daniel answered and said , Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever : for wisdom and might are his : 2 : 21 And he changeth the times and the seasons : he removeth kings , and setteth up kings : he giveth wisdom unto the wise , and knowledge to them that know understanding : 2 : 22 He revealeth the deep and secret things : he knoweth what is in the darkness , and the light dwelleth with him .
2 : 24 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch , whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon : he went and said thus unto him ; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon : bring me in before the king , and I will shew unto the king the interpretation .
2 : 30 But as for me , this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living , but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king , and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart .
3 : 16 Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , answered and said to the king , O Nebuchadnezzar , we are not careful to answer thee in this matter .
3 : 27 And the princes , governors , and captains , and the king ' s counsellors , being gathered together , saw these men , upon whose bodies the fire had no power , nor was an hair of their head singed , neither were their coats changed , nor the smell of fire had passed on them .
4 : 4 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house , and flourishing in my palace : 4 : 5 I saw a dream which made me afraid , and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me .
4 : 6 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me , that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream .
4 : 8 But at the last Daniel came in before me , whose name was Belteshazzar , according to the name of my God , and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods : and before him I told the dream , saying , 4 : 9 O Belteshazzar , master of the magicians , because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee , and no secret troubleth thee , tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen , and the interpretation thereof .
Belteshazzar answered and said , My lord , the dream be to them that hate thee , and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies .
4 : 36 At the same time my reason returned unto me ; and for the glory of my kingdom , mine honour and brightness returned unto me ; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me ; and I was established in my kingdom , and excellent majesty was added unto me .
5 : 14 I have even heard of thee , that the spirit of the gods is in thee , and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee .
5 : 22 And thou his son , O Belshazzar , hast not humbled thine heart , though thou knewest all this ; 5 : 23 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven ; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee , and thou , and thy lords , thy wives , and thy concubines , have drunk wine in them ; and thou hast praised the gods of silver , and gold , of brass , iron , wood , and stone , which see not , nor hear , nor know : and the God in whose hand thy breath is , and whose are all thy ways , hast thou not glorified : 5 : 24 Then was the part of the hand sent from him ; and this writing was written .
5 : 25 And this is the writing that was written , MENE , MENE , TEKEL , UPHARSIN .
5 : 28 PERES ; Thy kingdom is divided , and given to the Medes and Persians .
6 : 5 Then said these men , We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel , except we find it against him concerning the law of his God .
6 : 14 Then the king , when he heard these words , was sore displeased with himself , and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him : and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him .
6 : 24 And the king commanded , and they brought those men which had accused Daniel , and they cast them into the den of lions , them , their children , and their wives ; and the lions had the mastery of them , and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den .
7 : 6 After this I beheld , and lo another , like a leopard , which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl ; the beast had also four heads ; and dominion was given to it .
7 : 8 I considered the horns , and , behold , there came up among them another little horn , before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots : and , behold , in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man , and a mouth speaking great things .
7 : 11 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake : I beheld even till the beast was slain , and his body destroyed , and given to the burning flame .
7 : 12 As concerning the rest of the beasts , they had their dominion taken away : yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time .
7 : 15 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body , and the visions of my head troubled me .
So he told me , and made me know the interpretation of the things .
7 : 18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom , and possess the kingdom for ever , even for ever and ever .
7 : 23 Thus he said , The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth , which shall be diverse from all kingdoms , and shall devour the whole earth , and shall tread it down , and break it in pieces .
7 : 24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise : and another shall rise after them ; and he shall be diverse from the first , and he shall subdue three kings .
7 : 27 And the kingdom and dominion , and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven , shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High , whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom , and all dominions shall serve and obey him .
7 : 28 Hitherto is the end of the matter .
8 : 9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn , which waxed exceeding great , toward the south , and toward the east , and toward the pleasant land .
8 : 12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression , and it cast down the truth to the ground ; and it practised , and prospered .
8 : 14 And he said unto me , Unto two thousand and three hundred days ; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed .
8 : 18 Now as he was speaking with me , I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground : but he touched me , and set me upright .
8 : 27 And I Daniel fainted , and was sick certain days ; afterward I rose up , and did the king ' s business ; and I was astonished at the vision , but none understood it .
9 : 1 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus , of the seed of the Medes , which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans ; 9 : 2 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years , whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet , that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem .
9 : 11 Yea , all Israel have transgressed thy law , even by departing , that they might not obey thy voice ; therefore the curse is poured upon us , and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God , because we have sinned against him .
9 : 15 And now , O Lord our God , that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand , and hast gotten thee renown , as at this day ; we have sinned , we have done wickedly .
9 : 24 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city , to finish the transgression , and to make an end of sins , and to make reconciliation for iniquity , and to bring in everlasting righteousness , and to seal up the vision and prophecy , and to anoint the most Holy .
9 : 26 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off , but not for himself : and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary ; and the end thereof shall be with a flood , and unto the end of the war desolations are determined .
9 : 27 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week : and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease , and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate , even until the consummation , and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate .
10 : 4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month , as I was by the side of the great river , which is Hiddekel ; 10 : 5 Then I lifted up mine eyes , and looked , and behold a certain man clothed in linen , whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz : 10 : 6 His body also was like the beryl , and his face as the appearance of lightning , and his eyes as lamps of fire , and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass , and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude .
10 : 10 And , behold , an hand touched me , which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands .
10 : 20 Then said he , Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee ?
and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia : and when I am gone forth , lo , the prince of Grecia shall come .
11 : 1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede , even I , stood to confirm and to strengthen him .
11 : 19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land : but he shall stumble and fall , and not be found .
11 : 26 Yea , they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him , and his army shall overflow : and many shall fall down slain .
11 : 45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain ; yet he shall come to his end , and none shall help him .
12 : 9 And he said , Go thy way , Daniel : for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end .
1 : 5 And it shall come to pass at that day , that I will break the bow of Israel , in the valley of Jezreel .
1 : 6 And she conceived again , and bare a daughter .
And God said unto him , Call her name Loruhamah : for I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel ; but I will utterly take them away .
1 : 7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah , and will save them by the LORD their God , and will not save them by bow , nor by sword , nor by battle , by horses , nor by horsemen .
1 : 10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea , which cannot be measured nor numbered ; and it shall come to pass , that in the place where it was said unto them , Ye are not my people , there it shall be said unto them , Ye are the sons of the living God .
4 : 10 For they shall eat , and not have enough : they shall commit whoredom , and shall not increase : because they have left off to take heed to the LORD .
5 : 1 Hear ye this , O priests ; and hearken , ye house of Israel ; and give ye ear , O house of the king ; for judgment is toward you , because ye have been a snare on Mizpah , and a net spread upon Tabor .
5 : 7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD : for they have begotten strange children : now shall a month devour them with their portions .
5 : 11 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment , because he willingly walked after the commandment .
5 : 14 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion , and as a young lion to the house of Judah : I , even I , will tear and go away ; I will take away , and none shall rescue him .
6 : 7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant : there have they dealt treacherously against me .
7 : 6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven , whiles they lie in wait : their baker sleepeth all the night ; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire .
7 : 15 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms , yet do they imagine mischief against me .
8 : 8 Israel is swallowed up : now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure .
9 : 12 Though they bring up their children , yet will I bereave them , that there shall not be a man left : yea , woe also to them when I depart from them !
10 : 2 Their heart is divided ; now shall they be found faulty : he shall break down their altars , he shall spoil their images .
10 : 8 The high places also of Aven , the sin of Israel , shall be destroyed : the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars ; and they shall say to the mountains , Cover us ; and to the hills , Fall on us .
11 : 1 When Israel was a child , then I loved him , and called my son out of Egypt .
11 : 10 They shall walk after the LORD : he shall roar like a lion : when he shall roar , then the children shall tremble from the west .
12 : 3 He took his brother by the heel in the womb , and by his strength he had power with God : 12 : 4 Yea , he had power over the angel , and prevailed : he wept , and made supplication unto him : he found him in Bethel , and there he spake with us ; 12 : 5 Even the LORD God of hosts ; the LORD is his memorial .
13 : 10 I will be thy king : where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities ?
prudent , and he shall know them ?
1 : 2 Hear this , ye old men , and give ear , all ye inhabitants of the land .
1 : 4 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten ; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten ; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten .
1 : 7 He hath laid my vine waste , and barked my fig tree : he hath made it clean bare , and cast it away ; the branches thereof are made white .
1 : 10 The field is wasted , the land mourneth ; for the corn is wasted : the new wine is dried up , the oil languisheth .
the herds of cattle are perplexed , because they have no pasture ; yea , the flocks of sheep are made desolate .
2 : 7 They shall run like mighty men ; they shall climb the wall like men of war ; and they shall march every one on his ways , and they shall not break their ranks : 2 : 8 Neither shall one thrust another ; they shall walk every one in his path : and when they fall upon the sword , they shall not be wounded .
2 : 10 The earth shall quake before them ; the heavens shall tremble : the sun and the moon shall be dark , and the stars shall withdraw their shining : 2 : 11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army : for his camp is very great : for he is strong that executeth his word : for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible ; and who can abide it ?
3 : 1 For , behold , in those days , and in that time , when I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem , 3 : 2 I will also gather all nations , and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat , and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel , whom they have scattered among the nations , and parted my land .
3 : 4 Yea , and what have ye to do with me , O Tyre , and Zidon , and all the coasts of Palestine ?
will ye render me a recompence ?
3 : 12 Let the heathen be wakened , and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat : for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round about .
3 : 14 Multitudes , multitudes in the valley of decision : for the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision .
3 : 16 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion , and utter his voice from Jerusalem ; and the heavens and the earth shall shake : but the LORD will be the hope of his people , and the strength of the children of Israel .
3 : 20 But Judah shall dwell for ever , and Jerusalem from generation to generation .
2 : 10 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt , and led you forty years through the wilderness , to possess the land of the Amorite .
saith the LORD .
3 : 3 Can two walk together , except they be agreed ?
3 : 7 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing , but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets .
3 : 11 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD ; An adversary there shall be even round about the land ; and he shall bring down thy strength from thee , and thy palaces shall be spoiled .
4 : 3 And ye shall go out at the breaches , every cow at that which is before her ; and ye shall cast them into the palace , saith the LORD .
4 : 7 And also I have withholden the rain from you , when there were yet three months to the harvest : and I caused it to rain upon one city , and caused it not to rain upon another city : one piece was rained upon , and the piece whereupon it rained not withered .
4 : 10 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt : your young men have I slain with the sword , and have taken away your horses ; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils : yet have ye not returned unto me , saith the LORD .
5 : 13 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time ; for it is an evil time .
5 : 17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing : for I will pass through thee , saith the LORD .
5 : 27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus , saith the LORD , whose name is The God of hosts .
6 : 3 Ye that put far away the evil day , and cause the seat of violence to come near ; 6 : 4 That lie upon beds of ivory , and stretch themselves upon their couches , and eat the lambs out of the flock , and the calves out of the midst of the stall ; 6 : 5 That chant to the sound of the viol , and invent to themselves instruments of musick , like David ; 6 : 6 That drink wine in bowls , and anoint themselves with the chief ointments : but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph .
Then shall he say , Hold thy tongue : for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD .
7 : 3 The LORD repented for this : It shall not be , saith the LORD .
7 : 5 Then said I , O Lord GOD , cease , I beseech thee : by whom shall Jacob arise ?
for he is small .
Then said the LORD , Behold , I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel : I will not again pass by them any more : 7 : 9 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate , and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste ; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword .
8 : 3 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day , saith the Lord GOD : there shall be many dead bodies in every place ; they shall cast them forth with silence .
and the sabbath , that we may set forth wheat , making the ephah small , and the shekel great , and falsifying the balances by deceit ?
8 : 8 Shall not the land tremble for this , and every one mourn that dwelleth therein ?
and the Philistines from Caphtor , and the Syrians from Kir ?
1 : 1 The vision of Obadiah .
1 : 5 If thieves came to thee , if robbers by night , ( how art thou cut off !
1 : 6 How are the things of Esau searched out !
1 : 13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity ; yea , thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity , nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity ; 1 : 14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway , to cut off those of his that did escape ; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress .
1 : 20 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites , even unto Zarephath ; and the captivity of Jerusalem , which is in Sepharad , shall possess the cities of the south .
arise , call upon thy God , if so be that God will think upon us , that we perish not .
1 : 8 Then said they unto him , Tell us , we pray thee , for whose cause this evil is upon us ; What is thine occupation ?
1 : 9 And he said unto them , I am an Hebrew ; and I fear the LORD , the God of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land .
1 : 11 Then said they unto him , What shall we do unto thee , that the sea may be calm unto us ?
2 : 7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD : and my prayer came in unto thee , into thine holy temple .
3 : 9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent , and turn away from his fierce anger , that we perish not ?
3 : 10 And God saw their works , that they turned from their evil way ; and God repented of the evil , that he had said that he would do unto them ; and he did it not .
Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish : for I knew that thou art a gracious God , and merciful , slow to anger , and of great kindness , and repentest thee of the evil .
Micah
What is the transgression of Jacob ?
2 : 5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the LORD .
2 : 7 O thou that art named the house of Jacob , is the spirit of the LORD straitened ?
2 : 11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie , saying , I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink ; he shall even be the prophet of this people .
3 : 5 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err , that bite with their teeth , and cry , Peace ; and he that putteth not into their mouths , they even prepare war against him .
4 : 5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god , and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever .
5 : 2 But thou , Bethlehem Ephratah , though thou be little among the thousands of Judah , yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel ; whose goings forth have been from of old , from everlasting .
5 : 10 And it shall come to pass in that day , saith the LORD , that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee , and I will destroy thy chariots : 5 : 11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land , and throw down all thy strong holds : 5 : 12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand ; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers : 5 : 13 Thy graven images also will I cut off , and thy standing images out of the midst of thee ; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands .
and wherein have I wearied thee ?
6 : 4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt , and redeemed thee out of the house of servants ; and I sent before thee Moses , Aaron , and Miriam .
shall I come before him with burnt offerings , with calves of a year old ?
6 : 11 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances , and with the bag of deceitful weights ?
6 : 12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence , and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies , and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth .
6 : 13 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee , in making thee desolate because of thy sins .
6 : 15 Thou shalt sow , but thou shalt not reap ; thou shalt tread the olives , but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil ; and sweet wine , but shalt not drink wine .
7 : 4 The best of them is as a brier : the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge : the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh ; now shall be their perplexity .
7 : 7 Therefore I will look unto the LORD ; I will wait for the God of my salvation : my God will hear me .
7 : 9 I will bear the indignation of the LORD , because I have sinned against him , until he plead my cause , and execute judgment for me : he will bring me forth to the light , and I shall behold his righteousness .
7 : 12 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria , and from the fortified cities , and from the fortress even to the river , and from sea to sea , and from mountain to mountain .
7 : 16 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might : they shall lay their hand upon their mouth , their ears shall be deaf .
Nahum
1 : 8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof , and darkness shall pursue his enemies .
1 : 13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee , and will burst thy bonds in sunder .
2 : 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red , the valiant men are in scarlet : the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation , and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken .
2 : 4 The chariots shall rage in the streets , they shall justle one against another in the broad ways : they shall seem like torches , they shall run like the lightnings .
2 : 5 He shall recount his worthies : they shall stumble in their walk ; they shall make haste to the wall thereof , and the defence shall be prepared .
2 : 8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water : yet they shall flee away .
2 : 2 And the LORD answered me , and said , Write the vision , and make it plain upon tables , that he may run that readeth it .
and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay !
2 : 9 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house , that he may set his nest on high , that he may be delivered from the power of evil !
2 : 12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood , and stablisheth a city by iniquity !
His glory covered the heavens , and the earth was full of his praise .
3 : 8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers ?
3 : 11 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation : at the light of thine arrows they went , and at the shining of thy glittering spear .
1 : 1 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi , the son of Gedaliah , the son of Amariah , the son of Hizkiah , in the days of Josiah the son of Amon , king of Judah .
2 : 1 Gather yourselves together , yea , gather together , O nation not desired ; 2 : 2 Before the decree bring forth , before the day pass as the chaff , before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you , before the day of the LORD ' s anger come upon you .
2 : 11 The LORD will be terrible unto them : for he will famish all the gods of the earth ; and men shall worship him , every one from his place , even all the isles of the heathen .
3 : 6 I have cut off the nations : their towers are desolate ; I made their streets waste , that none passeth by : their cities are destroyed , so that there is no man , that there is none inhabitant .
3 : 14 Sing , O daughter of Zion ; shout , O Israel ; be glad and rejoice with all the heart , O daughter of Jerusalem .
3 : 19 Behold , at that time I will undo all that afflict thee : and I will save her that halteth , and gather her that was driven out ; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame .
1 : 1 In the second year of Darius the king , in the sixth month , in the first day of the month , came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel , governor of Judah , and to Joshua the son of Josedech , the high priest , saying , 1 : 2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts , saying , This people say , The time is not come , the time that the LORD ' s house should be built .
1 : 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Consider your ways .
1 : 8 Go up to the mountain , and bring wood , and build the house ; and I will take pleasure in it , and I will be glorified , saith the LORD .
2 : 8 The silver is mine , and the gold is mine , saith the LORD of hosts .
2 : 10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month , in the second year of Darius , came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet , saying , 2 : 11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Ask now the priests concerning the law , saying , 2 : 12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment , and with his skirt do touch bread , or pottage , or wine , or oil , or any meat , shall it be holy ?
And the priests answered and said , It shall be unclean .
2 : 20 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month , saying , 2 : 21 Speak to Zerubbabel , governor of Judah , saying , I will shake the heavens and the earth ; 2 : 22 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms , and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen ; and I will overthrow the chariots , and those that ride in them ; and the horses and their riders shall come down , every one by the sword of his brother .
2 : 23 In that day , saith the LORD of hosts , will I take thee , O Zerubbabel , my servant , the son of Shealtiel , saith the LORD , and will make thee as a signet : for I have chosen thee , saith the LORD of hosts .
And the angel that talked with me said unto me , I will shew thee what these be .
1 : 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD ; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies : my house shall be built in it , saith the LORD of hosts , and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem .
1 : 18 Then lifted I up mine eyes , and saw , and behold four horns .
2 : 7 Deliver thyself , O Zion , that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon .
2 : 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts ; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you : for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye .
2 : 11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day , and shall be my people : and I will dwell in the midst of thee , and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee .
2 : 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land , and shall choose Jerusalem again .
3 : 8 Hear now , O Joshua the high priest , thou , and thy fellows that sit before thee : for they are men wondered at : for , behold , I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH .
4 : 11 Then answered I , and said unto him , What are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof ?
4 : 12 And I answered again , and said unto him , What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves ?
5 : 2 And he said unto me , What seest thou ?
And I answered , I see a flying roll ; the length thereof is twenty cubits , and the breadth thereof ten cubits .
5 : 10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me , Whither do these bear the ephah ?
6 : 2 In the first chariot were red horses ; and in the second chariot black horses ; 6 : 3 And in the third chariot white horses ; and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses .
7 : 4 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me , saying , 7 : 5 Speak unto all the people of the land , and to the priests , saying , When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month , even those seventy years , did ye at all fast unto me , even to me ?
7 : 11 But they refused to hearken , and pulled away the shoulder , and stopped their ears , that they should not hear .
8 : 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts ; Let your hands be strong , ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets , which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the LORD of hosts was laid , that the temple might be built .
8 : 13 And it shall come to pass , that as ye were a curse among the heathen , O house of Judah , and house of Israel ; so will I save you , and ye shall be a blessing : fear not , but let your hands be strong .
9 : 2 And Hamath also shall border thereby ; Tyrus , and Zidon , though it be very wise .
9 : 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod , and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines .
10 : 8 I will hiss for them , and gather them ; for I have redeemed them : and they shall increase as they have increased .
11 : 8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month ; and my soul lothed them , and their soul also abhorred me .
11 : 9 Then said I , I will not feed you : that that dieth , let it die ; and that that is to be cut off , let it be cut off ; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another .
11 : 16 For , lo , I will raise up a shepherd in the land , which shall not visit those that be cut off , neither shall seek the young one , nor heal that that is broken , nor feed that that standeth still : but he shall eat the flesh of the fat , and tear their claws in pieces .
12 : 2 Behold , I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about , when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem .
12 : 6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire among the wood , and like a torch of fire in a sheaf ; and they shall devour all the people round about , on the right hand and on the left : and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place , even in Jerusalem .
14 : 13 And it shall come to pass in that day , that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them ; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour , and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour .
14 : 14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem ; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together , gold , and silver , and apparel , in great abundance .
offer it now unto thy governor ; will he be pleased with thee , or accept thy person ?
1 : 10 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought ?
1 : 11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles ; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name , and a pure offering : for my name shall be great among the heathen , saith the LORD of hosts .
2 : 12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this , the master and the scholar , out of the tabernacles of Jacob , and him that offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts .
3 : 1 Behold , I will send my messenger , and he shall prepare the way before me : and the LORD , whom ye seek , shall suddenly come to his temple , even the messenger of the covenant , whom ye delight in : behold , he shall come , saith the LORD of hosts .
Yet ye have robbed me .
4 : 2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings ; and ye shall go forth , and grow up as calves of the stall .
1 : 1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
1 : 21 And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins .
2 : 3 When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
2 : 7 Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
2 : 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
2 : 9 When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
2 : 10 When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
3 : 16 And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him : 3 : 17 And lo a voice from heaven , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
4 : 3 And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
4 : 11 Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
4 : 22 And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
5 : 20 For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
5 : 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ; 5 : 24 Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
5 : 43 Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
5 : 44 But I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ; 5 : 45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
6 : 11 Give us this day our daily bread .
Amen .
6 : 17 But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ; 6 : 18 That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
6 : 25 Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on .
6 : 26 Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them .
Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin : 6 : 29 And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
or , What shall we drink ?
6 : 33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
7 : 3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
7 : 11 If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
7 : 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat : 7 : 14 Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
8 : 7 And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
8 : 11 And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
8 : 26 And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ?
9 : 2 And , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
9 : 4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
9 : 9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me .
9 : 16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
9 : 32 As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
10 : 20 For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
10 : 22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
10 : 39 He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
10 : 41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ' s reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ' s reward .
10 : 42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
A man clothed in soft raiment ?
behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
A prophet ?
11 : 14 And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
11 : 26 Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
12 : 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep ?
12 : 14 Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
12 : 33 Either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
12 : 44 Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
12 : 50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
13 : 17 For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
13 : 26 But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
13 : 33 Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
Whence then hath this man all these things ?
But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
13 : 58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
14 : 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus , 14 : 2 And said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
14 : 10 And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
14 : 26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
14 : 30 But when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
15 : 1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying , 15 : 2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ?
15 : 7 Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying , 15 : 8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
15 : 16 And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
15 : 17 Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
15 : 28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt .
15 : 29 And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
15 : 36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
15 : 38 And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
16 : 3 And in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowering .
16 : 8 Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
16 : 21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
16 : 28 Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
17 : 1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter , James , and John his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart , 17 : 2 And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
17 : 6 And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
17 : 7 And Jesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
17 : 11 And Jesus answered and said unto them , Elias truly shall first come , and restore all things .
17 : 14 And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying , 17 : 15 Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is lunatick , and sore vexed : for ofttimes he falleth into the fire , and oft into the water .
And they were exceeding sorry .
Jesus saith unto him , Then are the children free .
18 : 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
18 : 15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
18 : 18 Verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
18 : 30 And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
19 : 1 And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ; 19 : 2 And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
19 : 29 And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ' s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
20 : 2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
20 : 5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
20 : 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ?
20 : 21 And he said unto her , What wilt thou ?
Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
21 : 9 And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
21 : 26 But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
21 : 32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
21 : 41 They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
22 : 16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
22 : 23 The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him , 22 : 24 Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
for they all had her .
22 : 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
22 : 33 And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
22 : 39 And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
23 : 29 Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites !
23 : 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
24 : 1 And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
24 : 14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
24 : 15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand :) 24 : 16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains : 24 : 17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house : 24 : 18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
24 : 23 Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not .
24 : 32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh : 24 : 33 So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
24 : 36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
25 : 11 Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
25 : 16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
25 : 18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ' s money .
25 : 23 His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
25 : 29 For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
25 : 30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
or naked , and clothed thee ?
26 : 13 Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
26 : 16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
26 : 18 And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
26 : 21 And as they did eat , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
26 : 24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed !
26 : 25 Then Judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ?
26 : 29 But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ' s kingdom .
26 : 40 And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
26 : 44 And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
26 : 64 Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
26 : 67 Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands , 26 : 68 Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
26 : 71 And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
26 : 72 And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man .
And immediately the cock crew .
26 : 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
27 : 11 And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
27 : 12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
27 : 28 And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
27 : 36 And sitting down they watched him there ; 27 : 37 And set up over his head his accusation written , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
27 : 54 Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
27 : 55 And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him : 27 : 56 Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedees children .
27 : 66 So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
28 : 15 So they took the money , and did as they were taught : and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day .
1 : 1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ; 1 : 2 As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
1 : 12 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
1 : 19 And when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
1 : 28 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
1 : 35 And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
1 : 36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
1 : 38 And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
2 : 6 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts , 2 : 7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ?
2 : 12 And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
2 : 17 When Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
2 : 24 And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
2 : 25 And he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
3 : 3 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
3 : 6 And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
3 : 7 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea , 3 : 8 And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
3 : 9 And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
3 : 10 For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
3 : 11 And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
3 : 20 And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
3 : 26 And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
4 : 1 And he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
4 : 11 And he said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables : 4 : 12 That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
And there were also with him other little ships .
And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
5 : 15 And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
5 : 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
5 : 37 And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
and are not his sisters here with us ?
6 : 6 And he marvelled because of their unbelief .
6 : 7 And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ; 6 : 8 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse : 6 : 9 But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
6 : 10 And he said unto them , In what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
6 : 18 For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ' s wife .
6 : 24 And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ?
And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
6 : 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison , 6 : 28 And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
6 : 41 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
6 : 47 And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
6 : 51 And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
7 : 6 He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
7 : 17 And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
7 : 18 And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ?
7 : 20 And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
7 : 21 For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders , 7 : 22 Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness : 7 : 23 All these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
8 : 14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
perceive ye not yet , neither understand ?
and do ye not remember ?
8 : 23 And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
8 : 28 And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
8 : 30 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
8 : 33 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
8 : 36 For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
9 : 5 And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
9 : 10 And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
9 : 12 And he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
9 : 14 And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
bring him unto me .
9 : 28 And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
9 : 34 But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
9 : 45 And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched : 9 : 46 Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
9 : 47 And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire : 9 : 48 Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
10 : 17 And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
10 : 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words .
10 : 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
10 : 38 But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ?
10 : 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
10 : 50 And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
11 : 15 And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ; 11 : 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
11 : 17 And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ?
but ye have made it a den of thieves .
11 : 29 And Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
11 : 30 The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
answer me .
12 : 6 Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
12 : 12 And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
12 : 17 And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ' s , and to God the things that are God ' s .
And they marvelled at him .
12 : 28 And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
And the common people heard him gladly .
12 : 43 And he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury : 12 : 44 For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
13 : 17 But woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
13 : 20 And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect ' s sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
13 : 30 Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
14 : 3 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
14 : 13 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
14 : 25 Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
14 : 26 And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
14 : 29 But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I .
14 : 39 And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
14 : 40 And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy ,) neither wist they what to answer him .
14 : 42 Rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
14 : 45 And as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
14 : 69 And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
15 : 8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
15 : 10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
15 : 13 And they cried out again , Crucify him .
15 : 24 And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
15 : 28 And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
15 : 32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe .
15 : 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ?
15 : 36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
15 : 45 And when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
15 : 46 And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
16 : 9 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week , he appeared first to Mary Magdalene , out of whom he had cast seven devils .
16 : 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be damned .
The Gospel According to Saint Luke
1 : 5 THERE was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
1 : 7 And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
1 : 13 But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
1 : 20 And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
1 : 63 And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is John .
1 : 64 And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
1 : 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
1 : 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying , 1 : 68 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people , 1 : 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ; 1 : 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began : 1 : 71 That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ; 1 : 72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ; 1 : 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham , 1 : 74 That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear , 1 : 75 In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
2 : 9 And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
2 : 36 And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ; 2 : 37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
2 : 48 And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ?
2 : 49 And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ?
3 : 5 Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ; 3 : 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
3 : 19 But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip ' s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done , 3 : 20 Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
4 : 3 And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
4 : 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
4 : 20 And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down .
4 : 39 And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
4 : 42 And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
5 : 3 And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon ' s , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land .
5 : 7 And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them .
5 : 17 And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
5 : 20 And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
5 : 25 And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
5 : 26 And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to day .
5 : 28 And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
5 : 35 But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
6 : 5 And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
6 : 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
6 : 9 Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ?
6 : 11 And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
6 : 20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
6 : 22 Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man ' s sake .
6 : 23 Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
6 : 27 But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you , 6 : 28 Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
6 : 42 Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
6 : 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
7 : 11 And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
7 : 21 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
7 : 27 This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
7 : 31 And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ?
7 : 33 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil .
7 : 36 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him .
7 : 39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
7 : 40 And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee .
7 : 42 And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both .
7 : 46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
7 : 48 And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
8 : 1 And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him , 8 : 2 And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils , 8 : 3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod ' s steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
8 : 7 And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
8 : 19 Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
8 : 22 Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake .
for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
I beseech thee , torment me not .
8 : 36 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
8 : 38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying , 8 : 39 Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee .
And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him .
When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
8 : 52 And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
9 : 1 Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
9 : 13 But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat .
9 : 14 For they were about five thousand men .
9 : 32 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
9 : 33 And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
9 : 43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God .
9 : 56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men ' s lives , but to save them .
10 : 1 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
Go not from house to house .
10 : 28 And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
11 : 4 And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us .
11 : 10 For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
11 : 11 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ?
11 : 15 But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
11 : 16 And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
11 : 17 But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
11 : 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
11 : 26 Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
11 : 42 But woe unto you , Pharisees !
11 : 45 Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
11 : 46 And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers !
11 : 52 Woe unto you , lawyers !
12 : 4 And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
12 : 16 And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully : 12 : 17 And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
12 : 21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
12 : 29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
12 : 35 Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ; 12 : 36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
12 : 56 Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
12 : 59 I tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite .
13 : 17 And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
13 : 19 It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
13 : 22 And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
13 : 29 And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
13 : 30 And , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ; 14 : 5 And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
14 : 32 Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
And he divided unto them his living .
15 : 13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
15 : 17 And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father ' s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
16 : 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
16 : 25 But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
16 : 26 And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
16 : 30 And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
17 : 9 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ?
17 : 12 And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off : 17 : 13 And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
17 : 15 And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God , 17 : 16 And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
17 : 20 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation : 17 : 21 Neither shall they say , Lo here !
17 : 22 And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
17 : 26 And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
17 : 30 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
17 : 32 Remember Lot ' s wife .
18 : 6 And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .
18 : 7 And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
none is good , save one , that is , God .
18 : 25 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ' s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
18 : 38 And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
18 : 43 And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
19 : 6 And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
) 19 : 26 For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
19 : 47 And he taught daily in the temple .
20 : 6 But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
20 : 11 And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
20 : 21 And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly : 20 : 22 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ?
20 : 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
20 : 29 There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
20 : 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ?
20 : 37 Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
21 : 2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
21 : 7 And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ?
21 : 9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
21 : 18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
21 : 33 Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
22 : 19 And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
22 : 22 And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
22 : 23 And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
22 : 27 For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ?
22 : 31 And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat : 22 : 32 But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
22 : 40 And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
22 : 47 And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
And Peter followed afar off .
for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
23 : 2 And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
23 : 12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
) 23 : 18 And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas : 23 : 19 ( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison .
23 : 39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
23 : 50 And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just : 23 : 51 ( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ;) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
24 : 4 And it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout , behold , two men stood by them in shining garments : 24 : 5 And as they were afraid , and bowed down their faces to the earth , they said unto them , Why seek ye the living among the dead ?
24 : 13 And , behold , two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus , which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs .
24 : 17 And he said unto them , What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another , as ye walk , and are sad ?
24 : 19 And he said unto them , What things ?
24 : 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets , he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself .
24 : 28 And they drew nigh unto the village , whither they went : and he made as though he would have gone further .
And he went in to tarry with them .
24 : 32 And they said one to another , Did not our heart burn within us , while he talked with us by the way , and while he opened to us the scriptures ?
24 : 33 And they rose up the same hour , and returned to Jerusalem , and found the eleven gathered together , and them that were with them , 24 : 34 Saying , The Lord is risen indeed , and hath appeared to Simon .
24 : 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish , and of an honeycomb .
1 : 25 And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
1 : 38 Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ?
1 : 43 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
1 : 49 Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel .
thou shalt see greater things than these .
2 : 7 Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water .
2 : 22 When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
3 : 19 And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
3 : 24 For John was not yet cast into prison .
3 : 25 Then there arose a question between some of John ' s disciples and the Jews about purifying .
3 : 27 John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
3 : 29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ' s voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
4 : 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
4 : 10 Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
4 : 13 Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again : 4 : 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
4 : 15 The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband : 4 : 18 For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
4 : 32 But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of .
4 : 33 Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
4 : 36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
4 : 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
4 : 45 Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
4 : 52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend .
5 : 19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
5 : 33 Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth .
5 : 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
5 : 41 I receive not honour from men .
5 : 43 I am come in my Father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
6 : 1 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
6 : 4 And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
6 : 15 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
6 : 18 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
6 : 22 The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ; 6 : 23 ( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks :) 6 : 24 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
6 : 31 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
6 : 42 And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ?
6 : 53 Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
6 : 55 For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
6 : 64 But there are some of you that believe not .
If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
7 : 9 When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
7 : 14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
7 : 17 If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
Why go ye about to kill me ?
7 : 34 Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come .
7 : 41 Others said , This is the Christ .
7 : 43 So there was a division among the people because of him .
7 : 50 Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them ,) 7 : 51 Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
8 : 2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
8 : 11 She said , No man , Lord .
And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
8 : 16 And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come .
8 : 24 I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
8 : 30 As he spake these words , many believed on him .
8 : 33 They answered him , We be Abraham ' s seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
8 : 37 I know that ye are Abraham ' s seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
8 : 40 But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him .
8 : 47 He that is of God heareth God ' s words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
9 : 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ?
He said , He is a prophet .
9 : 33 If this man were not of God , he could do nothing .
And they cast him out .
10 : 5 And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
10 : 7 Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
10 : 17 Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
10 : 26 But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
10 : 27 My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me : 10 : 28 And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
11 : 5 Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
11 : 12 Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
11 : 14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
11 : 20 Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
11 : 28 And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
11 : 29 As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
11 : 30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
11 : 34 And said , Where have ye laid him ?
They said unto him , Lord , come and see .
11 : 41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid .
11 : 43 And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
11 : 45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
11 : 46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
11 : 49 And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all , 11 : 50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
11 : 57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
12 : 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
12 : 17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
12 : 24 Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
12 : 26 If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour .
12 : 32 And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
12 : 41 These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
12 : 49 For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
13 : 11 For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
13 : 22 Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
13 : 24 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
I will lay down my life for thy sake .
14 : 8 Philip saith unto him , Lord , shew us the Father , and it sufficeth us .
14 : 18 I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you .
14 : 20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
15 : 2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
15 : 3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
15 : 19 If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
16 : 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
16 : 18 They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ?
Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
16 : 28 I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
17 : 7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
17 : 11 And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee .
17 : 17 Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
17 : 20 Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ; 17 : 21 That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
18 : 1 When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
18 : 2 And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
18 : 5 They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth .
And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
18 : 6 As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
18 : 7 Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ?
The servant ' s name was Malchus .
18 : 15 And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
18 : 21 Why askest thou me ?
ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
18 : 34 Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth .
19 : 2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe , 19 : 3 And said , Hail , King of the Jews !
19 : 11 Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
19 : 19 And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross .
And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS .
19 : 20 This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
19 : 21 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
These things therefore the soldiers did .
19 : 25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ' s sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
19 : 26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
19 : 28 After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
20 : 2 Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
20 : 6 Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie , 20 : 7 And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
20 : 8 Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
20 : 17 Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
20 : 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the LORD .
20 : 21 Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
20 : 25 The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the LORD .
20 : 26 And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
20 : 28 And Thomas answered and said unto him , My LORD and my God .
21 : 3 Simon Peter saith unto them , I go a fishing .
21 : 5 Then Jesus saith unto them , Children , have ye any meat ?
And none of the disciples durst ask him , Who art thou ?
this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
1 : 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
2 : 32 This Jesus hath God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
2 : 44 And all that believed were together , and had all things common ; 2 : 45 And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
3 : 6 Then Peter said , Silver and gold have I none ; but such as I have give I thee : In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk .
3 : 11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon ' s , greatly wondering .
4 : 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
4 : 24 And when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is : 4 : 25 Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
4 : 29 And now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word , 4 : 30 By stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
4 : 31 And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
4 : 36 And Joses , who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas , ( which is , being interpreted , The son of consolation ,) a Levite , and of the country of Cyprus , 4 : 37 Having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
5 : 6 And the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
5 : 10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
5 : 11 And great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
5 : 13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
5 : 14 And believers were the more added to the Lord , multitudes both of men and women .
) 5 : 15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
5 : 34 Then stood there up one in the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ; 5 : 35 And said unto them , Ye men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
6 : 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , It is not reason that we should leave the word of God , and serve tables .
6 : 9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and of Asia , disputing with Stephen .
6 : 15 And all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
7 : 12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
7 : 20 In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father ' s house three months : 7 : 21 And when he was cast out , Pharaoh ' s daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
7 : 38 This is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us : 7 : 39 To whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt , 7 : 40 Saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
7 : 47 But Solomon built him an house .
saith the Lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
7 : 50 Hath not my hand made all these things ?
8 : 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them .
8 : 18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money , 8 : 19 Saying , Give me also this power , that on whomsoever I lay hands , he may receive the Holy Ghost .
8 : 21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of God .
8 : 31 And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ?
of himself , or of some other man ?
8 : 36 And as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , See , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
8 : 40 But Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
9 : 5 And he said , Who art thou , Lord ?
9 : 10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias .
9 : 27 But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
10 : 3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Cornelius .
10 : 16 This was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
10 : 27 And as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
10 : 29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
10 : 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree : 10 : 40 Him God raised up the third day , and shewed him openly ; 10 : 41 Not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
10 : 44 While Peter yet spake these words , the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
10 : 45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost .
11 : 8 But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
11 : 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
11 : 11 And , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was , sent from Caesarea unto me .
11 : 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting .
11 : 16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
And it came to pass , that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church , and taught much people .
11 : 28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
) 12 : 4 And when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
12 : 14 And when she knew Peter ' s voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how Peter stood before the gate .
12 : 15 And they said unto her , Thou art mad .
12 : 18 Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
12 : 21 And upon a set day Herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
13 : 8 But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
13 : 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , Ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
13 : 22 And when he had removed him , he raised up unto them David to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimony , and said , I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after mine own heart , which shall fulfil all my will .
13 : 23 Of this man ' s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus : 13 : 24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
13 : 46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
13 : 48 And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
13 : 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
13 : 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto Iconium .
14 : 17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
15 : 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
15 : 11 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
15 : 19 Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God : 15 : 20 But that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
Fare ye well .
15 : 33 And after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
15 : 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
15 : 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
16 : 22 And the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
16 : 35 And when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , Let those men go .
16 : 39 And they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
17 : 10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews .
17 : 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
17 : 15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
17 : 29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man ' s device .
18 : 1 After these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth ; 18 : 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , lately come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla ; ( because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome :) and came unto them .
18 : 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks .
18 : 16 And he drave them from the judgment seat .
18 : 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat .
And Gallio cared for none of those things .
18 : 20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ; 18 : 21 But bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will .
And he sailed from Ephesus .
18 : 23 And after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
19 : 4 Then said Paul , John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on Christ Jesus .
19 : 15 And the evil spirit answered and said , Jesus I know , and Paul I know ; but who are ye ?
19 : 18 And many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .
19 : 20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed .
19 : 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rashly .
20 : 7 And upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
20 : 13 And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
20 : 24 But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
20 : 36 And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
21 : 22 What is it therefore ?
Who said , Canst thou speak Greek ?
22 : 6 And it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
22 : 8 And I answered , Who art thou , Lord ?
22 : 14 And he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that Just One , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
22 : 26 When the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , Take heed what thou doest : for this man is a Roman .
23 : 3 Then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
23 : 4 And they that stood by said , Revilest thou God ' s high priest ?
23 : 10 And when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
23 : 13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
23 : 32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle : 23 : 33 Who , when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
23 : 34 And when the governor had read the letter , he asked of what province he was .
24 : 4 Notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
24 : 7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands , 24 : 8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
24 : 17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
25 : 8 While he answered for himself , Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I offended any thing at all .
25 : 17 Therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
25 : 21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus , I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar .
25 : 23 And on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
25 : 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
26 : 1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself .
26 : 8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
26 : 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
26 : 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
26 : 21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
I know that thou believest .
26 : 28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian .
27 : 3 And the next day we touched at Sidon .
27 : 5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
27 : 27 But when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ; 27 : 28 And sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
27 : 30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship , 27 : 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , Except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saved .
27 : 38 And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
27 : 41 And falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
28 : 2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness : for they kindled a fire , and received us every one , because of the present rain , and because of the cold .
28 : 18 Who , when they had examined me , would have let me go , because there was no cause of death in me .
28 : 21 And they said unto him , We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee , neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee .
28 : 29 And when he had said these words , the Jews departed , and had great reasoning among themselves .
28 : 30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house , and received all that came in unto him , 28 : 31 Preaching the kingdom of God , and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ , with all confidence , no man forbidding him .
1 : 13 Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto ,) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
1 : 14 I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
1 : 24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves : 1 : 25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever .
2 : 12 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ; 2 : 13 ( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
3 : 2 Much every way : chiefly , because that unto them were committed the oracles of God .
3 : 4 God forbid : yea , let God be true , but every man a liar ; as it is written , That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings , and mightest overcome when thou art judged .
3 : 5 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God , what shall we say ?
( I speak as a man ) 3 : 6 God forbid : for then how shall God judge the world ?
3 : 8 And not rather , ( as we be slanderously reported , and as some affirm that we say ,) Let us do evil , that good may come ?
3 : 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law .
is he not also of the Gentiles ?
4 : 4 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace , but of debt .
when he was in circumcision , or in uncircumcision ?
4 : 11 And he received the sign of circumcision , a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised : that he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also : 4 : 12 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only , but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham , which he had being yet uncircumcised .
4 : 14 For if they which are of the law be heirs , faith is made void , and the promise made of none effect : 4 : 15 Because the law worketh wrath : for where no law is , there is no transgression .
4 : 18 Who against hope believed in hope , that he might become the father of many nations , according to that which was spoken , So shall thy seed be .
5 : 10 For if , when we were enemies , we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son , much more , being reconciled , we shall be saved by his life .
5 : 19 For as by one man ' s disobedience many were made sinners , so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous .
6 : 11 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin , but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord .
6 : 12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body , that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof .
6 : 18 Being then made free from sin , ye became the servants of righteousness .
for the end of those things is death .
7 : 7 What shall we say then ?
7 : 8 But sin , taking occasion by the commandment , wrought in me all manner of concupiscence .
For without the law sin was dead .
7 : 19 For the good that I would I do not : but the evil which I would not , that I do .
7 : 22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man : 7 : 23 But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members .
8 : 7 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God : for it is not subject to the law of God , neither indeed can be .
8 : 18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us .
8 : 23 And not only they , but ourselves also , which have the firstfruits of the Spirit , even we ourselves groan within ourselves , waiting for the adoption , to wit , the redemption of our body .
8 : 30 Moreover whom he did predestinate , them he also called : and whom he called , them he also justified : and whom he justified , them he also glorified .
8 : 36 As it is written , For thy sake we are killed all the day long ; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter .
9 : 1 I say the truth in Christ , I lie not , my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost , 9 : 2 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart .
9 : 14 What shall we say then ?
9 : 17 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh , Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might shew my power in thee , and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth .
( that is , to bring Christ down from above :) 10 : 7 Or , Who shall descend into the deep ?
( that is , to bring up Christ again from the dead .
10 : 13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved .
10 : 15 And how shall they preach , except they be sent ?
10 : 20 But Esaias is very bold , and saith , I was found of them that sought me not ; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me .
11 : 1 I say then , Hath God cast away his people ?
11 : 2 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew .
But if thou boast , thou bearest not the root , but the root thee .
11 : 19 Thou wilt say then , The branches were broken off , that I might be graffed in .
11 : 22 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God : on them which fell , severity ; but toward thee , goodness , if thou continue in his goodness : otherwise thou also shalt be cut off .
11 : 30 For as ye in times past have not believed God , yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief : 11 : 31 Even so have these also now not believed , that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy .
12 : 3 For I say , through the grace given unto me , to every man that is among you , not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think ; but to think soberly , according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith .
12 : 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us , whether prophecy , let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith ; 12 : 7 Or ministry , let us wait on our ministering : or he that teacheth , on teaching ; 12 : 8 Or he that exhorteth , on exhortation : he that giveth , let him do it with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with diligence ; he that sheweth mercy , with cheerfulness .
12 : 14 Bless them which persecute you : bless , and curse not .
12 : 20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger , feed him ; if he thirst , give him drink : for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head .
12 : 21 Be not overcome of evil , but overcome evil with good .
For there is no power but of God : the powers that be are ordained of God .
13 : 2 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God : and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation .
13 : 7 Render therefore to all their dues : tribute to whom tribute is due ; custom to whom custom ; fear to whom fear ; honour to whom honour .
13 : 8 Owe no man any thing , but to love one another : for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law .
13 : 13 Let us walk honestly , as in the day ; not in rioting and drunkenness , not in chambering and wantonness , not in strife and envying .
14 : 9 For to this end Christ both died , and rose , and revived , that he might be Lord both of the dead and living .
14 : 11 For it is written , As I live , saith the Lord , every knee shall bow to me , and every tongue shall confess to God .
14 : 13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more : but judge this rather , that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother ' s way .
14 : 14 I know , and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus , that there is nothing unclean of itself : but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean , to him it is unclean .
15 : 3 For even Christ pleased not himself ; but , as it is written , The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me .
15 : 4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning , that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope .
15 : 5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus : 15 : 6 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ .
16 : 10 Salute Apelles approved in Christ .
16 : 11 Salute Herodion my kinsman .
16 : 16 Salute one another with an holy kiss .
16 : 25 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel , and the preaching of Jesus Christ , according to the revelation of the mystery , which was kept secret since the world began , 16 : 26 But now is made manifest , and by the scriptures of the prophets , according to the commandment of the everlasting God , made known to all nations for the obedience of faith : 16 : 27 To God only wise , be glory through Jesus Christ for ever .
1 : 22 For the Jews require a sign , and the Greeks seek after wisdom : 1 : 23 But we preach Christ crucified , unto the Jews a stumblingblock , and unto the Greeks foolishness ; 1 : 24 But unto them which are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God .
1 : 26 For ye see your calling , brethren , how that not many wise men after the flesh , not many mighty , not many noble , are called : 1 : 27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty ; 1 : 28 And base things of the world , and things which are despised , hath God chosen , yea , and things which are not , to bring to nought things that are : 1 : 29 That no flesh should glory in his presence .
3 : 6 I have planted , Apollos watered ; but God gave the increase .
3 : 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world , let him become a fool , that he may be wise .
3 : 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God .
For it is written , He taketh the wise in their own craftiness .
3 : 21 Therefore let no man glory in men .
4 : 2 Moreover it is required in stewards , that a man be found faithful .
now if thou didst receive it , why dost thou glory , as if thou hadst not received it ?
4 : 14 I write not these things to shame you , but as my beloved sons I warn you .
4 : 18 Now some are puffed up , as though I would not come to you .
5 : 9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators : 5 : 10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world , or with the covetous , or extortioners , or with idolaters ; for then must ye needs go out of the world .
do not ye judge them that are within ?
6 : 1 Dare any of you , having a matter against another , go to law before the unjust , and not before the saints ?
6 : 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels ?
6 : 4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life , set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church .
6 : 5 I speak to your shame .
why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded ?
6 : 8 Nay , ye do wrong , and defraud , and that your brethren .
6 : 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ?
Be not deceived : neither fornicators , nor idolaters , nor adulterers , nor effeminate , nor abusers of themselves with mankind , 6 : 10 Nor thieves , nor covetous , nor drunkards , nor revilers , nor extortioners , shall inherit the kingdom of God .
6 : 11 And such were some of you : but ye are washed , but ye are sanctified , but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus , and by the Spirit of our God .
6 : 12 All things are lawful unto me , but all things are not expedient : all things are lawful for me , but I will not be brought under the power of any .
6 : 16 What ?
Every sin that a man doeth is without the body ; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body .
6 : 20 For ye are bought with a price : therefore glorify God in your body , and in your spirit , which are God ' s .
But every man hath his proper gift of God , one after this manner , and another after that .
7 : 9 But if they cannot contain , let them marry : for it is better to marry than to burn .
7 : 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife , and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband : else were your children unclean ; but now are they holy .
A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases : but God hath called us to peace .
or how knowest thou , O man , whether thou shalt save thy wife ?
Knowledge puffeth up , but charity edifieth .
8 : 8 But meat commendeth us not to God : for neither , if we eat , are we the better ; neither , if we eat not , are we the worse .
9 : 3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this , 9 : 4 Have we not power to eat and to drink ?
or who feedeth a flock , and eateth not of the milk of the flock ?
or saith not the law the same also ?
Nevertheless we have not used this power ; but suffer all things , lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ .
Verily that , when I preach the gospel , I may make the gospel of Christ without charge , that I abuse not my power in the gospel .
9 : 19 For though I be free from all men , yet have I made myself servant unto all , that I might gain the more .
9 : 22 To the weak became I as weak , that I might gain the weak : I am made all things to all men , that I might by all means save some .
10 : 19 What say I then ?
10 : 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord , and the cup of devils : ye cannot be partakers of the Lord ' s table , and of the table of devils .
11 : 6 For if the woman be not covered , let her also be shorn : but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven , let her be covered .
11 : 20 When ye come together therefore into one place , this is not to eat the Lord ' s supper .
11 : 22 What ?
have ye not houses to eat and to drink in ?
11 : 31 For if we would judge ourselves , we should not be judged .
And the rest will I set in order when I come .
12 : 20 But now are they many members , yet but one body .
12 : 29 Are all apostles ?
13 : 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels , and have not charity , I am become as sounding brass , or a tinkling cymbal .
13 : 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor , and though I give my body to be burned , and have not charity , it profiteth me nothing .
13 : 10 But when that which is perfect is come , then that which is in part shall be done away .
14 : 6 Now , brethren , if I come unto you speaking with tongues , what shall I profit you , except I shall speak to you either by revelation , or by knowledge , or by prophesying , or by doctrine ?
for ye shall speak into the air .
14 : 15 What is it then ?
I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
14 : 17 For thou verily givest thanks well , but the other is not edified .
14 : 22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign , not to them that believe , but to them that believe not : but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not , but for them which believe .
14 : 29 Let the prophets speak two or three , and let the other judge .
14 : 33 For God is not the author of confusion , but of peace , as in all churches of the saints .
14 : 34 Let your women keep silence in the churches : for it is not permitted unto them to speak ; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law .
or came it unto you only ?
14 : 39 Wherefore , brethren , covet to prophesy , and forbid not to speak with tongues .
15 : 26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death .
15 : 36 Thou fool , that which thou sowest is not quickened , except it die : 15 : 37 And that which thou sowest , thou sowest not that body that shall be , but bare grain , it may chance of wheat , or of some other grain : 15 : 38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him , and to every seed his own body .
15 : 39 All flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh of men , another flesh of beasts , another of fishes , and another of birds .
15 : 47 The first man is of the earth , earthy ; the second man is the Lord from heaven .
16 : 4 And if it be meet that I go also , they shall go with me .
16 : 8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost .
16 : 9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me , and there are many adversaries .
Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord , with the church that is in their house .
16 : 24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus .
1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , and Timothy our brother , unto the church of God which is at Corinth , with all the saints which are in all Achaia : 1 : 2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
1 : 3 Blessed be God , even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Father of mercies , and the God of all comfort ; 1 : 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble , by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God .
1 : 20 For all the promises of God in him are yea , and in him Amen , unto the glory of God by us .
2 : 6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment , which was inflicted of many .
2 : 9 For to this end also did I write , that I might know the proof of you , whether ye be obedient in all things .
And who is sufficient for these things ?
4 : 6 For God , who commanded the light to shine out of darkness , hath shined in our hearts , to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ .
4 : 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels , that the excellency of the power may be of God , and not of us .
4 : 13 We having the same spirit of faith , according as it is written , I believed , and therefore have I spoken ; we also believe , and therefore speak ; 4 : 14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus , and shall present us with you .
5 : 5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God , who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit .
5 : 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in his body , according to that he hath done , whether it be good or bad .
5 : 16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh : yea , though we have known Christ after the flesh , yet now henceforth know we him no more .
5 : 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin ; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him .
6 : 14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers : for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness ?
6 : 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols ?
6 : 18 And will be a Father unto you , and ye shall be my sons and daughters , saith the Lord Almighty .
7 : 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort : yea , and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus , because his spirit was refreshed by you all .
8 : 7 Therefore , as ye abound in every thing , in faith , and utterance , and knowledge , and in all diligence , and in your love to us , see that ye abound in this grace also .
8 : 9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich .
8 : 13 For I mean not that other men be eased , and ye burdened : 8 : 14 But by an equality , that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want , that their abundance also may be a supply for your want : that there may be equality : 8 : 15 As it is written , He that had gathered much had nothing over ; and he that had gathered little had no lack .
8 : 16 But thanks be to God , which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you .
9 : 3 Yet have I sent the brethren , lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf ; that , as I said , ye may be ready : 9 : 4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me , and find you unprepared , we ( that we say not , ye ) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting .
9 : 7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart , so let him give ; not grudgingly , or of necessity : for God loveth a cheerful giver .
10 : 1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ , who in presence am base among you , but being absent am bold toward you : 10 : 2 But I beseech you , that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence , wherewith I think to be bold against some , which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh .
10 : 10 For his letters , say they , are weighty and powerful ; but his bodily presence is weak , and his speech contemptible .
11 : 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus , whom we have not preached , or if ye receive another spirit , which ye have not received , or another gospel , which ye have not accepted , ye might well bear with him .
12 : 13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches , except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you ?
12 : 20 For I fear , lest , when I come , I shall not find you such as I would , and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not : lest there be debates , envyings , wraths , strifes , backbitings , whisperings , swellings , tumults : 12 : 21 And lest , when I come again , my God will humble me among you , and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already , and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed .
For we also are weak in him , but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you .
13 : 9 For we are glad , when we are weak , and ye are strong : and this also we wish , even your perfection .
13 : 10 Therefore I write these things being absent , lest being present I should use sharpness , according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification , and not to destruction .
1 : 21 Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia ; 1 : 22 And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ : 1 : 23 But they had heard only , That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed .
1 : 24 And they glorified God in me .
2 : 18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed , I make myself a transgressor .
3 : 5 He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit , and worketh miracles among you , doeth he it by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
3 : 11 But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God , it is evident : for , The just shall live by faith .
3 : 12 And the law is not of faith : but , The man that doeth them shall live in them .
3 : 19 Wherefore then serveth the law ?
It was added because of transgressions , till the seed should come to whom the promise was made ; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator .
3 : 27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ .
4 : 8 Howbeit then , when ye knew not God , ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods .
4 : 19 My little children , of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you , 4 : 20 I desire to be present with you now , and to change my voice ; for I stand in doubt of you .
4 : 31 So then , brethren , we are not children of the bondwoman , but of the free .
6 : 13 For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law ; but desire to have you circumcised , that they may glory in your flesh .
6 : 15 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing , nor uncircumcision , but a new creature .
1 : 1 Paul , an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God , to the saints which are at Ephesus , and to the faithful in Christ Jesus : 1 : 2 Grace be to you , and peace , from God our Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ .
3 : 14 For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , 3 : 15 Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named , 3 : 16 That he would grant you , according to the riches of his glory , to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man ; 3 : 17 That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith ; that ye , being rooted and grounded in love , 3 : 18 May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth , and length , and depth , and height ; 3 : 19 And to know the love of Christ , which passeth knowledge , that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God .
Amen .
4 : 10 He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all things .
4 : 20 But ye have not so learned Christ ; 4 : 21 If so be that ye have heard him , and have been taught by him , as the truth is in Jesus : 4 : 22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man , which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts ; 4 : 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind ; 4 : 24 And that ye put on the new man , which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness .
4 : 28 Let him that stole steal no more : but rather let him labour , working with his hands the thing which is good , that he may have to give to him that needeth .
4 : 29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth , but that which is good to the use of edifying , that it may minister grace unto the hearers .
He that loveth his wife loveth himself .
6 : 4 And , ye fathers , provoke not your children to wrath : but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord .
6 : 17 And take the helmet of salvation , and the sword of the Spirit , which is the word of God : 6 : 18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit , and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints ; 6 : 19 And for me , that utterance may be given unto me , that I may open my mouth boldly , to make known the mystery of the gospel , 6 : 20 For which I am an ambassador in bonds : that therein I may speak boldly , as I ought to speak .
6 : 21 But that ye also may know my affairs , and how I do , Tychicus , a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord , shall make known to you all things : 6 : 22 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that ye might know our affairs , and that he might comfort your hearts .
6 : 23 Peace be to the brethren , and love with faith , from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ .
Amen .
The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians
2 : 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him , and given him a name which is above every name : 2 : 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow , of things in heaven , and things in earth , and things under the earth ; 2 : 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the glory of God the Father .
2 : 14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings : 2 : 15 That ye may be blameless and harmless , the sons of God , without rebuke , in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation , among whom ye shine as lights in the world ; 2 : 16 Holding forth the word of life ; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ , that I have not run in vain , neither laboured in vain .
2 : 24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly .
2 : 28 I sent him therefore the more carefully , that , when ye see him again , ye may rejoice , and that I may be the less sorrowful .
3 : 15 Let us therefore , as many as be perfect , be thus minded : and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded , God shall reveal even this unto you .
4 : 3 And I intreat thee also , true yokefellow , help those women which laboured with me in the gospel , with Clement also , and with other my fellowlabourers , whose names are in the book of life .
4 : 9 Those things , which ye have both learned , and received , and heard , and seen in me , do : and the God of peace shall be with you .
4 : 12 I know both how to be abased , and I know how to abound : every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry , both to abound and to suffer need .
4 : 18 But I have all , and abound : I am full , having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you , an odour of a sweet smell , a sacrifice acceptable , wellpleasing to God .
2 : 13 And you , being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh , hath he quickened together with him , having forgiven you all trespasses ; 2 : 14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us , which was contrary to us , and took it out of the way , nailing it to his cross ; 2 : 15 And having spoiled principalities and powers , he made a shew of them openly , triumphing over them in it .
2 : 23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship , and humility , and neglecting of the body : not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh .
3 : 18 Wives , submit yourselves unto your own husbands , as it is fit in the Lord .
4 : 1 Masters , give unto your servants that which is just and equal ; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven .
4 : 2 Continue in prayer , and watch in the same with thanksgiving ; 4 : 3 Withal praying also for us , that God would open unto us a door of utterance , to speak the mystery of Christ , for which I am also in bonds : 4 : 4 That I may make it manifest , as I ought to speak .
4 : 5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without , redeeming the time .
4 : 6 Let your speech be alway with grace , seasoned with salt , that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man .
4 : 7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you , who is a beloved brother , and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord : 4 : 8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose , that he might know your estate , and comfort your hearts ; 4 : 9 With Onesimus , a faithful and beloved brother , who is one of you .
4 : 10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you , and Marcus , sister ' s son to Barnabas , ( touching whom ye received commandments : if he come unto you , receive him ;) 4 : 11 And Jesus , which is called Justus , who are of the circumcision .
4 : 14 Luke , the beloved physician , and Demas , greet you .
4 : 18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul .
Remember my bonds .
2 : 3 For our exhortation was not of deceit , nor of uncleanness , nor in guile : 2 : 4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel , even so we speak ; not as pleasing men , but God , which trieth our hearts .
2 : 13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing , because , when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us , ye received it not as the word of men , but as it is in truth , the word of God , which effectually worketh also in you that believe .
2 : 17 But we , brethren , being taken from you for a short time in presence , not in heart , endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire .
2 : 19 For what is our hope , or joy , or crown of rejoicing ?
3 : 1 Wherefore when we could no longer forbear , we thought it good to be left at Athens alone ; 3 : 2 And sent Timotheus , our brother , and minister of God , and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ , to establish you , and to comfort you concerning your faith : 3 : 3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions : for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto .
3 : 9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you , for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God ; 3 : 10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face , and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith ?
3 : 11 Now God himself and our Father , and our Lord Jesus Christ , direct our way unto you .
5 : 4 But ye , brethren , are not in darkness , that that day should overtake you as a thief .
5 : 5 Ye are all the children of light , and the children of the day : we are not of the night , nor of darkness .
5 : 19 Quench not the Spirit .
Amen .
3 : 7 For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us : for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you ; 3 : 8 Neither did we eat any man ' s bread for nought ; but wrought with labour and travail night and day , that we might not be chargeable to any of you : 3 : 9 Not because we have not power , but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us .
3 : 12 Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ , that with quietness they work , and eat their own bread .
The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy
1 : 3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus , when I went into Macedonia , that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine , 1 : 4 Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies , which minister questions , rather than godly edifying which is in faith : so do .
1 : 14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
1 : 16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy , that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering , for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting .
2 : 12 But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence .
2 : 15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing , if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety .
3 : 8 Likewise must the deacons be grave , not doubletongued , not given to much wine , not greedy of filthy lucre ; 3 : 9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience .
3 : 10 And let these also first be proved ; then let them use the office of a deacon , being found blameless .
3 : 12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife , ruling their children and their own houses well .
3 : 16 And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness : God was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the Gentiles , believed on in the world , received up into glory .
4 : 12 Let no man despise thy youth ; but be thou an example of the believers , in word , in conversation , in charity , in spirit , in faith , in purity .
5 : 1 Rebuke not an elder , but intreat him as a father ; and the younger men as brethren ; 5 : 2 The elder women as mothers ; the younger as sisters , with all purity .
5 : 15 For some are already turned aside after Satan .
5 : 19 Against an elder receive not an accusation , but before two or three witnesses .
5 : 21 I charge thee before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , and the elect angels , that thou observe these things without preferring one before another , doing nothing by partiality .
5 : 22 Lay hands suddenly on no man , neither be partaker of other men ' s sins : keep thyself pure .
Grace be with thee .
1 : 6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God , which is in thee by the putting on of my hands .
1 : 13 Hold fast the form of sound words , which thou hast heard of me , in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus .
2 : 3 Thou therefore endure hardness , as a good soldier of Jesus Christ .
2 : 5 And if a man also strive for masteries , yet is he not crowned , except he strive lawfully .
2 : 6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits .
2 : 10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect ' s sakes , that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory .
2 : 11 It is a faithful saying : For if we be dead with him , we shall also live with him : 2 : 12 If we suffer , we shall also reign with him : if we deny him , he also will deny us : 2 : 13 If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he cannot deny himself .
2 : 15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God , a workman that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth .
2 : 17 And their word will eat as doth a canker : of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus ; 2 : 18 Who concerning the truth have erred , saying that the resurrection is past already ; and overthrow the faith of some .
And , Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity .
3 : 16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for correction , for instruction in righteousness : 3 : 17 That the man of God may be perfect , throughly furnished unto all good works .
4 : 1 I charge thee therefore before God , and the Lord Jesus Christ , who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom ; 4 : 2 Preach the word ; be instant in season , out of season ; reprove , rebuke , exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine .
4 : 6 For I am now ready to be offered , and the time of my departure is at hand .
4 : 9 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me : 4 : 10 For Demas hath forsaken me , having loved this present world , and is departed unto Thessalonica ; Crescens to Galatia , Titus unto Dalmatia .
Take Mark , and bring him with thee : for he is profitable to me for the ministry .
Eubulus greeteth thee , and Pudens , and Linus , and Claudia , and all the brethren .
Amen .
1 : 5 For this cause left I thee in Crete , that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting , and ordain elders in every city , as I had appointed thee : 1 : 6 If any be blameless , the husband of one wife , having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly .
1 : 7 For a bishop must be blameless , as the steward of God ; not selfwilled , not soon angry , not given to wine , no striker , not given to filthy lucre ; 1 : 8 But a lover of hospitality , a lover of good men , sober , just , holy , temperate ; 1 : 9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught , that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers .
3 : 10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject ; 3 : 11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted , and sinneth , being condemned of himself .
3 : 12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee , or Tychicus , be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis : for I have determined there to winter .
3 : 13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently , that nothing be wanting unto them .
1 : 4 I thank my God , making mention of thee always in my prayers , 1 : 5 Hearing of thy love and faith , which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus , and toward all saints ; 1 : 6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus .
1 : 22 But withal prepare me also a lodging : for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you .
1 : 1 God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets , 1 : 2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ; 1 : 3 Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high : 1 : 4 Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
1 : 5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ?
1 : 10 And , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands : 1 : 11 They shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ; 1 : 12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
2 : 5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come , whereof we speak .
4 : 8 For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
4 : 13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
4 : 15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
6 : 1 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God , 6 : 2 Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
6 : 10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
6 : 11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end : 6 : 12 That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
7 : 13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
7 : 17 For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
7 : 20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest : 7 : 21 ( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec :) 7 : 22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
8 : 4 For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law : 8 : 5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
9 : 11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ; 9 : 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
10 : 1 For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
10 : 4 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
10 : 5 Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me : 10 : 6 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
10 : 28 He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses : 10 : 29 Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
10 : 37 For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
10 : 39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
11 : 6 But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
11 : 8 By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
11 : 12 Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
11 : 14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
11 : 15 And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
11 : 31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
12 : 12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ; 12 : 13 And make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
12 : 28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear : 12 : 29 For our God is a consuming fire .
13 : 12 Wherefore Jesus also , that he might sanctify the people with his own blood , suffered without the gate .
13 : 16 But to do good and to communicate forget not : for with such sacrifices God is well pleased .
13 : 18 Pray for us : for we trust we have a good conscience , in all things willing to live honestly .
1 : 4 But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
1 : 6 But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering .
1 : 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
1 : 19 Wherefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath : 1 : 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
1 : 22 But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
Do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
2 : 10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
can faith save him ?
3 : 2 For in many things we offend all .
3 : 11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter ?
3 : 15 This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
4 : 7 Submit yourselves therefore to God .
4 : 11 Speak not evil one of another , brethren .
He that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
5 : 17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are , and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain : and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months .
1 : 3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , 1 : 4 To an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you , 1 : 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
1 : 6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations : 1 : 7 That the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ : 1 : 8 Whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory : 1 : 9 Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
1 : 12 Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
The grass withereth , and the flower thereof falleth away : 1 : 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever .
2 : 4 To whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious , 2 : 5 Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
Fear God .
2 : 19 For this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
2 : 21 For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps : 2 : 22 Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth : 2 : 23 Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously : 2 : 24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
3 : 5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands : 3 : 6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
3 : 18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit : 3 : 19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ; 3 : 20 Which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
4 : 11 If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever .
4 : 14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
4 : 18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
1 : 13 Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ; 1 : 14 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
2 : 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
3 : 14 Wherefore , beloved , seeing that ye look for such things , be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace , without spot , and blameless .
2 : 3 And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
2 : 14 I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning .
If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
2 : 27 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
2 : 28 And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
3 : 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning .
3 : 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
4 : 1 Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
4 : 4 Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
4 : 11 Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
5 : 4 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
5 : 10 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
5 : 14 And this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us : 5 : 15 And if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
5 : 18 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
5 : 19 And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
1 : 9 I wrote unto the church : but Diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
Our friends salute thee .
1 : 3 Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
1 : 9 Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
1 : 14 And Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , Behold , the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints , 1 : 15 To execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
1 : 16 These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men ' s persons in admiration because of advantage .
1 : 19 These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
Amen .
The Revelation of Saint John the Devine
1 : 4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ; 1 : 5 And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth .
1 : 7 Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him .
1 : 19 Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ; 1 : 20 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks .
2 : 8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ; 2 : 9 I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
2 : 11 He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
2 : 15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes , which thing I hate .
3 : 16 So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
4 : 2 And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
6 : 12 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ; 6 : 13 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
7 : 1 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
7 : 11 And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God , 7 : 12 Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever .
8 : 6 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
9 : 1 And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
9 : 2 And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
9 : 13 And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God , 9 : 14 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
9 : 15 And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
9 : 16 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
11 : 2 But the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
11 : 3 And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
11 : 4 These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
11 : 16 And the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God , 11 : 17 Saying , We give thee thanks , O LORD God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
12 : 12 Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them .
Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea !
12 : 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
13 : 15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast , that the image of the beast should both speak , and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed .
14 : 5 And in their mouth was found no guile : for they are without fault before the throne of God .
14 : 16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth ; and the earth was reaped .
15 : 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God , and the song of the Lamb , saying , Great and marvellous are thy works , Lord God Almighty ; just and true are thy ways , thou King of saints .
15 : 4 Who shall not fear thee , O Lord , and glorify thy name ?
16 : 13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon , and out of the mouth of the beast , and out of the mouth of the false prophet .
Blessed is he that watcheth , and keepeth his garments , lest he walk naked , and they see his shame .
16 : 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon .
16 : 18 And there were voices , and thunders , and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as was not since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake , and so great .
The seven heads are seven mountains , on which the woman sitteth .
18 : 15 The merchants of these things , which were made rich by her , shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment , weeping and wailing , 18 : 16 And saying , Alas , alas that great city , that was clothed in fine linen , and purple , and scarlet , and decked with gold , and precious stones , and pearls !
18 : 21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone , and cast it into the sea , saying , Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down , and shall be found no more at all .
19 : 7 Let us be glad and rejoice , and give honour to him : for the marriage of the Lamb is come , and his wife hath made herself ready .
19 : 12 His eyes were as a flame of fire , and on his head were many crowns ; and he had a name written , that no man knew , but he himself .
19 : 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun ; and he cried with a loud voice , saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven , Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God ; 19 : 18 That ye may eat the flesh of kings , and the flesh of captains , and the flesh of mighty men , and the flesh of horses , and of them that sit on them , and the flesh of all men , both free and bond , both small and great .
20 : 2 And he laid hold on the dragon , that old serpent , which is the Devil , and Satan , and bound him a thousand years , 20 : 3 And cast him into the bottomless pit , and shut him up , and set a seal upon him , that he should deceive the nations no more , till the thousand years should be fulfilled : and after that he must be loosed a little season .
This is the second death .
21 : 3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying , Behold , the tabernacle of God is with men , and he will dwell with them , and they shall be his people , and God himself shall be with them , and be their God .
21 : 9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues , and talked with me , saying , Come hither , I will shew thee the bride , the Lamb ' s wife .
21 : 17 And he measured the wall thereof , an hundred and forty and four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of the angel .
21 : 25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day : for there shall be no night there .
22 : 6 And he said unto me , These sayings are faithful and true : and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done .
I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
22 : 17 And the Spirit and the bride say , Come .
And let him that heareth say , Come .
22 : 18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book , If any man shall add unto these things , God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book : 22 : 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy , God shall take away his part out of the book of life , and out of the holy city , and from the things which are written in this book .
Amen .
Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
Piping down the valleys wild , Piping songs of pleasant glee , On a cloud I saw a child , And he laughing said to me :
Old John , with white hair , Does laugh away care , Sitting under the oak , Among the old folk .
White as an angel is the English child , But I am black , as if bereaved of light .
" And we are put on earth a little space , That we may learn to bear the beams of love And these black bodies and this sunburnt face Is but a cloud , and like a shady grove .
THE BLOSSOM
Pretty , pretty robin !
Under leaves so green A happy blossom Hears you sobbing , sobbing , Pretty , pretty robin , Near my bosom .
weep !
There ' s little Tom Dacre , who cried when his head , That curled like a lamb ' s back , was shaved ; so I said , " Hush , Tom !
And so Tom awoke , and we rose in the dark , And got with our bags and our brushes to work .
" Father , father , where are you going ?
"
The night was dark , no father was there , The child was wet with dew ; The mire was deep , and the child did weep , And away the vapour flew .
The little boy lost in the lonely fen , Led by the wandering light , Began to cry , but God , ever nigh , Appeared like his father , in white .
LAUGHING SONG
A SONG
Wept for me , for thee , for all , When He was an infant small .
Then cherish pity , lest you drive an angel from your door .
Where lambs have nibbled , silent move The feet of angels bright ; Unseen they pour blessing , And joy without ceasing , On each bud and blossom , And each sleeping bosom .
" " Well , well , go and play till the light fades away , And then go home to bed .
" The little ones leaped , and shouted , and laughed , And all the hills echoed .
" Sweet joy befall thee !
" I am set to light the ground , While the beetle goes his round : Follow now the beetle ' s hum ; Little wanderer , hie thee home !
Can I see another ' s grief , And not seek for kind relief ?
Never , never can it be !
Think not thou canst sigh a sigh , And thy Maker is not by : Think not thou canst weep a tear , And thy Maker is not year .
SONGS OF EXPERIENCE
Can delight , Chained in night , The virgins of youth and morning bear ?
"
Is that trembling cry a song ?
THE LITTLE GIRL LOST
Seven summers old Lovely Lyca told .
The kingly lion stood , And the virgin viewed : Then he gambolled round O ' er the hallowed ground .
Say !
"
For I dance And drink , and sing , Till some blind hand Shall brush my wing .
If thought is life And strength and breath And the want Of thought is death ;
I dreamt a dream !
And that I was a maiden Queen Guarded by an Angel mild : Witless woe was ne ' er beguiled !
Soon my Angel came again ; I was armed , he came in vain ; For the time of youth was fled , And grey hairs were on my head .
what the chain ?
what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp ?
When the stars threw down their spears , And watered heaven with their tears , Did he smile his work to see ?
AH SUNFLOWER
I went to the Garden of Love , And saw what I never had seen ; A Chapel was built in the midst , Where I used to play on the green .
"
"
" Ona , pale and weak , To thy father speak !
THE SCHOOLBOY
How can the bird that is born for joy Sit in a cage and sing ?
How shall the summer arise in joy , Or the summer fruits appear ?
Thou , mother of my mortal part , With cruelty didst mould my heart , And with false self - deceiving tears Didst bind my nostrils , eyes , and ears ,
why fades the lotus of the water ?
The Cloud then shewd his golden head & his bright form emerg ' d .
Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel .
The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf , And the bright Cloud saild on , to find his partner in the vale .
She wandered in the land of clouds thro ' valleys dark , listning Dolors & lamentations : waiting oft beside the dewy grave She stood in silence , listning to the voices of the ground , Till to her own grave plot she came , & there she sat down .
" No , you can ' t come in ," the little Tulip said .
" Who is there ?
" No , you can ' t come in ," said the little Tulip .
Then it was very still for a long time .
"
We want to come in !
She was so pleased , too , when the children exclaimed with pleasure that now they knew that the beautiful spring had come !
Far below lay the earth , brown , dry , and desolate , from drought .
" If I could but make their work easier , or give the hungry ones food , or the thirsty a drink !
And as the day passed , and the Cloud became larger , this wish to do something for the people of earth was ever greater in her heart .
On earth it grew hotter and hotter ; the sun burned down so fiercely that the people were fainting in its rays ; it seemed as if they must die of heat , and yet they were obliged to go on with their work , for they were very poor .
The thought made her suddenly marvellously big and strong and powerful .
Never had she dreamed that she could be so big .
" Yes , I will help you ," cried the Cloud once more .
As she said the words a wonderful light glowed from her heart , the sound of thunder rolled through the sky , and a love greater than words can tell filled the Cloud ; down , down , close to the earth she swept , and gave up her life in a blessed , healing shower of rain .
"
" No , you won ' t ," said the little Red Hen .
as fast as you can !
"
" Stop , little Gingerbread Boy ," said the cow ; " I want to eat you .
run !
" Please stop , little Gingerbread Boy ," said the horse , " you look very good to eat .
" Oho !
" I have run away from a little old woman ,
"
By and by the little Gingerbread Boy came to a barn full of threshers .
" I have run away from a little old woman ,
And when he found that he was ahead of the threshers , he turned and shouted back to them ,--
as fast as you can !
" You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !
"
Then the little Gingerbread Boy ran faster than ever .
When the mowers saw how fine he looked , they ran after him , calling out , " Wait a bit !
" But the little Gingerbread Boy laughed harder than ever , and ran like the wind .
" Oho !
" he said ,--
"
" You can ' t catch me , I ' m the Gingerbread Man !
" Run !
"
The little Gingerbread Boy jumped on his back .
A little farther out , the fox said , " I am afraid the water will cover you , there ; jump on my shoulder .
And one day the Lion was so near that the little mother Jackal grew frightened ; she said ,--
I b ' lieve our time has come !
"
They led him to a place where there was a round , deep well of clear water .
The Lion came close and looked down into the water ,-- and a lion ' s face looked back at him out of the water !
When he saw that , the Lion roared and shook his mane and showed his teeth .
But , of course , as you know very well , there wasn ' t any other lion !
The Lion is dead !
" Ao !
Once a little mouse who lived in the country invited a little mouse from the city to visit him .
"
" What is that ?
" and ran as fast as he could to the hole .
The Country Mouse ran after , you may be sure , as fast as _he_ could .
Overhead hung bunches of sausages , and there were spicy apples in barrels standing about .
So the little Country Mouse went back to his home , and there he stayed all the rest of his life .
The trundle - bed had castors on it so that it could be rolled about , and there was nothing in the world the little boy liked so much as to have it rolled .
When his mother came to bed he would cry , " Roll me around !
roll around !
more !
The good Moon went along and made a light , and they came to the forest .
" Roll !
But all the animals were asleep , and nobody at all looked at Little Jack Rollaround except an old White Owl ; and all she said was , " Who are you ?
The kind Moon made a path up to the sky , and up sailed the little bed into the midst of the sky .
All the little bright Stars were there with their nice little lamps .
" Do not treat the little Stars so ," said the good Moon .
Make a light !
" shouted the little boy .
But the Moon answered never a word , and Jack Rollaround could not see where to steer .
" Look out , I am coming !
HOW BROTHER RABBIT FOOLED THE WHALE AND THE ELEPHANT
Little Brother Rabbit sniggered to himself .
Then he went along the beach till he came to the Whale .
Then he tied the end of the rope tightly round the Elephant ' s trunk , and ran away into the bushes .
" Dear me !
He pulled harder ; the Elephant pulled harder .
He was terribly angry .
He braced himself with all his might , and pulled his best .
" Who is pulling me ?
" spouted the Whale .
" I ' ll teach you to play cow !
" I ' ll show you how to fool me !
One , two , three , came out plump and fluffy ; but when the fourth shell broke , out came a little half - chick !
One day the little Half - Chick said , " Mother , I am off to Madrid , to see the King !
" And away he went , hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , over the fields .
When he had gone some distance the little Half - Chick came to a little brook that was caught in the weeds and in much trouble .
" The idea !
" said the little Half - Chick .
Fan me a little with your wing , I beg .
"
" The idea !
The Wind was whimpering , and begging to be set free .
Hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , the little Half - Chick skipped past the sentry at the gate , and hoppity - kick , hoppity - kick , he crossed the court .
" The very thing for the King ' s dinner !
" she said .
" And she seized the little Half - Chick by his one wing and threw him into a kettle of water on the fire .
" Little Half - Chick , little Half - Chick ," said the Wind , " when I was in trouble you would not help me !
It keeps nodding , nodding to me behind the fence ; what does it say , mamma ?
" It says ," she answered , "' I see a happy little boy in the warm , fire - lighted room .
The wind blows cold , and here it is dark and lonely ; but that little boy is warm and happy and safe at his mother ' s knees .
then through all my twigs I feel the slow sap stirring .
The small blades of grass creep thick about my feet ; the sweet rain helps to swell my shining buds .
Then the wee boy smiled , and said he liked the little story .
THE FAIRIES
They stole little Bridget For seven years long ; When she came down again Her friends were all gone .
Is any man so daring As dig them up in spite , He shall find their sharpest thorns In his bed at night .
THE ADVENTURES OF THE LITTLE FIELD MOUSE
It was such a fine shiny little acorn that he thought he would take it home with him ; so he put out his paw to touch it , but the little acorn rolled away from him .
He ran after it , but it kept rolling on , just ahead of him , till it came to a place where a big oak - tree had its roots spread all over the ground .
The Field Mouse hurried as fast as he could down the last stairs , and pushed through just as the door was closing .
It shut behind him , and he was in a little room .
" said the Field Mouse .
" It is my acorn ," said the Field Mouse ; " I found it .
" No , it isn ' t ," said the little Red Man , " I have it ; you will never see it again .
"
The little Field Mouse knew that his chance had come to run away home .
I expect he set it down hard , for all at once , with a little snap , it opened !-- exactly like a little box .
So the little Field Mouse gave the tiny necklace to his little Mouse - sister .
Every time she went out to market she locked the door of the house behind her , and as soon as she came in again she locked the door behind her and put the key in her apron pocket , where she kept her scissors and some sugar candy .
At last the old Fox thought out a way to catch the little Red Hen .
how scared the little Red Hen was !
" said the Fox .
My , but it bumped him well !
"
" says Fox , " all right .
" Begorra , now , I ' ll have yees Widout much throuble more "; An ' in he shlips quite unbeknownst , An ' hides be ' ind the door .
An ' thin he whiruled around , An ' round an ' round an ' round , Fashter an ' fashter an ' fashter , Afther his tail on the ground .
An ' whin he came in sight O ' his great din o ' rocks , Jist watchin ' for him at the door He shpied ould mither Fox .
" Says he to ould Fox thin ; " Shure an ' it is , me child ," says she ; " Have ye the small Rid Hin ?
" Yes , jist here in me bag , As shure as I shtand here ; Open the lid till I pit her in : Open it -- nivir fear .
One day she gave him a big piece of cake ; nice , yellow , rich gold - cake .
" Cake , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
" Yes , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
" Butter , Mammy ," said Epaminondas ; " Auntie gave it to me .
"
" Epaminondas , you ain ' t got the sense you was born with !
By and by , another day , Epaminondas went to see his Auntie again , and ; this time she gave him a little new puppy - dog to take home .
"
" A puppy - dog , Mammy ," said Epaminondas .
" A _puppy - dog_ !
"
I ' ll go see her my own self .
But I ' ll just tell you one thing , Epaminondas !
"
Then Epaminondas ' Mammy put on her bonnet and her shawl and took a basket in her hand and went away to see Auntie .
* * * * *
Come and help !
The kind villagers left their work and ran to the field to help him .
Then one day a wolf did break into the fold and began killing the lambs .
" Wolf !
But as the days went on , and the eel was perfectly harmless , they stopped being afraid ; and as soon as they stopped fearing King Eel they stopped respecting him .
Soon they sent a third messenger to Jove , and begged that they might have a better king ,-- a king who was worth while .
It was too much ; Jove was angry at their stupidity at last .
One after another they came bobbing up , and one after another the stork ate them .
The Sun had won .
THE LITTLE JACKAL AND THE ALLIGATOR
He used to go down by the river and hunt along the edges for crabs and such things .
"
So he put on a very cheerful voice , as if nothing at all were the matter , and he said ,--
Clever Mr Alligator !
Smart Mr Alligator , to take that old bulrush root for my paw !
He said ,--
" And he ran away like the wind .
He saw no sign of the old Alligator .
Kind Mr Alligator !
After a while the little Jackal came dancing into the garden , very happy and free from care ,-- _but_ looking all around .
"
He said ,--
" Thank you , again , Mr Alligator ; very sweet of you to show me where you are ; I can ' t stay to thank you as I should like : good - bye !
Then he saw that the door of his house was crushed at the sides and broken , as if something very big had gone through it .
" What ' s this ?
What ' s this ?
" I think I ' ll investigate a little !
The old Alligator thought to himself that he must certainly pretend to be the little House , or the little Jackal would never come in .
So he put on as pleasant a voice as he could ( which is not saying much ) and said ,--
"
One day when she came home the little Larks were much frightened .

The corn is getting too ripe ; it ' s no use to wait for our relatives , we shall have to cut this corn ourselves .
Once there were four little girls who lived in a big , bare house , in the country .
There were dark , shadowy woods , and fields of flowers , and a river .
She liked to make up stories out of her own head , and sometimes she made verses .
It was great fun .
One of the plays they acted was _Jack and the Beanstalk_ .
They made a wonderful big pumpkin out of the wheelbarrow , trimmed with yellow paper , and Cinderella rolled away in it , when the fairy godmother waved her wand .
Louisa loved all these plays , and she made some of her own and wrote them down so that the children could act them .
I cannot tell you how much Louisa suffered over this .
And she began to work very hard to earn money .
And , children , the little book made Louisa famous .
Maybe you would like to hear a poem she wrote about it , when she was only fourteen years old .
Sad were they When dawned the morning of Christmas - day ; Their little darling no joy might stir , St Nicholas nothing would bring to her !
" See what the good saint brought !
A sparrow , that in at the window flew , Had crept into Piccola ' s tiny shoe !
"
" Oh , please , dear wind , come down and play with me !
how the Little Fir Tree pricked up his needles !
The Little Fir Tree was happy as a bird , because he knew they were about to cut him down .
" It is too little , too little .
When they saw the Little Fir Tree they cried out ,--
Very soon they went away , and came back again with a big basket , which they carried between them .
It grew more and more shadowy .
He knew they must mean him , for all their shining eyes were looking straight at him .
And from his shiny head to his feet he was glad , through and through , because he was just little enough to be the nicest kind of tree in the world !
And for love of this friend , the king of Egypt had let numbers of the Israelites settle in his land .
But after the king and his Israelitish friend were dead , there was a new king , who hated the Israelites .
But at the end of that time , she saw that it would not be possible to keep him safe any longer .
And when she had opened it , she saw the child ; the poor baby was crying .
THE TEN FAIRIES
But they loved Elsa so much that they did not like her to do any work ; very foolishly , they let her play all the time .
Then , then , my dears , came hard times for Elsa !
I wish I could work !
" You shall have them , dear ," said the grey man , and he shook his strange grey cloak .
" These shall be your servants , Elsa ," said the grey man ; " they are faithful and clever , and they will do everything you want them to , just right .
But the neighbours might stare and ask questions if they saw these little chaps running about your house , so I will hide them away for you .
The fairies sprang to Elsa ' s knee , then to the palms of her hands , and then -- whisk !
And the grey man was gone .
They stirred so that Elsa jumped up and ran to the cooking table , and took hold of the bread board .
She has only one maid , but , to see the work done , you would think she had as many servants as she has fingers on her hands !
THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER
Once upon a time there was an honest shoemaker , who was very poor .
But the first customer who came was so pleased with the beautiful shoes that he bought them , and paid so much that the shoemaker was able to buy leather enough for two pairs .
But when morning came , two pairs of shoes lay on the bench , most beautifully made , and no sign of anyone who had been there .
"
On Christmas eve , the shoemaker cleaned his bench , and on it , instead of leather , he laid the two sets of gay little fairy - clothes .
Promptly at midnight , the little naked elves came in .
Once the Otter came to the Mouse - deer and said , " Friend Mouse - deer , will you please take care of my babies while I go to the river , to catch fish ?
"
" Who killed my children while you were taking care of them ?
"
" said the king .
"
" said the king .
And the Mouse - deer cannot be blamed , by the law of the land !
"
So the Brahmin unlocked the door and let the Tiger out .
"
The first thing they came to , to ask , was an old Banyan Tree , by the wayside .
" In the summer ," he said , " when the sun is hot , men come and sit in the cool of my shade and refresh themselves with the fruit of my branches .
Let the Tiger eat the Brahmin .
"
The Tiger sprang , but the Brahmin spoke very quickly ,--
The Tiger grumbled a good deal , but at last he went on again with the Brahmin .
At last he did persuade him , however , and they walked on together .
The old Alligator turned in the mud , and grunted , and snorted ; then he said ,--
" I lie here in the mud all day , as harmless as a pigeon ; I hunt no man , yet every time a man sees me , he throws stones at me , and pokes me with sharp sticks , and jeers at me .
"
At this the Tiger was going to eat the Brahmin at once .
" said the little Jackal , vacantly .
I am a little slow of understanding .
Now what was it ?
" Do you think ," said the Brahmin , " it is right for this Tiger to eat me , when I set him free from his cage ?
" Yes , yes , yes !
Show me the cage .
" Now , let us understand the situation ," said the little Jackal .
" Tiger , and where were you ?
"
" Oh , I do beg your pardon ," said the little Jackal .
" Then he made a very low bow to the Brahmin .
This is what happened .
"
He ate happily , and noticed nothing around him .
Consequently , the little Jackal had eaten his fill by the time the Camel had barely taken a mouthful .
" So they came down , with sticks and stones .
" I think it ' s time to go home , now ," he said ; " don ' t you ?
"
You brought this upon me .
"
" Yes ," said the little Jackal .
They were hopping from the barren places into the young , green crops , and as they settled down they ate the tiny shoots and leaves to the ground .
Then they ran and told the terrible news , and all the village came to help .
"
" No , no !
Every night , when I go to carry scraps from the kitchen to my mother , who lives in the wood beyond the forest , I hear the Nightingale sing .
" said the little girl , " she is going to sing .
She sang so beautifully that you have never in all your life heard anything like it .
" Dear , dear ," said the courtiers , " that is very pleasant ; does that little grey bird really make all that noise ?
They asked the little Nightingale to sing , over and over again , and when they had listened enough the Emperor said that she should be made " Singer in Chief to the Court .
" She was to have a golden perch near the Emperor ' s bed , and a little golden cage , and was to be allowed to go out twice every day .
It was not so very much fun to go out that way !
Everybody in the court was filled with delight at the music of the new nightingale .
The Emperor ran to his doctor , but he could not do anything .
When it was sure that he could not live much longer , the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die .
He was quite alone , for all the courtiers had gone to congratulate the new emperor , and all the servants had gone to talk it over .
" Oh , sing again , little Nightingale ," begged Death .
Do not leave me again .
"
"
The flat where her mother and father lived was at the top of a big building , and you couldn ' t see a great deal from the windows , except chimney - pots on other people ' s roofs .
Margery did not know much about trees and flowers , but she loved them dearly ; whenever it was a fine Sunday she used to go with her mother and father to the park and look at the lovely flower - beds .
"
" Surely , flowers ," said her mother , " and shall we not have a little salad garden in the middle ?
"
" Margery asked .
" I should love a salad garden .
That very evening , Margery ' s father took pencil and paper , and drew out a plan for her garden ; first , they talked it all over , then he drew what they decided on ; it looked like the diagram on the next page .
" The outside strip is for flowers ," said Margery ' s father , " and next is a footpath , all the way round the beds ; that is to let you get at the flowers to weed and to pick ; there is a wider path through the middle , and the rest is for rows of salad vegetables .

MISS MARGERY BROWN , PRIMROSE COTTAGE , 21 NARCISSUS ROAD , COLCHESTER .
[ Illustration ]
"
" said Margery .
[ Illustration ]
Now , Margery ' s father put the fertiliser on the top , and then raked it into the earth .
Father tied one end of a cord to a little stake , and drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden .
" Perhaps you have seen it .
This is what he did .
Mr Brown had seen gardeners do it when he was a little boy , and he did it very nicely : he walked along the sides of the square , with one foot turned a little out , and the other straight , taking such tiny steps that his feet touched each other all the time .
At the back were the sweet peas , which would grow tall , like a screen ; on the two sides , for a kind of hedge , were yellow sunflowers ; and along the front edge were the gay nasturtiums .
The two front corners had canariensis in them .
Mother and father and Margery were late to supper that evening .
But they were all so happy that it did not matter .
" I have a garden !
Yes !
She examined them very closely , so that she might know a radish next time .
Margery flew back to her mother , to say that the first seeds were up .
And her mother , nearly as excited as Margery , came to look at the little crack .
"
" Can we have made a mistake ?
She ran to the house and found her father .
When her father finished his supper they went together to the garden , and father examined the seedlings carefully .
Then he pulled up a little radish plant and a tiny beet .
" said Margery .
"
Margery ' s father took her in his arms .
"
" Oh , don ' t leave me behind !
" How can we take you with us ?
take me with you !
" said the Tortoise .
We will each take hold of one end of a stout stick , and do you take the middle in your mouth ; then we will fly up in the air with you and carry you with us .
If you open your mouth , you are lost .
ROBERT OF SICILY
He was a very selfish king , and very proud ; he cared more for his pleasures than for the needs of his people , and his heart was so filled with his own greatness that he had no thought for God .
" They mean , ' He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and hath exalted them of low degree ,'" answered the clerk .
Presently the king fell asleep , while the service went on .
The old sexton heard some one shouting and pounding in the church , and thought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the service .
He came to the door with his keys and called out , " Who is there ?
"
The sexton did not know that he had ever seen him before , but he looked long after him , wondering at his wildness and his haste .
The great hall was filled with lights and flowers ; the tables were set with everything that is delicate and rich to eat ; the courtiers , in their gay clothes , were laughing and talking ; and at the head of the feast , on the king ' s own throne , sat a king .
He was dressed in the king ' s royal robes , he wore the royal crown , and on his hand was the king ' s own ring .
" Who art thou , and what dost thou here ?
You shall wear the cap and bells , and make laughter for my court .
You shall be the servant of the servants , and your companion shall , be the jester ' s ape .
And when he woke next morning , he believed it was a dream , and that he was king again .
" And each time that he asked it his eyes looked into Robert ' s eyes , to find his heart .
His horse was poor and old , many - coloured , and the ape rode with him .
" And again Robert was pushed back among the serving - men .
And at last , as he listened , his heart was softened .
On Easter night , as he crept to his bed of straw , he wept , not because he was so wretched , but because he had not been a better king when power was his .
Robert the jester came home too .
At last , he sent them all away , saying he wanted to be alone ; but he commanded the jester to stay .
But suddenly the music seemed to change ; a wonderful light shone all about .
"
" Now that the horse ' s head is in proportion , there is not a flaw .
" My courtiers are much pleased now ," said the prince to Herr Grupello ; " they think the statue much improved by the changes you have made .
"
It was , indeed .
Of what use will it be to him to be beautiful , rich , or powerful , if he grows into a bad man ?
" I promised your father that I would be your best friend , and as long as you live I shall watch over your happiness .
It did not prick him for a long time , because he was good and merry and happy .
But Prince Cherry had been rather spoiled by his nurse when he was a child ; she had always said to him that when he should become king he could do exactly as he pleased .
The little gold ring began to feel tight and uncomfortable .
But the little dog was so used to being petted that he only jumped up on his master , and tried to kiss his hand .
" said the prince to himself .
What evil is there in that ?
The prince turned sharply , but no one was to be seen ; yet he recognised the voice as that of Fairy Candide .
Whenever he was crossed , or could not have his own way instantly , he flew into a passion .
" Am I not pleasing to you ?
"
"
In fury , he ordered Suliman to be put in fetters and brought before him .
"
" At the same moment , Prince Cherry felt himself being transported to a distant forest , where he was set down by a clear stream .
The keeper carried the beautiful little dog to the court and told the story , and from then on , Cherry was carefully treated , and had the best of everything .
Cherry was glad of that , and he was running happily back to his kennel when he heard cries of distress , and suddenly he saw some rough men dragging along a young girl , who was weeping and crying for help .
His heart was full of pity and rage .
But suddenly he thought , " I was as bad as these men ; I myself put Zelia in prison , and would have treated her worse still , if I had not been prevented .
Presently a window opened , and Cherry saw Zelia lean out and throw down a piece of meat .
But though he hunted in every room , no Zelia was to be found .
He wanted more than anything else to find her , and stay near her , so he flew out into the world , to seek her .
Cherry was wild with delight .
"
" laughed the hermit .
At the same time , the hermit stood up , his flowing hair changed to shining gold , and his face became a lovely woman ' s face ; it was the Fairy Candide .
Zelia and Prince Cherry fell at the fairy ' s feet .
He gave back the throne with all his heart , and King Cherry ruled again , with Zelia for his queen .
They dug until they had turned up the soil from one end of the orchard to the other , round the tree - roots and between them .
Her whole name was Margaret Haughery , but no one in New Orleans remembers her by it , any more than you think of your dearest sister by her full name ; she is just Margaret .
She lived with them until she grew up .
All day , from morning until evening , she ironed clothes in a laundry .
They needed a good friend , now .
With this , she bought two cows and a little delivery cart .
After a time , Margaret had a chance to get a bakery , and then she became a bread - woman instead of a milk - woman .
By this time everybody in the city knew her .
The children all over the city loved her ; the business men were proud of her ; the poor people all came to her for advice .
" So they made a statue of her , just as she used to look , sitting in her own office door , or driving in her own little cart .
And there it stands to - day , in memory of the great love and the great power of plain Margaret Haughery , of New Orleans .
It is so old that even as long ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines , and knew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold , and who could fight and make laws ; but we do not know just where they came from , nor exactly how they lived .
And this Dagda had a wonderful magic harp .
When the men were going out to battle , the Dagda would set up his magic harp and sweep his hand across the strings , and a war song would ring out which would make every warrior buckle on his armour , brace his knees , and shout , " Forth to the fight !
Whirling through the hall , sweeping aside and killing the men who got in its way , it sprang to its master ' s hand .
" God save you ," said the tailor .
" For , it seems the king had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who should be able to build up his court .
" Would you make me a hole ," said the old white garraun , " where I could go in to hide whenever the people come to fetch me to the mill or the kiln , so that they won ' t see me ; for they tire me out doing work for them ?
" Make a place for me now ," said the white horse , " by which I can come up out of the hole here , whenever I am hungry .
" Wait there until I come back again ," said he .
He placed the lion ' s tail in the hole he had made for it , and then clapped in a peg , and the lion was not able to draw out his tail again .
Then when the work was over , the tailor went to the king and told him to give him his wife and his money , as he had the court finished ; and the king said he would not give him any wife until he had killed the other giant , for he said that it was not by his strength he had killed the two giants before , and that he would give him nothing now until he killed the other one for him .
" The tailor said , " I will certainly do that , but you must give me an hour before we commence .
He came in then and told the giant first to drink a gallon of the broth himself .
" I will ," said the giant , giving such a prod of the knife into his own stomach that he killed himself .
" When they heard that , they released the lion .
" They released the old white garraun then , and the old white garraun , the fox , the lion , and the army of Dublin pursued the tailor and his wife , and it was not long before they came up with them .
" said the fox , " but that ' s the way he was when he was making the thing for me , and I ' ll go no nearer to him .
HOW THE SEA BECAME SALT
And after the wise men had looked closely at them and read the magic letters which were cut upon their edge , they said that the millstones were precious indeed , since they would grind out of nothing anything that the miller might wish .
" No longer will Frode sit on his throne , and rule over rings of red gold and mighty millstones .
" We have turned the stone round ; Though weary the maidens , See what they have ground !
They were both strong young men , but one was a lazy fellow and the other was a worker .
Suddenly , out of the distance , something like a great butterfly , of white and gold , swept toward them .
And when it came nearer , they saw that it was a most beautiful lady , robed in floating garments as fine as cobwebs and wearing on her head a crown so bright that no one could tell whether it was of diamonds or of dew .
" she said .
" Who are you , and whither are you going ?
" I am the Fairy of Fortune ," the beautiful lady said , " and that is my castle .
If you reach it before the last stroke of midnight , I will receive you there , and will be your friend .
The industrious man hurried back to his friend , and told him what the fairy had said .
"
" Then good - bye ," said his friend , " I am off .
" he sighed .
The little horse started at a fine pace , and in a very few minutes they overtook the other traveller , plodding along on foot .
The industrious man only nodded , and kept on with his steady stride , eyes straight ahead .
He slept like the seven sleepers , and he dreamed the most beautiful things you could imagine .
Then came trouble !
No donkey was to be found .
a snail as large as a calf !
" A beast , a beast !
As he mounted , he saw the doors of the castle open , and saw his friend standing on the threshold , waving his cap and beckoning to him .
The clock struck four times , and the new steed began to stir ; as it struck five , he moved a pace forward ; as it struck six , he stopped ; as it struck seven , he turned himself about ; as it struck eight , he began to move backward , away from the castle !
What became of him and his crab no one knows to this day , and no one cares .
By and by , war broke out between the people of David ' s country and a people that lived near at hand ; these men were called Philistines , and the people of David ' s country were named Israelites .
After the brothers had been gone some time , David ' s father longed very much to hear from them , and to know if they were safe ; so he sent for David , from the fields , and said to him , " Take now for thy brothers an ephah of this parched corn , and these ten loaves , and run to the camp , where thy brothers are ; and carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand , and see how thy brothers fare , and bring me word again .
The camp stood on a mountain on the one side , and the Philistines stood on a mountain on the other side ; and there was a valley between .
" asked David .
When King Saul heard these words , he was dismayed , and all the men of Israel , when they saw the man , fled from him and were sore afraid .
Very soon , some of the officers told the king about the youth who was asking so many questions , and who said that it was shame upon Israel that a mere Philistine should defy the armies of the living God .
"
And he armed David with his own armour ,-- he put a helmet of brass upon his head , and armed him with a coat of mail .
But when David girded his sword upon his armour , and tried to walk , he said to Saul , " I cannot go with these , for I am not used to them .
And he said to David , " Am I a dog , that thou comest to me with a cudgel ?
And then , when the Philistine arose , and came , and drew nigh to meet David , David made haste and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine .
THE SHEPHERD ' S SONG
David had many fierce battles to fight for King Saul against the enemies of Israel , and he won them all .
Sometimes the singers were divided into two great choruses , and went to the service in two processions ; then one chorus would sing a verse of David ' s song , and the other procession would answer with the next , and then both would sing together ; it was very beautiful to hear .
Even now , we sometimes do that with the songs of David in our churches .
He remembered the days and nights he used to spend in the fields with the sheep , when he was just a shepherd - boy ; and he thought to himself that God had taken care of him just as carefully as he himself used to care for the little lambs .
This is a legend about a hermit who lived long ago .
" Whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown To the selfsame measure as his own ; Whose treasure on the celestial shore Could neither be less than his nor more .
there was the clown , doing his silly tricks for the crowd .
The clown ' s head sank in his hands .
" Yes , holy father ," he said , " I have been something else .
" Tell me that one !
" pleaded the hermit .
And as she begged , she looked from one hard face to another , with trusting , imploring eyes , as if she could not believe men could be really bad .
' I cut her bonds with my knife , and she looked at me to show that she trusted .
And , as she left me , she turned and said , ' God will remember .
So I became a clown , and must be a clown until I die .
" As _yours_ ?
And when , after two years , the man who had been a clown died , the hermit felt that he had lost a brother more holy than himself .
" What ?
The hermit bent his head before the two women , and gave thanks in his heart .
"
And suddenly a great light came into the hermit ' s mind , and he saw how many ways there are of serving God .
And so , as the hermit climbed the mountain again , he thought ,--
LITTLE GOTTLIEB
His father had died when he was but a baby , and although from early morning till late at night his mother sat plying her needle , she found it difficult indeed to provide food and clothing and shelter for her little boy and herself .
But one night Gottlieb saw that his mother was more than usually troubled .
So the postman took the letter to the great burly man who lived in the big house and wore a gold chain round his neck .
His wondering eyes soon perceived other unusual objects , for the hearth was piled with wood , and the table was loaded with food and dainties such as he had never even imagined .
HOW THE FIR TREE BECAME THE CHRISTMAS TREE
"
" said the others .
Your needles would prick the wee Babe , and your tears are sticky .
Was not the Fir Tree richly rewarded for its meekness ?
Just above it , was a big Dewdrop that clung timidly to a nodding grass - blade .
" But there , what _can_ you expect from a low , grovelling beetle ?
"
" What I thought to be a precious dewdrop is only a worthless diamond .
The world will never get over your loss ," cruelly sneered the Diamond .
And the Dewdrop slid from the blade of grass , tumbled into the parched beak , and was eagerly swallowed .
"
But most of all he listened to a merry , low , silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on , until he just felt as if he must laugh too .
And as Buster listened it suddenly came to him just what he wanted for breakfast .
"
" said he in his deepest , most grumbly - rumbly voice .
" That ' s a very fine looking trout .
" Here ' s your trout , Mr .
He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of .
But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage .
" I wonder what I ' d better do with it .
I hate him !
If I live long enough I ' m going to get even with him !
There wasn ' t water enough in it anywhere except down in the Smiling Pool , and that was on the Green Meadows , where Buster had never been known to go .
" Let ' s go see what he is doing ," said Billy Mink .
" I do !
" cried Little Joe , into whose head an idea had just popped .
Then we ' ll see how many fish he will get !
He did the same thing in the next pool and the next .
Buster Bear hadn ' t enjoyed himself so much since he came to the Green Forest to live .
He stole up to it very , very softly , so as not to frighten the fish .
Buster learned a long time ago that a fisherman must be patient unless , like Little Joe Otter , he is just as much at home in the water as the fish themselves , and can swim fast enough to catch them by chasing them .
Buster ' s little eyes twinkled , and he smacked his lips as he moved on to the next little pool , for he knew that it was of no use to stay longer at the first one .
But it takes more than three trout to fill Buster Bear ' s stomach , so he kept on to the next little pool .
But this little pool , instead of being beautiful and clear so that Buster could see right to the bottom of it and so tell if there were any fish there , was so muddy that he couldn ' t see into it at all .
" said Buster Bear .
He found this just as muddy as the other .
Then he went on to another , and this was no better .
Somehow , it seemed to Buster as if the Brook were laughing at him .
Then he began to chuckle and finally to laugh .
You see he wasn ' t well enough acquainted with Buster to know that Buster is quite as smart as he is , and perhaps a little bit smarter .
Spite and selfishness were at the bottom of it .
" I ' ll keep watch , and as soon as I see him coming , I ' ll drive out all the fish , just as I did to - day .
Then he hurried down to the next little pool and did the same thing .
You know he had guessed the day before who had spoiled his fishing .
It didn ' t take Buster long to catch all the fish he could eat .
Then he saved a nice fat trout and waited .
When Little Joe Otter and Billy Mink reached the Smiling Pool , they climbed up on the Big Rock , and there Little Joe sulked and sulked , until finally Grandfather Frog asked what the matter was .
" He ' s nothing but a great big bully and thief !
" Chug - a - rum !
" snapped Little Joe .
" Well , _our_ fish , then !
" Nobody !
" Nothing , nothing at all ," replied Grandfather Frog mildly .
Little Joe Otter found that out when he took Grandfather Frog ' s advice .
Now having one ' s own way too much is a bad thing .
Little Joe Otter had his way too much .
" Too bad .
Too bad !
Now Little Joe is good - natured and full of fun as a rule , and after he had reached home and his temper had cooled off a little , he began to see the joke on himself ,-- how when he had worked so hard to frighten the fish in the little pools of the Laughing Brook so that Buster Bear should not catch any , he had all the time been driving them right into Buster ' s paws .
Then he hid near by , where he could watch .
Little Joe sprang at him angrily , but Shadow was too quick and darted away .
Suddenly Buster stopped and sniffed .
"
He knew every pool in the Laughing Brook where the trout love to hide , did Farmer Brown ' s boy , and it was just the kind of a morning when the trout should be hungry .
He was very patient , very , very patient , but his patience brought no reward , not so much as the faintest kind of a nibble .
" It wasn ' t cut off with a knife ; it was bitten off !
It made him feel very queer .
' Twas just a sudden odd surprise Made Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s hair to rise .
But that is just what the hair on Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s head did the day he went fishing in the Laughing Brook and had no luck at all .
Perhaps he wouldn ' t have been afraid this time if it hadn ' t been for the surprise of what he found .
He had a funny feeling , too , that he was being watched , although he couldn ' t see any one .
And Buster Bear was just exactly right .
So he hurried to the Smiling Pool , where he was sure he would find Billy Mink and Jerry Muskrat and Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle , and he hoped that perhaps some of the little people who live in the Green Forest might be there too .
" Look at Little Joe Otter !
" he snapped .
" I ' m not through with you either , Peter Rabbit !
" You ' ll find it out one of these fine days !
" Reddy , Reddy , smart and sly , Couldn ' t catch a buzzing fly !
taunted Peter .
" cried Little Joe .
" We can tell better how great it is when we hear what it is ," replied Grandfather Frog testily .
Farmer Brown ' s boy isn ' t afraid of any one who lives in the Green Forest or on the Green Meadows or in the Smiling Pool , and you know it .
" concluded Little Joe .
Now we ' ll get even with _him_ !
"
Of course , Peter Rabbit helped spread it .
Another was Reddy Fox .
Reddy doubted because he didn ' t want to believe .
" We ' ll do it right away .
" Certainly , certainly .
His voice is strong ; When things go wrong Blacky is a screamer !
On his big , green lily - pad sat Grandfather Frog .
Blacky waited until he was sure that no one else was coming .
You have made a hero of Buster Bear , because you believe Little Joe ' s story .
Now what do you say ?
Ever since it was light enough to see at all , Blacky the Crow had been sitting in the top of the tallest tree on the edge of the Green Forest nearest to Farmer Brown ' s house , and never for an instant had he taken his eyes from Farmer Brown ' s back door .
What was he watching for ?
In each hand he carried a milk pail .
Ha , ha , ha !
He just hung his head , which is something Blacky seldom does .
He was so curious to know what it all meant that he couldn ' t wait another minute .
Now there was some one else with a great deal of curiosity also .
He walked very softly so as not to make a sound .
FARMER BROWN ' S BOY AND BUSTER BEAR MEET
Then he had laughed some more , all of which goes to show how easy it is to be mistaken , and how foolish it is to laugh at things you really don ' t know about .
They felt sure that Farmer Brown ' s boy would follow them , and they meant to lead him to where Sammy had seen Buster Bear that morning .
Then they would find out for sure if what Little Joe Otter had said was true ,-- that Farmer Brown ' s boy really was afraid of Buster Bear .
Peter Rabbit , sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch , with eyes and ears wide open , held _his_ breath .
And all the other little people who happened to be where they could see did the same thing .
Then something happened .
Farmer Brown ' s boy opened his mouth and yelled !
And that yell was a yell of fright .
Didn ' t I say that he was afraid of Buster Bear ?
Then there was a great crash which made everybody turn to look the other way .
Sammy Jay looked at Blacky the Crow , and Blacky looked at Chatterer , and Chatterer looked at Happy Jack , and Happy Jack looked at Peter Rabbit , and Peter looked at Unc ' Billy Possum , and Unc ' Billy looked at Bobby Coon , and Bobby looked at Johnny Chuck , and Johnny looked at Reddy Fox , and Reddy looked at Jimmy Skunk , and Jimmy looked at Billy Mink , and Billy looked at Little Joe Otter , and for a minute nobody could say a word .
" Unc ' Billy Possum chuckled .
" Ah believe yo ' are right again , Brer Otter ," said he .
" It cert ' nly does look so .
If Brer Bear isn ' t scared , he must have remembered something impo ' tant and has gone to attend to it in a powerful hurry .
BUSTER BEAR IS A FALLEN HERO
As this was the first time , the very first time , that they had ever known any one who lives in the Green Forest to make Farmer Brown ' s boy run away , they looked on Buster Bear with a great deal of respect and were very proud of him .
They began to say unkind things about him .
But when impudent little Chatterer the Red Squirrel shouted the same thing from a place just out of reach in a big pine - tree , Buster could stand it no longer .
But he _had_ said hateful things , he _had_ chosen to sit in a tree which stood quite by itself , and Buster Bear _could_ climb !
" growled Buster Bear .
" Gr - r - r - r !
I ' ll eat you all up to the last hair on your tail !
But Chatterer had learned from Old Mother Nature that she had given him certain things to help him at just such times , and one of them is the power to spread himself very flat .
He did it now .
" I didn ' t catch him that time ," he growled , " but I guess I gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson .
"
BUSTER BEAR GOES BERRYING
It ' s a habit .
That is the way that a habit which isn ' t bad in itself can become bad when it is carried too far .
Of course , when he came down to the Green Forest to live , he brought all his habits with him .
The first Jolly Little Sunbeams had only reached the Green Meadows and had not started to creep into the Green Forest , when he saw a big , dark form steal out of the Green Forest where it joins the Old Pasture .
Isn ' t it funny how two people will often think of the same thing at the same time , and neither one know that the other is thinking of it ?
He carried a big tin pail , and in the bottom of it , wrapped up in a piece of paper , was a lunch , for he meant to stay until he filled that pail , if it took all day .
So he didn ' t whistle as he felt like doing , and he tried not to make a bit of noise as he followed an old cow - path towards a place where he knew the berries grew thick and oh , so big , and all the time he kept his eyes wide open , and he kept his ears open too .
He stopped to listen .
He never had heard a cry just like it before .
At first he couldn ' t make out just what it was or where it came from .
But one thing he was sure of , and that was that it was a cry of fright .
Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here , there , and everywhere .
Well , I don ' t like to tell you , but he was trying to swallow one of the children of Stickytoes the Tree Toad .
And he saw something else in the Old Pasture that made his smile still broader .
There were no leaves or green ones there .
No , he wasn ' t dreaming .
Buster looked sharply at the shiny thing that held the berries .
The question is , did Buster Bear steal Farmer Brown ' s boy ' s pail ?
Just then he heard a little noise , as if some one were coming .
He growled and whined and squealed .
He tried to back out of the pail and couldn ' t .
After that second yell he just stood still and stared .
He didn ' t want it .
Just as soon as he caught sight of Buster Bear running for the Green Forest as hard as ever he could , he understood what had excited Sammy so .
It was bad enough to be frightened almost to death as he had been up in the Old Pasture when the pail had caught over his head just as Farmer Brown ' s boy had yelled at him .
But Buster is so big that it is not easy for him to find a hiding place .
But it was of no use .
They actually flew into the very tree under which he was hiding , and how they did scream !
Yes , Sir , Buster Bear was having the worst fit of temper ever seen in the Green Forest .
But when his temper is aroused and gets away from him , then watch out !
It was more than any self - respecting Bear could stand .
Those who could fly , flew .
Those who could climb , climbed .
At least , he couldn ' t see any one .
At last the handle broke , and he was free !
Little by little , as he thought it all over , a look of shame crept into his face .
" I -- I guess it wasn ' t the fault of that thing .
"
Buster Bear looked up and grinned , and there was a twinkle in his eyes .
FARMER BROWN ' S BOY LUNCHES ON BERRIES
It was a comical little whistle of chagrin as he realized that he had nothing in which to put more berries , even if he picked them .
That bear might have tried to eat me instead of the berries .
" My , but those sandwiches will taste good ," thought he .
Hello !
They had disappeared as completely as if they never had been , and Old Man Coyote had taken care to leave no trace of his visit .
"
So she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ), whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ' ORANGE MARMALADE ', but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .
' ( and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you ' re falling through the air !
Down , down , down .
Dinah my dear !
' and sometimes , ' Do bats eat cats ?
' when suddenly , thump !
thump !
' No , I ' ll look first ,' she said , ' and see whether it ' s marked " poison " or not '; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ' poison ,' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
' said Alice ; ' I must be shutting up like a telescope .
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words ' EAT ME ' were beautifully marked in currants .
'
CHAPTER II .
' Curiouser and curiouser !
'
Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .
I wonder if I ' ve been changed in the night ?
' How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale !
' I ' m sure those are not the right words ,' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , ' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
' cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , ' I do wish they WOULD put their heads down !
' said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; ' and now for the garden !
' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas !
' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal ' s feelings .
' Well , perhaps not ,' said Alice in a soothing tone : ' don ' t be angry about it .
' cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail .
'
Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
' I know what " it " means well enough , when I find a thing ,' said the Duck : ' it ' s generally a frog or a worm .
The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , '"-- found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown .
' As wet as ever ,' said Alice in a melancholy tone : ' it doesn ' t seem to dry me at all .
' said the Eaglet .
'
)
However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out ' The race is over !
At last the Dodo said , ' EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes .
There was exactly one a - piece all round .
' It IS a long tail , certainly ,' said Alice , looking down with wonder at the Mouse ' s tail ; ' but why do you call it sad ?
'
' said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her .
' Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , ' Yes , please do !
' sighed the Lory , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ' Ah , my dear !
' Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I ' m sure she ' s the best cat in the world !
It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself ' The Duchess !
Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ?
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , ' Why , Mary Ann , what ARE you doing out here ?
There was no label this time with the words ' DRINK ME ,' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips .
It did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken .
She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself ' That ' s quite enough -- I hope I shan ' t grow any more -- As it is , I can ' t get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn ' t drunk quite so much !
'
Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought !
' THAT you won ' t ' thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
)
' said Alice to herself .
'
'
' thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face .
' which produced another dead silence .
Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head .
' And yet what a dear little puppy it was !
I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?
The great question certainly was , what ?
CHAPTER V . Advice from a Caterpillar
The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice .
' Who are YOU ?
Alice replied , rather shyly , ' I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then .
'
'
'
This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again .
' Keep your temper ,' said the Caterpillar .
'
' I ' m afraid I am , sir ,' said Alice ; ' I can ' t remember things as I used -- and I don ' t keep the same size for ten minutes together !
' said the Caterpillar .
' You are old , Father William ,' the young man said , ' And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head -- Do you think , at your age , it is right ?
' You are old ,' said the youth , ' one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ?
' I have answered three questions , and that is enough ,' Said his father ; ' don ' t give yourself airs !
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ?
'
' But I ' m not used to it !
' thought Alice to herself .
' she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right - hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot !
' She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .
' I ' m NOT a serpent !
' said Alice indignantly .
'
' I ' ve tried the roots of trees , and I ' ve tried banks , and I ' ve tried hedges ,' the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; ' but those serpents !
' I ' m very sorry you ' ve been annoyed ,' said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning .
'
' I can see you ' re trying to invent something !
' I ' ve seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that !
'
'
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it .
' Come , there ' s half my plan done now !
' The Frog - Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , ' From the Queen .
' ARE you to get in at all ?
' It ' s really dreadful ,' she muttered to herself , ' the way all the creatures argue .
'
She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again :--
'
' Oh , PLEASE mind what you ' re doing !
wow !
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that Alice could hardly hear the words :--
wow !
'
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer - shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , ' just like a star - fish ,' thought Alice .
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
' Don ' t grunt ,' said Alice ; ' that ' s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself .
Alice was just beginning to think to herself , ' Now , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ?
This time there could be NO mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further .
So she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .
It looked good - natured , she thought : still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .
' Then it doesn ' t matter which way you go ,' said the Cat .
' What sort of people live about here ?
Alice didn ' t think that proved it at all ; however , she went on ' And how do you know that you ' re mad ?
You grant that ?
' Do you play croquet with the Queen to - day ?
Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening .
' I thought it would ,' said the Cat , and vanished again .
'
I ' ve often seen a cat without a grin ,' thought Alice ; ' but a grin without a cat !
It was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself ' Suppose it should be raving mad after all !
CHAPTER VII .
A Mad Tea - Party
'
' There ' s PLENTY of room !
' I do ,' Alice hastily replied ; ' at least -- at least I mean what I say -- that ' s the same thing , you know .
'
'
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .
' she remarked .
' It tells the day of the month , and doesn ' t tell what o ' clock it is !
'
' I haven ' t the slightest idea ,' said the Hatter .
' I think you might do something better with the time ,' she said , ' than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers .
' Of course you don ' t !
that accounts for it ,' said the Hatter .
(' I only wish it was ,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .
' Not I !
" Twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
'
' Then you keep moving round , I suppose ?
' I ' m afraid I don ' t know one ,' said Alice , rather alarmed at the proposal .
' Wake up , Dormouse !
' Tell us a story !
' pleaded Alice .
' They couldn ' t have done that , you know ,' Alice gently remarked ; ' they ' d have been ill .'
' You mean you can ' t take LESS ,' said the Hatter : ' it ' s very easy to take MORE than nothing .
'
sh !
' I want a clean cup ,' interrupted the Hatter : ' let ' s all move one place on .
He moved on as he spoke , and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouse ' s place , and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare .
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again , so she began very cautiously : ' But I don ' t understand .
' Of course they were ', said the Dormouse ; '-- well in .
'
Alice was silent .
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : '-- that begins with an M , such as mouse - traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say things are " much of a muchness "-- did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ?
'
' That ' s very curious !
I think I may as well go in at once .
' And in she went .
CHAPTER VIII .
A large rose - tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
'
' said Five .
' said the one who had spoken first .
Seven flung down his brush , and had just begun ' Well , of all the unjust things --' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .
'
Two began in a low voice , ' Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a RED rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely ' Who is this ?
' said Alice , surprised at her own courage .
' It ' s no business of MINE .
The Knave did so , very carefully , with one foot .
' I see !
' said the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
' said Alice , and she put them into a large flower - pot that stood near .
' shouted the Queen .
' Yes !
Hush !
'
' No , I didn ' t ,' said Alice : ' I don ' t think it ' s at all a pity .
' Oh , hush !
' I ' d rather not ,' the Cat remarked .
' A cat may look at a king ,' said Alice .
'
'
The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious .
'
' And the executioner went off like an arrow .
I can ' t tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit .
' I dare say you ' re wondering why I don ' t put my arm round your waist ,' the Duchess said after a pause : ' the reason is , that I ' m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo .
'
' Very true ,' said the Duchess : ' flamingoes and mustard both bite .
' I quite agree with you ,' said the Duchess ; ' and the moral of that is --" Be what you would seem to be "-- or if you ' d like it put more simply --" Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise .
' Pray don ' t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that ,' said Alice .
' A fine day , your Majesty !
' I don ' t even know what a Mock Turtle is .
' I never saw one , or heard of one ,' said Alice .
' Come on , then ,' said the Queen , ' and he shall tell you his history ,'
As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low voice , to the company generally , ' You are all pardoned .
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
She pitied him deeply .
' I ' ll tell it her ,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep , hollow tone : ' sit down , both of you , and don ' t speak a word till I ' ve finished .
' You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question ,' added the Gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice , who felt ready to sink into the earth .
' We had the best of educations -- in fact , we went to school every day --'
' Yes ,' said Alice , ' we learned French and music .
'
' Certainly not !
' I couldn ' t afford to learn it .
' What is it ?
'
'
' Well , there was Mystery ,' the Mock Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers , '-- Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawling -- the Drawling - master was an old conger - eel , that used to come once a week : HE taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils .
' said Alice .
'
'
' Ten hours the first day ,' said the Mock Turtle : ' nine the next , and so on .
He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice , and , with tears running down his cheeks , he went on again :--
'
' Why ,' said the Gryphon , ' you first form into a line along the sea - shore --'
' THAT generally takes some time ,' interrupted the Gryphon .
'-- you advance twice --'
' cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about .
'" Will you walk a little faster ?
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
" and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
' I believe so ,' Alice replied thoughtfully .
So they got their tails fast in their mouths .
'
I never knew so much about a whiting before .
' I can tell you more than that , if you like ,' said the Gryphon .
' Does the boots and shoes !
' she repeated in a wondering tone .
'
' If I ' d been the whiting ,' said Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song , ' I ' d have said to the porpoise , " Keep back , please : we don ' t want YOU with us !
' Wouldn ' t it really ?
' No , no !
'
' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully .
]
' I should like to have it explained ,' said the Mock Turtle .
' Alice said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing , and longed to change the subject .
It ' s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard !
'
No accounting for tastes !
Sing her " Turtle Soup ," will you , old fellow ?
' Beautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen !
Who for such dainties would not stoop ?
Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop !
Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup !
' cried the Gryphon , and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of ' The trial ' s beginning !
'
Alice had never been in a court of justice before , but she had read about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there .
'
' What are they doing ?
Alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down ' stupid things !
' A nice muddle their slates ' ll be in before the trial ' s over !
' I beg pardon , your Majesty ,' he began , ' for bringing these in : but I hadn ' t quite finished my tea when I was sent for .
The Hatter looked at the March Hare , who had followed him into the court , arm - in - arm with the Dormouse .
' Stolen !
' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so , that he shook both his shoes off .
' The twinkling of the what ?
' Well , at any rate , the Dormouse said --' the Hatter went on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the Dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep .
' one of the jury asked .
' That I can ' t remember ,' said the Hatter .
' I ' m glad I ' ve seen that done ,' thought Alice .
'
' If that ' s all you know about it , you may stand down ,' continued the King .
' Come , that finished the guinea - pigs !
' Now we shall get on better .
'
' You may go ,' said the King , and the Hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes on .
' Treacle ,' said a sleepy voice behind her .
'
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , '-- for they haven ' t got much evidence YET ,' she said to herself .
Imagine her surprise , when the White Rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name ' Alice !
CHAPTER XII
She soon got it out again , and put it right ; ' not that it signifies much ,' she said to herself ; ' I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other .
As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset , and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident , all except the Lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of the court .
' That ' s very important ,' the King said , turning to the jury .
' Alice could see this , as she was near enough to look over their slates ; ' but it doesn ' t matter a bit ,' she thought to herself .
' There ' s more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty ,' said the White Rabbit , jumping up in a great hurry ; ' this paper has just been picked up .
' I haven ' t opened it yet ,' said the White Rabbit , ' but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody .
' It isn ' t directed at all ,' said the White Rabbit ; ' in fact , there ' s nothing written on the OUTSIDE .
' He unfolded the paper as he spoke , and added ' It isn ' t a letter , after all : it ' s a set of verses .
' He must have imitated somebody else ' s hand ,' said the King .
' If you didn ' t sign it ,' said the King , ' that only makes the matter worse .
' That PROVES his guilt ,' said the Queen .
' said Alice .
' Why , you don ' t even know what they ' re about !
' If there ' s no meaning in it ,' said the King , ' that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we needn ' t try to find any .
The Knave shook his head sadly .
' Do I look like it ?
' said the King triumphantly , pointing to the tarts on the table .
' No , no !
' Sentence first -- verdict afterwards .
' Hold your tongue !
' said Alice , ( she had grown to her full size by this time .
' Wake up , Alice dear !
The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by -- the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never - ending meal , and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig - baby was sneezing on the Duchess ' s knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it -- once more the shriek of the Gryphon , the squeaking of the Lizard ' s slate - pencil , and the choking of the suppressed guinea - pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle .
Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child - life , and the happy summer days .
I .
Every sort of tool or apparatus had , in consequence , to the full , that fantastic and distorted look which belongs to the miracles of science .

"
" Well , the fact is ," said the other , " that much as I admire your rhetoric and the rhetoric of your school , from a purely verbal point of view , such little study of you and your school in human history as I have been enabled to make has led me to -- er -- rather singular conclusion , which I find great difficulty in expressing , especially in a foreign language .
"
" Well , the truth is , I know I don ' t express it properly , but somehow it seemed to me that you always convey ideas of that kind with most eloquence , when -- er -- when ----"
But sensations awaited them which were much stranger than those of sinking through the solid earth .
And far , far below them the brown fog fell until it warmed into fire .
Beside the ship and beneath it ( for it swung just under the ball ), the immeasurable dome itself shot out and down into the dark like a combination of voiceless cataracts .
They had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight .
" This is the fellow ," he said , " this is the one for my money .
" May I with all respect inquire ," asked the old monk , " what on earth you are talking about ?

This globe is reasonable ; that cross is unreasonable .
The cross is arbitrary .
Above all the globe is at unity with itself ; the cross is primarily and above all things at enmity with itself .
That silent thing up there is essentially a collision , a crash , a struggle in stone .
" But we like contradictions in terms .
Man is a contradiction in terms ; he is a beast whose superiority to other beasts consists in having fallen .
" said the monk , a wrinkle coming into his forehead , " so you think that in a rationalistic scheme of symbolism the ball should be on top of the cross ?
" It sums up my whole allegory ," said the professor .
" What would happen ?
He began , of course , by refusing to allow a crucifix in his house , or round his wife ' s neck , or even in a picture .
Then one still summer evening as he was wending his way homewards , along a lane , the devil of his madness came upon him with a violence and transfiguration which changes the world .
He burnt his house because it was made of crosses .
You begin by breaking up the Cross ; but you end by breaking up the habitable world .
We leave you saying that there is no such place as Eden .
" For practical purposes of support ," replied Michael grimly , " it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball .
" Yes , yes .
" said the monk .
"
"
The monk pointed downward at Ludgate Hill .
This kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid - space , clinging to one arm of the Cross of St . Paul ' s .
Frequently they produce a certain useless and joyless activity of the mere intellect , thought not only divorced from hope but even from desire .
At the highest crisis of some incurable anguish there will suddenly fall upon the man the stillness of an insane contentment .
It is not hope , for hope is broken and romantic and concerned with the future ; this is complete and of the present .
He felt with a sort of half - witted lucidity that the cross was there , and the ball was there , and the dome was there , that he was going to climb down from them , and that he did not mind in the least whether he was killed or not .
A man , a heavy , ordinary man , with a composed indifferent face , and a prosaic sort of uniform , with a row of buttons , blocked his way .
He thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever .
A moment before he had been dying alone .
In the gallery below the ball Father Michael had found that man who is the noblest and most divine and most lovable of all men , better than all the saints , greater than all the heroes -- man Friday .
He gave what even Michael ( slight as was his knowledge of the world ) felt to be an improbable account of the sumptuous pleasures and varied advantages awaiting him downstairs .
And far below , lower even than the lights , could be seen creeping or motionless , great black masses of men .
Michael felt almost as if he were a god , and all the voices were hurled at him .
There ' s something that will surprise you downstairs ; something you want very much to see .
"
He was still full of the cold splendour of space , and of what a French writer has brilliantly named the " vertigo of the infinite ," when another door opened , and with a shock indescribable he found himself on the familiar level , in a street full of faces , with the houses and even the lamp - posts above his head .
Everything his eye fell on it feasted on , not aesthetically , but with a plain , jolly appetite as of a boy eating buns .
He relished the squareness of the houses ; he liked their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife .
And the police already had their hands on a very tall young man , with dark , lank hair and dark , dazed eyes , with a grey plaid over his shoulder , who had just smashed the shop window with a single blow of his stick .
The new and childlike world which he had seen so suddenly , men had not seen at all .
From the Cross from which he had fallen fell the shadow of its fantastic mercy ; and the first three words he spoke in a voice like a silver trumpet , held men as still as stones .
"
II .
" It was in vain that he cried with an accusing energy that the Bishop of London was paid L12 , 000 a year for pretending to believe that the whale swallowed Jonah .
The cross at the top of St . Paul ' s and _The Atheist_ shop at the foot of it were alike remote from the world .
Year after year went by , and year after year the death of God in a shop in Ludgate became a less and less important occurrence .
His high , hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called Celtic , but which is probably far older than the Celts , whoever they were .
Any persons he had talked to since he had touched the fringe of our fashion or civilization had been by a coincidence , sympathetic or hypocritical .
He knew that Our Lady ' s robes were blue before he knew the wild roses round her feet were red .
All through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divine debris , the broken remainder of his first vision .
His private tradition was equally wild and unworldly .
His father , the youngest son and the last left alive , had refused to attend on Queen Victoria in Scotland .
He was not in the least the pathetic Jacobite of whom we read , left behind by a final advance of all things .
" Ah ," he said , after a long pause , " that sort of thing was built under the Stuarts !
After some warning , he selected a sky - sign of some pill .
He learnt that the name Sho , under its third form of Psa , occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity , after the manner of Jupiter on so many occasions , seduced a Virgin and begat a hero .
" What is this ?
" cried little Mr . Turnbull , starting up with hair aflame .
You dirty lunatic , stand up , will you ?
" Are you ?
MacIan might possibly be a gentleman , they felt ; the editor manifestly was not .
He occasionally worked himself up into a sort of theoretic rage about certain particular offenders , such as the men who took pokers to their wives , talked in a loose , sentimental way about the desirability of flogging them , and was hopelessly bewildered by the fact that the wives seemed even more angry with him than with their husbands .
He had often treated serious crimes against mere order or property with a humane flippancy .
" Not your friend , eh ?
"
" answered the Highlander , " then what did those policemen swear by just now ?
" May I ask why you smashed this worthy citizen ' s window ?
" I tell you once and for all ," cried Mr . Cumberland Vane , rapping his knuckles angrily on the table , " I tell you , once and for all , my man , that I will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here .
Don ' t imagine that it will impress me .
The most religious people are not those who talk about it .
( Applause .
"
' I had no other reason .
If you had simply expressed regret for what you had done , I should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper .
" exploded Vane .
" Oh , you want a nurse to look after you ," he said .
But if he refuses , I will write his cowardice on every wall in the world .
I would fight for my country , but if I lost my country , I should still exist .
He went into a sort of weary laughter .
" To keep the peace ," repeated Evan , " with whom ?
( Laughter .
" You ' re like a breath of April , sir ," he cried .
You ' re perfectly right .
Evan went out of the Court of Justice free , but strangely shaken , like a sick man .
No cruelty could have shown it , but their kindness showed it with a ghastly clearness .
" Well , sir ," said the editor of _The Atheist_ , " where is the fight to be ?
And the shop that stood between the pawnshop and the shop of dreary indecency , showed with quite a blaze of old world beauty , for it was , by accident , a shop not unbeautiful in itself .
A row of half - burnished seventeenth - century swords ran like an ornate railing along the front of the window ; behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour ; and higher up hung the most extraordinary looking South Sea tools or utensils , whether designed for killing enemies or merely for cooking them , no mere white man could possibly conjecture .
They were fastidious about them .
Unfortunately , as the police are in some sense pursuing us , we are hurried , and must fight now and without seconds .
" Gentlemen , are you drunk ?
A duel in my garden .
I do believe in humanity .
Be still !
What an exquisite summer evening !
"
The brilliant light ran along the blades , filling the channels of them with white fire ; the combatants stuck their swords in the turf and took off their hats , coats , waistcoats , and boots .
Yet MacIan was not exactly ready .
" What are you staring at ?
" Let us begin .
But it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else .
" asked Evan , hoarsely .
" Yes , yes , quick !
" cried the Highlander .
He narrowed , and , so to speak , tightened his operations : he fenced ( as the swordsman ' s boast goes ), in a wedding ring ; he turned Turnbull ' s thrusts with a maddening and almost mechanical click , like that of a machine .
Help !
The atheist , with his grey eyes at their widest and wildest , was staring straight over his shoulder at the little archway of shop that opened on the street beyond .
And he saw the archway blocked and blackened with strange figures .
" We must bolt , MacIan ," he said abruptly .
Three seconds after he had alighted in his socks on the other side , MacIan alighted beside him , also in his socks and also carrying clothes and sword in a desperate bundle .
When the cabman saw his fares , however , two wild - haired men in their shirts and socks with naked swords under their arms , he not unnaturally brought his readiness to a rigid stop and stared suspiciously .
And a ' m gaein ' to St . Pancras Station .
Open the doors , cabby .
"
" Give me his hat ," said Turnbull in a silver voice , that the other obeyed like a bugle .
Our future action is a thing about which I myself entertain sufficiently strong views ; but I have no right to assume or to anticipate yours , though I may have formed a decided conception of your character and a decided notion of what they will probably be .
It means us .
You and I are the realities .
Yes , you open for me a vista of thought .
Our action must at least go further than it has gone under recent interrupted conditions .
That , I believe , is understood .
Until the event comes off , therefore I should suggest that quarrelling would be inconvenient and rather inartistic ; while the ordinary exchange of politeness between man and man would be not only elegant but uncommonly practical .
" Mr . MacIan ," replied Turnbull , calmly , " no more need be said .
Then he said , " Mr . MacIan , may I offer you a cigar .
" You are very kind .
A DISCUSSION AT DAWN
We do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding .
However democratic they may be , they are only concerned with the minority .
The incident of the religious fanatic who broke a window on Ludgate Hill was alone enough to set them up in good copy for the night .
Towards the end all the leaders tended to be the same , but they all began differently .
" The _Times_ began with something about Celtic disturbances of the equilibrium of Empire , and the _Daily Express_ distinguished itself splendidly by omitting altogether so controversial a matter and substituting a leader about goloshes .
It became monstrous and omnipresent , as do in our time the unimportant doings of the sect of the Agapemonites , or as did at an earlier time the dreary dishonesties of the Rhodesian financiers .
The Government was solemnly denounced in the papers for not having done something , nobody knew what , to prevent the window being broken .
Mr . MacIan , one of the combatants , became for some mysterious reason , singly and hugely popular as a comic figure in the comic papers and on the stage of the music hall .
From the spot where Turnbull and MacIan were sitting on one of the barren steeps behind Hampstead , they could see the whole of London shaping itself vaguely and largely in the grey and growing light , until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet , the splendid monstrosity that it is .
Turnbull , the old idealistic democrat , had so often reviled the democracy and reviled them justly for their supineness , their snobbishness , their evil reverence for idle things .
There seemed to be something greater than mere accuracy in making such a mistake as London .
" Like the land of the Brobdingnagians ," said Turnbull , smiling .
For the first time , perhaps , for many generations , the English are really more angry about a wrong thing done in England than they are about a wrong thing done in France .
"
Turnbull laughed .
But because two gentlemen , from private feelings of delicacy , do want to die , they will mobilize the army and navy to prevent them .
We must expect to be recognized as much as if we were Napoleon escaping from Elba .
We must often sleep under the stars as if we were in Africa .
I have the biscuits and the tinned meat , and the milk .
" And he set off ahead at a swinging walk .
" demanded the leader , again , his face slowly growing as red as his beard ; then he said , suddenly , and in a more human voice , " Are you in pain , MacIan ?
"
" It ' s not in the body ," said MacIan , in his dull , strange way .
" The pain has come into my mind .
A very dreadful thing has just come into my thoughts .
We must fight now .
"
" The hour has come -- the black hour God meant for it .
" Put that thing up again , you ass ; people will come out of that house at the first clash of the steel .
"
Now or never .
Perhaps you are feeling just as I do .
Turnbull ' s face flinched again in the fierce sunlight , but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease .
" You know what I mean .
MacIan bowed patiently , but with burning eyes .
I should feel that because I had been weak , justice had not been done .
" asked Turnbull , with a slight smile .
" No ," said Evan , thoughtfully , " I do not say that .
"
"
It is not some superstition or some symbol .
Turnbull ' s face wore an indecipherable expression .
Their hearts were growing weaker and weaker against each other .
But now nothing could undo or deny that flash of fact , that for a second they had been glad to be interrupted .
Was there , perhaps , some such fatalism in friendship as all lovers talk about in love ?
It was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man .
At the first glance he looked a fine animal , with curling gold beard and hair , and blue eyes , unusually bright .
Now , you don ' t mind my saying this , do you ?
Do you know what I always say to young people ?
We ' ve quite outgrown duelling , you know .
" Do _they_ ?
Now , let us put the matter very plainly , and without any romantic nonsense about honour or anything of that sort .
" There is no sin of bloodshed .
" Well , we won ' t quarrel about a word ," said the other , pleasantly .
Why do we choose one word more than another if there isn ' t any difference between them ?
" Ah , you ' re a casuist !
" Now , do you know what I always say to casuists ...?
MacIan made a violent gesture ; and Turnbull broke into open laughter .
Tolstoy has shown that violence merely breeds violence in the person towards whom it is used , whereas Love , on the other hand , breeds Love .
" It is against all modern ideas .
You seem to me colder than a lump of stone ; but I am willing to believe that you may at some time have loved a cat , or a dog , or a child .
But don ' t you talk about Christianity .
Christianity is a thing that could only make you vomit , till you are other than you are .
" Dogma !
With the string in his teeth , he said , " Oh , make up your damned mind and clear out !
"
"
" Well , that man was an angel ," said MacIan .
Give up vows and dogmas , and fixed things , and you may grow like That .
On guard !
What ?
They did not run in a scampering or feverish manner , but in the steady swing of the pendulum .
" said Turnbull , with civility .
They are too fat .
They will look like your friend , Cardinal Manning .
" They have put the mounted police on us ," said Turnbull , shortly .
"
Turnbull hoisted himself up and broke the hedge with his body .
As he swung himself up also into the evening light he felt as if he were rising on enormous wings .
Men who had loved each other and then fought each other ; men who had fought each other and then loved each other , together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness .
" That will do for us very well .
"
It was a weather - stained hut of grey wood , which with all its desolation retained a tag or two of trivial ornament , which suggested that the thing had once been a sort of summer - house , and the place probably a sort of garden .
I ought to say ----"
" Who the devil can that be ?
" It might be God .
"
" You ' re overdone , MacIan ," said Turnbull , putting him on one side .
"
He paused one moment with his hand on the handle and then flung the door open .
He was a small man with two wisps of long hair that curled up on each side , and seen in silhouette , looked like horns .
His large straw hat had fallen behind him as he leapt backwards .
Seen more fully , with the evening light on his face , the strange man looked a little less like a goblin .
Against the great sunset his figure had looked merely small : seen in a more equal light it looked tolerably compact and shapely .
His reddish - brown hair , combed into two great curls , looked like the long , slow curling hair of the women in some pre - Raphaelite pictures .
" But , may I ask ," he said at last , " what the devil you are doing in my summer - house ?
"
" We had better tell this gentleman the whole business ," broke in Turnbull .
I know all the excellent and ethical things that you will want to say to us .
" Put me out of my intellectual misery .
"
Even Turnbull , with his typical invulnerability , was a little taken aback by this boisterous and almost brutal hospitality .
Come in !
Ha !
"
Lord bless me , the gods must exist after all -- they have sent me one of my day - dreams !
" cried the creature again .
The moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive , whitewashed cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold .
" Selim ," said the host , " these two gentlemen are staying with me tonight .
" This will do us best , Mr . MacIan ," said he .
Only rabbits and cats , sometimes .
"
Men , men , men will bleed before him today .
" Perhaps I express myself a little too lyrically ," he said with an amicable abruptness .
They let me say it at dinner and so on , and seemed to like it .
Victory is the only ultimate fact .
And I salute the survivor .
Turnbull , with a questioning glance , handed him the weapon .
MacIan took the second sword in his left hand and , with a violent gesture , hurled it at the feet of little Mr . Wimpey .
Wimpey took a step backward , and bewildered words bubbled on his lips .
" Pick up that sword and fight me ," repeated MacIan , with brows as black as thunder .
If winning is everything , go in and win !
Fight , you rat !
" Chase him over a county !
THE VILLAGE OF GRASSLEY - IN - THE - HOLE
At about half past one , under a strong blue sky , Turnbull got up out of the grass and fern in which he had been lying , and his still intermittent laughter ended in a kind of yawn .
"
" It seems to me your most conclusive position .
" I supposed you did ," repeated MacIan with his usual mildness ; " but I admit that I know little of the details of your belief -- or disbelief .
Turnbull swung round quite suddenly , and set off towards the village .
" Come down to the village .
Come down to the nearest decent inhabitable pub .
" I do not quite follow you ," said the Highlander .
Do not by any means let us drop our intentions of settling our differences with two steel swords .
But do you not think that with two pewter pots we might do what we really have never thought of doing yet -- discover what our difference is ?
"
The upper of these two roads was decorated with a big public house , a butcher ' s shop , a small public house , a sweetstuff shop , a very small public house , and an illegible signpost .
Where all the people lived who supported all the public houses was in this , as in many other English villages , a silent and smiling mystery .
The first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it ; it was interfering with nature , if there is any nature .
The first wild ox began to tear up the grass and eat it ; he was interfering with nature , if there is any nature .
"
" And in the same way ," said MacIan almost dreamily , " the superhuman , the supernatural is just as natural as the nature which it destroys .
The supernatural does not exist .
If the natural does not exist the supernatural obviously can ' t .
" Good Lord in heaven !
" You would bump your head badly ," cried MacIan , suddenly starting up .
Come outside and ascend into heaven !
He stood silent for a second or two and then resumed .
Yes , there is a real difference between the natural and the supernatural : if you flew up into that blue sky this instant , I should think that you were moved by God -- or the devil .
The supernatural was not natural , but it was perfectly reasonable .
But there is the great difficulty , Turnbull .
"
" said Turnbull truculently .
I can understand your disbelieving in it , but why disbelieve in a part of it ?
Well , let that pass for the moment .
Did you not take in those things , too , along with your theology ?
But ----"
" said Turnbull .
"
"
" asked the atheist .
"
" What are you going to do ?
"
"
If every man is an enlightened citizen , there is your enlightened citizen .
The first man one meets is always man .
"
The old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill .
What you want , my friend , is your rights .
I don ' t want no votin ' nor priests .
When I sees a man , I sez ' e ' s a man .
" Not a city or owt else .
" And you have kept close to something the whole world of today tries to forget .
" A jolly old creature ," said Turnbull ; " he didn ' t seem able to get much beyond that fact that a man is a man .
MacIan had learnt much and thought more since he came out of the cloudy hills of Arisaig .
" I begin to understand one or two of your dogmas , Mr . Turnbull ," he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill .
" And every one that I understand I deny .
The first is that Nestorius , as a heretic , taught something quite opposite to the teaching of Arius , the heretic who came before him , and something quite useless to James Turnbull , the heretic who comes after .
I defy you to go back to the Free - thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all .
I defy you to read Godwin or Shelley or the deists of the eighteenth century of the nature - worshipping humanists of the Renaissance , without discovering that you differ from them twice as much as you differ from the Pope .
Who can discuss whether Emerson was a better optimist than Schopenhauer was pessimist ?
Granted that it took millions of books I never read and millions of men I never heard of to discover the electric light .
The Church always seems to be behind the times , when it is really beyond the times ; it is waiting till the last fad shall have seen its last summer .
" We once did make it a test for these things ," said MacIan smiling , " and then you told us that we were imposing by force a faith unsupported by argument .
" That is all very well as a debating - club answer ," replied Turnbull good - humouredly , " but the question still remains : Why don ' t you confine yourself more to Christians if Christians are the only really good men ?
" Do you suppose that the Catholic Church ever held that Christians were the only good men ?
Very well , now take the other types of human virtue ; many of them splendid .
What will remain ?
" It has been very well put by one of the brightest of your young authors , who said : ' Unless you become as little children ye shall in no wise enter the kingdom of heaven .
And what , I ask you , is this modern worship of children ?
And it was with these words that they came in sight of the great plains .
" MacIan answered nothing to the speech ; perhaps it is unanswerable .
THE STRANGE LADY
The two companions trudged across the moonlit plain for half an hour in full silence .
Then his hands dropped again and he spoke .
Something always jumped out of the bushes .
" Nothing will jump out of bushes here anyhow ," he said .
"
" I forgot your prejudices .
I will engage on my side , like Elijah , to accept a test from heaven .
" It is the voice of God ," he said again and again .
MacIan snatched up his fallen weapon without a word , and the two raced away towards that part of the distant road from which the cry was now constantly renewed .
She was clad in close - fitting dark costume , a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead ; and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort , like a young falcon hardly free of the nest .
He had come to know types by instinct and dilemmas with a glance ; he saw the crux of the situation in the road , and what he saw made him redouble his pace .
By the time the two champions came up , things had grown more serious .
But the other dropped at the interruption , turned upon Turnbull and began a battering bout of fisticuffs .
But to MacIan the sword even sheathed was a more natural weapon , and he laid about him on all sides with it as with a stick .
Another of the revellers picked the stick out of the ditch and ran in upon MacIan , calling to his companion to assist him .
By the time he had risen , Turnbull had come to the rescue of MacIan , who was at bay but belabouring his two enemies handsomely .
And he whose whole soul was with the swords and stately manners of the eighteenth century , he who was a Jacobite risen from the dead , had an overwhelming sense of being once more in the picture , when he had so long been out of the picture .
But Turnbull was more rational than he , being more indifferent .
" I don ' t think you ought to drive home alone , ma ' am ," he said , gruffly .
Turnbull , with the complete innocence of an absolutely sound motive , immediately jumped into the car ; but the girl cast an eye at MacIan , who stood in the road for an instant as if rooted like a tree .
A little while afterwards this mood seemed to slacken and she fell into a more ordinary pace ; but still she did not speak .
Turnbull , who kept a more common and sensible view of the case than anyone else , made some remark about the moonlight ; but something indescribable made him also relapse into silence .
Heaven had not merely sent him a message ; Heaven itself had opened around him and given him an hour of its own ancient and star - shattering energy .
The girl was a daughter of the rich ; and this police suspicion ( under which all the poor live day and night ) stung her for the first time into speech .
" she cried out in a kind of temper ; " this car ' s going like a snail .
"
" My God , MacIan !
" You may be right ," he said at last ; " if you are , I must tell her .
" We are chased by the police ," repeated MacIan , vigorously ; then he added , as if beginning an explanation , " You see , I am a Catholic .
When MacIan saw that arrogant and uplifted profile pencilled plainly against the moonshine , he accepted an ultimate defeat .
"
"
MacIan sat with bowed head , listening hungrily to her voice but hardly to her words , and seeing his great world drama grow smaller and smaller before his eyes till it was no bigger than a child ' s toy theatre .
" Our object ," said Turnbull , shortly , " is to make an effective demonstration "; and after that word , MacIan looked at his vision again and found it smaller than ever .
" People read the newspapers , but they don ' t believe them , or anything else , I think .
" What are you taking them up for ?
"
"
Now and then with a shock and rattle they went through sleeping moonlit villages , which must have stirred an instant in their sleep as at the passing of a fugitive earthquake .
Sometimes even a slouching rustic would be afoot on the road and would look after them , as after a flying phantom .
Evan staggered at last into his seat and hid his throbbing head in his hands ; and still the car flew on and its driver sat inflexible and silent .
Save that they were driving southward and had certainly passed the longitude of London , they knew nothing of their direction ; but Turnbull , who had spent a year on the Hampshire coast in his youth , began to recognize the unmistakable but quite indescribable villages of the English south .
X .
THE SWORDS REJOINED
Round the rays of the victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered colours -- brown and blue and green and flaming rose - colour ; as though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world .
" How glorious !
" said MacIan .
He wavered on his long legs as he stood up ; he pulled himself together , and the only consequence was that he trembled from head to foot .
" You can leave me here ," she said , quite casually , as if they had met five minutes before .
"
Evan looked at that lifted face and found it merely lovely ; he was far too much of a fool to see that it was working with a final fatigue and that its austerity was agony .
" repeated the obstinate and dazed MacIan , " why did you save us from the other men ?
God knows I have had no pleasure in my life , though I am pretty and young and father has plenty of money .
I suppose if I actually saw a child drowning I should save it .
Then came the final change in this Proteus , and she put out both her hands for an instant and said in a low tone on which he lived for days and nights :
Somehow one can never really manage to be an atheist .
Turnbull grew restless with this rigidity , and at last , after calling his companion twice or thrice , went up and clapped him impatiently on one of his big shoulders .
Evan winced and leapt away from him with a repulsion which was not the hate of an unclean thing nor the dread of a dangerous one , but was a spasm of awe and separation from something from which he was now sundered as by the sword of God .
He did not hate the atheist ; it is possible that he loved him .
She has left her good name and her good sleep and all her habits and dignity flung away on the other side of England in the hope that she may hear of us and that we have broken some hole into heaven .
" I thought I knew what you mean ," said Turnbull , biting his beard ; " it does seem as if we ought to do something after all she has done this night .
But no answer came ; a silence sank between the two .
And unless I am mistaken there ' s a way down the cliff just here which will land us on a stretch of firm sand where no one is likely to follow us .
It seemed like a triumphant prophecy of some perfect world where everything being innocent will be intelligible ; a world where even our bodies , so to speak , may be as of burning glass .
Other birds were shaken up in great clouds from the tree - tops , as if they were blossoms detached and scattered up to heaven .
" And picking up his sword again , he began striding towards a big bluff of the rocks which stood out upon their left .
" I was sent from Scotland to stop with my aunt .
Before saluting , MacIan , who , being a mystic , was one inch nearer to Nature , cast his eye round the huge framework of their heroic folly .
Both men saluted , and iron rang upon iron .
It was exactly at the same moment that he realized that his enemy ' s left ankle was encircled with a ring of salt water that had crept up to his feet .
" What view do you take of the development ?
"
" Oh , you have got it right , you have got it right !
" Turnbull !
" We ' re very well matched -- it may go on a good time -- the tide is coming up fast -- and I ' m a foot and a half taller .
But just as Turnbull launched his heaviest stroke , the sea , in which he stood up to his hips , launched a yet heavier one .
MacIan found two oars in the bottom of the deserted boat and began somewhat drearily to row .
But it was piercingly cold , and there was , from time to time , a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray , which seemed almost to freeze as it fell .
They had a dreary walk across wastes of grey shingle in the grey dawn before they began to come within hail of human fields or roads ; nor had they any notion of what fields or roads they would be .
Then , leaving MacIan in his attitude of prayer , Turnbull began to look right and left very sharply , like one looking for something .
We are somewhere better than England or Eden or Paradise .
We arrive in France .
_C ' est elle qui -- Mais oui , mais oui , c ' est elle qui sauvera encore le monde_ .
" France , that has always been in rebellion for liberty and reason .
'"
France , which shows today the conquering march of Catholicism , as brain after brain surrenders to it , Brunetire , Coppe , Hauptmann , Barrs , Bourget , Lematre .
"
" France !
"
Turnbull glanced at the crucifix with a sort of scowling good - humour and then said : " He may look and see His cross defeated .
They had not touched each other twice , however , when upon the hill , above the crucifix , there appeared another horrible parody of its shape ; the figure of a man who appeared for an instant waving his outspread arms .
And while it was like a comic repetition of the cross , it was also , in that place and hour , something more incredible .
Before the duellists had exchanged half a dozen passes , the big , blue policeman appeared once more on the top of the hill , a palpable monstrosity in the eye of heaven .
At the same moment a mass of blue blocked the corner of the road behind the small , smart figure of Turnbull , and a small company of policemen in the English uniform came up at a kind of half - military double .
When he saw it , cool as he was , he staggered back .
But why the blue blazes should you interfere , you great blue blundering sausages ?
I always heard that they were spry enough in their own way .
"
" repeated Turnbull , with a sort of dull incredulity .
" Quite so ," said Turnbull , and lurched suddenly against the sergeant , so as to tip him over the edge of the road with a crash into the shingle below .
Then leaving MacIan and the policemen equally and instantaneously nailed to the road , he ran a little way along it , leapt off on to a part of the beach , which he had found in his journey to be firmer , and went across it with a clatter of pebbles .
Then MacIan finally awoke , and leaving half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold him , took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the impetus of a cannon - ball and , sending them also flat among the stones , went tearing after his twin defier of the law .
As they were both good runners , the start they had gained was decisive .
"
He had a genius ( if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person ) a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject ; or rather what we in England would call the conventional thing .
Convention implies cant or affectation , and he had not the faintest smell of either .
If you had asked him about government , he would have said that all citizens were free and equal , but he would have meant what he said .
I am afraid it is impossible to explain this monster amid the exaggerative sects and the eccentric clubs of my country .
He was a large , lean man , with the stoop of an aged eagle , and even the eagle ' s nose to complete it ; he had old - fashioned military whiskers and moustache dyed with a garish and highly incredible yellow .
He had the dress of a showy gentleman and the manners of a decayed gentleman ; he seemed ( as with a sort of simplicity ) to be trying to be a dandy when he was too old even to know that he was old .
Then his frantic hands fell by his sides and he looked up under his brows with an expression that went well with his hard breathing .
" This need go no further here , M . Bert ," he said .
"
As no particular purpose could be served by delay , it was arranged that the affair should fall out three days afterwards .
" Oh , I don ' t mean that ," she said ; " I don ' t talk about what I don ' t understand .
I am sure it is not the best thing to fight .
It would be better to forgive -- if one could really forgive .
" Don ' t you know ," she said , " there is only one more celebration ?
M . Camille Bert was by no means placid .
When at last he said something it was : " O God !
" There will be another mass in a matter of eight hours ," said Madeleine , with a sort of business eagerness and energy , " and you can do it then before the fighting .
He advanced upon Madeleine with flaming eyes , and almost took her by the two shoulders .
" I do not love God ," he cried , speaking French with the broadest Scotch accent ; " I do not want to find Him ; I do not think He is there to be found .
And I am the dirtiest and most dishonest .
"
If you are horribly sorry it is all the better .
It ' s just like my damned luck .
" The plain truth is ," he said at last , " that I am James Turnbull the atheist .
" I saw something about you in a newspaper ," said the girl , with a simplicity which even surprise could never throw off its balance .
"
I am sure there is no God .
" But there is ," said Madeleine , quite quietly , and rather with the air of one telling children about an elephant .
Your scheme succeeds ; you pick a quite convincing quarrel ; you arrange a quite respectable duel ; the duel you have planned so long will come off tomorrow with absolute certainty and safety .
A policeman ran excitedly from under an archway and tried to collar him .
Then he joined the flight of Turnbull , and even as he did so , with one wrench of his powerful hands rent and split the strange , thick stick that he carried .
The nearest expression of the type is that it either hits or apologizes ; and in this case both apologized .
" I ' ll tell you what , you fellows ," said the sprawling gentleman , confidentially , while Evan ' s agonized ears heard behind him the first paces of the pursuit , " if you really are , as you say , in a hurry , I know what it is to be in a hurry -- Lord , what a hurry I was in when we all came out of Cartwright ' s rooms -- if you really are in a hurry "-- and he seemed to steady his voice into a sort of solemnity --" if you are in a hurry , there ' s nothing like a good yacht for a man in a hurry .
Turnbull had already ducked under the intoxicated gentleman ' s elbow and fled far in front .
" If you want to hurry you should take a yacht , and if "-- he said , with a burst of rationality , like one leaping to a further point in logic --" if you want a yacht -- you can have mine .
Evan ' s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry , in which it may be that he decided wrongly ; but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt .
"
The naked - looking nose of land projecting from the unknown island was , indeed , growing larger and larger , like the trunk of some terrible and advancing elephant .
In one place , however , the coast offered a soft , smooth bay of sand , and even the rudimentary ingenuity of the two amateur mariners managed to run up the little ship with her prow well on shore and her bowsprit pointing upward , as in a sort of idiotic triumph .
"
" The question is ," said Turnbull , with cheerful speculation , " whether the survivor will be in a proper frame of mind for potted prawns .
"
" What are you thinking ?
"
"
MacIan was already standing heavily by his with bent head and eyes reading the ground .
But Turnbull being of a more active and birdlike type of mind did throw a glance round the scene .
A long , curving neck of sand , as smooth and wet as the neck of the sea serpent , ran out into the sea and joined their rock to a line of low , billowing , and glistening sand - hills , which the sinking sea had just bared to the sun .
" cried Turnbull , with rolling eyes ; " this ain ' t an island in the Atlantic .
MacIan turned his head , and his face , already pale , grew a shade paler .
What sort of life he expected it to be if it appeared , he did not very clearly know .
" asked the staring editor .
Turnbull thrust his hands through his red hair like one who gives up the world as a bad riddle .
Then glancing at his companion with a small frown , as of one slightly suspicious , he said : " I say , don ' t think me rude -- but you ' re a visionary kind of fellow -- and then we drank a great deal .
" You are quit right ," sobbed that wholly demoralized journalist .
" You mean to say ," he began ----
But MacIan said nothing , and an instant afterwards Turnbull himself called out in an entirely changed voice : " Oh , this is damnable !
Turnbull , who was exceptionally lively and laughing in his demeanour , kicked his legs about like a schoolboy and said he did not want to go to sleep .
Indeed , he needed the strongest sleep he could get ; for the earth was still full of darkness and a kind of morning fog when his fellow - fugitive shook him awake .
He came on at a splendid pace for so portly a figure ; but , like all heavy bodies in motion , he gave the impression that it would be easier for him to increase his pace than to slacken it suddenly .
Pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled , for some quarter of a mile , when they came to a place where two or three of the trees grew twistedly together , making a special obscurity .
The white vapour lay , as it often does , in lean and palpable layers ; and even the head of the tree was above it in the half - daylight , like a green ship swinging on a sea of foam .
With his assistance Turnbull vaulted to the same perch , and the two began cautiously to shift along the wall in the direction by which they had come , doubling on their tracks to throw off the last pursuit .
Anything would serve , however , that was likely to confuse their trail , so they both decided without need of words to use this tree also as a ladder -- a ladder of descent .
And yet the mere whiteness of the syringa seemed the most violent colour of all .
His face , which was reflective and somewhat over - refined , was the face of a quite elderly man , though his stringy hair and moustache were still quite yellow .
A double eye - glass , with a broad , black ribbon , drooped from his aquiline nose , and he smiled , as he communed with himself , with a self - content which was rare and almost irritating .
It needed the full shock of the huge shadow of MacIan , falling across his sunlit path , to rouse him from his smiling reverie .
When this had fallen on him he lifted his head a little and blinked at the intruders with short - sighted benevolence , but with far less surprise than might have been expected .
We have just come over the wall .
"
"
" A large proprietor , I imagine ," said Turnbull , with a truculent eye .
" A large proprietor .
Turnbull ' s eye grew even more offensive , and he began biting his red beard ; but MacIan seemed to recognize a type with which he could deal and continued quite easily :
" I am sure that a man like you will not need to be told that one sees and does a good many things that do not get into the newspapers .
But in a gentleman ' s garden , now ----"
But a man may understand ragging and yet be very far from understanding religious ragging .
Even MacIan , therefore ( whose tact was far from being his strong point ), felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach .
" Look here !
You might have gone floundering about in all sorts of churches and chapels and colleges and schools of philosophy looking for some evidence of the existence of God .
Quite so !
So does the moon .
The man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very quickly ; yet the man with the bad hat , who thought he was God , overtook him .
One has to be broadminded .
The big banker in the black frock - coat and hat was standing quite grave and dignified on the lawn , save for his slight twitch of one limb , and he did not seem by any means unworthy of the part which the other promptly forced upon him .
He ' s mad and not so mad , either ; for he frightfully cunning and sharp .
Something in Turnbull made him want suddenly to be sick on the grass ; the mere healthy and heathen horror of the unclean ; the mere inhumane hatred of the inhuman state of madness .
" asked his opponent , eyeing him doubtfully .
The fact is , I don ' t like having God for my second .
Why does a rose have thorns ?
Why is the horn on the top of the nose ?
" And he struck the bridge of his nose smartly with his forefinger to indicate the place of the omission and then wagged the finger menacingly at the Creator .
"
" I am King Edward VII ," he said , with shaky arrogance .
" Do you doubt my word ?
"
"
And folding his arms and throwing back his lean , hawklike face , he haughtily confronted the man with the formal frock - coat and the eccentric elbow .
" What right had you stunted German squires ," he cried , " to interfere in a quarrel between Scotch and English and Irish gentlemen ?
Who made you , whose fathers could not splutter English while they walked in Whitehall , who made you the judge between the republic of Sidney and the monarchy of Montrose ?
Where is the blood of Lochiel ?
MacIan strode after him still preaching and flourishing his large , lean hands .
It performed almost all his gestures ; it was more important than the glittering eye - glasses through which he looked or the beautiful bleating voice in which he spoke .
"
" Well , I hope , at any rate ," he said , " that you like your precious religion now .
" Protoplasm is not worth going mad about .
" It makes all the odds ," said the other .
"
" All the same ," said Turnbull , shrewdly , " I bet you haven ' t found a madman of that sort .
" cried Evan , with unusual animation .
He put his arm in mine and whispered in my ear , as if it were the apocalypse : ' Never trust a God that you can ' t improve on .
" What can he have meant ?
" said the atheist , with all his logic awake .
" Obviously one should not trust any God that one can improve on .
" It is the way he talks ," said MacIan , almost indifferently ; " but he says rummier things than that .
Turnbull leapt to his feet as by an electric shock .
But he doesn ' t exist .
MacIan vanished , and in a few moments returned , trailing with him his own discovery among lunatics , who was a slender man with a fixed smile and an unfixed and rolling head .
He had a goatlike beard just long enough to be shaken in a strong wind .
Evan looked back at the leering head with the long - pointed beard and repeated the word inquiringly : " One of the doctors ?
" The medical authorities of the place .
Evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him .
" For goodness sake ," he said , " don ' t offend this fellow ; he may be as mad as ten hatters , if you like , but he has us between his finger and thumb .
We ' re not mad .
"
MacIan looked at the grass frowningly for a few seconds , and then said in a new , small and childish voice : " I am awfully stupid , Mr . Turnbull ; you must be patient with me .
The doctor with the pointed beard was already slanting it forward at a more than usually acute angle , with the smile that expressed expectancy .
" I am most awfully sorry , Doctor ," said Turnbull , with ready amiability ; " I never meant to keep you waiting ; but the silly accident that has landed us in your garden may have some rather serious consequences to our friends elsewhere , and my friend here was just drawing my attention to some of them .
"
The doctor sat down with a polite impatience on his professional perch ; MacIan remained standing , but Turnbull threw himself almost with luxury into a hard wooden arm - chair .
" I can understand that you were startled .
"
" No ," said the doctor , still smiling steadily and pleasantly , " there will be no one to let you out .
"
" Then , how the devil are we to get out ?
MacIan took one stride to the table , leant across it , and said : " We can ' t stop here , we ' re not mad people !
"
Hitherto Turnbull himself had somewhat scornfully surrendered his part in the whole business ; but he was too honest and unaffected not to start at his own name .
come along , MacIan ; I don ' t care so much , even about getting out of the madhouse , if only we get out of this room .
The system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude .
It is a question of a certain solid and childish fancy .
" asked the young man , accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness ; " what is my sword wanted for ?
"
"
The face was the face of a Greek god grown old , but not grown either weak or ugly ; there was nothing to break its regularity except a rather long chin with a cleft in it , and this rather added distinction than lessened beauty .
MacIan was one of those to whom a reverence and self - submission in ritual come quite easy , and are ordinary things .
" I do bring you a message ," answered the man of moon and marble .
MacIan clambered into the silver boat , and it rose upward to the stars .
As the white - robed figure went upward in his white chariot , he said quite quietly to Evan : " There is an answer to all the folly talked about equality .
They can be orderly , but they cannot be equal .
"
" They are all very beautiful ," said Evan , as if in doubt .
" The Stuart ----" began Evan , earnestly .
"
" Is the war still raging ?
" Is England , indeed , so secure ?
And he wondered whether the little shop was still by the side of it and whether its window had been mended .
But one old grumbling man did not get out of the way quick enough , and the man on horseback struck him , not severely , across the shoulders with the flat of his sword .
"
" I am an angel ," said the white - robed figure , without turning round .
" Go on !
" he cried , twisting and untwisting his long , bony fingers , " go on !
"
The beautiful and princely must , of necessity , be impatient with the squalid and ----"
But I saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry ; I knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals .
" No ," said Evan , quite composedly , " I desire a miracle .
You are not God .
But you were once .
Also it kept its shape , which is unusual with clouds shaken off ; also its shape was of an odd sort .
There was not a soul or a stir of life within sight .
The length of this lower part of the face and the strange cleft in it ( which gave the man , in quite another sense from the common one , a double chin ) faintly spoilt the claim of the face to absolute regularity , but it greatly assisted it in wearing the expression of half - smiling and half - sneering arrogance with which it was staring at all the stones , all the flowers , but especially at the solitary man .
" What do you want ?
" What do you want ?
" Revolution !
To some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall , having automatically followed the stranger so far .
They seemed rising into stronger and stronger sunlight , as if it were sunrise rather than sunset .
But when they looked down at the earth they saw it growing darker and darker .
And above them all the red and raging clouds were like the leaping flags of liberty .
"
All the people who think they are aspiring find they are falling head foremost .
"
"
Turnbull spat over the edge of the car and fell back furiously into his seat .
But , of course , these men like MacIan are awfully clever , especially when they pretend to be stupid .
Then for the first time the other lifted himself from the edge of the car and faced him .
" What do you mean ?
" I thought you would be glad to see your prayer answered .
Ludgate Hill indeed had been an uncaptured and comparatively quiet height , altered only by the startling coincidence of the cross fallen awry .
When at length they had risen high enough to have a bird ' s - eye view of the whole campaign , Turnbull was already intoxicated .
" And will you permit me to say ," said the other , with a snap , " that I don ' t like Mr . Evan MacIan ?
These people have rights .
"
The other went on with enthusiasm .
" I am taking you to the front of the revolutionary war , where you will be one of the first of the revolutionary leaders .
"
"
The unknown rose to his full height , and the expression in his eyes seemed to be made of ironies behind ironies , as two mirrors infinitely reflect each other .
I say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmare .
THE IDIOT
"
" You mean treated worse , I suppose ," said Turnbull , gruffly .
You imprison two perfectly sane men in a madhouse because you have made up a long word .
They take it in good temper , walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation , are civil even to you , you damned druggists ' hack !
I believe you to be a low , gibbering degenerate .
"
" Certainly not .
" I could kill you with my left hand before such a rat as you could so much as squeak .
"
" You can see the head of the asylum if you particularly want to .
" He almost ran out of the room , and the two followed swiftly on his flying coat tails .
This gentleman looked up for an instant as they entered , and the lamplight fell on his glittering spectacles and long , clean - shaven face -- a face which would have been simply like an aristocrat ' s but that a certain lion poise of the head and long cleft in the chin made it look more like a very handsome actor ' s .
They were dragged down countless cold avenues lined with glazed tiles , different only in being of different lengths and set at different angles .
Only the fact that windows grew fewer , coming at longer intervals , and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light , showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building .
He was dead , and the world had won .
His cell was of an oblong shape , but very long in comparison with its width .
There their interest in human nature suddenly ceased .
He was not underfed any more than he was underexercised or asphyxiated .
After three days of silence and cocoa , this angle at the end began to infuriate Turnbull .
Almost unconsciously it was his instinct to examine outlets , and he found himself paying particular attention to the row of holes which let in the air into his last house of life .
There is no power of retrieving a defeat , as in simpler and more living organisms .
Thus , indeed , all that excellent machinery which is the swiftest thing on earth in saving human labour is also the slowest thing on earth in resisting human interference .
But in all his moods , sane or insane , intolerant or stoical , he never really doubted this : that the machine held him as light and as hopelessly as he had from his birth been held by the hopeless cosmos of his own creed .
Here the unpierceable walls were washed every morning by an automatic sluice .
The light that came up from beyond was very faint , and apparently indirect ; it seemed to fall from some hole or window higher up .
The lighted aperture was abruptly blackened and blocked , presumably by a face and mouth , for something human spoke down the tube , though the words were not clear .
" I say , Turnbull , we couldn ' t fight through this tube , could we ?
For a mortal month I have been alone with God .
"
"
After a very long silence the voice of MacIan said : " What do you really hate most in your place ?
" I ' ve pulled it out .
" asked Turnbull .
Turnbull tumbled somehow into MacIan ' s apartment , and his first glance found out that the iron spike was indeed plucked from its socket , and left , moreover , another ragged hole into some hollow place behind .
" he asked .
" But where can the door of it be ?
" It has no door ," said Evan .
In the pause of perplexity that followed , an eerie and sinister feeling crept over Turnbull ' s stubborn soul in spite of himself .
And they have killed us , for you and I have only made a hole in our coffins .
"
After six still seconds Turnbull could stand it no longer , but called out to the dwarfish thing -- in what words heaven knows .
The hilarious energy in this idiot attitude gave Turnbull another sick turn .
But there was something new and subversive of the universe in the combination of so much cheerful decision with a body without a brain .
"
" Good day .
" cried Turnbull .
" They ' ve turned him to an imbecile just by burying him alive .
You pulled out that iron handle that had screwed up his cell , and it somehow altered the machinery and opened all the doors .
All this wilderness of windowless passages was so built into the heart of that fortress of fear that it seemed more than an hour before the fugitives had any good glimpse of the outer world .
Only once or twice in life is it permitted to a man thus to see the very universe from outside , and feel existence itself as an adorable adventure not yet begun .
Turnbull was the first to leap into the garden , with an earth - spurning leap like that of one who could really spread his wings and fly .
You don ' t suppose I should have let these lunatics out of their cells without good reason .
They can be let out of their cell today , because today the whole world has become their cell .
I will have no more medieval mummery of chains and doors .
"
What are those arrangements ?
"
" You mean to say ," said Turnbull , " that this was what the Master of the asylum urged before the House of Commons ?
" He was afraid !
Turning and returning , and making detours about the garden , he managed to study the man ' s face again and again -- a moustached , somewhat military face with a monocle , the sort of face that is aristocratic without being distinguished .
Was the man a long - lost uncle , or was he only somebody who had sat opposite him regularly in a railway train ?
As a magistrate Mr . Cumberland Vane had been somewhat careless and shallow , but certainly kindly , and not inaccessible to common sense so long as it was put to him in strictly conventional language .
Has he got anything to do with this game ?
So I am sure you will give us your testimony that , even if we were criminals , we are not lunatics in any legal or medical sense whatever .
" repeated the magistrate , with a slight start .
"
Mr . Cumberland Vane laughed outright .
" I don ' t understand ," answered Turnbull .
He walked away very rapidly and flung himself on a garden seat , and for some six minutes his own wrongs hid from him the huge and hilarious fact that Cumberland Vane had been locked up as a lunatic .
The garden of the madhouse was so perfectly planned , and answered so exquisitely to every hour of daylight , that one could almost fancy that the sunlight was caught there tangled in its tinted trees , as the wise men of Gotham tried to chain the spring to a bush .
It was of that innocent lonely yellow which has never heard of orange , though it might turn quite unconsciously into green .
" he cried .
" Nonsense ," said the other , clutching at the obvious cue of benevolent brutality , " this is one of your silly moods .
"
I did shut them , and opened them again , and she was still there -- that is , of course , she wasn ' t ---- She still had a little fur round her neck , but her dress was a shade brighter than when I really saw her .
"
" cried MacIan , with a leap of eagerness that was heart - breaking , " do you see her , too ?
" she said , smiling , and suddenly lifting her level brown eyebrows .
MacIan stared at her and then at his boots , and then at the sky and then at her again .
But the lady did not move an inch until Evan had flung up his face again ; and when he did he saw by the last gleam of sunlight that it was not only his face that was wet .
"
" Ain ' t I written on your heart , old boy ?
Not to be confused with the Wilkinsons of Cumberland ; and as I say , old boy , what have you done with my yacht ?
Turnbull .
The man you have just been talking to , poor fellow , is one of the strongest cases of pure _idee fixe_ that we have .
It ' s very sad , and I ' m afraid utterly incurable .
Sudden manifestation of Rapinavititis -- the delusion that one has stolen a ship .
Into the middle of his stationary and senseless enjoyment were thrust abruptly the projecting elbow and the projecting red beard of Turnbull .
" I am dying ," answered the other quite calmly .
Then after a silence he cried with a rending sincerity : " Are you really there , Evan ?
No , you are not dreaming -- you are waking up .
" What do you mean ?
" There are two states where one meets so many old friends ," said MacIan ; " one is a dream , the other is the end of the world .
"
or I shall say it all wrong ," said MacIan , breathing hard .
All the people are crowding into one corner .
Then after a silence he said : " I can ' t see it -- and yet I will try to describe it .
" Old man in the cell !
"
" I am much obliged ," said Turnbull , gruffly .
The Church has had her madnesses , and I am one of them .
Torture should be violently stopped , though the Church is doing it .
That is the final and blasting test .
The world left to itself grows wilder than any creed .
" I had a dream ," said MacIan , " in which I saw the cross erect and the ball invisible .
There must be some round earth to plant the cross upon .
But here is the awful difference -- that the round world will not consent even to continue round .
The astronomers are always telling us that it is shaped like an orange , or like an egg , or like a German sausage .
" murmured MacIan .
"
" You are right ," answered Evan almost inaudibly .
" You will be inside the building in three minutes ," he said , with pulverizing precision , " or you will be fired on by the artillery at all the windows .
And he turned his back and walked obediently towards the building .
By means of that complex but concealed machinery which ran like a network of nerves over the whole fabric , there had been shot out under every window - ledge rows and rows of polished - steel cylinders , the cold miracles of modern gunnery .
But when they entered the lamp - lit hall , and the high iron door was clashed to and locked behind them , yet a new amazement leapt into their eyes , and the stalwart Turnbull almost fell .
It was old Durand , the girls ' father ; and when Turnbull saw him he saw the last and worst marvel of that monstrous night .
Then all these bewildered but partly amicable recognitions were cloven by a cruel voice which always made all human blood turn bitter .
The Master was standing in the middle of the room surveying the scene like a great artist looking at a completed picture .
That is , he spoke with rattling and breathless rapidity , but with no incoherence , and therefore with no emotion .
" You refuse me my half - bottle of Medoc , the drink the most wholesome and the most customary .
You refuse me the beef and mutton , without pretence that it is a fast of the Church .
"
"
I will explain it , ladies and gentlemen ; I will explain everything .
"
"
There never was any man named MacIan .
He is a victim of the disease called Vinculomania -- the impression that one has been bound or tied up .
We have also a case of Fugacity ( Mr . Whimpey ), who imagines that he was chased by two men .
The indignant faces of the Jew shopkeeper and the Magdalen Don started out of the crowd in their indignation , but the speaker continued :
MacIan gave a great shout , snatched up the loose chair - leg , and , rushing on the other doctor , felled him with a blow .
"
" How did the French Revolution happen ?
" Oh , how should I know !
" wailed the other .
" You believe nothing ," said MacIan , simply , " and you are insupportably afraid of death .
"
"
In the roof above their heads a panel shot back , showing a strip of star - lit sky and a huge thing made of white metal , with the shape and fins of a fish , swinging as if at anchor .
The site of the old half - wit ' s cell was now the heart of a standing forest of fire -- the flames as thick and yellow as a cornfield .
Yet through all that deafening density MacIan thought he heard a small and separate sound .
" cried Evan , in agony ; " it ' s the poor old beggar ' s voice -- he ' s still alive , and shouting for help .
"
As he listened , MacIan ' s two eyes began to glow , as if a strange thought had come into his head .
" shouted Turnbull .
" Father ," he shouted , " come out and save us all !
The fire , though it had dropped in one or two places , was , upon the whole , higher and more unconquerable than ever .
It was literally a wall of fire .
" Turnbull was staring at him as he cried .
So that earth and ocean could behold , where there had been a mere fiery mass , a thing divided like a V -- a cloven tongue of flame .
But if it were a prodigy for those distant , it was something beyond speech for those quite near .
As the echoes of Evan ' s last appeal rang and died in the universal uproar , the fiery vault over his head opened down the middle , and , reeling back in two great golden billows , hung on each side as huge and harmless as two sloping hills lie on each side of a valley .
When he had passed they looked up .
But now the fire was turned to left and right like a woman ' s hair parted in the middle , and now the shafts of its light could shoot up into empty heavens and strike anything , either bird or cloud .
But it struck something that was neither cloud nor bird .
" screamed Beatrice , hiding her head .
"
" No , they are not lost ," he said .
He looked vaguely about at the fire that was already fading , and there among the ashes lay two shining things that had survived the fire , his sword and Turnbull ' s , fallen haphazard in the pattern of a cross .

The new - comer regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus .
Pray excuse me if I am wrong .

I have nothing else to do this afternoon .
The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth , but still with a queer kind of simplicity .
It was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking - room for some trouble in passing the matches , than as if he were ( as he was ) practically thanking the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him into a field to find a four - leaved clover .
In the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a sea - wall there is a very honest but rather sharp - tempered member of my flock , a widow called MacNab .
There are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat , who once came out of the sea - mists and apparently out of the sea , stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight , till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window .
Todhunter dashed down his window with violence , and the man in the high hat melted into the sea - fog again .
You see , therefore , how this sealed door of Todhunter ' s is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the ` Thousand and One Nights '.
He pays his rent to the tick ; he is practically a teetotaller ; he is tirelessly kind with the younger children , and can keep them amused for a day on end ; and , last and most urgent of all , he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter , who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow .
You , with your small parochial responsibilities , see only this particular Mrs MacNab , terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea .
He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs , in thousands of houses , dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea - cups of their friends ; he sees --"
Two separate voices : for James speaks low , with a burr , and the other voice was high and quavery .
" That man Glass ?
" I know his name is Glass ," answered the girl , in great impatience .
They were quarrelling -- about money , I think -- for I heard James say again and again , ` That ' s right , Mr Glass ,' or ` No , Mr Glass ,' and then , ` Two or three , Mr Glass .
" asked Dr Hood , who had been studying the young lady with marked interest .
It was an dim , and seemed to be empty , but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner , as if he were drugged or strangled .
The aspect of this edge of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor ' s hints about desolate moods and environments .
The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter ' s story , with more disturbing details of her own , to the divided vows of vengeance against Mr Glass for murdering , and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered , or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter , and for not having lived to do it .
Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side - table , but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet .
It was so much too large for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders .
" How to explain the absence of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass ' s hat ?
" I say ` old ' with intention , though not with certainty " continued the expositor ; " my reason for it might seem a little far - fetched .
The hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees , but almost always falls out slightly , and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn .
Now when this is taken with the high - pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly ( patience , my dear lady , patience ), when we take the hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger , I should think we may deduce some advance in years .
" By the way ," said Father Brown , " might it not be as well to untie Mr Todhunter ?
"
These cards and wine - cups are no part of his normal habit ; they have been produced for a particular companion .
What , then , were these vessels to contain ?
" Look here ," cried the young woman , " if you don ' t let me pass to untie him I ' ll run outside and scream for the police .
Second ," he continued , moving towards the window , " this is the only exit , and it is locked on the inside .
Third , this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point , but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter .
Mr Glass took that wound away with him , dead or alive .
Add to all this primary probability .
There , I think , we have a pretty complete story .
" But the ropes ?
" Miss MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from his ropes .
I did not do it because Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses .
" I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter ," reiterated Hood quietly .
For the whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail , which is the most morbid of human things , because it is a crime concealing a crime ; a black plaster on a blacker wound .
Then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company .
" he cried in a certain excitement .
Why , look at his eyes !
" You brutes ; I believe it ' s hurting him !
" Oh , bosh !
"
"
" Now I know ," replied the priest , " the profession of Mr Todhunter .
"
You have called an uncreated being out of the void .
" I have no notion what you are talking about ," said Dr Hood rather haughtily ; " my facts are all inevitable , though necessarily incomplete .
He is so extremely absent .
"
" He couldn ' t possibly wear it !
" asked the criminologist with a slight sneer .
" Didn ' t you see it all when you found out the faked ropes ?
" I mean inside Mr Todhunter .
But , again , being at the stage of practice , he very slightly grazed the inside of his throat with the weapon .
There was a long silence , and Dr Hood regarded the little man who had spoken with a dark and attentive smile .
" You are certainly a very ingenious person ," he said ; " it could not have been done better in a book .
But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded in explaining away , and that is his name .
Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle .
" Well , that ," he said , " that ' s the silliest part of the whole silly story .
Then , advancing into the middle of the room with a bow , he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red , which announced that ZALADIN , the World ' s Greatest Conjurer , Contortionist , Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion , Scarborough , on Monday next at eight o ' clock precisely .
II .
" cried the poet , rising and shaking hands in a pleasant astonishment .
" This ," answered Ezza gravely , " is not the costume of an Englishman , but of the Italian of the future .
" In that case ," remarked Muscari , " I confess I prefer the Italian of the past .
And whom are you conducting ?
" Oh , a man of the name of Harrogate , and his family , I believe .
" The daughter is divine ," affirmed Muscari , " the father and son are , I suppose , human .
He ' s not clever , he ' s got eyes like blue buttons ; he ' s not energetic , he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic .
"
"
His son Frank was a really fine lad , curly - haired , sun - burnt and strenuous ; but nobody looked at him either .
All eyes , as usual , were riveted , for the moment at least , upon Ethel Harrogate , whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea , like a goddess ' s .
Brigandage is utterly stamped out .
" It can never be utterly stamped out ," Muscari answered ; " because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners .
Believe me , there is no more danger of being captured in Italy than of being scalped in Boston .
" Then you propose to attempt it ?
The shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker ' s son , and the latter was astonished to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman .
"
" One can only be kind when it comes .
A more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast - town station of the little priest of the restaurant ; he alleged merely that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland .
The theory of danger from thieves was banished from thought and speech ; though so far conceded in formal act that some slight protection was employed .
But Ethel Harrogate had never before seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks ; the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent .
There was nothing here of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with high and wild scenery .
"
" It is not my fault if you have come ," she said after a difficult silence .
The driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads , and they became ungovernable .
On the other side of him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel ' s sunshade , and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long .
Has her sorrow come on her already ?
Mortals climb up and they fall down ; but it is only gods and goddesses who can fall upwards .
" The brigands !
" cried Muscari , with a kind of monstrous gaiety .
Then put the lady in the middle , and we will break the line up there -- with a rush .
I have been acting epics while you have been writing them .
" This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking ," went on the courier - brigand , with the same easy yet sinister smile , " is , together with some caves underneath it , known by the name of the Paradise of Thieves .
He carries it so that he may never be captured , like Cato .
The King of Thieves was , however , continuing his address with the same kind of dangerous politeness .
He paused with an unpleasing smile ; and Father Brown blinked repeatedly at him , and seemed suddenly to be listening with great attention .
That leap from the failing carriage seemed to have used up his last virility .
And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly to his breast - pocket , and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes to the brigand .
"
He slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks .
The priest sat down within a yard or two , and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him in an instantaneous irritation .
" I mean I am puzzled ," replied the priest .
" I am puzzled about Ezza or Montano , or whatever his name is .
" I should like to have your opinion on them .
" And here is the second of them .
Quite the other way , in fact .
" You may think you enlighten me , but you are leading me deeper in the dark .
Why does our brigand - courier call this his chief fortress and the Paradise of Thieves ?
I think it would be the worst fortress in the world .
It is something else ; it has some other strange sort of importance ; some value that I do not understand .
It is more like an accidental theatre or a natural green - room ; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy ; it is like ...."
The brigands swayed and huddled , cursing and whispering , and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols , or loosened their knives , or trailed their scabbards over the stones .
Now for freedom and a blow for it !
" I won ' t have it ," said the banker in a choking voice ; " I command you not to interfere .
" It is useless ," said the older man , who was trembling violently , " it is useless .
We must submit to our lot .
Muscari meanwhile , without waiting for support , had crested the bank up to the road , and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder , causing him to stagger and swing round .
"
" Nothing is coming up the road ," argued Muscari , " except the rescue .
" Well , you go over there ," said his adviser , " and be ready to rescue her from the rescue .
" Why , that was hours ago ," cried his son in astonishment : " when you were robbed of two thousand pounds .
"
The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across the green hollow .
" You ' ll get into trouble , too ," he said , " if you play these tricks .
Passing on , the policeman halted before the Harrogate group and said : " Samuel Harrogate , I arrest you in the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and Huddersfield Bank .
Change , bustle and new things every morning .
The Duel of Dr Hirsch
They were both atheists , with a depressing fixity of outlook but great mobility of exposition .
To their party throughout Europe , however , Paul Hirsch was a saint of science .
Beneath this was the entrance into a kind of court , gay with shrubs and tiles , into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated talk .
I cannot meet him myself .
I cannot : I will not .
The shrubs under the archway swayed and burst apart , as that unwelcome guest was shot out of them like a cannon - ball .
The man ' s shoulders were big and broad , but his legs were neat and active in knee - breeches and knitted stockings .
God help me , that is why I am speaking !
I am Jules Dubosc , Colonel of Artillery , Belfort .
It is in his hand .
" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd .
" I went to this man in straight and civil style .
Because I will not and must not see him -- because it would be against all rules of dignity and honour to see him .
Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly , and even the Doctor ' s enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance .
Once more a few sentences were inaudible , but they could hear him say : " To my friends -- I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual , and to these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself .
I am the Duc de Valognes .
" And it is ?
It says the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink .
" You are sure the grey envelope was in the left cupboard ?
" The grey envelope -- it was a white envelope really -- was --"
Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and stared across at his companion .
" What ?
You have to know an awful lot to be wrong on every subject -- like the devil .
" I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth ," said his friend firmly .
"
" But what could it mean ?
I can ' t describe these things ; I know what I mean .
" And what has it to do with old Hirsch ?
I mean those things that make a woman refuse to dance with a man or a man to touch an investment .
You ' d expect , probably a cipher , certainly abbreviations ; most certainly scientific and strictly professional terms .
But this thing ' s elaborately simple , like a penny dreadful : ` In the purple grotto you will find the golden casket .
" I have just come from this Colonel of ours .
The face of Father Brown was commonplace , but curiously contented ; it could shine with ignorance as well as with knowledge .
" He ' s round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee , where we drove with him .
" Then he somewhat inconsequently added : " He lives a very lonely life ; he has had to do everything for himself .
The lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to be at the back of things , and look like the wrong side of the stage scenery .
A colourless , continuous wall ran down one flank of it , interrupted at intervals by dull - hued and dirt - stained doors , all shut fast and featureless save for the chalk scribbles of some passing gamin .
Vanished , like a blasted fairy !
Then he threw up his long arms and swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall , his enormous figure dark against the purple sky , like the dark tree - tops .
The Duke looked at the priest .
" cried the Duke , smiting his hip .
" They will not meet on the Day of Judgement ," said the priest .
They don ' t work .
They don ' t fight .
Wherever the one sticks out the other sinks in .
Seen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of Judas laughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell .
Nevertheless , each man knew the other , even in that inky outline ; for they were both men of striking appearance and they hated each other .
The covered passage opened at one end on one of the steep streets of the Adelphi , and at the other on a terrace overlooking the sunset - coloured river .
The other side of the passage contained two doors , one at each end .
Persons of that eminence often like to have such private exits and entrances , for meeting friends or avoiding them .
Not , however , with equal speed ; but the man who walked fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel , so they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at the same instant .
In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither could be called inferior .
Fashion could have found no fault with his high silk hat --, yet it was unlike anyone else ' s hat -- a little higher , perhaps , and adding something to his natural height .
Indeed , in the wild school of caricature then current , Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as a proposition in the fourth book of Euclid .
Yet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour .
It was fitted and filled with looking - glasses at every angle of refraction , so that they looked like the hundred facets of one huge diamond -- if one could get inside a diamond .
She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and peacock blue satins , that gleamed like blue and green metals , such as delight children and aesthetes , and her heavy , hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men , but especially to boys and to men growing grey .
She accepted some flowers from Cutler , which were as tropical and expensive as his victories ; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour , offered later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman .
It was made of brass like all the Heroic weapons , but , oddly enough , sharp enough to prick anyone still .
" Aurora ," he began , in that deep voice like a drum of passion that had moved so many audiences , " will you --"
The presence of the one man who did not care about her increased Miss Rome ' s sense that everybody else was in love with her , and each in a somewhat dangerous way : the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt child ; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will rather than mind ; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening concentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby ; nay , even the abject Parkinson , who had known her before her triumphs , and who followed her about the room with eyes or feet , with the dumb fascination of a dog .
The man like a black wooden Noah ( who was not wholly without shrewdness ) noted it with a considerable but contained amusement .
Bruno , the big actor , was so babyish that it was easy to send him off in brute sulks , banging the door .
As to old Seymour , he had to be treated differently ; he had to be left to the last .
The only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend , to let him into the secret of the clearance .
" I must show this stupid man where to go ," said Aurora in a whisper to Seymour , and ran out to the threshold to speed the parting guest .
The dresser went round the room , pulling out looking - glasses and pushing them in again , his dingy dark coat and trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear of King Oberon .
Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him -- calculating the angles of the mirrors , the angles of each refraction , the angle at which each must fit into the wall ... when he heard a strong but strangled cry .
At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room , white as ivory .
" Where ' s that dagger of mine ?
It ran along the passage like a path of gold , and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of green and gold , with her dead face turned upwards .
The Captain ' s hand hesitated and dropped ; and the other added with the same icy candour : " If I find I haven ' t the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink .
"
" said the constable confidentially to Cutler .
" And he stood looking down at old Parkinson , who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair .
" We are all dead ," said Seymour in a strange voice , looking down the road .
So vast was the excitement that for some weeks the Press really told the truth ; and the reports of examination and cross - examination , if interminable , even if intolerable are at least reliable .
The wound was just over the heart , and she had died instantly .
When the doctor first saw her she could hardly have been dead for twenty minutes .
Some official detective evidence followed , chiefly concerned with the presence or absence of any proof of a struggle ; the only suggestion of this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder , and this did not seem to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow .
Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did at all -- not only well , but perfectly .
The passage is of such length that anyone in the middle of it appears quite black against the light at the other end .
Was it , for instance , like the figure of the murdered woman ?
" What did it look like to you ?
" It looked to me ," replied the witness , " like a tall man .
"
Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face , smoothing his black silk robes , and white silk whiskers .
" I ' m afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers ," he said .
" So you did think at first it was a woman ?
Seymour looked troubled for the first time .
" It is hardly a point of fact ," he said , " but if his lordship would like me to answer for my impression , of course I shall do so .
" Thank you ," said Mr Butler , K . C ., and sat down suddenly , as if he had got what he wanted .
" Perhaps I oughtn ' t to have said that ," he said ; " but when the brute has huge humped shoulders like a chimpanzee , and bristles sticking out of its head like a pig --"
" A woman ' s !
" Or again , he may not ," said Mr Butler , and sat down suddenly for the second time .
Well , what shape was it ?
" No ," said the priest dispassionately ; " I know who it was .
"
They had forgotten the figure in the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage .
" And then , without stopping , he shot at Brown the apparently disconnected question : " You have heard about this dagger ; you know the experts say the crime was committed with a short blade ?
And spears catch at the end of the steel just like daggers , if they ' re that sort of fancy spear they had in theatres ; like the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with , just when she ' d sent for me to settle their family troubles -- and I came just too late , God forgive me !
The general impression in court was that the little priest , who was gobbling away , had literally gone mad in the box .
How do you account for signs of struggle , like the dress dragged off the shoulder ?
" repeated the barrister in a curious voice .
" Yes , my lord ," said Father Brown .
"
"
You know what I mean ; they put a pulsometer on a man ' s wrist and judge by how his heart goes at the pronunciation of certain words .
"
I saw the thing done once and I ' ve never believed in it since .
All our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner , in which Last - Trick Todd , at his palatial home at Pilgrim ' s Pond , caused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger than their years .
Lord Falconroy ' s travels began before his ancient feudal title was resurrected , he was in the Republic in his youth , and fashion murmurs a sly reason for his return .
"
"
" Well , does that interest you ?
The paragraph was headed " Savage Murder of a Warder .
The unfortunate officer had , however , been hurled from the high wall , his brains beaten out as with a club , and his gun was missing .
"
" inquired Usher .
" Why , how did your men get hold of him ?
By the light of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road ; running with his body bent and at a good mile - race trot .
He appeared to be much exhausted ; but when he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders ' webs ; -- or rather ( for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets ) as if he himself were made of stone .
"
It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change his convict clothes for some confederate ' s clothes which did not fit him .
Second , there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running ; so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair , if the hair had not been very short .
"
" He had no gun ," said the other gravely ; " but that was doubtless due to some very natural mischance or change of plans .
" Well , that is possible enough ," answered the priest .
" And Greywood Usher threw down the newspapers and took up the two press - cuttings again .
" Well , since you are so obstinate ," he said , " let ' s begin at the beginning .
" Yes ; I know that .
Petroleum , I think .
He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking in his expansive , radiantly explanatory style .
So it looked to me , till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me .
I crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion , and which was fortunately split in places , as if specially for the application of a cautious eye .
I was about to climb the fence and follow , when I realized that the detective fever that had lured me into the adventure was rather undignified ; and that in a more authoritative capacity I already held all the cards in my hand .
There is no reason why anybody in America should want to kill an English lord newly landed , except for the one reason mentioned in the pink paper -- that the lord is paying his attentions to the millionaire ' s daughter .
Our crop - haired friend , despite his ill - fitting clothes , must be an aspiring lover .
You don ' t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift .
"
" I reckon you ' ll be shocked ," replied Greywood Usher , " as I know you don ' t cotton to the march of science in these matters .
Who else in this republic has any reason to jump at the name of a newly - arrived Englishman like Falconroy except the man who ' s shot him ?
" asked the detective .
How do you know , if you come to that , that he did not observe your manner ?
"
I should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody .
He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement .
His clothes were ill - fitting , as I ' ve said , but they were rather better , if anything , than those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged .
" Then , sir , the machine was on its trial ; and the machine was right .
If you must know all about me --'
I have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct .
Her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea - shooter .
If I had never heard the words , I should have known by the very shock upon his features that the so - called Oscar Rian had heard his real name .
Then came one case where the girl was found dead ; but deliberation could not quite be proved , and , what was more practical still , the criminal could not be found .
Well , there is your innocent man , and there is his innocent record .
" demanded the other .
I don ' t know what you people are made of .
Let it be granted -- let us admit , for the sake of argument , that he did all this .
He didn ' t explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder .
There burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags , with a greasy squash hat still askew on his head , and a shabby green shade shoved up from one of his eyes , both of which were glaring like a tiger ' s .
" See here , old man Usher ," shouted the being in the red handkerchief , " I ' m getting tired .
Keep him here for a split instant and you ' ll feel pretty mean .
I reckon I ' m not a man with no pull .
Sounds paradoxical , I know .
"
" Now , see here ," vociferated the stranger , striking the table , but speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding .
" I won ' t let you in .
" I think the gentleman ' s name is Todd ," said the priest .
" I fear you don ' t read the Society papers properly ," he said , and began to read out in a monotonous voice , "` Or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city ' s gayest leaders ; but there is talk of a pretty parody of the manners and customs of the other end of Society ' s scale .
"
He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne , from which he ran away in such a hurry , when the convict with the gun hove in sight .
" Why , look here , Mr Usher ," said Father Brown quietly , " you said the machine couldn ' t make a mistake ; and in one sense it didn ' t .
But the other machine did ; the machine that worked it .
You assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy , because he was Lord Falconroy ' s murderer .
He jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy .
" demanded the staring Usher .
" He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician ," replied the priest , " so he tried to keep the name back at first .
" Don ' t stay talking to this lunatic !
" Take me to my friend .
"
The pilgrim walking down it begins to think he will never come to a break or a corner ; but there is one exception -- a very small one , but hailed by the pilgrim almost with a shout .
There is a sort of mews between two of the tall mansions , a mere slit like the crack of a door by comparison with the street , but just large enough to permit a pigmy ale - house or eating - house , still allowed by the rich to their stable - servants , to stand in the angle .
" repeated Flambeau .
" I haven ' t a notion ," answered Father Brown .
I only want to know the direction .
Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time , with an expression between perplexity and amusement ; and then , rising from the table ; squeezed his huge form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern , and melted into the twilight .
'"
He seemed to find much food for thought in this ; but his reply was very slow and hesitant .
" You see , madam ," he said , " from outside the place looks -- well , it is a perfectly decent place -- but ladies like you don ' t -- don ' t generally think so .
" You are a most singular person ," said the young lady .
"
"
The priest smiled in his turn .
" I don ' t say it ' s the sort of nose one would wear out of mere foppery ," he admitted .
"
" But why ?
" observed Brown absent - mindedly .
"
" You are more of a mystery than all the others ," she said desperately , " but I feel there might be a heart in your mystery .
He was prouder of his Collection than of his coat - of - arms -- nobody could say more than that .
He had two sons and one daughter .
Though he had some differences with my father in early youth , no sooner had he taken over the Collection than he became like a pagan priest dedicated to a temple .
Often he would not trouble to dress for his simple meals ; but pattered about among the corded brown - paper parcels ( which no one else was allowed to touch ) in an old brown dressing - gown .
Every now and then , though , he would appear dressed like a decidedly fashionable gentleman ; but that was only when he went up to the London sales or shops to make an addition to the Carstairs Collection .
I got a lot of romance and rubbish where I got my red hair , from the other side of the family .
We lived then at a little seaside watering - place in South Wales , and a retired sea - captain living a few doors off had a son about five years older than myself , who had been a friend of Giles before he went to the Colonies .
If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face , bronzed by the sea also , it ' s not for his sake , I assure you , but for the story ; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence .
A Carstairs a thief ; and a thief of the Carstairs treasure !
Nevertheless , whatever my start sprang from was prophetic ; for , as I gazed , he started walking briskly in a bee - line towards us across the wide wet sands .
It was as if he had walked straight off a cliff and still marched steadily in mid - air .
As he stood there in the sunset - stained water he affected me as some hellish sea - monster just risen roaring out of a sea like blood .
I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse ; I was certainly alone ; for I always made sure of being unobserved when I slipped out to see Philip in this way .
'
Thus there was no one to help me in the house , except my brother , whose help must be my ruin .
In desperation I thrust two shillings into the horrid thing ' s hand , and told him to call again in a few days , when I had thought it out .
" The man or monster I ' d sent away was standing quite still in the middle of the garden .
And because his face was not pale , but had that waxen bloom still upon it that belongs to a barber ' s dummy .
" It might be best to go to Arthur after all .
What I did next does matter : I gave him all the money I had , including a good deal in paper which , though it was mine , I dare say I had no right to touch .
" Of course the superficial , on reflection ," said Flambeau , " would think first of this Australian brother who ' s been in trouble before , who ' s come back so suddenly and who ' s just the man to have shabby confederates .
" asked his companion patiently .
" Unless the girl ' s lover comes in , too , and he would be the blacker villain .
" this Hawker hears his love insulted , but doesn ' t strike till he ' s got to the soft sand - hills , where he can be victor in a mere sham - fight .
Why shouldn ' t it work ?
"
He spoke , nevertheless , with a sort of despairing dignity .
But it was too late .
In dead silence Flambeau strode across and telephoned for doctor and police .
An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor .
"
And that , by the way , is why she had that supernatural guess when he was away on the sand - dunes .
VII .
A letter from one of these lay immediately before him , and rapid and resolute as he was , he seemed almost to hesitate before opening it .
He took up a strip of proof instead , ran down it with a blue eye , and a blue pencil , altered the word " adultery " to the word " impropriety ," and the word " Jew " to the word " Alien ," rang a bell and sent it flying upstairs .
Then , with a more thoughtful eye , he ripped open the letter from his more distinguished contributor , which bore a postmark of Devonshire , and read as follows :
By the end of the week I think I can get you the truth about it .-- Yours ever , FRANCIS FINN .
I know that journalism largely consists in saying " Lord Jones Dead " to people who never knew that Lord Jones was alive .
As for the headlines , the sensational proclamations -- they will come at the end .
Now that I know them all better , there is no difficulty about disentangling the impressions ; but just then they looked like three very solid ghosts .
And all this red roll of impieties came from his thin , genteel lips rather primly than otherwise , as he sat sipping the wine out of his tall , thin glass .
And the little priest at the other end of the - table , though free from any such air of embarrassment , looked steadily at the table , and seemed to listen to the recital with great pain -- as well as he might .
" And with that he crushed a piece of the fallen glass under his heel , and strode away among the green twilight of the twinkling apple - trees .
Who is he ?
My name is Brown .
" He seems really to believe ," answered the priest called Brown , " that they have left a curse on him .
"
" I ' ve heard of it , of course , but surely it must be a superstitious yarn spun out of something much simpler .
The big librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands , like a man trying to think out his duty .
He must have a footman to carry his walking - stick ; a body servant to hold up his opera - glasses --"
" No ," replied Dr Mull quite simply ; " and yet that is just what I mean by saying you are unjust to him after all .
"
" I am glad of that ," he said , " for now I can take the whole estate .
But no man shall see mine and live .
But Mull swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer , after shaking his knotted fists in the air for an instant , simply ran from the room and never reappeared in the countryside ; and since then Exmoor has been feared more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate .
"
It began with the words :
Father Brown had picked up one of the lemons and was eyeing it with an odd pleasure .
" What a lovely colour a lemon is !
There never was hair of that colour in this world .
"
The little man ' s voice changed so suddenly , he shut his hand so sharply , and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter like a waking owl ' s , that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion on the table .
" Father Brown ," he said , " Doctor Mull informs me that you have come here to make a request .
Whatever I retain of the gentleman made me stand up .
All over this country I have found hundreds , even of my own faith and flock , whose imaginations are poisoned by the spell which I implore you to break .
I could see the librarian ' s great legs wavering under him like the shadows of stems in a pool ; and I could not banish from my own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were filling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds .
If I gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror I have to bear alone , you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine and begging to know no more .
"
"
DEAR FINN ,-- You must be mad ; we can ' t touch this .
" He heard Flambeau say to Fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes open and be spry .
For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle , and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly , he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby .
It was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked - glass slide seems to have been slid away from between us and Nature ; so that even dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours on cloudier days .
This magic clearness and intensity in the colours was further forced on Brown ' s slowly reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape .
There were one or two windows , which appeared to be coloured and leaded in an old - fashioned but more elaborate style .
" said Flambeau , who was still staring at the tower .
" Aha !
It was built by the Pendragons in the very days of the Spanish wars ; and though it ' s needed patching and even rebuilding for another reason , it ' s always been rebuilt in the old way .
With that he dived under the wave , and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards .
" There ' s that girl in the canoe again ," said Flambeau irrelevantly , for good - looking young women would call him off any topic .
Well , here ' s the landing stage ; let ' s come ashore and see the old boy .
The tower , as they left it behind , looked all the quainter , because such entrances are usually flanked by two towers ; and this one looked lopsided .
Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway , and a great gap of dark coppice gaped in the paling .
" My dear Admiral !
" he exclaimed , " do you -- er -- do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go for a walk ?
But I ' ll only carve another bit off the front door , and then come out and welcome you .
And sure enough , he heaved up his weapon once more , and , hacking twice , brought down another and similar strip of fence , making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all .
His eyes were prominent and piercing .
When I remember how I ' ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this ; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood , because of some confounded old bargain scribbled in a family Bible , why , I --"
"
The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds , one of red tulips , a second of yellow tulips , and the third of some white , waxen - looking blossoms that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic .
The corners of the expiring sunset which seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses here and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds ; and in a treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope .
Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted green garden table , as if someone had just had tea there .
Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement .
" But it seems rather odd ," said Flambeau , " that it should exactly confirm the old legend .
And a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt ; but that alone , if seriously examined , would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really go .
" It so happens ," replied his host coolly , " that there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family .
"
But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering , and he said hastily : " But , Admiral , what ' s that hissing noise quite near the island ?
The priest ' s instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that the colour and the little neat coat - tails of these bipeds had suggested the word " Canary ," and so by a mere pun connected them with southward travel .
I don ' t ask for curiosity , but really for my guidance and your convenience .
You won ' t understand , I suppose , unless I tell you the story .
You see , my father had two sons ; I remained a bachelor , but my elder brother married , and had a son who became a sailor like all the rest of us , and will inherit the proper estate .
But , of course , it set this forest of superstition on fire ; and men saw the flaming tower everywhere .
That ' s why I say it will be all right when Walter returns .
I most sincerely beg your pardon ": for he had spilt a small spot of wine on the table - cloth .
"
But it seems to me you are not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be .
" You do it at your own peril ," he said ; " but wouldn ' t you be an atheist to keep sane in all this devilry ?
" If I could find a spud or something I ' d do it myself .
"
" The mist ' s rising from the river ," said the staring Flambeau .
The tower was quite close , but its outline was curiously dim .
" By the Lord it has ," cried Fanshaw , who was very white .
" But you can ' t mean --"
This story is going to end in smoke .
" This is rather a curious kind of tower ," observed Father Brown , " when it takes to killing people , it always kills people who are somewhere else .
When the priest heard the voice , a terrible change came over his countenance .
He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim , and attended to no other business , knowing only by the noise and that semi - conscious corner of the eye , the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden .
He never turned his head to look at the strange fight that followed between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire .
He heard the crashing fall ; and his friend ' s gasp of triumph as he dashed on to the first negro ; and the cries of both the blacks as Flambeau and Fanshaw bound them .
He heard also the water broken by the paddles of a canoe ; the girl ' s voice giving orders , the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer , the plumping and sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream ; and finally the sound of many feet around the fire .
Then , finding them closing in on every side , the figure sprang upon one of the higher river banks and disappeared with a splash into the dark and driving river .
"
The fire hissed and shrieked more and more , like a strangled thing , as it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets , but Father Brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking :
" I thought of asking this young lady , if it were morning yet , to look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river .
Don ' t let ' s talk about anything .
" And that ," said Flambeau , " is how the father and brother died .
He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished ; and then refused to linger , though he actually heard young Pendragon , escorted by an enthusiastic crowd , come tramping up the river bank ; and might ( had he been moved by romantic curiosities ) have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe .
That ' s just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart .
" Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will think it ' s a specimen .
Put the same feather with a ribbon and an artificial flower and everyone will think it ' s for a lady ' s hat .
But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things .
"
They try to revive these places in the winter , but it never succeeds except with Brighton and the old ones .
"
But there was something fantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about the gold that haunted Flambeau as well as his friend with some association he could not capture , but which he knew was at once artistic and alien .
"
" Let ' s have a look at the god .
" Oh , very well ," said Flambeau , laughing ; and the next instant his own towering figure was visible on that quaint elevation .
It seemed to come from lower down than might have been expected , and to be addressed to his heels rather than his head .
" I have found what was sometimes more important .
Father Brown jumped off the bandstand , his friend following ; and as they walked in the direction indicated the trees fell away to right and left , and they saw a small , rather flashy hotel , such as is common in resorts -- the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than the Bar Parlour .
" So you are the proprietor ?
"
"
" Sherry , sir -- certainly ," said their host , turning to his hostel .
" My cook !
He will be starting presently .
But somehow something in the contrast of colour and caste increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor should answer the call of the cook , and not the cook the call of the proprietor .
He opened his mouth to speak , and then shut it again .
" What was he like ?
As has been said , the hotel - keeper can be proved to have told the precise truth .
But somehow the black man was like the black hat .
He also was black , and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more .
And in the way he carried his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude -- an attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices : something innocent and insolent -- the cake walk .
It was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children ' s comforters with a safety - pin .
Then he made a movement of blinding swiftness .
It startled him more than the small and distant detonation that had come just before .
It was not until nearly two miles farther on that he set his small companion down .
" Not so sure he was murdered ?
" queried his companion .
Do you feel sure a wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely ?
" Be careful , you know , about the ropes after the fourth -- Well , and what do you want , I wonder !
" he cried .
Weren ' t there parsons in the old days , when they fought without gloves ?
"
" I didn ' t mean either of the boxers ," said the little priest .
I never could see anything wrong about prize - fights .
" Anything else ?
" And what do you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it ?
" I say there will be one thousand nine - hundred and ninety - nine of them left alive when they have seen it ," said Father Brown .
Give your message .
And see whether it is Malvoli who answers .
" asked Lord Pooley abruptly .
"` In which Voodoo ,'" repeated the reader , almost with relish , "` is widely organized outside Jamaica itself is in the form known as the Monkey , or the God of the Gongs , which is powerful in many parts of the two American continents , especially among half - breeds , many of whom look exactly like white men .
You steal a coloured gentleman ' s prize -- prize his already -- yo ' think yo ' jes ' save that white ' Talian trash --"
" Who you to --" shouted Nigger Ned , beginning to storm .
" Who this fellow ?
I think you ought to tell me more about this .
" I think we know all that this can tell us , but you shall look at it to see if I ' m right .
There was a silence , and the little man went on .
He only said : " If you want to murder somebody , I should advise it .
It must mean empty spaces round him , and they are just what make him obvious .
Have you never walked along a cliff , and seen one man walking along the sands ?
No !
" But what other plan is there ?
"
A man is throttled close by the big stand at Epsom .
And here , of course , when the knock - out blow came -- it would not be the only one .
Almost on every hand the secret of their purpose perished with them .
He turned back and went in at the garden gate , making for the front door .
Round the corner of this came a figure , at first a mere shadow in the haze , apparently bending and peering about .
"
"
The figure was much longer , leaner , and more athletic ; the pyjamas , though equally tropical , were comparatively tasteful , being of white with a light lemon - yellow stripe .
The man was haggard , but handsome , more sunburned than the other ; he had an aquiline profile and rather deep - sunken eyes , and a slight air of oddity arising from the combination of coal - black hair with a much lighter moustache .
For the moment he only saw one thing about the man ; which was the revolver in his hand .
" Yes , I did ," retorted the black - haired gentleman hotly ; " and so would you in my place .
" Nor I ," said Father Brown faintly .
It was common enough , at that time of the morning , to find the remains of a banquet over - night ; but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual .
" he gasped .
Even the old silver cream - jug gone .
" They ' re simply a blind ," said Cray stubbornly .
By the time he came round to the garden door again he found a group there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the sunlight had already rolled away the mists .
The only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette was his friend Cray -- and as Brown remembered this , he turned to look for the other officer .
In the new presence of daylight and people clothed and in their right mind , the sight of him was rather a shock .
Seeing him thus quadrupedal in the grass , the priest raised his eyebrows rather sadly ; and for the first time guessed that " fancies things " might be an euphemism .
The third item in the group of the cook and the epicure was also known to Father Brown ; it was Audrey Watson , the Major ' s ward and housekeeper ; and at this moment , to judge by her apron , tucked - up sleeves and resolute manner , much more the housekeeper than the ward .
"
For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking so decisively was rather comic than tragic .
" Well !
" And I incline to think you are not .
" What do you mean ?
But you are trying to find traces of the burglar ; even when there aren ' t any .
You want what no madman ever wants .
" They are all at me here that the fellow was only after the silver -- as if I shouldn ' t be only too pleased to think so !
After a pause he said : " Look here , I ' ve never seen you before ; but you shall judge of the whole story .
Old Putnam and I were friends in the same mess ; but , owing to some accidents on the Afghan border , I got my command much sooner than most men ; only we were both invalided home for a bit .
Curious things .
So do you .
" Well , these are the facts .
But this seemed to say that the devilry was over all the earth .
" The first happened in an Indian village on the edge of the jungle , but hundreds of miles from the temple , or town , or type of tribes and customs where the curse had been put on me .
I woke in black midnight , and lay thinking of nothing in particular , when I felt a faint tickling thing , like a thread or a hair , trailed across my throat .
I woke again in the dark with a sensation that could not be put in colder or more literal words than that a breath bit like an adder .
We were in a fortress there ; and as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea , which almost came up to our window - sills , save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea .
But it had come from no human hand .
" This is more so , I know ," he said , laying his hand on the big book he had dropped , " a dictionary of drugs and such things .
" I suppose ," said the priest , who seemed anxious to change the subject , " all these spears and things are from India ?
As one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries , accompanied with their appropriate vintages , were laid before the other two , he only repeated that it was one of his fast - days , and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted a tumbler of cold water .
" Unfortunately it ' s the only thing we have got ," answered the good - humoured Major .
" A mustard plaster , I suppose .
Before he could quite recover himself Cray had cloven in .
"
" Pretty near ," said Brown , with the shadow of a smile ; for the emetic had very suddenly taken effect .
" he cried hoarsely .
"
There is only one weapon that will bring blood with that mere feathery touch : a razor held by a white man .
He was the emissary in England of the colossal American daily called the Western Sun -- also humorously described as the " Rising Sunset ".
For while the journalism of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English , it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems , of which English papers are innocent , or rather incapable .
The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most farcical way .
" You ' re a journalist , aren ' t you ?
"
" I ' ve come to see Mrs Boulnois ," replied the other .
" Are you interested in Catastrophism ?
His face was pale and dissipated , with the promise of formidable passions yet to be loosed ; but it was a clever and sensitive face ; his clothes were coarse and careless , but he had a good seal ring on one of his long , thin fingers .
Dalroy had come down , it seemed , to snuff up the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court , but which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park .
Such , according to Dalroy ' s account , was nevertheless the fact .
" He is a man of grand intellectual powers ," said Calhoun Kidd in a deep voice .
" Yes ," answered Dalroy ; " but even a man of grand intellectual powers can ' t be such a blighted fool as all that .
" Do you know where he went to ?
" Did he go with Mrs -- with the rest of the party ?
" But perhaps he ' s gone over to make a row .
"
He was a man with more literary than direct natural associations ; the word " Ravenswood " came into his head repeatedly .
But there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious .
Above him , at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden , was one of those small picturesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening ; a kind of small round hill or dome of grass , like a giant mole - hill , ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses , and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre .
The moonlight discoloured everything , against Dalroy ' s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green .
" In one sense ," drawled the representative of the Sun .
" Does Mrs Boulnois know ?
" I have not told her ," said the doctor gruffly --, " but here come the police .
But the little priest only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine , and at last stopped dead , on the steps of the house .
It was his silent way of acknowledging an equally silent approach ; for there came towards him a presence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd ' s demands for a lovely and aristocratic ghost .
He did not answer the question , but asked another : " Have you seen your husband ?
"
" Father Brown ," said the lady , " I am going to tell you all I know , but I want you to do me a favour first .
" At least , one ' s very trivial and the other very vague .
He turned his blank , round face up to the stars and continued absentmindedly : " To take the vague idea first .
I attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas .
It ' s more like Champion .
" Ah !
" There were finger - prints on that sword ; finger - prints can be detected quite a time after they are made if they ' re on some polished surface like glass or steel .
At all enemies except one .
" Except one ," she repeated .
"
" Oneself .
" I don ' t believe ," she said , " he ever cared about me a rap .
"
" Why ?
" He hated my husband because ... it is so strange I hardly know how to say it ... because ..."
" Yes ?
My husband has never been celebrated or successful ; and it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so .
But he couldn ' t be got to conceive the notion of envying Champion .
"
" Oh , don ' t you see ?
'"
Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own love and honour which has been the talk of the shire .
Her bright eyes widened to an almost electric glare ; and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear .
" she cried .
" All the servants were out of the house , seeing the theatricals .
Father Brown started and spun half round like an absurd teetotum .
" What , what ?
" he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life .
"
" Oh , the servants will be back by now ," she said , wondering .
" Right , right !
John Boulnois was a big , slow - moving man with a massive head , partly grey and partly bald , and blunt , burly features .
" I won ' t keep you long from ` The Bloody Thumb ' or any other catastrophic affairs ," said Father Brown , smiling .
" I only came to ask you about the crime you committed this evening .
" I can ' t analyse myself well ," went on Boulnois ; " but sitting in that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy on a half - holiday .
Then that bell rang , and I thought for one long , mortal minute that I couldn ' t get out of that chair -- literally , physically , muscularly couldn ' t .
I remembered the Yankee interviewer I had forgotten .
His hair was parted in the middle , and I tell you that murder --"
But he never composed anything in the form of fiction , unless it be the tale that follows :
And there ' s worse than that .
"
" asked Brown in some wonder .
Wolves with the hair of the ermine , Crows that are crowned and kings -- These things be many as vermin , Yet Three shall abide these things .
His friend looked at him in some surprise .
" Perhaps you know as much about it as I do .
Yes , and of all the men who played parts in that drama .
He multiplied the ordinary daily and nightly guard round his castle till there seemed to be more sentry - boxes than houses in the town , and doubtful characters were shot without mercy .
It was carried out , with extraordinary thoroughness and severity , by very well - organized officials over a small and familiar area , and , so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything , Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein .
People have been murdered with the mildest domestic comforts ; certainly with tea - kettles , probably with tea - cosies .
On the other hand , if you showed an Ancient Briton a revolver , I doubt if he would know it was a weapon -- until it was fired into him , of course .
Anyhow , the deputation of distinguished geologists and mineralogists from Paris and Berlin were there in the most magnificent and appropriate dress , for there are no men who like wearing their decorations so much as the men of science -- as anybody knows who has ever been to a soiree of the Royal Society .
When it did open it was empty , too .
And even as he did so he heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long rooms and corridors without .
Before he could be lifted he was dead .
"
" Yes ," replied Flambeau .
The foreign visitors , especially the mining experts , were in the wildest doubt and excitement , as well as many important Prussian officials , and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed .
" Of course ," said the priest , " when a grown up girl is really picking flowers , she picks them with plenty of stalk .
" he demanded .
" Hold on !
What a queer way of killing a man ; but I suppose it was the only one possible .
" demanded the other .
" They killed him with the sash ," said Brown carefully ; and then , as Flambeau protested : " Yes , yes , I know about the bullet .
" I said by his own orders .
Father Brown laughed .
For this and only this he had bought the traitor and butchered the hero , for this he had long questioned and cross - questioned the false Chamberlain , until he had come to the conclusion that , touching his ignorance , the renegade really told the truth .
" Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which he was making his way , among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs above the town , stood the hermitage , hardly more than a cavern fenced with thorn , in which the third of the great brethren had long hidden himself from the world .
He , thought Prince Otto , could have no real reason for refusing to give up the gold .
" The old man in the black gown had hitherto continued to gaze at him with watery blue eyes and a sort of weak wisdom in his face .
Let him cease to speak .
Consequently , he was ill acquainted with the emotion of surprise , and ill prepared for the next movement , which startled and stiffened him .
He had opened his mouth to answer the hermit , when the mouth was stopped and the voice strangled by a strong , soft gag suddenly twisted round his head like a tourniquet .
Perhaps his reason had been suddenly unseated by the unnatural captivity he carried with him , but in that wood he felt something unfathomably German -- the fairy tale .
He knew with half his mind that he was drawing near to the castle of an ogre -- he had forgotten that he was the ogre .
Carefully trying to place it in his scarf , he heard the halloo , ` Who goes there ?
The second challenge came ; and then a shot that shrieked as it came and then was stilled suddenly by impact .
He was a private named Schwartz , since not unknown in his profession , and what he found was a bald man in uniform , but with his face so bandaged by a kind of mask made of his own military scarf that nothing but open , dead eyes could be seen , glittering stonily in the moonlight .
She remained by the body and gave the alarm ; and there was nothing to connect her with the disaster either , since she had not got , and could not have , any firearms .
[ The Man Who Was Thursday by G . K . Chesterton 1908 ]
They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named : Men were ashamed of honour ; but we were not ashamed .
This is a tale of those old fears , even of those emptied hells , And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells -- Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash , Of what huge devils hid the stars , yet fell at a pistol flash .
But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague , its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable .
A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy .
And this was strongest of all on one particular evening , still vaguely remembered in the locality , of which the auburn - haired poet was the hero .
He was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance , which he worked , as the phrase goes , for all it was worth .
It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism .
But an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked .
I only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden .
" Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ?
" It is you who are unpoetical ," replied the poet Syme .
We feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird .
Chaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad .

Gregory ' s big bull ' s eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion , and one could almost fancy that his red mane rose .

Syme broke into a great laugh , that seemed too large for his slight and somewhat dandified figure .
And at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile , and she thought with a simultaneous pleasure of Gregory ' s absurdity and of his safety .
And it is always the humble man who talks too much ; the proud man watches himself too closely .
He stared and talked at the girl ' s red hair and amused face for what seemed to be a few minutes ; and then , feeling that the groups in such a place should mix , rose to his feet .
He left with a sense of champagne in his head , which he could not afterwards explain .
Then he realised ( in some odd way ) that the silence was rather a living silence than a dead one .
Only a fringe of fiery hair against the light , and also something aggressive in the attitude , proclaimed that it was the poet Gregory .
" I was waiting for you ," said Gregory .
There is your precious order , that lean , iron lamp , ugly and barren ; and there is anarchy , rich , living , reproducing itself -- there is anarchy , splendid in green and gold .
I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the light of the tree .
" Then after a pause he said , " But may I ask if you have been standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument ?
You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever succeeded in doing before .
The captain of a penny steamer ( if I remember correctly ) at Southend .
"
"
"
"
" You will promise me in return ?
" Syme suddenly took off his hat .
" I think ," said Gregory , with placid irrelevancy , " that we will call a cab .
"
The room was so small and dark , that very little could be seen of the attendant who was summoned , beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and bearded .
Do let me start you with a half - bottle of Pommery at least ?
" I don ' t often have the luck to have a dream like this .
It is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster .
Ah , here comes your champagne !
We are the most modest men that ever lived on earth .
"
"
It was an enormous crimson lantern , nearly as big as a fireplace , fixed over a small but heavy iron door .
To this he gave the more or less unexpected reply , " Mr . Joseph Chamberlain .
" The heavy hinges began to move ; it was obviously some kind of password .
Inside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of steel .
" Oh , don ' t apologise ," said Syme .
Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you here .
You need not fear to give me information , because , as you remember , you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the police , a promise I shall certainly keep .
Nor do they believe me .
I was nabbed at once .
Then I made up as a millionaire ; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor .
Now I am a humanitarian myself , but I have , I hope , enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who , like Nietzsche , admire violence -- the proud , mad war of Nature and all that , you know .
"
He was silent and even pale for a moment , and then resumed --
" But whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an epigram , and yet as practical as the Bank of England .
He suddenly lifted his lion ' s voice .
" It is really a smart dodge .
Then after a pause he added --
"
" My dear fellow .
this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my life , and I am going to act accordingly .
" Your secret ?
" You must have bewitched me , but I feel a furious curiosity about you .
"
Gregory tried to spring up straight , but he swayed thrice .
BEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway , Gregory ' s stunned surprise had fallen from him .
Syme did not flinch , but he put up a pale and polite hand .
Yes , and jolly sea - sick .
" Don ' t you see we ' ve checkmated each other ?
You can ' t tell the anarchists I ' m a policeman .
In short , it ' s a lonely , intellectual duel , my head against yours .
" Comrade Gregory ," he said , " I suppose this man is a delegate ?
" I am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate .
Evidently the awful President , whose name was Sunday , did sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings .
He was , indeed , in an agony of diplomacy .
It was clear that Syme ' s inspired impudence was likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas .
After all , it was only one night ' s discussion , and only one detective who would know of it .
I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair .
This being approved by a show of hands , the little man with the papers slipped into the presidential seat .
He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which , under happier circumstances , ought to have killed everybody on the pier .
But it is not to acclaim his virtues that we are met , but for a harder task .
" I move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday ," and sat lumberingly down again .
He believed in his own literary power , his capacity for suggesting fine shades and picking perfect words .
What tales were told of their atrocities by one educated Roman to another ?
Suppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as harmless as the Christians .
Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because we are really as meek .
"'
" I say we are merciful ," repeated Gregory furiously , " as the early Christians were merciful .
" No , no !
" Which is founded upon love ," repeated Gregory , grinding his teeth , " there will be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body , or which I should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body .
Superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society , we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure , the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity .
" Does anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory ?
" Yes , Mr . Chairman , I oppose .
" he cried , in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots , " have we come here for this ?
There was not a word in Comrade Gregory ' s address to which a curate could not have listened with pleasure ( hear , hear ).
We are not murderers , we are executioners ( cheers ).
Syme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones , and said with dignity --
I do not pretend to .
To the priest who says these men are the enemies of religion , to the judge who says these men are the enemies of law , to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order and public decency , to all these I will reply , ' You are false kings , but you are true prophets .
" Stop it , it is all --"
" I am not a madman ," reiterated Gregory , with a frightful sincerity which for a moment staggered the room , " but I give you a counsel which you can call mad if you like .
No , I will not call it a counsel , for I can give you no reason for it .
But you could not have guessed it from Syme ' s bleak blue eyes .
He merely began --
Close to the opening lay a dark , dwarfish steam - launch , like a baby dragon with one red eye .
" What did I promise you ?
" A very entertaining evening ," said Syme , and he made a military salute with the sword - stick as the steamboat slid away .
He was one of those who are driven early in life into too conservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists .
He had not attained it by any tame tradition .
His hatred of modern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident .
It happened that he was walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage .
He wore an old - fashioned black chimney - pot hat ; he was wrapped in a yet more old - fashioned cloak , black and ragged ; and the combination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer Lytton .
Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards , cut and pointed , on the lawns of Saffron Park .
" A good evening is it ?
I tell you that if that were literally human blood , spilt and shining , you would still be standing here as solid as ever , looking out for some poor harmless tramp whom you could move on .
" asked Syme , wondering .
" Oh , at Harrow ," said the policeman
" For much the same reason that you abused the police ," replied the other .
It is their business to watch the beginnings of this conspiracy , not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense .
Syme ' s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity .
" he said .
We discover from a book of sonnets that a crime will be committed .
We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartle pool , and that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr . Wilks ( a smart young fellow ) thoroughly understood a triolet .
" You are not sufficiently democratic ," answered the policeman , " but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business .
But this new movement of ours is a very different affair .
We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless modern philosopher .
Bigamists respect marriage , or they would not go through the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy .
But philosophers despise marriage as marriage .
Murderers respect human life ; they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives .
It has given up its more dignified work , the punishment of powerful traitors the in the State and powerful heresiarchs in the Church .
" It is a chance not to be missed , certainly ," assented Syme , " but still I do not quite understand .
But , beastly as they are , they generally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other .
How can you talk of their leading one army or hurling one bolt .
"
The outer ring -- the main mass of their supporters -- are merely anarchists ; that is , men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness .
"
" Oh !
When they say that mankind shall be free at last , they mean that mankind shall commit suicide .
That is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols .
" How can I join you ?
" I know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment ," said the policeman , " as I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I have spoken .
" inquired Syme , with interest .
Somewhat dazed and considerably excited , Syme allowed himself to be led to a side - door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard .
" Are you the new recruit ?
" said the invisible chief , who seemed to have heard all about it .
Good day .
He put this carefully in his upper waistcoat pocket , lit a cigarette , and went forth to track and fight the enemy in all the drawing - rooms of London .
At about half - past one on a February night he found himself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames , armed with swordstick and revolver , the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists .
This was mainly due to the insane yet solid decision of that evening , though partly also to an entire change in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two hours before .
The sword - stick became almost the sword of chivalry , and the brandy the wine of the stirrup - cup .
So this inhuman landscape was only imaginative by the presence of a man really human .
To Syme ' s exaggerative mind the bright , bleak houses and terraces by the Thames looked as empty as the mountains of the moon .
The tug was worked by two men , and with much toil went comparatively slowly .
It broke like the splitting of great bars of lead , showing bars of silver ; and these had brightened like white fire when the tug , changing its onward course , turned inward to a large landing stage rather beyond Charing Cross .
As a figure he was quite conventional , clad in a silk hat and frock - coat of the more formal type of fashion ; he had a red flower in his buttonhole .
For the man remained more still than would have been natural if a stranger had come so close .
Then the man smiled , and his smile was a shock , for it was all on one side , going up in the right cheek and down in the left .
There was nothing , rationally speaking , to scare anyone about this .
Have you had any sleep ?
"
It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to him lifeless conveniences , and that his only life was hate .
Then Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant .
"
God blast your impudence !
With this they emerged out of a narrow street , and saw the early sunlight filling Leicester Square .
And this effect increased in Syme the sensation , which in many shapes he had had through the whole adventure , the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new world .
At one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous but quiet hotel , the bulk of which belonged to a street behind .
He knew it was so , with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty .
By an effort , braver than that of leaping over a cliff , he went to an empty seat at the breakfast - table and sat down .
His face was very large , but it was still possible to humanity .
He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter .
But the eyes did look out of the tangle , and they were the sad eyes of some Russian serf .
And , indeed , when Syme came in the President , with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy , was actually chaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces .
When a householder finds a man under his bed , he will probably pause to note the circumstance .
Only the individual examples will express this half - concealed eccentricity .
Syme ' s original cicerone bore the title of Monday ; he was the Secretary of the Council , and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything , except the President ' s horrible , happy laughter .
His fine face was so emaciated , that Syme thought it must be wasted with some disease ; yet somehow the very distress of his dark eyes denied this .
Then came Syme , and next a very old man , Professor de Worms , who still kept the chair of Friday , though every day it was expected that his death would leave it empty .
For the red flower in his button - hole showed up against a face that was literally discoloured like lead ; the whole hideous effect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse .
When he rose or sat down , which was with long labour and peril , something worse was expressed than mere weakness , something indefinably connected with the horror of the whole scene .
Right at the end sat the man called Saturday , the simplest and the most baffling of all .
CHAPTER VI
But there was one persistent thing which first troubled Syme and at last terrified him .
And they were always fixed on Syme .
Then there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many days .
Dynamite is not only our best tool , but our best symbol .
It expands ; it only destroys because it broadens ; even so , thought only destroys because it broadens .
" I want to do a lot of beastly things before I die .
For an instant , at least , he looked down upon all their sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace .
All was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that the barrel - organ was right .
The first to speak was Gogol , the irreconcilable , who seemed bursting with inarticulate grievance .
Zso !
" You zay you nod ' ide .
For the first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said .
I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and shocking that even the waiters upstairs ( long inured to our levities ) might hear some new seriousness in my voice .
They all moved feverishly in their seats , except Syme .
Sunday went on smoothly --
The Secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman .
" he cried , leaping .
" His name is Gogol ," said the President .
With the same flash three men sprang at his throat .
Even the Professor made an effort to rise .
The alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair , but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card .
For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table , and he could read nothing of the inscription on it , it bore a startling resemblance to the blue card in his own pocket , the card which had been given to him when he joined the anti - anarchist constabulary .
" Pathetic Slav ," said the President , " tragic child of Poland , are you prepared in the presence of that card to deny that you are in this company -- shall we say de trop ?
" said the late Gogol .
"
"
"
The Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger .
" That ' s where you fail right enough .
They meant that while Sunday could not denounce him like Gogol , he still could not trust him like the others .
Syme sat long after the rest had gone , revolving his strange position .
He had escaped a thunderbolt , but he was still under a cloud .
He could only suppose that the man ' s malady ( whatever it was ) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance .
He was not inclined , however , to feel in this case any very compassionate concern .
On the contrary , he rather congratulated himself that the Professor ' s stroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from him and leave him miles behind .
He remembered that in old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were anarchists .
Too bewildered to look back or to reason , he rushed into one of the little courts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole .
The sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow , leaving London in a darkness and oppression premature for that hour of the evening .
It seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were darkening that high place of the earth was bright .
He had a new impulse to tear out the secret of this dancing , jumping and pursuing paralytic ; and at the entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned , stick in hand , to face his pursuer .
Syme waited for him as St . George waited for the dragon , as a man waits for a final explanation or for death .
Syme was galvanised with an energy that was something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision .
I think so now .
" Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere ?
"
" Are you , or are you not , a police detective ?
" No !
Syme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside down , that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his feet .
For the last twenty - four hours the cosmos had really been upside down , but now the capsized universe had come right side up again .
" You haven ' t drunk your milk ," said Syme .
" said the other , in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt , " my milk !
Syme was staring at him with a happy curiosity .
" Why , there were three of us there !
" he cried .
" Professor ," he cried , " it is intolerable .
"
He made an effort to speak , but Syme went on in a low voice , but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation --
" Who would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear ?
Who would stoop to be fearless -- like a tree ?
" Have you any idea ," he asked , with a sort of benevolent bewilderment , " exactly where you are going ?
" Yes ," said the other in his curious , absent - minded way , " I know where he is myself .
"
" What do you mean ?
" Syme inquired .
"
Even as he stared , the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret abruptly went out , as if this black Argus had winked at him with one of his innumerable eyes .
" What do you mean ?
Without further parley , he led the way through several by - ways until they came out into the flare and clamour of the East India Dock Road .
That is why , in spite of a hundred disadvantages , the world will always return to monogamy .
But , indeed , to say that I am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression .
I am a portrait .
"
" He knows it right enough ," replied his friend cheerfully .
I made myself up into what was meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professor ' s dirty old self .
" I need hardly say there was a collision .
But I won .
Then he tried to blast my claims intellectually .
' I don ' t fancy ,' he said , ' that you could have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation , since there inheres in it the introduction of lacuna , which are an essential of differentiation .
But the people all round ( rather to my surprise ) seemed to remember them quite well , and the Professor , finding that the learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy slightly deficient in scruples , fell back upon a more popular form of wit .
' I see ,' he sneered , ' you prevail like the false pig in Aesop .
' I had no intelligent answer to this , which was quite true and rather witty .
"
I struck a sort of paralytic attitude , and cried in a high German accent , ' Yes , I am wanted -- by the oppressed of the world .
' This charge , if it was criminal at all , was certainly the lighter of the two , and I went along with the man , doubtful , but not greatly dismayed .
" BURGUNDY is a jolly thing ," said the Professor sadly , as he set his glass down .
"
" It does ," said Syme ; " but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you are really a bit worried .
"
Yes , I have rather a heavy cloud in my head .
There is a great problem to face ," and he sank his bald brow in his two hands .
" It would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter .
" Thank you ," said Syme , " you flatter me .
) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round , black head of Dr .
"
My favourite word is ' coeval '.
"' Lush ' too ," said Syme , shaking his head sagaciously , " we must have ' lush '-- word applied to grass , don ' t you know ?
" Do you imagine ," asked the Professor furiously , " that we are going to talk to Dr . Bull about grass ?
" Perfectly ," replied Syme ; " always be comic in a tragedy .
He was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness , and found his grey - bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed .
"
By the time they reached Dr . Bull ' s landing , a last window showed them a harsh , white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red , more like red clay than red cloud .
The moment he saw the garret and Dr . Bull sitting writing at a table , he remembered what the memory was -- the French Revolution .
There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against that heavy red and white of the morning .
And , indeed , if ever Death himself sat writing at a wooden table , it might have been he .
He looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in , and rose with the resilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken .
"
Dr . Bull smiled again , but continued to gaze on them without speaking .
I will , however , relate the occurrence in detail , even at the risk of losing time , if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the problem we have to discuss .
"
Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctor ' s complexion , the pattern of his tweeds , grew and expanded outrageously , as such things grow too important in a realistic novel .
"
Syme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair , and his eyes were burning feverishly .
"
Bull !
The Doctor ' s sleek and smiling head did not move , but they could have sworn that under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme .
His eyes were like stars , and for an instant he could only point without speaking .
The Professor had also started to his feet , forgetful of his supposed paralysis .
And indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene .
It was the spectacles that did it !
" It certainly does make a queer difference ," said the Professor shakily .
He pulled out his own official card and put it beside his friend ' s .
Yes , I ' m in the force right enough ," and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a matter of form .
"
" We might have fought easily ," said Bull ; " we were four against three .
We were four against One .
I hope you won ' t despise me for having been in a blue funk .
"
They said my very walk was respectable , and that seen from behind I looked like the British Constitution .
They said that if I had been a criminal , I might have made my fortune by looking so like an honest man ; but as I had the misfortune to be an honest man , there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by ever looking like a criminal .
One asked whether a bushy beard would hide my nice smile ; another said that if they blacked my face I might look like a negro anarchist ; but this old chap chipped in with a most extraordinary remark .
' A pair of smoked spectacles will do it ,' he said positively .
' And so it was , by George !
When once my eyes were covered , all the rest , smile and big shoulders and short hair , made me look a perfect little devil .
" So I did ," said Bull brightly ; " but we talked in a pitch - dark room like a coalcellar .
There , you would never have guessed that .
At the inquiry office he asked with businesslike brevity about the trains for Dover .
You see , I had to send that beast , the Marquis , over with his bomb , because the President had his eye on me , though God knows how .
Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere , smiling out of the bow - window of a club , or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus .
"
Shall we be in time to catch him ?
"
" Theoretically I ought to drown myself first .
It may be his digestion , or his conscience , or his nerves , or his philosophy of the universe , but he ' s damned , he ' s in hell !
"
We cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business ; he might swallow much in that way , but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the Czar went safely through Paris .
I am going to profit by the fact that he is a highly respected nobleman .
"
"
' The motto varies .
" Are you seasick or joking in the wrong place ?
" My remarks are almost painfully practical ," answered Syme , in an unhurried manner .
He cannot deny that I am a gentleman .
I shall say , ' The Marquis de Saint Eustache , I believe .
"
"
" But what ' s the good of it all ?
" It leads up to my challenge , don ' t you see ," said Syme , beaming .
And since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one of its parties alone ( as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen ), the only thing to be done , I suppose , is for the one party , as far as possible , to do all the dialogue by himself .
He looked across to the little table where the Marquis sat .
Besides these black , cylindrical costumes , the Marquis , in his loose straw hat and light spring clothes , looked Bohemian and even barbaric ; but he looked the Marquis .
Indeed , one might say that he looked the king , with his animal elegance , his scornful eyes , and his proud head lifted against the purple sea .
But he was no Christian king , at any rate ; he was , rather , some swarthy despot , half Greek , half Asiatic , who in the days when slavery seemed natural looked down on the Mediterranean , on his galley and his groaning slaves .
" And you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache ," he said gracefully .
" Permit me to pull your nose .
" He insulted my mother .
" But how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now ?
" said Syme darkly .
We are always being insulted about it .
" said the second gentleman .
" By George !
" said Syme , facing round and looking at him , " what a clever chap you are !
"
Syme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness .
"
For now that he came back to them he was quite sober , a little pale , and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality .
Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings .
Syme was subject to spasms of singular common sense , not otherwise a part of his character .
They were ( as he said of his impulse about the spectacles ) poetic intuitions , and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy .
But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train , not only his seconds carrying the sword - case , but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket .
He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves -- how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare , and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science .
For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe ' s foreshortened blade , and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch , vibrating like two living things , he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter , and that probably his last hour had come .
He felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him , in the grass under his feet ; he felt the love of life in all living things .
He could guess the reason of the Marquis ' s sudden madness of battle -- the Paris train was in sight .
A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the man ' s neck below the jaw .
It came out clean .
But this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy - turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him .
Anyhow , this was certain , that three times had a human sword been driven into him and made no mark .
When Syme had that thought he drew himself up , and all that was good in him sang high up in the air as a high wind sings in the trees .
He fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity , like a Mohammedan panting for Paradise .
" I want to say something .
" asked Colonel Ducroix , staring .
The Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience .
" It is rather important .
You can have no conception of how important it is to me .
He stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity , with the pasteboard proboscis still between his fingers , looking at it , while the sun and the clouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene .
" If anyone has any use for my left eyebrow ," he said , " he can have it .
The mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture .
" Will you drive me mad ?
"
" cried the other , tearing his hair , which came off easily .
" Have you all got softening of the brain , that you don ' t realise what I am ?
" What did I care about ?
"
" I regret to inform you ," said Syme with restraint , " that your remarks convey no impression to my mind .
What do you mean by saying that the train has caught you ?
It may be my literary fancy , but somehow I feel that it ought to mean something .
"
" said the Marquis , and tore off his scalp and half his face .
The Professor gave a tired gesture .
"
A secret society of anarchists is hunting us like hares ; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw a bomb through starvation or German philosophy , but a rich and powerful and fanatical church , a church of eastern pessimism , which holds it holy to destroy mankind like vermin .
How hard they hunt us you can gather from the fact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise , and to such pranks as this one by which you suffer .
" Sunday !
" cried Bull , and dropped his hat .
"
" asked Syme .
"
I tell you he has bought every trust , he has captured every cable , he has control of every railway line -- especially of that railway line !
And since you really want to know what was my objection to the arrival of that train , I will tell you .
My objection was that Sunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it .
"
" Could I know a white elephant among all those people !
by God !
It is quite true ," he added , frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little station , " it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way ; but they are not all the army that you make out .
" Oh , they ," said the new detective contemptuously ; " no they are not a very valuable force .
He has got hold of all the cables and telegraphs himself .
They turned and followed their leader , who had already struck the wood , and disappeared among the twinkling trees .
Was he wearing a mask ?
Might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin ?
" We must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea ," he said .
You ' ve got that eternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor .
Aristocrats were always anarchists , as you can see from the barons ' wars .
" Millionaires I can understand ," said Syme thoughtfully , " they are nearly all mad .
Burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration , and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils , a heavy French peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet .
" Mr . Syme is saying ," called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel , " that this man , at least , will never be an anarchist .
" I have an idea ," called out Dr . Bull suddenly ; " how much would he take to give us a lift in his cart ?
"
" You do not understand ; he would not see the meaning of generosity .
For , after all , the riddle as to where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved .
He could see them as separate human figures ; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as one man .
They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats , like any common crowd out of the streets ; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack , as would be natural in an ordinary mob .
" Yes ," replied the policeman , " that ' s discipline .
The Colonel , who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend , passed rapidly into the inn - parlour , and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment .
" May I ask you , Colonel ," he said in a low voice , " why we have come here ?
"
" My other reason for coming here ," said Ducroix soberly , " is that it is just as well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death .
"
Then he said --
By Ducroix ' s advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable form of food and wine , and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons available , they clattered away down the steep , white road .
"
" What is that noise ?
Not with all that white hair .
They breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear , and they rang the bell .
When the matter was explained to him he pooh - poohed the panic of the ex - Marquis altogether ; he said , with the solid French scepticism , that there was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising .
" Et ca ," cried out the Colonel suddenly , pointing over the other ' s shoulder , " and that is childishness , isn ' t it ?
But even at that great distance they could see something so fanatical , so unquestionable in his figure , that they knew it was the Secretary himself .
When they came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had already fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics .
They looked down the steep streets , and seemed to see a slight mist coming up from the sea .
He had leapt at once into the chauffeur ' s seat , and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused machinery .
Then there came quite suddenly a scream of scraping iron , and the car leapt forward .
' I suppose ,' I said , ' there ' s no time to get a lamp .
Was I not right when I said that Dr . Renard was worth knowing ?
" he cried .
" No ," said the other with an immovable simplicity , " the whole town would fight for them .
While they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with sudden excitement .
" Oh , the horses behind us , I suppose ," said the Colonel .
No ," said the Professor , " it is not horses , and it is not behind us .
"
There was a puzzled pause for some little time , and then the Colonel began again abruptly --
The plain people of a peaceable French town --"
The staring Colonel was long past minding satire .
" It is extraordinary ," he said , " most extraordinary .
" No ," said Inspector Ratcliffe , " we shall never get there .
" They have two rows of armed men across the road already ; I can see them from here .
" How do you know ?
" asked the professor , staring .
"
There was , indeed , a rank of dim figures running across the road , and they could not be clearly seen ; but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable Dr . Renard , in a white hat , stroking his long brown beard , and holding a revolver in his left hand .
" Of course , the dear old boy has turned out to help us .
Dr . Bull , at whom the bullets had been fired , just missing his scalp , stood quite still in the middle of the road without a sign of fear , and then turned very slowly and crawled back to the car , and climbed in with two holes through his hat .
"
The Colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation .
If you knew Renard as I do -- it ' s like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter .
" cried the Colonel , stamping .
But the impatient Colonel was already out of earshot , advancing towards the advancing enemy .
Give the Colonel a chance .
In fact , I seem to see there another friend of yours , Syme .
He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering and galloping towards them in the gloom .
He saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam of a sword , and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man ' s hair .
The others did not understand his words , but when they looked back at the street above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the corner and down the slopes after them ; and foremost of all rode the good innkeeper , flushed with the fiery innocence of the evening light .
" Whatever all this pandemonium means , I suppose the police station will help us .
That town was transfigured with uproar .
" Nonsence !
"
" cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm .
As he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry , and bullets seemed to hop like hailstones on the stones in front of them .
" The gendarmes have joined them !
" I am in the padded cell ," said Bull solidly .
There was a long silence , and then Ratcliffe said , looking out over the swollen sea , all a sort of grey purple --
We shall all be dead soon .
But Sunday must have killed him by now .
"
"
"
" No !
" asked the other , and pointed to the beach .
"
Then he turned to the Secretary , whose frightful mouth was almost foaming now , and held the lamp high with so rigid and arresting a gesture , that the man was , as it were , frozen for a moment , and forced to hear .
"
He put up his hand with an anxious authority .
But above all these matters of detail which could be explained , rose the central mountain of the matter that they could not explain .
"
"
" Why ," asked the Secretary , " for fear of bombs ?
"
" Let us have some drinks ," said Dr . Bull , after a silence .
Twenty minutes afterwards , however , he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall .
" Got whom here ?
" asked Syme impatiently .
" We are all spies !
" We ' re all spies !
" shouted Dr . Bull .
But all his councillors , who had come to vote him down , crossed that Square as if they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes .
" No , sir ," he said sternly " there has been no massacre .
The Secretary choked for a moment , and the President went on with a sort of smooth appeal --
Look at my face .
Do you know who and what we are ?
"
"
"
" There ' s one thing I ' ll tell you though about who I am .
He and Bull sprang into the cab together , the Professor and the Inspector into another , while the Secretary and the late Gogol scrambled into a third just in time to pursue the flying Syme , who was pursuing the flying President .
Sunday led them a wild chase towards the north - west , his cabman , evidently under the influence of more than common inducements , urging the horse at breakneck speed .
But Syme was in no mood for delicacies , and he stood up in his own cab shouting , " Stop thief !
At the highest ecstacy of speed , Sunday turned round on the splashboard where he stood , and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab , with white hair whistling in the wind , he made a horrible face at his pursuers , like some colossal urchin .
Syme caught the thing while instinctively warding it off , and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers .
" asked Bull , staring at the words .
Syme ' s message was , at any rate , longer , and ran as follows :--
And here there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage .
But quick as it went by , Sunday had bounded out of his cab , sprung at the fire - engine , caught it , slung himself on to it , and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures .
"
Syme had jumped down on the other side , but he still stood listening impatiently .
" Well , listen to that ," he said , " is that a dog -- anybody ' s dog ?
" The elephant !
He has run away with the elephant .
The elephant is not made by God that could run away with him if he did not consent to the elopement .
"
And even as he spoke , a final crash and roar of terror announced that the great grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens , and was careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus .
" Great Lord !
The six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the elephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the streets .
"
'
A second afterwards the string came in two just under the car , and the balloon , broken loose , floated away with the freedom of a soap bubble .
" He ' s got into it !
" and he shook his fists at the sky .
The balloon , borne by some chance wind , came right above them , and they could see the great white head of the President peering over the side and looking benevolently down on them .
" I ' m not beaten yet .
The blasted thing must come down somewhere .
" After all ," he said , " it is very beautiful !
It might hurt the old boy .
"
"
" I ' ve got it now ," cried Bull , " it was because he was so fat and so light .
Just like a balloon .
We always think of fat people as heavy , but he could have danced against a sylph .
I see now what I mean .
No , it ' s not an admiration of force , or any silly thing like that .
.
I found him smoking in a twilight room , a room with brown blind down , infinitely more depressing than the genial darkness in which our master lives .
It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life -- the deep sea lumps and protoplasm .
Do you ask me to forgive him that ?
Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind .
An absentminded man means a good - natured man .
" I don ' t think of Sunday on principle ," said Gogol simply , " any more than I stare at the sun at noonday .
"
The Professor spoke at last very slowly .
The mouth was so much by itself , that one had to think of it by itself .
Yet when I walked a little farther I found that there was no face , that the window was ten yards away , the lamp ten hundred yards , the cloud beyond the world .
Well , Sunday ' s face escaped me ; it ran away to right and left , as such chance pictures run away .
Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is quite close and another fifty miles away .
" Have you noticed an odd thing ," he said , " about all your descriptions ?
" Get on ," said Dr . Bull .
And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards , and dancing as he ran .
" It was exactly the worst instant of my life .
" It is a long game ," said the Secretary , and frowned at his broken boots .
We see everything from behind , and it looks brutal .
"
" You seem to think Pan is everything .
Syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations .
"
" Gentlemen ," he said , " my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road just by .
"
The hedges were ordinary hedges , the trees seemed ordinary trees ; yet he felt like a man entrapped in fairyland .
Along the side of these carriages stood a rank of splendid servants , all dressed in the grey - blue uniform , and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom which would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman , but rather to the officials and ambassadors of a great king .
" Is this another joke of Sunday ' s ?
Very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him .
All the six friends compared notes afterwards and quarrelled ; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place reminded them of their boyhood .
Syme , under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement , went up the large oaken stairs after the respectful attendant .
" Clothes !
Meanwhile , sir , there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant , which he hopes you will not refuse , as it is some hours before supper .
" Dressed as Thursday !
" said Syme in meditation .
" Beg pardon , sir ," said the valet , " Bible also provided for you ," and with a respectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of Genesis .
"
The whole looked like some very severe ecclesiastical vestment .
There were a thousand other such objects , however .
And long afterwards , when Syme was middle - aged and at rest , he could never see one of those particular objects -- a lamppost , or an apple tree , or a windmill -- without thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of masquerade .
Gogol and Dr . Bull were already in their seats ; the Professor was just mounting to his .
He lay back in his chair with a broad smile , the picture of an optimist in his element .
"
For a long time -- it seemed for hours -- that huge masquerade of mankind swayed and stamped in front of them to marching and exultant music .
Finally the last stray merry - maker ran into the house whooping to his companions .
I knew how near you were to hell .
I know how you , Thursday , crossed swords with King Satan , and how you , Wednesday , named me in the hour without hope .
There was complete silence in the starlit garden , and then the black - browed Secretary , implacable , turned in his chair towards Sunday , and said in a harsh voice --
" I am the peace of God .
The Secretary started up , and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand .
I should like to know .
" l understand nothing , but I am happy .
" I wish I knew why I was hurt so much .
He seemed to have a fine close suit with knee - breeches such as that which was worn by the servants of the house , only that it was not blue , but of this absolute sable .
" gasped Syme , half - rising from his seat .
A sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme , and he spoke brokenly and without sequence .
You have red hair like your sister .
"
" I thought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything ; but I find that I do not hate everything so much as I hate you !
You are the Law , and you have never been broken .
The unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme .
I can answer for every one of the great guards of Law whom he has accused .
"
Dawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid ; as if Nature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose .
He walked by instinct along one white road , on which early birds hopped and sang , and found himself outside a fenced garden .
There he saw the sister of Gregory , the girl with the gold - red hair , cutting lilac before breakfast , with the great unconscious gravity of a girl .
One evening she was sitting at the foot of her mother ' s bed spinning , and her little brothers and sisters were gathered round the fire eating their potatoes and milk for supper .
"
" The fine weather will never come again to me ," said her mother .
She was tired of speaking , for she was very weak ; but she took their little hands , as they laid them on the bed and joining them all together , she said , " Bless you , dears ; bless you ; love and help one another all you can .
Good night !-- good - bye !
At the end of the week she was dead and buried , and the orphans were left alone in their cabin .
Edmund was not yet nine , but he was a stout - grown , healthy boy , and well disposed to work .
Mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in FOR CHARITY ' S SAKE ; for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves .
Into these lodgings the orphans now removed , taking with them two bedsteads , a stool , chair and a table , a sort of press , which contained what little clothes they had , and a chest in which they had two hundred of meal .
The half - guinea which Mr . Hopkins , the agent , required for letting Mary into the castle , was part of what she had to pay to the schoolmistress , to whom above a guinea was due .
Being now settled in their house , they went every day regularly to work ; Maud spun nine cuts a day , besides doing all that was to be done in the house ; Edmund got fourpence a day by his work ; and Peggy and Annie earned twopence apiece at the paper - mills near Navan , where they were employed to sort rags , and to cut them into small pieces .
Annie and Peggy cut out the garland , and Mary , when it was finished , went along with them and Edmund to put it up .
She told the ladies how Mary had been turned out of her house , and how she had offered her goat , of which she was very fond , to discharge a debt due for her schooling ; and , in short , the schoolmistress , who had known Mary for several years , spoke so well of her that these ladies resolved that they would go to the old castle of Rossmore to see her the next day .
When the winter nights came on , he used to light his rush candles for Mary to work by .
The rush candles caught his attention ; for he had never seen any of them before , as he came from a part of England where they were not used .
*
The largest and longest are the best .
"]
After this he was always believed when he said , " There was no answer ," or , " They bid me not wait "; for Gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from being scolded .
She platted the packthread together in strands of about half an inch thick , and these were served firmly together at the bottom of the shoe .
When the shoes were completed , Isabella and Caroline disposed of them for her amongst their acquaintance , and got three shillings a pair for them .
Peggy and Anne platted the packthread , and basted the vamps and linings together ready for her .
She , however , in the midst of her hurry , found time to make a very pretty pair , with neat roses , as a present for her schoolmistress , who , now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business , consented to receive the amount of her old debt .
Most haste worst speed .
"
The children turned pale and stood motionless ; but Edmund threw down his hammer , and ran out to see what was the matter .
None could be found but a woman , who was a great scold , and a man who was famous for going to law about every trifle with his neighbours .
She returned home to the old castle , mortified that she had no good news to tell Anne and Peggy , who she knew expected to hear that she had found a nice house for them in the village near their brother .
" Here are more , a great many more of them ," cried Peggy ; and upon searching amongst the rubbish , they discovered a small iron pot , which seemed as if it had been filled with these coins , as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell .
Never was anything so lucky !
Caroline also found out that many of the coins were very valuable as curiosities .
Isabella and Caroline , knowing something of the character of Mr . Hopkins , the agent , had the precaution to count the coins , and to mark each of them with a cross , so small that it was scarcely visible to the naked eye , though it was easily to be seen through a magnifying glass .
" St . Patrick ' s days should come about , There would be found A treasure under ground , By one within twenty miles round .
This prophecy made a deep impression upon her .
"
[* Goody is not a word used in Ireland .
Mary paid the half - crown , and was in hopes that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor , but she was mistaken , for scarcely was the week at an end before the old woman appeared before her again , and repeated her threats of falling to work the next morning , unless she had something given to her to buy tobacco .
The orphans were shocked and astonished when they heard , from Isabella and Caroline , the charge that was made against them .
Mary , don ' t be cast down -- we have no need to be cast down -- we are honest .
" True ," said Mary ; " but is not it a hard case that we , who have lived , as my mother did all her life before us , in peace and honesty with all the world , should now have our good name taken from us , when --" Mary ' s voice faltered and stopped .
The orphans , conscious of their own innocence , took no pains about the matter ; and the consequence was , that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty ; but many , who knew nothing of them , concluded that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong .
Where ' s the gold that you found at Rossmore Castle ?
Isabella and Caroline everywhere asserted their belief in the integrity of the orphans , but to prove it was in this instance out of their power .
The orphans were in a worse condition than ever when the winter came on , and their benefactresses left the country to spend some months in Dublin .
joy !-- I always said the truth would come out at last ; and that he could not take our good name from us .
To comprehend why Edmund is joyful , our readers must be informed of certain things which happened after Isabella and Caroline went to Dublin .
One morning they went with their father and mother to see the magnificent library of a nobleman , who took generous and polite pleasure in thus sharing the advantages of his wealth and station with all who had any pretensions to science or literature .
They were not envied for their prosperity ; because everybody saw that it was the reward of their good conduct ; everybody except Goody Grope .
bad luck to me !-- Why didn ' t I go sooner to that there castle ?
Think of the luck of these childer , that have found a pot of gold , and such great , grand friends , and a slated house , and all : and here am I , with scarce a rag to cover me , and not a potato to put into my mouth !-- I , that have been looking under ground all my days for treasure , not to have a halfpenny at the last , to buy me tobacco !
" That is the very reason that you have not a halfpenny ," said Betsy .
"
'"
She lived happily in this manner for several years ; but , alas !
She begged a few months ' delay , and they were granted to her ; but at the end of that time there was no resource but to sell her horse Lightfoot .
" Jem ," said the old woman , " what , ar ' t hungry ?
" That I am , brave and hungry !
"
"
" Finish thy supper , child .
"
" WILL ?
why MUST you , mother ?
" said the widow , leaning her head upon her arm .
"
"
"
" If I get ever so little ," he still said to himself , " it will be SOMETHING ; and who knows but landlord might then wait a bit longer ?
Then he recollected that one day , when he had been sent to Clifton to sell some flowers , he had seen an old woman with a board beside her covered with various sparkling stones , which people stopped to look at as they passed , and he remembered that some people bought the stones ; one paid twopence , another threepence , and another sixpence for them ; and Jem heard her say that she got them amongst the neighbouring rocks : so he thought that if he tried he might find some too , and sell them as she had done .
" It ' s no trouble ; I ' ll look a little longer ; we ' ll not give it up so soon ," said Jem ; and after he had looked a little longer , he found the piece of crystal .
" Thank ' e ," said the man , " you are a fine little industrious fellow .
His father was an ale - house keeper , and being generally drunk , could take no care of his son ; so that Lazy Lawrence grew every day worse and worse .
" Are you awake ?
" I don ' t know -- because I can ' t find anybody to play with me to - day .
He took him home to his own house , and showed him a parcel of fossils , which he had gathered , he said , on purpose to sell , but had never had time enough to sell them .
" You are not an idle boy ," said she ; " so there is little danger of your getting into any mischief .
"
I thought I saw him here just now .
"
Jem ' s eyes sparkled with joy .
" Oh , thank you , ma ' am ," said he , " I will be sure and bring you as many more , to - morrow .
" But , perhaps , though you don ' t promise it , you will .
" Let him wonder a few minutes longer ," said the lady , " and tell me the rest of your story .
"
It was late in the evening , and Jem was impatient to get home to feed Lightfoot ; yet he recollected that he had promised the man who had trusted him to sell the fossils , that he would bring him half of what he got for them ; so he thought that he had better go to him directly ; and away he went , running along by the waterside about a quarter of a mile , till he came to the man ' s house .
" No ," said the man , when he had heard his story , " I shall not take half of that ; it was given to you .
"
"
Jem smiled .
I have -- let me -- see -- stones , two shillings ; then five days ' work -- that ' s five sixpences , that ' s two shillings and sixpence ; in all , makes four shillings and sixpence ; and my silver penny , is four and sevenpence -- four and sevenpence !
" Follow me , then ," cried Jem , " and I ' ll soon make you believe me ; come .
"
" Lord bless me , earned it !
I ' d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to Christmas , and I ' d make little Newton crack ' em for me , for that ' s the worst of nuts ; there ' s the trouble of cracking ' em .
"
The next day , as usual , Jem jumped up before six o ' clock and went to his work , whilst Lazy Lawrence sauntered about without knowing what to do with himself .
In the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread ; and as long as these lasted , he found himself well received by his companions ; but , at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny , and when it was gone , unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much , but he had no money to pay for them ; so he ran home to coax his father , as he called it .
" Now , did not I order you three days ago to carry these bottles to the cellar , and did not I charge you to wire the corks ?
" I began but with one halfpenny ," cried the stable boy , with an oath , " and now I ' ve got twopence !
" added he , jingling the halfpence in his waistcoat pocket .
"
So he stepped forward , presenting his halfpenny , offering to toss up with the stable boy , who , after looking him full in the face , accepted the proposal , and threw his halfpenny into the air .
As this was an amusement which he could enjoy without any sort of exertion , he soon grew so fond of it , that every day he returned to the stable yard , and the horse block became his constant seat .
" No , ma ' am ," said the gardener , " nor I don ' t know when , if ever , the man will bring home those mats you bespoke , ma ' am .
"
" In the first place , he recollected that he had seen Lazy Lawrence , whilst he lounged upon the gate , twist a bit of heath into different shapes ; and he thought , that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together , it would make a very pretty green soft mat , which would do very well for one to wipe one ' s shoes on .
About a mile from his mother ' s house , on the common which Jem rode over when he went to Farmer Truck ' s for the giant strawberries , he remembered to have seen a great quantity of this heath ; and , as it was now only six o ' clock in the evening , he knew that he should have time to feed Lightfoot , stroke him , go to the common , return , and make one trial of his skill before he went to bed .
" Expect !-- Nothing , ma ' am ," said Jem ; " I meant to give it you , if you ' d have it ; I did not mean to sell it .
"
" But that ' s not all ," said the lady .
It was Saturday night when he finished , and he carried , at three journeys , his eighteen mats to his mistress ' house ; piled them all up in the hall , and stood with his hat off , with a look of proud humility , beside the pile , waiting for his mistress ' appearance .
Presently a folding - door , at one end of the hall , opened , and he saw his mistress , with a great many gentlemen and ladies , rising from several tables .
" Oh !
there is my little boy and his mats ," cried the lady ; and , followed by all the rest of the company , she came into the hall .
" Well ," said the lady , smiling , " what do you see that makes you look so surprised ?
"
"
" Jem turned round to take up his hat , which he had left on the floor .
" Everybody thought , however , that they had been thanked RIGHTLY .
"
" Not now ," said the lady , laughing ; " but I will come to Ashton to - morrow evening ; perhaps your mother can find me a few strawberries .
" said he , patting him , and then could not refrain from counting out his money .
Come , you ' ll go , won ' t you ?
" exclaimed Lawrence .
" Yes , indeed ; but why did you stammer so when we first got in ?
You had liked to have blown us all up .
"
When he got to the stable a black cloud was just passing over the moon , and it was quite dark .
" What do we stand here for ?
" No ; it was Farmer Truck come for Lightfoot .
" said she , gravely .
"
" Oh , Jem !
" And don ' t you know me ?
" said she .
" Here she quite opened her large hand , and on the palm of it appeared Jem ' s silver penny .
" exclaimed Jem , seizing it , " oh , where did you find it ?
" I know nothing of your money -- I don ' t know what you would be at ," said the milk - woman .
" Why , madam ," said she , taking up the corner of her apron , " I came by it in an odd way , too .
"
" Why , that ' s true ; as I was coming along all alone , for the rest came round , and I came a short cut across yon field -- no , you can ' t see it , madam , where you stand -- but if you were here --"
He gave her his knife .
Still he takes no heed , but cuts the cord , as I said before , and through the gate they went , and out of sight in half a minute .
" Put it on your horse yourself , Jem ," said the lady ; " it is yours .
The latter had on a red jacket , which little Jem immediately recollected , and scarcely dared lift his eyes to look at the boy on horseback .
" said he to himself , " it must be -- yet surely it can ' t be Lawrence !
" Lawrence !
The shock sobered him at once , and he hid his face in his hands .
"
As for the hardened wretch , his accomplice , everyone was impatient to have him sent to gaol .
"
" Yes , madam , for mercy ' s sake ," said Jem ' s mother to the lady , " think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol .
His father stood by wringing his hands in an agony of despair .
"
Lawrence ' s heart was touched by his kindness , and his example struck him so forcibly that , when his confinement was ended , he resolved to set immediately to work ; and , to the astonishment of all who knew him , soon became remarkable for industry .
But Mr . Spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased ; that by behaving well he would certainly , sooner or later , secure the esteem and love of all who knew him , even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father ' s account .
He came back with the candle , and , with a stout heart , stood by whilst the letter was sealing ; and , when his master put it into his hand , said , in a cheerful voice , " I hope you will let me see you again , sir , sometimes .
He got to Queen ' s Square about three o ' clock .
" And she received him with a cold " Very well , ma ' am ," which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him .
In fact , Mrs . Pomfret was a woman so fond of power , and so jealous of favour , that she would have quarrelled with an angel who had got so near her mistress without her introduction .
" But they are not suffered to be with their parents ," rejoined the lady ; " and therefore cannot be hurt by their example .
"
he would be forced to starve or steal , if everybody had such prejudices .
" Well ," said Mrs . Churchill , changing her tone , " but , Pomfret , if we don ' t like the boy at the end of the month , we have done with him ; for I have only promised Mr . Spencer to keep him a month upon trial : there is no harm done .
"
He perceived indeed -- for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers -- that Felix was a much handsomer , or as the kitchen maid expressed it , a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was ; and he was made to understand , that he wanted a frill to his shirt , a cravat , a pair of thin shoes , and , above all , shoe strings , besides other nameless advantages , which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen .
"
" Because , indeed , I did not .
"
From this time forward Felix alone was privileged to enter the butler ' s pantry .
All this Franklin bore with fortitude ; nor did he envy Felix the dainties which he ate , sometimes close beside him : " For ," said he to himself , " I have a clear conscience , and that is more than Felix can have .
One Sunday there appeared a handsome sirloin of beef , which before noon on Monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone , and presented such a deplorable spectacle to the opening eyes of Mrs . Pomfret that her long smothered indignation burst forth , and she boldly declared she was now certain there had been foul play , and she would have the beef found , or she would know why .
"
I ' m sure it ' s what I can ' t pretend to , unless you do me the justice to forbid him my places .
I knew the nature of him well enough , from the first time I ever set my eyes upon him ; but mistress shall have her own way , and see the end of it .
" In fact , Felix had till now professed himself his firm ally , and had on his part received from Franklin unequivocal proofs of friendship ; for it must be told that every other morning , when it was Felix ' s turn to get breakfast , Felix never was up in decent time , and must inevitably have come to public disgrace if Franklin had not got all the breakfast things ready for him , the bread and butter spread , and the toast toasted ; and had not , moreover , regularly , when the clock struck eight , and Mrs . Pomfret ' s foot was heard overhead , run to call the sleeping Felix , and helped him constantly through the hurry of getting dressed one instant before the housekeeper came downstairs .
Cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time ; but although they may escape once , twice , perhaps ninety - nine times , what does that signify ?-- for the hundredth time they come to shame , and lose all their character .
Grown bold by frequent success , Felix became more careless in his operations ; and it happened that one day he met his mistress full in the passage , as he was going on one of the cook ' s secret errands .
Manchon , be quiet !
" But what ?
In my house everybody shall have justice ; speak -- but what ?
Mrs . Pomfret now seeing how far she had been imposed upon , resolved , for the future , to be more upon her guard with Felix , and felt that she had treated Franklin with great injustice , when she accused him of malpractices about the sirloin of beef .
His health was ruined .
His new friends were by no means uninterested by his conversation , and encouraged him as much as possible to talk ; for they had secret views , which the butler was by no means sufficiently sober to discover .
Before they parted with Corkscrew , they engaged him to meet them again the next night ; their intimacy was still more closely cemented .
Nothing , however , that he could urge made any impression upon Felix , whose recollection on the subject was perfectly distinct , and who had too much cunning himself , and too little confidence in his companion , to be the dupe of his dissimulation .
The butler knew not what to do when he saw that Felix was absolutely determined either to betray their scheme , or to become a sharer in the booty .
This was no very difficult task ; he had a strong desire to have some worked cravats , and the butler knew enough of him to believe that this would be a sufficient bribe .
Mrs . Pomfret , recovering from her fright , postponed all inquiries till the morning , and rejoiced that her mistress had not been awakened , whilst Corkscrew flattered himself that he should be able to conceal the true cause of the accident .
" Must !
" That is impossible ," retorted she , vehemently , " for I left this candlestick with my own hands last night , in the hall , the last thing I did , after you ," said she , turning to the butler , " was gone to bed -- I ' m sure of it -- Nay , don ' t you recollect my taking this JAPANNED CANDLESTICK out of your hand , and making you to go up to bed with the brass one , and I bolted the door at the stair - head after you ?
" How do you find yourself this morning , ma ' am ?
" I ' m sure I beg your pardon a thousand times -- it ' s only the bar -- because I had this great key in my hand .
"
" Dear me !
I brought up this here key of the house door for reasons of my own , which I ' m sure you ' ll approve of ; but I ' m not come to that part of my story yet .
I hope you were not disturbed by the noise in the house last night , ma ' am .
" To be sure , ma ' am -- how can I help believing him ?
I never found him out in the least symptom of a lie since ever he came into the house ; so one can ' t help believing in him , like him or not .
" No , ma ' am , there ' s no danger of that ; but I ' m sure if you had seen him last night yourself , you would think he deserved to be rewarded .
"
"
" Pray desire ," continued her mistress , " that he will bring up breakfast this morning ; and leave the key of the house - door , Pomfret , with me .
When Franklin brought the urn into the breakfast - parlour , his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand .
" How long have you lived with me ?
" said she , pausing ; " three weeks , I think ?
" That is but a short time ; yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think I may depend upon you .
Everything went on smoothly for three days .
" But how will she know anything of the matter ?
"
But come , come !
" added the hypocrite , assuming a tone of friendly persuasion , " you won ' t be such a blockhead , Franklin , as to lose going to the play for nothing ; it ' s only just obstinacy .
he ' ll give it to you back again safe and sound .
" But we ' ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy ," said Felix ; " and let him make his story good as he can afterwards .
"
" I don ' t think anything -- much , I mean , of that , sir ," answered Franklin , smiling .
"
and if here isn ' t Felix ' s fine cravat that he wanted in such a hurry to go to the play !
"
" You shall have both , indeed , Mrs . Pomfret ; but don ' t make such a noise , for everybody will hear you .
But poor Franklin !
Poor fellow !
I thought he would have dropped ; and he was so modest , ma ' am , when Mr . Spencer spoke to him , and told him he had done his duty .
" exclaimed Mrs . Pomfret , with unfeigned joy , " I ' m sure you are very good ; and I ' m very glad of it .
And , ma ' am ," continued Mrs . Pomfret , " the night after the fire I left him my great Bible and my watch , in my will ; for I never was more mistaken at the first in any boy in my born days ; but he has won me by his own DESERTS , and I shall from this time forth love all the VILLAINTROPIC folks for his sake .
Dryden .
For several years he suffered his children to run wild in the village ; but suddenly , on his being appointed to a considerable agency , he began to think of making his children a little genteel .
He sent his son to learn Latin ; he hired a maid to wait upon his daughter Barbara ; and he strictly forbade her thenceforward to keep company with any of the poor children , who had hitherto been her playfellows .
She heard the busy voices in the lane , and she concealed herself behind the high hedge , that she might listen to their conversation .
" Ay , where ' s Susan ?
I want her to sing me this same tune over again ; I have not it yet .
The Attorney wants to get our playground , so he does .
No later than yesterday she threw down my nine - pins in one of her ill - humours , as she was walking by with her gown all trailing in the dust .
Mamma says she wishes I may be like Susan , when I grow up to be a great girl , and so do I . I should not like to look conceited as Barbara does , if I was ever so rich .
" Rich or poor ," said Philip , " it does not become a girl to look conceited , much less BOLD , as Barbara did the other day , when she was at her father ' s door without a hat upon her head , staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink .
' But I wish Susan would come ," cried Philip , interrupting himself ,
She was detained by her father ' s returning later than usual .
Why have you such a fire to roast me at this time of the year ?
" You said yesterday , father , I thought , that you liked a little cheerful wood fire in the evening ; and there was a great shower of hail ; your coat is quite wet , we must dry it .
Susan was the first who ventured to break silence .
He could not be prevailed upon to eat any of the supper which had been prepared for him ; however , with a faint smile , he told Susan that he thought he could eat one of her guinea - hen ' s eggs .
Barbara , who was at this instant reflecting , with no agreeable feelings , upon the conversation of the village children , to which she had recently listened , started when she heard Susan ' s voice , and with a proud , ill - humoured look and voice , refused her request .
" Then Barbara called to her maid , Betty , and bid her catch the mischievous hen .
"
" It won ' t do ," said Barbara , turning her back .
We can do nothing without YOU , dear Susan ," cried Rose , running to meet her , at the moment she saw her .
But what is the matter ?
" said Susan , " don ' t wait for me ; I can ' t come to you , but ," added she , pointing to the tuft of double cowslips in the garden , " gather those for poor little Mary ; I promised them to her , and tell her the violets are under a hedge just opposite the turnstile , on the right as we go to church .
never mind me ; I can ' t come -- I can ' t stay , for my father wants me .
" About a fortnight ago , you know , wife ," continued he , " there was a balloting in our town for the militia ; now at that time I wanted but ten days of forty years of age ; and the attorney told me I was a fool for not calling myself plump forty .
So I was drawn for a militiaman ; but when I thought how loth you and I would be to part , I was main glad to hear that I could get off by paying eight or nine guineas for a substitute -- only I had not the nine guineas -- for , you know , we had bad luck with our sheep this year , and they died away one after another -- but that was no excuse , so I went to Attorney Case , and , with a power of difficulty , I got him to lend me the money ; for which , to be sure , I gave him something , and left my lease of our farm with him , as he insisted upon it , by way of security for the loan .
I ' m not come to the worst part of my story yet --"
Here Farmer Price made a dead stop ; and his wife and Susan looked up in his face , breathless with anxiety .
Case met Farmer Price as he was coming home , whistling , from a new ploughed field .
Walk on here , man , beside my horse , and you ' ll hear me .
" My good friend , Mr . Price ," said he , in a soft voice , and pale with suppressed rage .
He forced a smile .
I ' ll get the money back from him , and go myself , if so be it must be so , into the militia -- so I will .
" You don ' t mean to take the corner into your own garden , do you , Price ?
" said the farmer , " God forbid !
it ' s none of mine , I never take what does not belong to me .
"
" Then why so stiff about it , Price ?
" To say that black is white , which I won ' t do , Mr . Case .
The glow of enthusiasm , the pride of virtue , which made our hero brave , could not render him insensible .
He passed the door of his own cottage with resolute steps , however , and went through the village in search of the man who had engaged to be his substitute .
He found him , told him how the matter stood ; and luckily the man , who had not yet spent the money , was willing to return it ; as there were many others drawn for the militia , who , he observed , would be glad to give him the same price , or more , for his services .
"
Susan sat motionless , and breathed softly , lest she should disturb her .
The rushlight , which stood beside the bed , was now burnt low ; the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted , faded , appeared , and vanished , as the flame rose and sunk in the socket .
Susan was afraid that the disagreeable smell might waken her mother ; and , gently disengaging her hand , she went on tiptoe to extinguish the candle .
A few birds began to chirp ; but , as Susan was listening to them , her mother started in her sleep , and spoke unintelligibly .
As it approached nearer , she knew that it was Philip playing upon his pipe and tabor .
" said she , placing the garland upon her friend ' s head .
"
"
Her mother ' s unfinished knitting lay upon a table near the bed , and Susan sat down in her wicker arm - chair , and went on with the row , in the middle of which her hand stopped the preceding evening .
Susan ' s affectionate , dexterous , sensible activity was never more wanted , or more effectual .
You won ' t like to leave home ; I ' ll go to Barbara , and you shall see your guinea - hen in ten minutes .
Rose hurried away , pleased with her commission , and to accomplish her business .
" said she to her maid ; but as soon as she saw Rose behind the maid , she put on a scornful air .
She assured her , that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow ; that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask ; and , producing her well filled purse , " I believe that this is a very good shilling ," said she .
" If you don ' t like it , I will change it , and now you will be so good as to give me Susan ' s guinea - hen .
Then take four .
There is a certain manner of accepting a favour , which shows true generosity of mind .
" said Susan , starting from a reverie into which she had fallen , as she contemplated the purse .
" Certainly I DO long to see my pretty guinea - hen once more ; but I was not thinking of her just then -- I was thinking of my father .
Susan , who had always been attentive to what her mother taught her , and who had often assisted her when she was baking bread and cakes for the family at the Abbey , had now formed the courageous , but not presumptuous idea , that she could herself undertake to bake a batch of bread .
The modest simplicity of Susan ' s appearance and the artless propriety of the answers she gave to all the questions that were asked her , pleased the ladies at the Abbey , who were good judges of character and manners .
They watched eagerly for the moment of her return , that they might satisfy their curiosity .
Bab could descend , without shame , whenever it suited her purposes , from the height of insolent pride to the lowest meanness of fawning familiarity .
" cried Bab , winking at her maid .
" One may see you ' ve been in good company this morning -- hey , Susan ?
" What room did you go into ?
Can ' t you stop gathering those things for a minute , and chat a bit with us , Susan ?
" Is it ready ?
She tasted it , and added now a little salt , and now a little more , till she thought it was just to her mother ' s taste .
Susan ' s little companions repeated it , and applied it upon many occasions , whenever anyone claimed more than his share of anything good .
He constantly perceived , however , that he could not impose upon Sir Arthur ; but the idea that he could know all the mazes of the law , and yet prefer the straight road , was incomprehensible .
" The attorney looked in unfeigned astonishment , that a man who was actually making 3 , OOO pounds per annum at the bar should leave it .
"
" You are mistaken , my good sir , and you are not mistaken ," said Mr . Case , with a shrewd smile .
Now , being in possession , I come forward in my own proper person .
"
" That we shall ruin this poor man .
It was this unexpected reply of Sir Arthur ' s which had deranged the temper of Mr . Case , and caused his wig to stand so crooked upon his forehead , and which had rendered him impenetrably silent to his inquisitive daughter Barbara .
After having walked up and down his room , conversing with himself , for some time , the attorney concluded that the agency must be given to somebody when Sir Arthur should have to attend his duty in Parliament ; that the agency , even for the winter season , was not a thing to be neglected ; and that , if he managed well , he might yet secure it for himself .
She said that Sir Arthur was remarkably fond of lamb , and that she wished she could get a quarter for him .
" I know of one ," cried Barbara .
He prowled forth in search of his prey .
My father goes to - morrow .
" She started up in an ecstasy .
"
" What good can any lamb do ?
" Where is it ?
" He is , indeed , a whole week ;-- but how burning hot your hand is still .
"
Susan closed the curtains , and was silent .
What is your head running upon ?
Look at it .
" Some of them !
She was not sorry to hear him sigh as he passed the knapsack , which she had been packing up for his journey .
The voices were still raised one above another , all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins , or marbles , or tops , or bows and arrows , when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced .
Susan pointed to the great oak - tree , and they beheld , seated under its shade , an old man playing upon his harp .
The children all approached -- at first timidly , for the sounds were solemn ; but as the harper heard their little footsteps coming towards him , he changed his hand and played one of his most lively tunes .
" He must be very old , for all his hair is white ; and he must have travelled a great way , for his shoes are quite worn out ," observed another .
Susan ' s voice , which was soft and sweet , expressive of gentleness and good nature , caught his ear the moment she spoke .
" Then you heard MY sister Susan speak just now .
" And very fond of the little boy who sits upon my knee .
right !
"
"
Was not that good - natured ?
At last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling .
"
you can see the copper through it quite plain .
" That ' s your affair ," said the brutal boy , pushing away his hand .
You have taken it from me , and I shan ' t take it back again , I promise you .
" Who says it ' s unjust ?
" He was a sickly - looking boy , and of a remarkably peaceful disposition .
Young Case fancied that he would be afraid to give judgment against him .
"
The old harper called to Susan , and begged , that , if she was going towards the village , she would be so kind as to show him the way .
There was a small rivulet , which they had to cross , and as a plank which served for a bridge over it was rather narrow , Susan was afraid to trust the old blind man to his little conductor ; she therefore went on the tottering plank first herself , and then led the old harper carefully over .
"
" continued Miss Somers , looking round the kitchen .
Before Susan could reply , little William pushed forward , and answered , " Yes , ma ' am , it is MY sister Susan that keeps everything neat ; and she always comes to school for us , too , which was what caused her to be so late .
Many neighbours came to their doors , and far from envying , they all secretly wished Susan well as she passed .
She went in , and was rejoiced to see the shelves at the back of the counter well - furnished with glossy tiers of stuffs , and gay , neat printed linens and calicoes .
Miss Somers and her sister were not of this roughly charitable class .
" Well then , we will not press you , you are scarcely acquainted with us yet ; when you are , you will not be afraid , I hope , to speak your mind .
Put this shining yellow counter ," continued she , pointing to the guinea , " in your pocket , and make what use of it you please .
From what we know , and from what we have heard of you , we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it .
But I don ' t speak from partiality ; for I am no relation whatever to the Prices -- only a well - wisher , as everyone , I believe , who knows them is .
" If you please ," said Miss Somers , " and , as soon as you receive your new things from town , let us know .
but she would not have blessed Attorney Case , though , if she had known about my poor Daisy .
"
" What are they going to do with DAISY ?
Susan sat down upon the bank in silent sorrow ; her little brothers ran up to the butcher , and demanded whether he was going to DO ANY HARM to the lamb .
The little boys now burst into piercing lamentations .
The butcher looked aside , and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron .
The attorney stood unmoved ; he pulled up the head of the lamb , which had just stooped to crop a mouthful of clover .
If it ' s fat -- the sooner the better .
I ' ve no more to say .
As soon as the attorney was out of sight , Susan rose from the bank where she was seated , came up to her lamb , and stooped to gather some of the fresh dewy trefoil , to let it eat out of her hand for the last time .
" Now , let us go ," said Susan .
He went directly to his father to beg the life of Susan ' s lamb .
" Come , lads , don ' t keep a crowd and a scandal about my door ," continued he , aloud , to the children ; " turn the lamb in here , John , in the paddock , for to - night , and go your ways home .
"
The crowd dispersed , but murmured , and the butcher went to the attorney .
Rose , her good friend , was with her , and she had before her the pleasure of telling her father of his week ' s reprieve .
" Yes ," said the old harper , " I have found my way to you .
The old man thankfully entered the hospitable cottage .
He struck his head against the low roof , as he stepped over the doorsill .
" Many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good ," said he .
" As she spoke , she threw her arms round her father , who pressed her to his bosom without speaking , for his heart was full .
He was some little time before he could perfectly believe that what he heard was true ; but the revived smiles of his wife , the noisy joy of his little boys , and the satisfaction that shone in Susan ' s countenance , convinced him that he was not in a dream .
"
When she came to the story of her lamb , her voice faltered , and everybody present was touched .
The prize was ten guineas for the best performer on the harp , and the prize was now to be decided in a few days .
" To be sure ," said the maid ; " it ' s the least one may expect from a lady who DEMEANS herself to visit Susan Price , and goes about a - shopping for her .
That ' s the thing .
They can never enjoy the present moment .
"
He never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him , who was the curate of the parish .
After the ladies left the dining - room , as they were walking up and down the large hall , Miss Barbara had a fair opportunity of imitating her keen father ' s method of conversing .
He thanked her : but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea - hen , and he involuntarily exclaimed , " Susan ' s guinea - hen , I declare !
At the sound of Bab ' s voice , Philip turned -- saw her -- and indignation , unrestrained by the presence of all the amazed spectators , flashed in his countenance .
Miss Somers , however , mindful of what was due to her guest , was anxious to dispatch Philip for his piece of sycamore .
" Shall we try her ?
" continued she .
"
" If you please , ma ' am ," said Barbara , sullenly ; " I have nothing more to do with it .
He ran into the village .
They were delighted to see the guinea - hen once more .
" He darted into his father ' s house .
"
They had closed round Daisy , so that she did not see it ; but as they came up to the garden gate she saw that Rose beckoned to her .
At this instant the music paused , Susan heard the bleating of a lamb , and scarcely daring to believe her senses , she pressed eagerly forward , and beheld poor Daisy !-- she burst into tears .
I would not have parted with you for anything else in the whole world .
"
Barbara also saw the guinea - hen , and turned her head another way , that she might avoid the contemptuous , reproachful looks of those whom she only affected to despise .
" I am glad she saw the guinea - hen ," cried Rose , who now held it in her hands .
" Yes ," said Philip , " she ' ll not forget May day in a hurry .
Now I ' ve my pretty guinea - hen safe once more , I should think of returning your money .
"
" But , Philip ," said Mrs . Price , " I ' ll hold the jug -- you ' ll be late with your message to your mother ; we ' ll not detain you any longer .
" One of them dined at the Abbey , to - day , and told papa that they ' d all come .
Pray , Betty , don ' t forget that Mrs . Strathspey can ' t breakfast without honey .
Tell her it ' s for Mrs .
" I ' ll tell you what , Susan Price ," said she , in a high tone , " the honey I WILL have , so you may as well give it to me by fair means .
Will you give it me or not ?
" That bit of honey - comb is for my mother ' s breakfast ," said Susan ; " I cannot give it you .
Can ' t you do something for me ?
Mr . Case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family .
" Is there anything in our house can be of service to her ?
" But as no Barbara answered , her father stalked upstairs directly , opened the door , and stood amazed at the spectacle of her swelled visage .
" Susan curtsied , in great surprise ; but her lamb could not be forgotten , and she left the attorney ' s house as soon as she could , to make her mother ' s rosemary tea breakfast .
The farmer was a blunt , honest man , and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous , when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone .
The Miss Somerses , who were fond of music , were amongst the ladies in the semicircle ; and the prize was lodged in the hands of Sir Arthur .
Miss Somers ' ready pencil was instantly produced ; and the old harper dictated the words of his ballad , which he called -- " Susan ' s Lamentation for her Lamb .
"
Farmer Price sat down in his own chair , for he could not read entirely to his satisfaction in any other , and read as follows :--
I have won the ten guinea prize , and for that I am in a great measure indebted to your sweet daughter Susan ; as you will see by a little ballad I inclose for her .
You do not , I hope , forget that I was present when you were counting the treasure in Susan ' s little purse , and that I heard for what purpose it was all destined .
I see more of the world under my tattered garb than , perhaps , I should ever see in a better dress .
There are many of my profession who are of the same mind as myself in this respect ; and we are glad , when it lies in our way , to do any kindness to such a worthy family as yours .-- So , fare ye well .
" Your obliged Friend , " LLEWELLYN .
" Why , sir ," said Price , " the land ' s mine , to be sure , for that matter ; but I hope you don ' t look upon me to be that sort of person that would be stiff about a trifle or so .
"
You ' ll see , by that bit of paper , what was meant ; but the attorney says , the paper ' s not worth a button in a court of justice , and I don ' t understand these things .
" Let us go and see this nook ," said Sir Arthur .
" It is not far off , is it ?
Let it belong to whom it will , I give it up to you .
" So great a lawyer , Mr . Case , as you are ," replied Sir Arthur , " must know , that a man cannot give up that to which he has no legal title ; and in this case it is impossible that , with the best intentions to oblige me in the world , you can give up this bit of land to me , because it is mine already , as I can convince you effectually by a map of the adjoining land , which I have fortunately safe amongst my papers .
" Yes , sir ," said Sir Arthur , pulling the lease out of his pocket .
I am ready , at a fair valuation , to pay the exact value of your house and land ; but upon this condition -- that you quit the parish within one month !
"
I want no agent to squeeze my tenants , or do my dirty work .
" I have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it .
"
"
" Ma ' am , you have seen her , I believe ; she is a very good girl , indeed ," said Mrs . Price .
" And works very neatly , indeed ," continued Susan , eagerly , to Miss Somers ; " and she and her mother heard you were looking out for someone to wait upon you .
Tell Rose to come to the Abbey , to - morrow morning , or , rather , come with her yourself ; for our housekeeper , I know , wants to talk to you about a certain cake .
Well , the best of it is , we shall be able next year , when he comes his rounds , to pay him his money with thanks , being all the time , and for ever , as much obliged to him as if we kept it .
The good news that Farmer Price was to be employed to collect the rents , and that Attorney Case was to leave the parish in a month , soon spread over the village .
Susan ' s too modest to say it herself ; but I tell ye all , Sir Arthur gave us this play - green for ever , on account of her being so good .
"
"
"
" Impossible !
" cried Mr . Somerville , " for I had no thoughts of building an inn at that time .
"
" Oh , I beg your honour ' s pardon but if you ' d be just pleased to recollect , it was coming through the gap in the bog meadows , FORENENT Thady O ' Connor , you made me the promise -- I ' ll leave it to him , so I will .
" But I will not leave it to him , I assure you ," cried Mr . Somerville ; " I never made any such promise .
I never thought of letting this inn to you .
" Then your honour won ' t let me have it ?
" Ha !
So I think he knows nothing of the matter .
"
The carpenter was speaking to Mr . Somerville upon the landing - place of the stairs ; but , the moment he spied the white pigeon , he broke off in the midst of a speech about THE NOSE of the stairs , and exclaimed , " There he is , please your honour !
Don ' t chop his head off ," added the boy to the carpenter , who had now the white pigeon in his hands .
" No ," said Mr . Somerville , " the pigeon ' s head shall not be chopped off , nor yours either , my good boy , for breaking a window .
"
"
" Thank you for having me taught to read , father ," said Brian .
Why should not he ?
Their place of meeting was at the ale - house of Mr . Cox , the man who , as our readers may remember , was offended by Mr . Somerville ' s hinting that he was fond of drinking and of quarrelling , and who threatened vengeance for having been refused the new inn .
Whilst these men were talking over their scheme , one of them observed , that one of their companions was not arrived .
The very means which these people took to secure secrecy were the means of bringing their plots to light .
But the pigeon , though he had been purposely fed at this house for a week before this trial , did not stop there , but flew on to his old master ' s house in Somerville , and pecked at the kitchen window , as he had formerly been taught to do .
Mr . Somerville , in consequence of this fortunate discovery , took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house .
A few days afterwards , Mr . Somerville called at O ' Neill ' s house , and bid him and his son follow him .
There , now it is straight .
The boy pulled off the cover , and saw a white pigeon painted upon the sign , and the name of O ' Neill in large letters underneath .
" Take care you do not tumble down and break your neck upon this joyful occasion ," said Mr . Somerville , who saw that Brian ' s surprise was too great for his situation .
"
"
"
"
" Indeed !
"
" But stay , Rosamond , how you jumble things together !
" But ," added she , " the NICE NEW playthings , mother !
Now you shall be judge , mamma ; I ' ll tell you all that was in the drawer .
"
Rosamond thought , but she could not find out any reason ; besides , she suddenly recollected that she had not time to think any longer ; for there was a certain work - basket to be finished , which she was making for her cousin Bell , as a present upon her birthday .
"
I heard her say something to my mother .
I hope she ' ll be by when I give my basket to Bell -- won ' t it be beautiful ?
"
" Can ' t you ?
" Poor girl !
"
All her feelings of pity were immediately suppressed .
" she went to spend her half - guinea upon her filigree basket .
"
" How much would another cost ?
"
As the carriage went on , Rosamond pulled the paper to one side and to the other , and by each of the four corners .
" Let us look at this basket ," said he , taking it out of her unwilling hands , for she knew of what frail materials it was made , and she dreaded its coming to pieces under her father ' s examination .
" Your Cousin Bell will be very much obliged to you for a present that is of no use .
But Bell will like the basket , I know , though it is of no use .
"
" _I_ , father ?
"
" But it is her birthday , sir ; and I am sure she will EXPECT something , and everybody else will give her something .
And will you , or can you , or should you , always give , merely because others EXPECT , or because somebody else gives ?
"
" Then I am a fool , am I ?
She was idle , fretful , and selfish ; so that nothing could make her happy .
" Why , if you are asked , you must tell the truth , to be sure .
" How pretty !-- but let me have it in my own hands ," said Bell , as the maid held the basket up out of her reach .
" Oh , no , you must not touch it ; for if you should spoil it , what would become of me ?
"
" Become of you , indeed !
"
" Then you won ' t snatch it ?
Calmed at this sight , the next question was , how she should conceal the mischief which she had done .
The habits of tyranny , meanness , and falsehood , which children acquire from living with bad servants , are scarcely ever conquered in the whole course of their future lives .
" The girl was going to answer , but the maid interrupted her , saying --" Come , come , none of your excuses ; you are a little idle , good - for - nothing thing , to disappoint Miss Bell upon her birthday .
I believe you ' d call , call , call twenty times for twopence .
"
However ungraciously the permission to call again was granted , it was received with gratitude .
Don ' t you wish your mamma could afford to give some like it ?
" But cannot the person who made it ," said Laura , " make any more like it ?
" No , no , no !
" Nobody can get any like it , I say ," repeated Bell ; " nobody in all London can make it but one person , and that person will never make a bit for anybody but me , I am sure .
"
" cried her mother ; " come to me , and tell me what ' s the matter .
" Oh !
the lace , child !-- are you mad ?
" said her mother , catching hold of both her hands .
" I don ' t care how much it cost -- it is not beautiful , and I ' ll have none of it ," replied Bell , sobbing ; " for it is not beautiful .
" Oh , fie !
"
"
Nancy !
Rosamond did not rejoice in her anger , and had nearly made a sad mistake by speaking aloud her thoughts --" I WAS VERY FOOLISH --" she began and stopped .
"
" said Bell , trembling .
I ' m sure she must have been meddling with it ," added the maid .
" Oh , yes , that ' s the thing ," said the mistress , decidedly .
It was the little girl , who came to be paid for her lace .
The maid , who was afraid that the girl ' s innocence would appear if she were produced , hesitated ; but upon her mistress repeating her commands , she was forced to obey .
The girl came in with a look of simplicity ; but when she saw a room full of company she was a little abashed .
" whispered Rosamond to her sister .
" Vastly well !
"
" YES , MA ' AM !
You had better confess it at once , and mistress , perhaps , will say no more about it .
"
" said the little girl ; " I never touched the basket , madam .
The maid , frightened , pulled the little girl by the sleeve .
O , fie !
"
"
" said Rosamond to her godmother , " now you see -- you see she is NOT a little miser .
" This is being REALLY GENEROUS , father , is it not ?

" At eleven o ' clock , the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the College , the Royal Family set off from the Castle to see them , and , after walking round the Courtyard , they proceeded to Salt Hill in the following order :--
" Then followed the Scholars , preceded by the Marechal Serjeant , the Musicians of the Staffordshire Band , and Mr . Ford , Captain of the Seminary , the Serjeant Major , Serjeants , Colonels , Corporals , Musicians , Ensign , Lieutenant , Steward , Salt Bearers , Polemen , and Runners .
" Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cumberland , after taking leave of their Majesties , set off for town , and honoured the Opera House with their presence in the evening .

" Mr . Bartelot , plain mantle and sandals , Scotch bonnet , a very Douglas .

Say no more about it ; ' tis an unpossibility in the natur of things .
Mrs . Newington , Mr . Newington drinks your health ; for I suppose I must not be landlord any more in my own house ( shrugs ).
Oh , as to that , I have no objections nor impediments to your being called LANDLORD .
To be sure I don ' t .
Very true , indeed , wife -- Mrs . Newington , I mean -- I ask pardon ; but now to go on with what we were saying about the unpossibility of letting that old lady , and the civil - spoken young lady there above , have them there rooms for another day .
Neither o ' them , I take it , by what they ' ve ordered since their coming into the house , are such grand folk , that one need be so petticular about them .
what signifies talking ?
So , Mr . Newington , if you don ' t think proper to go up and inform the ladies above , that the Dolphin rooms are not for them , I must SPEAK myself , though ' tis a thing I never do when I can help it .
) My dear , you can speak a power better than I can ; so take it all upon yourself , if you please ; for , old - fashioned as I and my tankard here be , I can ' t make a speech that borders on the uncivil order , to a lady like , for the life and lungs of me .

CURTAIN FALLS .
When Maurice got to the seed - shop , it was full of people , who were all impatient to be served : first a great tall man , and next a great fat woman pushed before him ; and he stood quietly beside the counter , waiting till somebody should be at leisure to attend to him .
" I want all these seeds for my father ," said Maurice , putting a list of seeds into the shopman ' s hand ; " and I have brought money to pay for them all .
Maurice saw that , if the captain took one more step forward , he must pull the string , so that it would throw down the jar , round the bottom of which the packthread was entangled .
It would have been a pity if I had broken it just when it was safe landed .
I am sorry I threw down your seeds , as you are such a good natured , forgiving boy .
" Then here are a couple of tulip - roots for you ; and if you take care of them , I ' ll promise you that you will have the finest tulips in England in your little garden .
where are you ?
" I am sorry for it ," said Arthur , who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden ; " I am afraid you will be very angry with me .
Oh , how could you do so ?
you must all die now .
I am sure I should have been exceedingly angry if you had broken the glass , if it had been mine .
It would be well for all the world if they could be convinced , like Arthur , that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel .
"
Oakly flew into a passion when he received such a message , declared it was just such a mean , shabby trick as might have been expected from a Scotchman -- called himself a booby , a dupe , and a blockhead , for ever having trusted to the civil speeches of a Scotchman -- swore that he would die in the parish workhouse before he would ever ask another favour , be it ever so small , from a Scotchman ; related to his wife , for the hundredth time , the way in which he had been taken in by the Scotch peddler ten years ago , and concluded by forswearing all further intercourse with Mr . Grant , and all belonging to him .
"
" No ," replied Oakly , sturdily ; " his father has used me uncivil , and no man shall use me uncivil twice .
Arthur promised to obey his father .
Grant gave his answer to his wife ; she to a Welsh servant - girl , who did not perfectly comprehend her mistress ' broad Scotch ; and she in her turn could not make herself intelligible to Mrs . Oakly , who hated the Welsh accent , and whose attention , when the servant - girl delivered the message , was principally engrossed by the management of her own horse .
" It contained these words :
But though you are angry with me , I am not angry with you .
You will find the ashes in the flower - pot upon the wall .
"
)
"' When I read in this book what is said about the strawberries growing as large as apricots , after they had been covered over with seaweed , I thought that perhaps seaweed ashes might be good for my father ' s raspberries ; and I asked him if he would give me leave to try them .
" No , indeed , sir , I don ' t know -- I never asked -- I did not think it signified .
" Upon my word ," said his father , " this will be a beautiful tulip !
"
" I have a great mind to let you play together again ," said Arthur ' s father .
Oakly showed him Maurice ' s letter ; and to Arthur ' s extreme astonishment , the attorney had no sooner read it , than he exclaimed , " What an artful little gentleman this is !
I never , in the course of all my practice , met with anything better .
They know -- that is , Mr . Grant , who is sharp enough , knows -- that he will be worsted in that suit ; that he must , in short , pay you a good round sum for damages , if it goes on --"
"
Maurice had put his tulip , which was beginning to blow , in a flower - pot , on the top of the wall , in hopes that his friend Arthur would see it from day to day .
The next day , when Maurice saw his raspberry - plants scattered upon the ground , and his favourite tulip broken , he was in much astonishment , and , for some moments , angry ; but anger , with him , never lasted long .
He was convinced that all this must be owing to some accident or mistake .
He could not believe that anyone could be so malicious as to injure him on purpose --" And even if they did all this on purpose to vex me ," said he to himself , " the best thing I can do , is , not to let it vex me .
Tulips were , at this time , things of great consequence in the estimation of the country several miles round where Maurice and Arthur lived .
Arthur ' s tulip was beautiful .
The day of the florist ' s feast arrived , and Oakly went with his son and the fine tulip to the place of meeting .
All the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling - green ; and , amongst all this gay variety , the tulip which Maurice had given to Arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful .
" So I did ," said Maurice ; " but somebody ( I suppose by accident ) broke it .
"
" That was me -- that somebody was me ," said Oakly .
" To be sure I am ," said Grant
" Which ," continued Oakly , " gives me a better opinion of you than ever I had before -- I mean , than ever I had since the day you sent me the shabby answer about those foolish , what d ' ye call em , cursed raspberries .
" said Grant , with surprise ; and Oakly repeated exactly the message which he received ; and Grant declared that he never sent any such message .
Till now , I never rightly liked a Scotchman .
I ' m sure , from the bottom of my heart , I ' m sorry I broke his tulip .
"
He was fond of children ; and as he had no sons , he determined to adopt one of his relations .
He had been told that " gentlemen should be above being careful and saving ": and he had unfortunately imbibed a notion that extravagance was the sign of a generous disposition , and economy of an avaricious one .
" Oh !
" exclaimed Ben , when he read the following words , which were written in large characters over the chimney - piece , in his uncle ' s spacious kitchen --
Hal stood still , exactly in the spot where the parcel was put into his hands , and tried first at one corner , and then at another , to pull the string off by force .
" I wish these people wouldn ' t tie up their parcels so tight , as if they were never to be undone ," cried he , as he tugged at the cord ; and he pulled the knot closer instead of loosening it .
" Ben !
' you know .
" Pooh !
" You may keep the string for your pains ," said Mr . Gresham .
" Oh , how I wish I had but a string ," said Hal .
It soon was worn through , and he split his top by driving the pea too tightly into it .
It happened some time afterwards that a lady , who had been intimately acquainted with Hal ' s mother at Bath -- that is to say , who had frequently met her at the card - table during the winter -- now arrived at Clifton .
" Pick it up , then , and bring it to me , quick , can ' t you , child ," cried Hal , " for Lady Di ' s sons are waiting for me ?
" said Mr . Gresham , who came instantly , on hearing the noise of someone falling downstairs .
" Here , papa ," said the little girl , touching her ankle , which she had decently covered with her gown .
He had diverted himself with running up and downstairs , whipping the bannisters with it , as he thought he could convert it to no better use ; and , with his usual carelessness , he at last left it hanging just where he happened to throw it when the dinner bell rang .
"
"
"
"
" May be so ," said Mr . Gresham , still with the same look of calm simplicity ; " put on your hats , boys , and come with me .
"
As soon as their visit was over , and all the time they walked down the hill from Prince ' s Building ' s towards Bristol , he continued to repeat nearly the same arguments , which he had formerly used , respecting necessity , the uniform , and Lady Diana Sweepstakes .
" Oh , uncle ," said he , as his uncle was going to turn the corner to pursue the road to Bristol , " look at those jellies !
" pointing to a confectioner ' s shop .
His uncle , who was desirous to see his nephews act without restraint , that he might judge their characters , bid them do as they pleased .
However , with all my heart , let us take a coach , for Ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday ; and I believe I should find it rather too much for me to walk so far , though I am not sick with eating good things .
"
" Why ," said Hal , who was now piqued , " I ' m sure you did say , uncle , you would go to Mr . Hall ' s to choose the cloth for the uniform .
" Very true , and so I will ," said Mr . Gresham ; " but we need not make a whole morning ' s work , need we , of looking at a piece of cloth ?
They went first to the cathedral .
" And ," continued the lad who showed the cathedral , " he has lived here these many , many winters .
that if I had a bit of bread he ' d come down and feed in my hand .
" I ' ve a bit of bun here ," cried Ben , joyfully , producing the remains of the bun which Hal but an hour before would have thrown away .
" He is afraid of US ," said Ben ; " he is not used to eat before strangers , I suppose .
" Where does your mother live ?
" Hard by , sir , just close to the church here : it was HER that always had the showing of it to strangers , till she lost the use of her poor limbs .
"
" Shall we , may we , uncle , go that way ?
The old woman was sitting up in her wretched bed , winding worsted ; four meagre , ill - clothed , pale children were all busy , some of them sticking pins in paper for the pin - maker , and others sorting rags for the paper - maker .
" cried he , as he jumped eagerly out of the coach , when his uncle stopped at the woollen - draper ' s door .
" Uncle ," said Ben , stopping Mr . Gresham before he got out of the carriage , " I don ' t think a uniform is at all necessary for me .
"
"
" Yes , sir , quite right .
" Don ' t you remember how cold we were , Hal , the day before yesterday , in that sharp wind , when we were flying our kite upon the Downs ?
Hal , what say you ?
"
" said Hal , sighing , as he looked at the epaulettes , " uncle , if you would not be displeased , if I choose the uniform --"
The measure of Hal ' s happiness was now complete .
" said Mr . Gresham ; " speak , what do you wish for first ?
" Arrows , uncle , if you please ; three arrows .
"
You say famous very often ; and I don ' t know exactly what it means ; a famous uniform -- famous doings .
I remember you said there are to be famous doings , the first of September , upon the Downs .
" Patty laughed , and said , " This does not explain it to me .
Where equal pains are taken , success is usually found to be pretty nearly equal .
"
" Papa ," said Patty , " as we go up the hill where there is so much red mud , I must take care to pick my way nicely ; and I must hold up my frock , as you desired me , and , perhaps , you will be so good , if I am not troublesome , to lift me over the very bad place where are no stepping - stones .
Oh , that puts me in mind -- here are your gloves which I asked you that night to let me mend .
"
"
" I would not have you trust to my blindness ," said her father , stroking her head , fondly ; " I observe everything .
Is not it time to think of setting out , sir ?
" said Hal to his uncle .
" There ' s a poor lad , sir , below , with a great black patch on his right eye , who is come from Bristol , and wants to speak a word with the young gentlemen , if you please .
"
" They are both alike , gentlemen ," said he .
"
I am not sure I ' m right , sir ; for both the young gentlemen spoke at once , and the wind is very high at the street door ; so that I could not well make out all they said ; but I believe this is the sense of it .
I know that is just what was settled the day I dined at Lady Diana ' s ; and Lady Diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride --"
" Well , that is nothing to the purpose ," interrupted Mr . Gresham .
" If you ' ll give me leave , sir ," said the poor Bristol lad , " I shall have plenty of time ; and I ' ll run down to the Well Walk after the young gentleman , and take him his bow and arrows .
Parties of gentlemen and ladies , and a motley crowd of spectators , were seen moving backwards and forwards , under the rocks , on the opposite side of the water .
The archers and archeresses were now drawn up on the flags under the semicircular piazza just before Mrs . Yearsley ' s library .
He looked from side to side in great distress --" Oh , there ' s my bow coming , I declare !
"
The poor boy had no ambition to partake the triumph ; he FELL BACK as soon as he understood the meaning of the lady ' s words .
The drum beat , the fife played , the archers marched , the spectators admired .
" cried he , as he ran after it .
The hat was too large for his head without this band ; a sudden gust of wind blew it off .
the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank .
He tried to draw it back ; his other foot slipped , and he fell prostrate , in his green and white uniform , into the treacherous bed of red mud .
His companions , who had halted upon the top of the hill , stood laughing , spectators of his misfortune .
" But soon the fear of being too late at the archery meeting began to balance the dread of appearing in his stained habiliments ; and he now as anxiously repeated , whilst the woman held the wet coat to the fire , " Oh , I shall be too late ; indeed , I shall be too late ; make haste ; it will never dry ; hold it nearer -- nearer to the fire .
"
" Nobody ," said he , " will take notice of my coat behind , I daresay .
At length he reached the appointed spot .
" You have been almost the ruin of my poor uniform habit ; but I ' ve escaped rather better than you have .
Hal looked round in search of better friends .
" Oh , where ' s my uncle ?-- where ' s Ben ?
" My hands are benumbed ; I can scarcely feel ," said he , rubbing them , and blowing upon the ends of his fingers .
Do you hear , Hal ?
This young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws , as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself .
He little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship .
" There , it ' s all over with you !
His first arrow was not successful .
Master Sweepstakes clapped his hands with loud exultations and insulting laughter .
" exclaimed Hal , when he saw that it was the very same that had tied up the parcel .
" cried little Patty , as his arrow hit the mark , " it ' s the nearest ; is it not the nearest ?

Lucy ( still playing with the box ).
Contradict me as often as you please , but you cannot impose upon me ; I defy you to impose upon me !
I know the law !-- I know the law !-- and I ' ll make you know it , too .
)
don ' t be frightened !-- I mean , you tell the truth , never be frightened .
SCENE IV .
Oh la !
I ' ve heard nothing yet that I can understand .
Now I do desire , Mrs . Landlady , nobody may speak a single word whilst I am cross - examining the thief .
( Landlady puts her finger upon her lips -- Everybody looks eagerly towards the door .
Ay , darling , her father ' s own child !
And when I went to his old hiding place , there it was ; but you see , papa , he did not take the box .
because the thief was a magpie .
No MAN would have taken the money and left the box .
I am the happiest man !
Bless you for it !
And , friend , do you hear ?
We have some excellent ale .
Land .
Will .
)
On the stairs , in the passages , at her window , she was continually visible ; and she appeared to possess the art of being present in all these places at once .
" " Mrs . Theresa Tattle at home ?
Besides , Mrs . Theresa ' s parlour door was sometimes left more than half open , to afford a view of a green parrot .
In the course of the first week she only hinted to Mr . Montague that " some people thought his system of education rather odd ; that she should be obliged to him if he would , some time or other , when he had nothing else to do , just sit down and make her understand his notions , that she might have something to say to her acquaintance , as she always wished to have when she heard any friend attacked , or any friend ' s opinions .
Mr . Montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say , and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened , Mrs . Tattle next addressed herself to Mrs . Montague , prophesying , in a most serious whisper , " that the charming Miss Marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked , if she were not immediately provided with a back - board , a French dancing - master , and a pair of stocks .
She was about thirteen -- that dangerous age at which ill educated girls , in their anxiety to display their accomplishments , are apt to become dependent for applause upon the praise of every idle visitor ; when the habits not being formed , and the attention being suddenly turned to dress and manners , girls are apt to affect and imitate , indiscriminately , everything that they conceive to be agreeable .
This word FASHIONABLE , Mrs . Theresa Tattle knew , had usually a great effect , even at thirteen ; but she had not observed that it had much power upon Sophy ; nor were her remarks concerning grace and manners much attended to .
if I were , Miss Marianne for me !
" People must think children are very silly , or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds , if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them , by way of moral , when the countenance , manner , and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale .
He was a boy of much vivacity , and had considerable abilities ; but his appetite for vulgar praise had not yet been surfeited .
As they were to be absent all day , they foresaw that their officious neighbour would probably interfere with their children .
Mrs . Theresa has taken care to provide a few macaroons for her little favourite , who said she was particularly fond of them the other day .
Mrs . Theresa hopes they will all come at six , or before , not forgetting Miss Sophy , if she will condescend to be of the party .
Then twisting the note in his fingers , he appealed to Sophy :--
" Yes , I know that ," said Frederick .
Sophy , whose powers of reasoning were not to be confounded , even by quotations from the Latin grammar , looked up soberly from her drawing , and answered " that very likely those words might be signs of the same thing in the Latin grammar , but she believed that they meant perfectly different things in real life .
You wanted to prove --"
" There !
there !
blood !
Marianne .
See !
" Oh , I only mixed red , blue , green and yellow , to show you , Marianne , that all colours mixed together make white .
I ' m sure Sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot , which papa showed us yesterday , long before you did , though you are a man .
"
Women who are always drawing and reasoning , never know how to make puddings .
"
Cannot I learn them as she did ?
" Yes , but you ' d never do it exactly , and mind the spoonfuls right , by the recipe , like a cook .
"
" Never would !
Marianne coloured a little ; for though she had precipitately followed her brother , and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying " You know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best ," yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself : and it was not till after Mrs . Theresa had exhausted all her compliments , and half her macaroons , that she could restore her spirits to their usual height .
I can ' t cut it , I say ; it ' s as hard as a deal board .
not a bit of fat .
not a drop of gravy .
I ' ll have none of it .
It ' s really very extraordinary , Mrs . Carbuncle !
( aside ).
" Now , brother , suppose that it is after dinner ," said Marianne ; " and show us how the doctor goes to sleep .
Miss Marianne , who did not clearly comprehend this affair of the jointure , or the reason why Mrs . Carbuncle would be so unhappy after her husband ' s death , turned to Frederick , who was at that instant studying Mrs . Theresa as a future character to mimic .
indeed , ladies !
"
But Mrs . Theresa Tattle is a very particular person .
Mar .
Now , brother , read the newspaper like Counsellor Puff .
Here ' s a newspaper , sir , pray let us have Counsellor Puff .
I absolutely must show you , some day , to my friend Lady Battersby ; you ' d absolutely make her die with laughing ; and she ' d quite adore you ," said Mrs . Theresa , who was well aware that every pause must be filled with flattery .
You , who make everybody else laugh .
Oh , such another sigh again !
a glass of cowslip - wine ?
" But , Sophy !
We ' ll have candles .
pray bring -- Do you hear ?
" but no Christopher answered ; and , upon turning round , Mrs . Tattle , instead of Christopher , beheld two little black figures , which stood perfectly still and silent .
"
" Chimney - sweepers !
" The bell rang !
"
" said Mrs . Tattle , in a more complacent tone , " the boy takes me for Miss Bertha Eden , I perceive "; and , flattered to be taken in the dark by a chimney - sweeper for a young and handsome lady , Mrs . Theresa laughed , and informed him " that they had mistaken the room ; and they must go up another pair of stairs , and turn to the left .
Marianne withdrew rather coldly from a kiss which Mrs . Tattle was going to give her ; for she was somewhat surprised at the familiarity with which this lady talked to her footman .
She had not been accustomed to these familiarities in her father and mother , and she did not like them .
Those chimneys , they say , are difficult ; and the square fellow , ma ' am , the biggest of the two boys , got wedged in the chimney .
So he screeched , and screeched , all he could ; and by the greatest chance in life , ma ' am , old Mr . Eden was just going down the hill to fetch his morning walk .
" Why , ma ' am ," said Christopher , with a look of great delight , " that was all as one , as the very ' dentical words I put to the boy myself , when he telled me his story .
"
but he ' s alive now ; go on with your story , Christopher ," said Mrs . T . " Chimney - sweepers get wedged in chimneys every day ; it ' s part of their trade , and it ' s a happy thing when they come off with a few bruises .
"
I ' m convinced Mr . and Mrs . Montague will find themselves obliged to stay out another day , and I so long to show you off to her ladyship ; and your Doctor Carbuncle , and your Counsellor Puff , and your Miss Croker , and all your charming characters .
" Oh , ma ' am ," said Frederick , " I cannot promise you any such thing , indeed .
why not ?
"
"
I know I need not , because my father and mother always let me judge for myself almost about everything .
" Papa and mamma , you know , just as they were going away , said , ' If Mrs . Theresa asks you to come , do as you think best '"
" Well , then ," said Mrs . Theresa , " you know it rests with yourselves , if you may do as you please .
" To be sure I may , madam ," said Frederick , colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame , and which often conquers real shame ; " to be sure , ma ' am , I may do as I please .
The jargon of politeness and gallantry is frequently brought by the silly acquaintance of young people to confuse their simple morality and clear good sense .
They hesitate between new motives and old principles .
From the fear of being thought ignorant , they become affected ; and from the dread of being thought to be children act like fools .
"
" Why not , my love ?
but you know your own value , I see ; as you entertaining people always do .
"
"
" It shall , it must be done .
I only told you my invention .
" But have they been up to old Eden yet ?
"
" That will do , Christopher !
" Now ," said she to Frederick , " step in here to the next room with this candle , and you ' ll be equipped in an instant .
" I think he is in the right not to go up , though he can do it so easily , to see that gentleman ; I mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards .
"
He would not let her be wakened .
"
" I hope Frederick won ' t go up to disturb her .
Young ladies should not be so forward to give opinions and advice to their elder brothers unasked ; and I presume that Mr . Frederick and I must know what ' s right as well as Miss Marianne .
" Go , then , about your business ," said Mrs . Theresa , " and here ' s a shilling for you , to drink , my honest fellow .
Go ," said she , pushing Frederick towards the door .
The hall was rather dark , but under the lamp a crowd of people , all the servants in the house having gathered together .
As Mrs . Theresa approached , the crowd opened in silence , and in the midst she beheld Frederick , with blood streaming from his face .
A key , a large key down his back -- a key -- has nobody a key ?
a puff ball !
come down this minute , or he ' ll be dead !
" That ' s more than he deserves .
"
"
" Oh , Miss Eden , your beautiful India muslin !
take care of the chimney sweeper , for heaven ' s sake .
" It ' s my brother , will he die ?
You see Mr . Frederick Montague only in a masquerade dress .
Mr . Frederick , we ' ll keep your counsel .
Come , Mr . Frederick , this way , into my room , and I ' ll give you a towel and some clean water , and you can get rid of this masquerade dress .
Bless me !
" Here ," said Mr . Eden , opening the door of his room , which was on the opposite side of the hall to Mrs . Tattle ' s .
" Nay , my room ' s at Mr . Frederick Montague ' s service , and my door ' s open too .
" Forgive thee !-- and what have I to forgive !
" cried Frederick ; " all that concerns myself , I mean .
Sir , I disguised myself in this dress ; I came up to your room to - night on purpose to see you , without your knowing it , that I might mimic you .
This boy said he would not stand by and hear you laughed at ; that you had saved his life ; that I ought to be ashamed of myself ; that you had just given me half a crown ; and so you had ; but I went on , and told him I ' d knock him down if he said another word .
" said Frederick to Mr . Eden , seizing hold of his hand .
I hope for the future I shall behave like a gentleman .
" Frederick will never be persuaded again by anybody to do what he does not think right : and now , brother , you may wash your black countenance .
my son !
" Nay ," interrupted Bertha , " let my brother tell the story this time .
Thou hast told it once , and told it well ; no one but my brother could tell it better .
Now , indeed , Mr . Frederick , your papa and mamma have reason to be angry .
gone !
no sign of them in my closet , or anywhere .
He went over to Archer , who , considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy , received him with open arms , and translated his whole lesson without expressing MUCH contempt for his stupidity .
It was a prize which was to be won by his own exertions ; but he suffered himself to consider it as an affair of chance .
Come , do open this new playhouse of yours to - night .
" echoed a multitude of voices .
"
De Grey looked on superior .
There was a blank space before them .
What strange voice is that ?
" said Archer .
Everybody looked round to see where the voice came from .
At length she fixed her eyes on De Grey .
" Well , woman ," said he , " what do you want with me ?
"
" I -- what do I want ?
"
for you will make your own fortune , and the fortune of all that belong to you !
" And I ' m one of them , remember that ," cried Fisher .
"
" cried Fisher with joy .
" Nobody COULD make it out but ME ," replied the gipsy .
"
I must be gone .
He had privately slipped two good shillings into the gipsy ' s hand to secure her ; for he was willing to pay any price for ANY means of acquiring power .
This appeared to his friends and to himself an inexhaustible treasure .
Amongst these , Fisher was distinguished by his knowledge of all the streets and shops in the adjacent town ; and , though a dull scholar , he had such reputation as a man of business , that whoever had commissions to execute at the confectioner ' s , was sure to apply to him .
" when he saw that the old theatre was pulled down .
"
"
" It cannot be a stroke aimed at ' you and your party ,' for he does not know that you HAVE a party .
" Before I came here you reigned alone , now your reign is over , Mr . De Grey .
" I won ' t be governed by any man ' s reasons that he won ' t tell me ," cried Archer .
"
" Because we who know him , have never known him capricious .
" No ," said De Grey ; " for that very reason _I_ speak who do know him .
" I will be in a passion .
"
"
"
" Out of my senses !
" At the door Archer was stopped by Mr . Chip .
The stuff is all laid out and delivered .
" YAnder , within !
"
Mr . Chip scrupled and hesitated , and began to talk of " THE DOCTOR .
" Well , Master Archer ," said he , " there ' s no refusing you nothing .
You have such a way of talking one out of it .
Follow your leader ," cried he , sounding his well known whistle as a signal .
" Did you ever hear of such a thing as a ' BARRING OUT ,' my friends ?
Archer gave the history of a " Barring Out ," in which he had been concerned at his school , in which the boys stood out against the master , and gained their point at last , which was a week ' s more holidays at Easter .
" All schoolmasters are tyrants -- are not they ?
"
" Get !-- everything !-- what we want !-- which is everything to lads of spirit - - victory and liberty !
Bar him out till he repeals his tyrannical law ; till he lets us into our own theatre again , or till he tells us his ' GOOD REASONS ' against it .
Go !
"
" It would have taken up too much time to examine what " THE RIGHT " was .
" My advice to you , Archer , is , to do nothing in this till we have consulted , YOU KNOW WHO , about whether it ' s right or wrong .
" The old woman ," said Fisher , gravely ; " the gipsy .
" I know , I know ," said Fisher , " and what she said about your friends being lucky -- that went a great way with many ," added he , with a sagacious nod of his head ; " I can tell you THAT -- more than you think .
Archer knew too well how to govern fools , to attempt to reason with them ; and , instead of laughing any longer at Fisher ' s ridiculous superstition , he was determined to take advantage of it .
lost !
"
" No ," said the gipsy , " not if you trust to me for food , and if you give me money enough .
So , as Fisher thought it was possible that Archer , clever as he was , might be disappointed in his supplies , he determined to take secret measures for himself .
"
He had , within the last two hours , got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom ; he had , with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party , sent into the town for provisions , at his own expense , which would make a handsome supper for that night ; he had also negotiated with some cousins of his , who lived in the town , for a constant supply in future .
" Stupidity !
" Enough !
Away went Fisher .
So I got leave .
"
A dunce always thinks it clever to cheat even by SOBER LIES .
Order and punctuality , it appears , are necessary even in a Barring Out ; and even rebellion must have its laws .
When he had got all his books together under his arm , he let one of them fall ; and whilst he stooped to pick it up , Archer gave the signal .
"
" Let you out !
No , no , my little Greybeard ," said Archer , catching hold of him , and dragging him to the window bars .
Manager ," cried Townsend .
Let everyone take care of himself .
" cried they .
" Tell me what ' s the Latin for cold roast beef ?
" said Fisher , exultingly , and they returned to their feast .
Long and loud they revelled .
"
" Your good health , Mr .
" Don ' t swear , Mr .
"
" said Archer .
" It ' s a wonder NOBODY ever thought of the trap - door !
As the house was new to him , and the ceiling being newly white - washed , the opening was scarcely perceptible .
Archer in a fury dashed it to the ground .
"
Or else --
'"
In vain they roared in chorus .
In vain they tried to appear gay .
" This next chap is quick enough ; but , then , he is so fond of having everything his own way .
And this curl pated monkey , who is grinning in his sleep , is all tongue and no brains .
I might kick him for my football this half hour before I should get him awake .
This poor little fellow that we hunted into the corner has more sense than all of them put together ; but then he is a Greybeard .
And how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set , when , for each individual of which it was composed , he felt such supreme contempt ?
If these be not good reasons , none better can be assigned for Archer ' s conduct .
Here ' s some diversion for you -- up !
" Now for breakfast !
This ventilator Archer had taken down , and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure ; but , upon examination , it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back , which it was impossible to penetrate or remove .
That feast had been spread with such imprudent profusion , that little now remained to satisfy the hungry guests .
I ' ll give you one whole one for yourself , if you will unbar the window for me .
"
But stay ; there is something of more consequence than your twelve buns .
It may have surprised the intelligent reader that the gipsy was so punctual to her promise to Fisher , but we must recollect that her apparent integrity was only cunning ; she was punctual that she might be employed again , that she might be intrusted with the contribution which , she foresaw , must be raised amongst the famishing garrison .
No sooner had she received the money than her end was gained .
They listened with hungry ears , but no signal was heard .
Have not I divided the last morsel with you ?
I have not tasted one mouthful today !
I was not going to touch this last morsel myself .
fools !
"
" Here ," said he , striking his hand upon the little boy ' s shoulder , " here ' s the only one amongst you who has not uttered one word of reproach or complaint , and he has had but one bit of bread -- a bit that I gave him myself this day .
Here !
" I like you now ," said the little boy , courageously ; " but I love De Grey better ; he has always been my friend , and he advised me never to call myself any of those names , Archer or Greybeard ; so I won ' t .
He turned away from the little boy , and sitting down at one end of the table , hid his face in his hands .
"
" He has forsaken us !
He deserts his party !
"
" I am not going to leave you ," cried Archer .
Others , stretching their arms , and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room , wished for air , or food , or water .
Fisher and his nine , who had such firm dependence upon the gipsy , now gave themselves up to utter despair .
It was eight o ' clock , growing darker and darker every minute , and no candles , no light could they have .
Some he reminded of their promises ; others he praised for former prowess ; and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business .
Townsend , in particular , stood laughing and looking on .
" Ask my party ," said Fisher , terrified ; " they set me on ; ask my party .
Why not ?
What signifies such a party -- all mute ?
" What signifies SUCH a party , indeed ?
" So , depending upon the sullen silence of the assembly , he again approached Archer with a cord .
A large basket !
Huzza !
Joy and gratitude sparkled in every face when he unpacked his basket , and spread the table with a plentiful breakfast .
So what signifies mouthing about persuading and convincing ?
" But ," said De Grey , " when we yield , I hope it will not be merely to get our dinner , gentlemen .
When we yield , Archer --"
I have no power , no party , you see !
" cried he , going to the ventilator .
" Round to the window then , and fill our bag .
We ' ll let it down , my lad , in a trice ; bar me out who can !
" said the voice from without ; " the gardener will come from dinner , else , and we shall be caught .
He mounted guard all yesterday at the ventilator ; and though I watched and watched till it was darker than pitch , I could not get near you .
Make haste , pull away !
" The heavy bag was soon pulled up .
" said Archer .
" Several times the bag descended and ascended ; and at every unlading of the crane , fresh acclamations were heard .
" at length the boy with the tailor ' s bag cried .
" Off with you , then ; we ' ve enough , and thank you .
Archer , in the height of his glory , looked on , the acknowledged master of the whole .
Townsend , who , in his prosperity as in adversity , saw and enjoyed the comic foibles of his friends , pushed De Grey , who was looking on with a more good - natured and more thoughtful air .
Besides , anybody can make puns ; and one doesn ' t want wit , either , at all times ; for instance , when one is going to settle about dinner , or business of consequence .
I never thought he ' d have come .
"
" Hey - day !
In the middle of his own party too !
I have felt the want of a friend , and I am determined to make one if I can .
unbar the windows !
" REASONABLE !
"
" But ," said Archer , " we have not always time enough to reason AT FIRST .
"
"
"
Then , indeed you are unreasonable !
Punish me as you think proper .
I feel no anger ; you have done me no injury .
"
Here many of the little boys looked timidly up to the windows .
"
"
Without obedience to the laws ," added he , turning to Archer , " as men , you cannot be suffered in society .
You , sir , think yourself a man , I observe ; and you think it the part of a man not to submit to the will of another .
Archer , proud to be treated like a reasonable creature , and sorry that he had behaved like a foolish schoolboy , was silent for some time , but at length replied , " That he would rather not name his own punishment .
"
" I deserve your confidence , I hope ," said Dr . Middleton ; " for it is my first wish to make you all happy .
"
I have had the place cleaned , and you may return to it when you please .
The gipsies were yesterday removed from the town .
"
To obtain credit for the tinder - box and candles , he made use of THIS name ," said he , turning to the other side of the bill , and pointing to De Grey ' s name , which was written at the end of a copy of one of De Grey ' s exercises .
" In vain he solicited Archer and De Grey to intercede for him .
Everybody turned away with contempt ; and he sneaked out , whimpering in a doleful voice , " What shall I say to my Aunt Barbara ?
THE BRACELETS .
This task she had undertaken ; and twenty young persons were put under her care , with the perfect confidence of their parents .
To the one , therefore , they patiently submitted , and in the other consciously rejoiced .
Many loved Leonora , but none were ever governed by her , for she was too indolent to govern .
"
you whose hearts are elated with success , whose bosoms beat high with joy in the moment of triumph , command yourselves .
She was full of spirits and vanity .
Running down the flight of steps which led to the garden , in her violent haste , Cecilia threw down the little Louisa , who had a china mandarin in her hand , which her mother had sent her that very morning , and which was all broken to pieces by her fall .
" cried Louisa , bursting into tears .
The crowd behind Cecilia suddenly stopped .
Louisa sat on the lowest step , fixing her eyes upon the broken pieces .
Then , turning round , she hid her face in her hands upon the step above her .
The crowd behind laughed , too .
"
Cecilia , interrupting her , " Oh , pray let me hear no more about Louisa !
"
"
Who sang so sweetly as Leonora ?
"
" What are you doing there , little one ?
"
"
"
I have not eaten one of them ; they are all for your friend Leonora .
See how unjust you are !
"
that ' s a cant word which you learnt of my friend Leonora , as you call her ; but she is not my friend now .
"
" Not your friend now !
" cried Cecilia , catching hold of her .
They are all gone !
" said she ; and she hid her face in Leonora ' s lap .
gone where ?
" There she is !
"
"
"
" Who is there ?
" said Mrs . Villars .
" It is I , madam .
"
"
Her vanity was now as much mortified as in the morning it had been elated .
"
" But , my dear , how can Leonora tell whether your heart be good or bad ?
"
"
"
No human being becomes wicked all at once .
A man begins by doing wrong because it is , or because he thinks it , for his interest .
"
" Indeed , madam , I never did , until everybody told me so , and then I began to be frightened about it .
" Yes , indeed , madam -- very sorry .
" Then make that sorry of use to you , Cecilia , and fix it steadily in your thoughts , as you hope to be good and happy , that if you suffer yourself to yield to your passion upon every occasion , anger and its consequences will become familiar to your mind ; and , in the same proportion , your sense of shame will be weakened , till what you began with doing from sudden impulse you will end with doing from habit and choice : then you would , indeed , according to our definition , have a bad heart .
" Good - night to you , Cecilia ," said Mrs . Villars , as she was crossing the hall .
She could not go to sleep ; but she lay awake , reflecting upon the events of the preceding day , and forming resolutions for the future , at the same time that she had resolved , and resolved without effect , she wished to give her mind some more powerful motive .
They formed the most beautiful gradation of colours , from the palest auburn to the brightest black .
was now the question .
A slight difference in the manner makes a very material one in the effect .
Cecilia , though she was capable of acknowledging any of her faults in public before all her companions , could not humble herself in private to Leonora .
So great an influence upon our manners and conduct have the objects of our ambition .
Active love arises spontaneously in the mind , after feeling particular instances of kindness , without reflection on the past conduct or general character .
It exceeds the merits of its object , and is connected with a feeling of generosity , rather than with a sense of justice .
In the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells ; nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening .
Then , first returning into the hall , she found the peddler just unbuckling his box , and taking it off his shoulders .
" Alack - a - day , miss , I had a great stock of that same chinaware ; but now I ' m quite out of them kind of things ; but I believe ," said he , rummaging one of the deepest drawers , " I believe I have one left , and here it is .
" Cecilia paid the money , and was just going to carry off the mandarin , when the peddler took out of his great - coat pocket a neat mahogany case .
Cecilia contemplated it with delight .
" And how much does it cost ?
" said she ; " then I can ' t have it .
" Is this the same that I had before ?
" Why , ma ' am ," said he , " since you ' ve taken such a fancy to the piece , if you ' ve a mind to make up the remainder of the money , I will take this here little box , if you care to part with it .
"
Now this box was a keepsake from Leonora to Cecilia .
" Oh , miss !
"
In vain Cecilia ran to the rest of her companions , to display her present , in hopes that the applause of others would restore her own self - complacency ; in vain she saw the Flora pass in due pomp from hand to hand , each vying with the other in extolling the beauty of the gift and the generosity of the giver .
Cecilia was still displeased with herself , with them , and even with their praise .
In giving her change , the peddler took out of his pocket , with some halfpence , the very box which Cecilia had sold to him .
Leonora did not in the least suspect the truth , for her mind was above suspicion ; and besides , she had the utmost confidence in Cecilia .
The peddler named the price , and Leonora took the box .
"
that out of which she used to give me Barbary drops .
" Yes ," she replied calmly , " I see that ; but it is no proof that it is Cecilia ' s .
" That may be ," said Louisa ; " but I remember scratching that L with my own needle , and Cecilia scolded me for it , too .
" Louisa ," she began , but at this instant she heard a step , which , by its quickness , she knew to be Cecilia ' s , coming along the passage .
"
" Well ," replied Louisa , " and that would have been enough , surely ; but what a beautiful crown of roses !
Dear Cecilia , I ' m very much obliged to you ; but I won ' t take it by way of payment for the mandarin you broke ; for I ' m sure you could not help that , and , besides , I should have broken it myself by this time .
"
Louisa stopped short and coloured ; the word keepsake recalled the box to her mind , and all the train of ideas which the Flora had banished .
" All eyes glanced first at Cecilia , and then at Leonora .
" Oh Cecilia , there was a time when you could not have neglected me so !
Have you forgot that the bracelet --"
is this the evening ?
" inquired Leonora .
" But why should it give her pain ?
" Nay , Louisa , surely you don ' t think Cecilia jealous ?
"
Cecilia has been with us this half - hour .
"
" cried Louisa ; " don ' t stay ; they are so angry .
During all this time , Cecilia had been in the garden with her companions .
I , who hoped to restore my friendship to her as an honour !
" We are not rivals , but friends , I hope ," said she .
" One , two , three , four ; the numbers are both equal .
I have deceived you ; I have sold --"
She had heard all that passed , from her window .
"
" And Louisa also desired me ," said she , " to return to you this Flora .
" exclaimed Cecilia ; " now I have no hope left .
It is she who has given you the prize ; it was she who persuaded Louisa to give you her vote .
' Whilst Louisa was speaking ," continued Mrs . Villars , " I saw this silver box lying on the bed .
If anybody else had told me so , I could not have believed them , because I remember the box so well ; but I can ' t help believing Leonora .
said I .
I guessed her reason .
oh , yes , Louisa ," exclaimed everybody with one voice .
" Yes ," said Mrs . Villars , " and let Cecilia carry the bracelet to her ; she deserves that reward .

A great number of them bring fish for sale to town from Santa Lucia ; others are very often seen about the arsenals , or wherever carpenters are at work , employed in gathering up the chips and pieces of wood ; or by the sea - side , picking up sticks , and whatever else has drifted ashore , which , when their basket is full , they carry away .
The advantages of truth and honesty , and the value of a character for integrity , are very early felt amongst these little merchants in their daily intercourse with each other .
The most cunning cheat is at last detected and disgraced .
The boy profited much by his father ' s precepts , and more by his example ; he always heard his father speak the truth , and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody .
In all his childish traffic , Francisco , imitating his parents , was scrupulously honest , and therefore all his companions trusted him --" As honest as Francisco ," became a sort of proverb amongst them .
" As honest as Francisco ," repeated Piedro ' s father , when he one day heard this saying .
" With the idea of making his son SHARP he made him cunning .
After being idle for a whole day , he would cast his line or his nets , and if he was lucky enough to catch a fine fish , he would go and show it in triumph to his neighbour the gardener .
"
" He ' ll do well enough in the world , you will find ," answered the fisherman , carelessly .
You are a droll chap ," said his father , " and will sell my fish cleverly , I ' ll be bound .
He proceeded to the market , and he offered his fish with assiduity to every person whom he thought likely to buy it , especially to those upon whom he thought he could impose .
"
" Was it caught to - day ?
On his road homewards from Naples to the little village of Resina , where his father lived , he overtook Francisco , who was leading his father ' s ass .
You ' ll allow I ' m no fool , Francisco , and that I ' m in a fair way to grow rich , if I go on as I have begun .
" Stay ," said Francisco ; " you forgot that the booby you took in to - day will not be so easily taken in to - morrow .
"
there are people enough to buy fish in Naples .
"
"
Ay , stroke the long ears of your ass , and look as wise as you please .
This was certain , that Francisco was so well known for his honesty amongst all the people at Naples with whom his father was acquainted , that everyone was glad to deal with him ; and as he never wronged anyone , all were willing to serve him -- at least , as much as they could without loss to themselves : so that after the market was over , his panniers were regularly filled by the gardeners and others with whatever he wanted .
Though he had simplicity enough to be easily cheated once , he had too much sense to be twice made a dupe .
fresh fish !
I ' ll come to the vineyard if it was ten miles off ; and all the time we stay in Naples ( may it not be so long as I fear it will !
What can I want more ?
"
One day , when he was returning from the market in a very bad humour , in consequence of these reproaches , and of his not having found customers for his goods , he espied his SMART son Piedro at a little merchant ' s fruit - board devouring a fine gourd with prodigious greediness .
" The money , father ," said Piedro , " that I got for the fish yesterday , and that I meant to give you to - day , before you went out .
" said his father .
Piedro saw that his father was in a passion , and knew that he was beaten because he was found out to be a rogue , rather than for being one .
"
Piedro writhed with bodily pain as he left the market after his drubbing , but his mind was not in the least amended .
Not one of the little Neapolitan merchants would either enter into partnership with him , give him credit , or even trade with him for ready money .
* Chartres .
Such had been Piedro ' s wretched education , that even the hard lessons of experience could not alter its pernicious effects .
' Yes , take as many figs as you will ," continued he ; and held his basket closer to Piedro , who , as he saw , cast a hungry eye upon one of the ripe figs .
We never see you in the markets as we used to do .
"
" I would rather BE than seem your friend , if I could ," said Francisco .
" Partnership !
" Can ' t you ?
" But don ' t make me say anything that is not true ," said Francisco , pausing .
" No , to be sure not ," said Piedro ; " I DO mean to give no room for scandal .
Piedro made a good beginning , and gave what several of the younger customers thought excellent bargains .
His grapes and figs were quickly sold , and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply ; and thus he went on for some time , conducting himself with scrupulous honesty , so that he acquired some credit among his companions .
They no longer watched him with suspicious eyes .
But Piedro was in too great haste to get rich to take time into his account .
He observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums , and of burnt almonds .
'".
" Ha !
" What !
"
" My character , and that of my board , are too firmly established now for any chance customer like you to injure .
"
Do as you please with your board , but give me my sugar - plums , for I have some right to meddle with those , having paid for them .
"
"
"
A discovery !
" Excellent they were !
" He is a neighbour of ours , and I pitied him ; but since he is at his old tricks again , there ' s an end of the matter .
Bankers and merchants used formerly to count their money , and write their bills of exchange upon benches in the streets ; and when a merchant or banker lost his credit , and was unable to pay his debts , his bench was broken .
The cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous .
Break his bench !
Is there anything else you could think of for me ?
" Trigonometry !
" I looked just as you do now - - I felt just as you do now -- all in a fright and a puzzle , when I first heard of angles and sines , and cosines , and arcs and centres , and complements and tangents .
mercy !
Besides , it will not be the work of a day , I promise you ; but come and see us at your leisure hours , and we ' ll study it together .
I have a great notion we shall become friends ; and , to begin , step in with me now ," said Carlo , " and eat a little macaroni with us .
"
" said Francisco , as he was sitting one morning with his tutor , the carpenter .
" To be sure it will ," said the carpenter , putting down his compasses , with which he was drawing a circle --" Arithmetic is a most useful , and I was going to say necessary thing to be known by men in all stations ; and a little trigonometry does no harm .
" Yes , partly ," said Rosetta .
You know I went out to the carpenter ' s yard , near the arsenal , where all the children are picking up chips and sticks so busily ; and I was as busy as any of them , because I wanted to fill my basket soon ; and then I thought I should sell my basketful directly in the little wood - market .
" Oh , I forgot ; did not I tell you that ?
"
Stay !
It was lying beside his oven .
" cried Rosetta , who ran into the baker ' s shop first ; and as he heard " Stop !
The case was easily explained , and the baker told them that he did not buy any wood in the little market that morning ; that this faggot he had purchased between the hours of twelve and one from a lad about Francisco ' s height , whom he met near the yard of the arsenal .
" Well ," said the baker , " if you will stay here a few minutes , you will probably see the lad who sold it to me .
Arthur could not , especially as he spoke wretched Italian , make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an English trial by jury .
They preferred their own summary mode of proceeding .
Francisco , in whose integrity they all had perfect confidence , was chosen with unanimous shouts for the judge ; but he declined the office , and another was appointed .
But all that he could say could not alter facts .
He handed lemonade about in a part of Naples where he was not known , but he lost his customers by putting too much water and too little lemon into this beverage .
"
"
" Ay , that rule ," said Francisco --" how much I owe to it !
" Take them , then ," said Carlo ; " I wish all Naples could see them , provided they might be liked half as well as I like them .
Arthur was desired to summon the young artist .
The hot ashes from Mount Vesuvius have often been seen upon the roofs of the houses of Naples , from which it is six miles distant .
The little village of Resina is also situated near the spot .
** About the same time , in a pit in the town of Portici , a similar passage underground was discovered , and , by orders of the King of Naples , workmen were employed to dig away the earth , and clear the passage .
Several magnificent buildings of brick , faced with marble of different colours , are partly seen , where the workmen have cleared away the earth and lava with which they were encrusted .
CHAPTER III .
Let us do something for him .
Some weeks after Francisco had been with the painter , they had occasion to look for the front of a temple in one of these large books .
" But , signor , I never saw it ," said Francisco , respectfully , " or , perhaps , I should have preferred it .
Is a taste for the arts to be learned , think you , by looking at the cover of a book like this ?
" Often and often ," cried Francisco , " have I longed to open it ; but I thought it was forbidden me , and however great my curiosity in your absence , I have never touched them .
I hoped indeed , that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me .
Thus , even Francisco ' s talents could not have advanced him in the world , unless they had been united to integrity .
He was much delighted and astonished by the new scene that was now opened to his view ; and as , day after day , he accompanied his master to this subterraneous city , he had leisure for observation .
Francisco made several trials , and at last finished such an excellent copy , that his enthusiastic and generous master , with warm encomiums , carried it immediately to his patron , and he had the pleasure to receive from Mr . Lee a purse containing five guineas , as a reward and encouragement for his pupil .
" Here , my dear mother ," cried Francisco , pouring the guineas into her lap ; " and here ," continued he , emptying a bag which contained about as much more , in small Italian coins , the profits of trade - money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little Neapolitan merchants ; " this is all yours , dearest mother , and I hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow .
Nay , you must not refuse me - - I have set my heart upon the cow being milked by you this very evening ; and I ' ll produce my best bunches of grapes , and my father , perhaps , will give us a melon ; for I ' ve had no time for melons this season ; and I ' ll step to Naples and invite -- may I , mother ?-- my good friends , dear Carlo and your favourite little Rosetta , and my old drawing master , and my friend Arthur , and we ' ll sup with you at your dairy .
The brindled cow was bought , and Arthur and Carlo and Rosetta most joyfully accepted their invitation .
It was a delicious evening ; they left Naples just as the sea - breeze , after the heats of the day , was most refreshingly felt .
most charming !
" The company , who were all pleased with each other , and with the gardener ' s good fruit , which he produced in great abundance , did not think of separating till late .
"
* Tutte le volpi si trovano in pellicera .
" I have no need to steal hats ; I can afford to buy better than you ' ll have upon your head .
" And what would you say to me ?
"
You stare when I tell you I am rich ; but the thing is so .
I hope he came honestly by them ," said Carlo ; " but ever since the affair of the double measure , I suspect double - dealing always from him .
" Compute the morn and evening of their day .
They often follow very early in the morning , or during the night - time , the trace of carriages that are gone , or that are returning from the opera ; and Piedro was one night at this work , when the horses of a nobleman ' s carriage took fright at the sudden blaze of some fireworks .
She was uncertain where she had dropped it ; the shop , the carriage , the street , were searched for it in vain .
Piedro saw it fall as the lady was lifted out of the carriage , seized upon it , and carried it off .
" What brings you here ?
I WILL know .
His father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp , which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood .
He promised him that he should have half of whatever the Jew would give for the diamonds , and Piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction .
Facts are masculine , and words are feminine .
" *
These goods friends seemed to make Francisco happier than Piedro could be made by his stolen diamonds .
He looked , and saw at some paces distant this female fury , who stood guarding the windlass of a well , to which , with threatening gestures and most voluble menaces , she forbade all access .
After having inquired sufficiently , after having seen several wells , in which the water had evidently decreased , and after having seen the mill - wheels that were standing still for want of their usual supply , he hastened home to his father and mother , reported what he had heard and seen , and begged of them to remove , and to take what things of value they could to some distance from the dangerous spot where they now resided .
* Phil .
Some of the inhabitants of Resina , whom he questioned , declared that they had heard strange rumbling noises underground ; and a peasant and his son , who had been at work the preceding day in a vineyard , a little above the village , related that they had seen a sudden puff of smoke come out of the earth , close to them ; and that they had , at the same time , heard a noise like the going off of a pistol .
* These facts are mentioned in Sir William Hamilton ' s account of an eruption of Mount Vesuvius .-- See Phil .
The villagers listened with large eyes and open ears to these relations ; yet such was their habitual attachment to the spot they lived upon , or such the security in their own good fortune , that few of them would believe that there could be any necessity for removing .--" We ' ll see what will happen to - morrow ; we shall be safe here one day longer ," said they .
He ran to his master ' s apartment , and communicated all that he had just heard .
" Has the count abandoned his villa ?
"
What , has there been a fresh eruption ?
" No ; but it will inevitably be blown up .
The wind blows that way .
One spark of fire , and the whole is blown up .
"
Francisco waited not to hear more ; but instantly , without explaining his intentions to anyone , set out for the count ' s villa , and , with a bucket of water in his hand , crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed ; when , reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left , he plunged them into the water , and returned with them in safety over the lava , yet warm under his feet .
He could scarcely believe his eyes , when he saw the rockets and the gunpowder all safe .
It is scarcely a twelvemonth since I drew tears from your eyes .
I have had but few misfortunes in my life .
" To each their sufferings -- all are men Condemn ' d alike to groan ; The feeling for another ' s woes , Th ' unfeeling for his own .
" The same ," said the Improvisatore ; " the same , though in a better dress , which I should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes , though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar .
These were his young companions , who remembered him as a fruit - seller amongst the little merchants .
They rejoiced to hear his praises , and repeated the lines with shouts of applause .
" You are the young man who , last summer , had liked to have tricked me out of my new hat .
Not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the Count de Flora , near Torre del Greco , this morning , by Signor Francisco .
"
"
" said the lad , whom our readers have probably before this time discovered to be Piedro .
" How , pray , is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor ?
" It is a pity ," said Piedro , " that the count has sent Francisco , with his servants down to guard it .
"
"
" A boy , a young lad only , of about my own age ; but I know him to be sturdily honest .
"
"
"
In the course of the morning , inquiries were made secretly amongst the count ' s servants ; and the two men who were engaged to sit up at the villa that night along with Francisco , were bribed to second the views of this gang of thieves .
It was agreed that about midnight the robbers should be let into the house ; that Francisco should be tied hand and foot , whilst they carried off their booty .
Piedro , when he was alone , tried to collect his thoughts -- all his thoughts were full of horror .
He could not doubt but that it was the serious intention of his accomplices to murder Francisco , if he should make any resistance .
His wretched father died some weeks before this time , in a fit of intoxication .
" Oh , that I dared to disobey !
He was pale and trembling , and felt a cold dew spread over him .
His accomplices did not arrive , and , in a sort of impatient terror , the attendant upon an evil conscience , he flung open the door of his cell , and groped his way through the passage which he knew led to the public shop .
The Jew , when Piedro entered the shop , was bargaining with a poor , thin - looking man about some gunpowder .
" I don ' t deny that it has been wet ," said the man , " but since it was in the bucket of water , it has been carefully dried .
"
He imagined that at this moment his fate was decided ; that Saint Januarius deserted him , and that he was undone .
" Speak , then ," said the man , astonished .
I throw myself upon the count ' s mercy .
Hasten to him -- we have no time to lose .
" Now that you are able to go out ," said Francisco ' s father to him , " you must come and look at my new house , my dear son .
Delightful task !
His friend Loveit , on the contrary , wished to be universally liked , and his highest ambition was to be thought the best natured boy in the school -- and so he was .
When they had got it up to three hundred and twenty , the game became very interesting .
" resounded on all sides .
"
" Yes , but you are ," said Hardy , coming forward .
" No ," said Hardy , coolly , after the laugh had somewhat subsided , " I am as little afraid of being flogged as you are , Tarlton ; but I meant --"
" No matter what you meant ; why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings ; nobody thought of asking YOU to stir a step for us ; but we asked Loveit , because he ' s the best fellow in the world .
"
and what Hardy said was only for fear I should get in disgrace ; he ' s the best friend I have .
" No ," said Loveit , " to be sure it does not signify ; but one does not like to be called Little Panado : besides ," added he , after going a few steps farther , " they ' ll all think it so ill - natured .
"
" But , I assure you , I won ' t stay a minute ; wait for me ," added Loveit ; and he slunk back again to prove that he was not Little Panado .
Once returned , the rest followed , of course ; for to support his character of good - nature he was obliged to yield to the entreaties of his companions , and to show his spirit , leapt over the gate , amidst the acclamations of the little mob :-- he was quickly out of sight .
"
"
" Oh , indeed !
" Well , then ," cried Tarlton , giving his hand to the boy next him , then to the next , " your word and honour that you won ' t betray me ; but stand by me , and I ' ll stand by you .
"
" Why , I don ' t know you , I declare I don ' t know you to - day ," said Tarlton ; " you used to be the best natured most agreeable lad in the world , and would do anything one asked you ; but you ' re quite altered of late , as we were saying just now , when you skulked away with Hardy : come ,-- do , man , pluck up a little spirit , and be one of us , or you ' ll make us all HATE YOU .
"
It is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad .
There was a small window at the end of the back staircase , through which , between nine and ten o ' clock at night , Tarlton , accompanied by Loveit and another boy , crept out .
They quickened their pace , and with some difficulty scrambled through the hedge which fenced the garden , though not without being scratched and torn by the briers .
nothing at all !
In the meantime , the visits to the apple - tree had been now too frequently repeated to remain concealed from the old man who lived in the cottage .
Let me see -- oh , ay , that will do ; I will borrow farmer Kent ' s dog Barker , he ' ll keep them off , I ' ll answer for it .
Farmer Kent lent his dog Barker , cautioning his neighbour , at the same time , to be sure to chain him well , for he was the fiercest mastiff in England .
There was just moonlight enough to see the dog .
" He ' ll break his chain and tear us to pieces ," cried Tarlton ; and , struck with terror , he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him , and betook himself to flight , with the greatest precipitation .
The next morning Loveit could not help reproaching the party with their conduct .
Everyone for himself in this world !
"
why , yes ; I thought you all loved me !
" Pugh !
Compared with his friend Hardy , his new associates did indeed appear contemptible ; for all this time Hardy had treated him with uniform kindness , avoided to pry into his secrets , yet seemed ready to receive his confidence , if it had been offered .
"
"
"
" Come a little farther however ," said Tarlton , looking round suspiciously .
" Yes .
" What ' s that ?
" How came you by it ?
" I don ' t want to hear what he ' ll say ," cried Loveit , vehemently : " the dog will die in agonies -- in agonies !
" replied Tarlton , in an audacious tone , as if he meant to set his inquiring eye at defiance .
" They both went to the top of the stairs to call Tom ; no one answered .
And as he was receiving Hardy ' s commission , Loveit saw the corner of the blue handkerchief hanging out of his pocket .
" He ' s gone to do it !
" cried Hardy , starting up .
speak out at once !
" I want the poisoned meat that you have in your pocket .
I didn ' t !
" I thought I should find you out at last .
" Hardy obeyed without reply .--" Hardy !
" Hardy obeyed in silence .
"
" looking at him with a menacing air : " what is all this ?
" Hardy was silent .
" Why don ' t you speak ?
" Sir ," continued Hardy , " ever since I have been at school , I never told a lie , and therefore , sir , I hope you will believe me now .
Upon my word and honour , sir , I have done nothing wrong .
" There , sir , take up your lodging there for to - night ," said he , pushing him in ; " tomorrow I ' ll know more , or I ' ll know why ," added he , double locking the door , with a tremendous noise , upon his prisoner , and locking also the door at the end of the passage , so that no one could have access to him .
" So now I think I have you safe !
The conversation which had passed between Hardy and Mr . Power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to ; but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard .
All assembled in the morning with faces of anxiety .
Tarlton and Loveit ' s were the most agitated : Tarlton for himself , Loveit for his friend , for himself , for everybody .
what shall we all do ?
They listened --" Here he is coming !
They knelt down to prayers , and the moment they rose , Mr . William Power , laying his hand upon the table , cried , " Stand still , gentlemen , if you please .
" Everybody stood stock still ; he walked out of the circle ; they guessed that he was gone for Hardy , and the whole room was in commotion .
" Well , sir ," said Mr . Power , sitting down in Mr . Trueman ' s elbow - chair , and placing the prisoner opposite to him ; " well , sir , what have you to say to me this morning ?
" Nothing , sir ," answered Hardy , in a decided , yet modest manner ; " nothing but what I said last night .
" I told him you ' d not believe your own eyes .
"
Mr . Trueman advanced with a slow step .
"
" I , sir ?
"
" said Mr . Trueman , taking one out of the basket .
"
" Nonsense -- cunning !
" Don ' t you know this handkerchief , sir ?
"
" Don ' t you know whose it is ?
I will begin with the eldest of you ; I will begin with Hardy , and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned .
" J .
T .!
" Take your handkerchief -- go out of this room -- out of this house ; let me never see you more .
" I am sure ," thought Loveit , " this is a lesson I shall never forget .
" * PAUL ET VIRGINIE .
They thought themselves very happy when the good old woman first took them into her hut and bid them warm themselves at her small fire , and gave them a crust of mouldy bread to eat .
She had not much to give , but what she had she gave with good - will .
You often say that you are tired , and then you know that you cannot spin all that time .
Now if we might go up the hill , and put the stones behind the wheels , you could sit still at your work , and would not the people give us the halfpence ?
and could not we bring them all to you ?
" Yes ," said the old woman ; " I will try what you can do ; but I must go up the hill along with you for the first two or three times , for fear you should get yourselves hurt .
She said that they had been useful to her , and that her spinning had gone on finely , because she had been able to sit still at her wheel all day .
"
" Only a pinch -- only one pinch that I got , as I was putting a stone behind a wheel of a chaise .
I ' ll make it of some use , if I may have it .
I wish it was morning , and that a carriage would come , that I might run up the hill , and try my scotcher .
"
Stand you hereabouts , half - way up the hill , and the moment you see any carriage coming along the road , run as fast as you can and call me .
"
Then she stood still , and looked again , and she saw no carriage ; so she went sorrowfully into the field , and to the hedge where her brother was gathering blackberries , and she said , " Paul , I ' m sadly tired , SADLY TIRED !
Perhaps a carriage might go by whilst you are standing here talking to me .
" But , oh , brother , look at this !
" No , indeed , it is not ," cried Paul , " it is no halfpenny ; it is a guinea , a bright golden guinea !
" Is it ?
I ' ll run to the fruit - stall , and ask the woman ; shall I ?
"
Not so well as my grandmother .
But now I ' ll tell you what I am thinking of , Anne , that we might buy something for my grandmother , that would be very useful to her indeed , with the guinea -- something that would last a great while .
" What , brother ?
" I know , I know what you mean !
I know where blankets can be got .
Do you remember how she used to shiver with the cold last winter ?
"
" And you ' ll bring the blanket to me , and I shall make the bed very neatly , that will be all right -- all happy !
We cannot buy the blanket , I ' m afraid .
"
" Why , Paul , why ?
" Because I don ' t think this guinea is honestly ours .
"
' Now , if she gave you the guinea , she must have given it to you by mistake .
There was a gentleman reading in one of the chaises and a lady , who looked very good - naturedly at me , and then the gentleman put down his book and put his head out of the window , and looked at your scotcher , brother , and he asked me if that was your own making ; and when I said yes , and that I was your sister he smiled at me , and put his hand into his waistcoat pocket , and threw a handful of halfpence into the hat , and I daresay he gave us the guinea along with them because he liked your scotcher so much .
" Then , as we are not quite certain , had not we best go and ask my grandmother what she thinks about it ?
I am very glad that you did not buy either the plums or the blanket with this guinea .
However , we are doing what is honest , and that is a comfort .
Here , we must go through this gateway , into the inn - yard ; we are come to the ' Dun Cow .
" Cow !
Come , never mind looking at it now ; I want to find out the green chaise that has John Nelson ' s name upon it .
" said a waiter , who almost ran over Paul , as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle - rack .
" You ' ve no business here , crowding up the yard .
"
" Pray give me leave , sir ," said Paul , " to stay a few minutes , to look amongst these chaises for one dark green chaise with red wheels , that has Mr . John Nelson ' s name written upon it .
" What ' s that he says about a dark green chaise ?
"
" Oh , they will be trampled upon !
Here ' s the postillion can tell you so .
He is going to bed ; he is tired and can ' t see you himself .
He pushed them towards the door ; but the basket - woman whispered to them as they went out , " Wait in the street till I come to you .
" NO BAD HIT ," was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times .
Joe !
Pray , what would you have the conscience , I wonder now , to charge me for these here half - dozen little mats to put under my dishes ?
"
"
Do you like to be employed or to be idle best ?
" Very much !
" But ," said Anne , " we must tell all this to grandmother , and ask her about it ; and I ' m afraid -- though I ' m very happy -- that it is getting very late , and that we should not stay here any longer .
I ' ll walk with you , and see you safe home myself .

What do you see ?-- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .
How then is this ?
Are the green fields gone ?
But though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine - tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd ' s head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd ' s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .

Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?
And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .
It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not .
But BEING PAID ,-- what will compare with it ?
CHAPTER 2
For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft , because there was a fine , boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island , which amazingly pleased me .
Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen , the Red - Men , first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan ?
And where but from Nantucket , too , did that first adventurous little sloop put forth , partly laden with imported cobblestones -- so goes the story -- to throw at the whales , in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ?
With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket , and only brought up a few pieces of silver ,-- So , wherever you go , Ishmael , said I to myself , as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag , and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south -- wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night , my dear Ishmael , be sure to inquire the price , and don ' t be too particular .
With halting steps I paced the streets , and passed the sign of " The Crossed Harpoons "-- but it looked too expensive and jolly there .
Further on , from the bright red windows of the " Sword - Fish Inn ," there came such fervent rays , that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house , for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard , asphaltic pavement ,-- rather weary for me , when I struck my foot against the flinty projections , because from hard , remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight .
'
Poor Lazarus there , chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow , and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings , he might plug up both ears with rags , and put a corn - cob into his mouth , and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon .
What a fine frosty night ; how Orion glitters ; what northern lights !
Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights ?
go down to the fiery pit itself , in order to keep out this frost ?
Ever and anon a bright , but , alas , deceptive idea would dart you through .-- It ' s the Black Sea in a midnight gale .-- It ' s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements .-- It ' s a blasted heath .-- It ' s a Hyperborean winter scene .-- It ' s the breaking - up of the icebound stream of Time .
But at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the picture ' s midst .
even the great leviathan himself ?
In fact , the artist ' s design seemed this : a final theory of my own , partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom I conversed upon the subject .
A still duskier place is this , with such low ponderous beams above , and such old wrinkled planks beneath , that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft ' s cockpits , especially of such a howling night , when this corner - anchored old ark rocked so furiously .
" But avast ," he added , tapping his forehead , " you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer ' s blanket , have ye ?
All right ; take a seat .
I could not help it , but I began to feel suspicious of this " dark complexioned " harpooneer .
They had just landed from their boat , and this was the first house they entered .
One complained of a bad cold in his head , upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch - like potion of gin and molasses , which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever , never mind of how long standing , or whether caught off the coast of Labrador , or on the weather side of an ice - island .
This man interested me at once ; and since the sea - gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate ( though but a sleeping - partner one , so far as this narrative is concerned ), I will here venture upon a little description of him .
Bulkington !
Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed , more than anybody else ; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea , than bachelor Kings do ashore .
I began to twitch all over .
" So saying he procured the plane ; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench , vigorously set to planing away at my bed , the while grinning like an ape .
It seemed no bad idea ; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it .
" Landlord !
The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle , and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension .
But to - night he went out a peddling , you see , and I don ' t see what on airth keeps him so late , unless , may be , he can ' t sell his head .
" getting into a towering rage .
"
" I tell you what it is , landlord ," said I quite calmly , " you ' d better stop spinning that yarn to me -- I ' m not green .
"
" It ' s broke a ' ready ," said he .
This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery , and showed that the landlord , after all , had had no idea of fooling me -- but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath , engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ?
But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night , and somehow , Sam got pitched on the floor , and came near breaking his arm .
"
I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck .
I then took off my coat , and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves .
This accomplished , however , he turned round -- when , good heavens !
Such a face !
Yes , it ' s just as I thought , he ' s a terrible bedfellow ; he ' s been in a fight , got dreadfully cut , and here he is , just from the surgeon .
They were stains of some sort or other .
At first I knew not what to make of this ; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me .
Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room , he then took the New Zealand head -- a ghastly thing enough -- and crammed it down into the bag .
His bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull .
Even as it was , I thought something of slipping out of the window , but it was the second floor back .
I am no coward , but what to make of this head - peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension .
Meanwhile , he continued the business of undressing , and at last showed his chest and arms .
As I live , these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face ; his back , too , was all over the same dark squares ; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years ' War , and just escaped from it with a sticking - plaster shirt .
I quaked to think of it .
He might take a fancy to mine -- heavens !
But there was no time for shuddering , for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention , and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen .
Remembering the embalmed head , at first I almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner .
But seeing that it was not at all limber , and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony , I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol , which indeed it proved to be .
All these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee , who seemed to be praying in a sing - song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other , during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner .
All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness , and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations , and jumping into bed with me , I thought it was high time , now or never , before the light was put out , to break the spell in which I had so long been bound .
I sang out , I could not help it now ; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me .
save me !
"
He really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way .
For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean , comely looking cannibal .
Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian .
" Landlord ," said I , " tell him to stash his tomahawk there , or pipe , or whatever you call it ; tell him to stop smoking , in short , and I will turn in with him .
Besides , I ain ' t insured .
"
The counterpane was of patchwork , full of odd little parti - coloured squares and triangles ; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure , no two parts of which were of one precise shade -- owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade , his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times -- this same arm of his , I say , looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt .
I felt worse and worse -- at last I got up , dressed , and softly going down in my stockinged feet , sought out my stepmother , and suddenly threw myself at her feet , beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour ; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time .
I now strove to rouse him --" Queequeg !
"-- but his only answer was a snore .
Meanwhile , I lay quietly eyeing him , having no serious misgivings now , and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature .
What under the heavens he did it for , I cannot tell , but his next movement was to crush himself -- boots in hand , and hat on -- under the bed ; when , from sundry violent gaspings and strainings , I inferred he was hard at work booting himself ; though by no law of propriety that I ever heard of , is any man required to be private when putting on his boots .
He was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners .
He was an undergraduate .
At that time in the morning any Christian would have washed his face ; but Queequeg , to my amazement , contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest , arms , and hands .
He then donned his waistcoat , and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash - stand centre table , dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face .
Breakfast .
I cherished no malice towards him , though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow .
This young fellow ' s healthy cheek is like a sun - toasted pear in hue , and would seem to smell almost as musky ; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage .
" now cried the landlord , flinging open a door , and in we went to breakfast .
Not always , though : Ledyard , the great New England traveller , and Mungo Park , the Scotch one ; of all men , they possessed the least assurance in the parlor .
And not only that , but they looked embarrassed .
A curious sight ; these bashful bears , these timid warrior whalemen !
But THAT was certainly very coolly done by him , and every one knows that in most people ' s estimation , to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly .
There weekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men , all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery .
He wears a beaver hat and swallow - tailed coat , girdled with a sailor - belt and sheath - knife .
No town - bred dandy will compare with a country - bred one -- I mean a downright bumpkin dandy -- a fellow that , in the dog - days , will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands .
In bespeaking his sea - outfit , he orders bell - buttons to his waistcoats ; straps to his canvas trowsers .
The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in , in all New England .
In summer time , the town is sweet to see ; full of fine maples -- long avenues of green and gold .
Elsewhere match that bloom of theirs , ye cannot , save in Salem , where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk , their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore , as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of the Puritanic sands .
The sky had changed from clear , sunny cold , to driving sleet and mist .

All these things are not without their meanings .
But somehow I grew merry again .
Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance .
Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being .
However , hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed , and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner ; when , arrayed in a decent suit , he quietly approached the pulpit .
Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity , that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage .
What could be more full of meaning ?-- for the pulpit is ever this earth ' s foremost part ; all the rest comes in its rear ; the pulpit leads the world .
CHAPTER 9
The Sermon .
midships !
"
There was a low rumbling of heavy sea - boots among the benches , and a still slighter shuffling of women ' s shoes , and all was quiet again , and every eye on the preacher .
" In black distress , I called my God , When I could scarce believe him mine , He bowed his ear to my complaints -- No more the whale did me confine .
Nearly all joined in singing this hymn , which swelled high above the howling of the storm .
A brief pause ensued ; the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the Bible , and at last , folding his hand down upon the proper page , said : " Beloved shipmates , clinch the last verse of the first chapter of Jonah --' And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah .
'"
As sinful men , it is a lesson to us all , because it is a story of the sin , hard - heartedness , suddenly awakened fears , the swift punishment , repentance , prayers , and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah .
But all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to do -- remember that -- and hence , he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade .
Miserable man !
For the instant he almost turns to flee again .
' I ' ll sail with ye ,'-- he says ,--' the passage money how much is that ?-- I ' ll pay now .
And taken with the context , this is full of meaning .
The air is close , and Jonah gasps .
'
Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship , and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft , till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat .
"' I am a Hebrew ,' he cries -- and then --' I fear the Lord the God of Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land !
But all in vain ; the indignant gale howls louder ; then , with one hand raised invokingly to God , with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah .
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish ' s belly .
For sinful as he is , Jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance .
And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale .
" Shipmates , God has laid but one hand upon you ; both his hands press upon me .
As we have seen , God came upon him in the whale , and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom , and with swift slantings tore him along ' into the midst of the seas ,' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down , and ' the weeds were wrapped about his head ,' and all the watery world of woe bowled over him .
Then God spake unto the fish ; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea , the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun , and all the delights of air and earth ; and ' vomited out Jonah upon the dry land ;' when the word of the Lord came a second time ; and Jonah , bruised and beaten -- his ears , like two sea - shells , still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean -- Jonah did the Almighty ' s bidding .
And what was that , shipmates ?
He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment ; then lifting his face to them again , showed a deep joy in his eyes , as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm ,--" But oh !
shipmates !
Delight ,-- top - gallant delight is to him , who acknowledges no law or lord , but the Lord his God , and is only a patriot to heaven .
Returning to the Spouter - Inn from the Chapel , I found Queequeg there quite alone ; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time .
With much interest I sat watching him .
He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor .
As I sat there in that now lonely room ; the fire burning low , in that mild stage when , after its first intensity has warmed the air , it then only glows to be looked at ; the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements , and peering in upon us silent , solitary twain ; the storm booming without in solemn swells ; I began to be sensible of strange feelings .
I ' ll try a pagan friend , thought I , since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy .
He made me a present of his embalmed head ; took out his enormous tobacco wallet , and groping under the tobacco , drew out some thirty dollars in silver ; then spreading them on the table , and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions , pushed one of them towards me , and said it was mine .
He then went about his evening prayers , took out his idol , and removed the paper fireboard .
By certain signs and symptoms , I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him ; but well knowing what was to follow , I deliberated a moment whether , in case he invited me , I would comply or otherwise .
I was a good Christian ; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church .
How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood ?
But what is worship ?
Impossible !
But what is worship ?-- to do the will of God -- THAT is worship .
Now , Queequeg is my fellow man .
Yes , we became very wakeful ; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome , and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up ; the clothes well tucked around us , leaning against the head - board with our four knees drawn up close together , and our two noses bending over them , as if our kneepans were warming - pans .
The more so , I say , because truly to enjoy bodily warmth , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast .
Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words , yet subsequent disclosures , when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology , now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give .
It is not down in any map ; true places never are .
Hiding his canoe , still afloat , among these thickets , with its prow seaward , he sat down in the stern , paddle low in hand ; and when the ship was gliding by , like a flash he darted out ; gained her side ; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe ; climbed up the chains ; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck , grappled a ring - bolt there , and swore not to let it go , though hacked in pieces .
The grinning landlord , as well as the boarders , seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg -- especially as Peter Coffin ' s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with .
I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore , and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons .
Not to seem ignorant about the thing -- though in truth he was entirely so , concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrow -- Queequeg puts his chest upon it ; lashes it fast ; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf .
"
Sideways leaning , we sideways darted ; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire ; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes .
"
The schooner was run into the wind , and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat , Queequeg , stripped to the waist , darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap .
For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog , throwing his long arms straight out before him , and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam .
I looked at the grand and glorious fellow , but saw no one to be saved .
He only asked for water -- fresh water -- something to wipe the brine off ; that done , he put on dry clothes , lighted his pipe , and leaning against the bulwarks , and mildly eyeing those around him , seemed to be saying to himself --" It ' s a mutual , joint - stock world , in all meridians .
See what a real corner of the world it occupies ; how it stands there , away off shore , more lonely than the Eddystone lighthouse .
Look at it -- a mere hillock , and elbow of sand ; all beach , without a background .
But these extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois .
With loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters .
CHAPTER 15
It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to anchor , and Queequeg and I went ashore ; so we could attend to no business that day , at least none but a supper and a bed .
It ' s ominous , thinks I .
A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port ; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen ' s chapel ; and here a gallows !
" Come on , Queequeg ," said I , " all right .
There ' s Mrs .
And so it turned out ; Mr . Hosea Hussey being from home , but leaving Mrs . Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs .
Upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed , Mrs . Hussey , postponing further scolding for the present , ushered us into a little room , and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast , turned round to us and said --" Clam or Cod ?
" What ' s that about Cods , ma ' am ?
" Clam or Cod ?
" says I , " but that ' s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter time , ain ' t it , Mrs .
"
hearken to me .
Chowder for breakfast , and chowder for dinner , and chowder for supper , till you began to look for fish - bones coming through your clothes .
The area before the house was paved with clam - shells .
But the chowder ; clam or cod to - morrow for breakfast , men ?
CHAPTER 16
I peered and pryed about the Devil - dam ; from her , hopped over to the Tit - bit ; and finally , going on board the Pequod , looked around her for a moment , and then decided that this was the very ship for us .
You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day , for aught I know ;-- square - toed luggers ; mountainous Japanese junks ; butter - box galliots , and what not ; but take my word for it , you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod .
Planted with their broad ends on the deck , a circle of these slabs laced together , mutually sloped towards each other , and at the apex united in a tufted point , where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the top - knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem ' s head .
And half concealed in this queer tenement , I at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority ; and who , it being noon , and the ship ' s work suspended , was now enjoying respite from the burden of command .
Such eye - wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl .
" Is this the Captain of the Pequod ?
" But what takes thee a - whaling ?
" Well , sir , I want to see what whaling is .
" I am mistaken then .
I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself .
"
Mind what I said about the marchant service -- don ' t aggravate me -- I won ' t have it .
I thought so .
Going forward and glancing over the weather bow , I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood - tide , was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean .
Nor will it at all detract from him , dramatically regarded , if either by birth or other circumstances , he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature .
Be sure of this , O young ambition , all mortal greatness is but disease .
But unlike Captain Peleg -- who cared not a rush for what are called serious things , and indeed deemed those self - same serious things the veriest of all trifles -- Captain Bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism , but all his subsequent ocean life , and the sight of many unclad , lovely island creatures , round the Horn -- all that had not moved this native born Quaker one single jot , had not so much as altered one angle of his vest .
His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character .
Such , then , was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin .
" Bildad ," cried Captain Peleg , " at it again , Bildad , eh ?
" said Bildad , in a hollow tone , and turning round to me .
And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather LONG LAY , yet it was better than nothing ; and if we had a lucky voyage , might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it , not to speak of my three years ' beef and board , for which I would not have to pay one stiver .
But I am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes , and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me , while I am putting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud .
And I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands , especially as I now found him on board the Pequod , quite at home there in the cabin , and reading his Bible as if at his own fireside .
"
the seven hundred and seventy - seventh !
he must have more than that .
The seven hundred and seventy - seventh lay , Captain Peleg .
"
" Captain Peleg ," said Bildad steadily , " thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water , or ten fathoms , I can ' t tell ; but as thou art still an impenitent man , Captain Peleg , I greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one ; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit , Captain Peleg .
fiery pit !
Out of the cabin , ye canting , drab - coloured son of a wooden gun -- a straight wake with ye !
"
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad , but with a marvellous oblique , sliding celerity , Bildad for that time eluded him .
That ' s he ; thank ye , Bildad .
" To be sure ," said Peleg .
" What lay does he want ?
" Oh !
never thee mind about that , Bildad ," said Peleg .
Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg , inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found .
Mark ye , be forewarned ; Ahab ' s above the common ; Ahab ' s been in colleges , as well as ' mong the cannibals ; been used to deeper wonders than the waves ; fixed his fiery lance in mightier , stranger foes than whales .
aye , the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle !
" And a very vile one .
Captain Ahab did not name himself .
It ' s a lie .
Think of that ; by that sweet girl that old man has a child : hold ye then there can be any utter , hopeless harm in Ahab ?
No , no , my lad ; stricken , blasted , if he be , Ahab has his humanities !
And yet I also felt a strange awe of him ; but that sort of awe , which I cannot at all describe , was not exactly awe ; I do not know what it was .
I could only see part of the foot - board of the bed and a line of the wall , but nothing more .
I tried to burst open the door ; but it stubbornly resisted .
murder !
Mrs . Hussey !
"-- and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs again empty - handed , when Mrs . Hussey interposed the mustard - pot and vinegar - cruet , and the entire castor of her countenance .
In as calm , but rapid a manner as possible , I gave her to understand the whole case .
" He ' s killed himself ," she cried .
Where ' s that girl ?-- there , Betty , go to Snarles the Painter , and tell him to paint me a sign , with --" no suicides permitted here , and no smoking in the parlor ;"-- might as well kill both birds at once .
The Lord be merciful to his ghost !
" said the landlady .
There he sat ; and all he could do -- for all my polite arts and blandishments -- he would not move a peg , nor say a single word , nor even look at me , nor notice my presence in the slightest way .
" But not a word did he reply .
And just so I now did with Queequeg .
This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters .
It was after a great feast given by his father the king , on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o ' clock in the afternoon , and all cooked and eaten that very evening .
After all , I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg .
His Mark .
" said I , now jumping on the bulwarks , and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf .
Son of darkness ," he added , turning to Queequeg , " art thou at present in communion with any Christian church ?
" First Congregational Church ," cried Bildad , " what !
" Do tell , now ," cried Bildad , " is this Philistine a regular member of Deacon Deuteronomy ' s meeting ?
Finding myself thus hard pushed , I replied .
" I mean , sir , the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I , and Captain Peleg there , and Queequeg here , and all of us , and every mother ' s son and soul of us belong ; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world ; we all belong to that ; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief ; in THAT we all join hands .
" Young man , you ' d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore - mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon .
I say , Quohog , or whatever your name is , did you ever stand in the head of a whale - boat ?
"
So down we went into the cabin , and to my great joy Queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship ' s company to which I myself belonged .
goodness gracious !
There was young Nat Swaine , once the bravest boat - header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard ; he joined the meeting , and never came to good .
There he stood , very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top - sail in the waist .
" Have ye shipped in her ?
" he repeated .
" You mean the ship Pequod , I suppose ," said I , trying to gain a little more time for an uninterrupted look at him .
" said I , again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner .
"
"
" What did they TELL you about him ?
" That ' s true , that ' s true -- yes , both true enough .
Nothing about the silver calabash he spat into ?
" My friend ," said I , " what all this gibberish of yours is about , I don ' t know , and I don ' t much care ; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head .
" And it ' s said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye .
"
" Come along , Queequeg , let ' s leave this crazy man .
But stop , tell me your name , will you ?
" Elijah .
Elijah !
This circumstance , coupled with his ambiguous , half - hinting , half - revealing , shrouded sort of talk , now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and half - apprehensions , and all connected with the Pequod ; and Captain Ahab ; and the leg he had lost ; and the Cape Horn fit ; and the silver calabash ; and what Captain Peleg had said of him , when I left the ship the day previous ; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig ; and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail ; and a hundred other shadowy things .
Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore , but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp look - out upon the hands : Bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores ; and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after night - fall .
For besides the great length of the whaling voyage , the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery , and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented , it must be remembered , that of all ships , whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds , and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends .
Never did any woman better deserve her name , which was Charity -- Aunt Charity , as everybody called her .
" There are some sailors running ahead there , if I see right ," said I to Queequeg , " it can ' t be shadows ; she ' s off by sunrise , I guess ; come on !
" Lookee here ," said Queequeg , shaking himself , " go ' way !
"
"
"
" He ' s cracked , Queequeg ," said I , " come on .
"
"
" Very dim , very dim ," said Elijah .
morning to ye !
" Oh !
At last , stepping on board the Pequod , we found everything in profound quiet , not a soul moving .
But it seemed that , when on the wharf , Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to ; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter , were it not for Elijah ' s otherwise inexplicable question .
very benevolent countenance then ; but how hard he breathes , he ' s heaving himself ; get off , Queequeg , you are heavy , it ' s grinding the face of the poor .
" Aye , aye , ye are going in her , be ye ?
She sails to - day .
" What Captain ?-- Ahab ?
" And so saying he went on deck , and we followed .
It was now clear sunrise .
Captain Ahab is all ready -- just spoke to him -- nothing more to be got from shore , eh ?
Muster ' em aft here -- blast ' em !
How now !
He seemed to do most of the talking and commanding , and not Bildad .
"
As I hinted before , this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port ; and on board the Pequod , for thirty years , the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor .
"-- was the next command , and the crew sprang for the handspikes .
Meantime , overseeing the other part of the ship , Captain Peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner .
Back the main - yard there !
Stand by to come close alongside , now !
Luck to ye , Starbuck -- luck to ye , Mr . Stubb -- luck to ye , Mr . Flask -- good - bye and good luck to ye all -- and this day three years I ' ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket .
"
Don ' t keep that cheese too long down in the hold , Mr . Starbuck ; it ' ll spoil .
Some chapters back , one Bulkington was spoken of , a tall , newlanded mariner , encountered in New Bedford at the inn .
Let me only say that it fared with him as with the storm - tossed ship , that miserably drives along the leeward land .
Know ye now , Bulkington ?
For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God !
But , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all - abounding adoration !
for almost all the tapers , lamps , and candles that burn round the globe , burn , as before so many shrines , to our glory !
of France , at his own personal expense , fit out whaling ships from Dunkirk , and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket ?
Let a handful suffice .
For in their succourless empty - handedness , they , in the heathenish sharked waters , and by the beaches of unrecorded , javelin islands , battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared .
Ah , the world !
If that double - bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
Whaling is imperial !
Cetus is a constellation in the South !
Drive down your hat in presence of the Czar , and take it off to Queequeg !
No more !
in my desk , then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale - ship was my Yale College and my Harvard .
Postscript .
we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff !
But this , his thinness , so to speak , seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares , than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight .
It was merely the condensation of the man .
" I will have no man in my boat ," said Starbuck , " who is not afraid of a whale .
" Aye , aye ," said Stubb , the second mate , " Starbuck , there , is as careful a man as you ' ll find anywhere in this fishery .
That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor - ruined man .
Nor can piety itself , at such a shameful sight , completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars .
The great God absolute !
who didst not refuse to the swart convict , Bunyan , the pale , poetic pearl ; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold , the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes ; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles ; who didst hurl him upon a war - horse ; who didst thunder him higher than a throne !
A happy - go - lucky ; neither craven nor valiant ; taking perils as they came with an indifferent air ; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase , toiling away , calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year .
Good - humored , easy , and careless , he presided over his whale - boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner , and his crew all invited guests .
For , like his nose , his short , black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face .
You would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe .
The third mate was Flask , a native of Tisbury , in Martha ' s Vineyard .
A short , stout , ruddy young fellow , very pugnacious concerning whales , who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him ; and therefore it was a sort of point of honour with him , to destroy them whenever encountered .
To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs , you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans , and half - believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air .
Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo , a gigantic , coal - black negro - savage , with a lion - like tread -- an Ahasuerus to behold .
Yes , their supreme lord and dictator was there , though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin .
His whole high , broad form , seemed made of solid bronze , and shaped in an unalterable mould , like Cellini ' s cast Perseus .
Threading its way out from among his grey hairs , and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck , till it disappeared in his clothing , you saw a slender rod - like mark , lividly whitish .
So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me , and the livid brand which streaked it , that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood .
He has a quiver of ' em .
But the Pequod was only making a passage now ; not regularly cruising ; nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to , so that there was little or nothing , out of himself , to employ or excite Ahab , now ; and thus chase away , for that one interval , the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow , as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon .
More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile .
But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world .
And all these subtle agencies , more and more they wrought on Ahab ' s texture .
" Then be called ten times a donkey , and a mule , and an ass , and begone , or I ' ll clear the world of thee !
Stop , Stubb ; somehow , now , I don ' t well know whether to go back and strike him , or -- what ' s that ?-- down here on my knees and pray for him ?
And now that I think of it , that ' s about the first thing babies do , and that ' s a sort of queer , too .
didn ' t he call me a dog ?
In old Norse times , the thrones of the sea - loving Danish kings were fabricated , saith tradition , of the tusks of the narwhale .
What business have I with this pipe ?
Next morning Stubb accosted Flask .
The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man .
But , somehow , next moment I was over the fright .
Listen , wise Stubb .
Halloa !
A white whale -- did ye mark that , man ?
Cetology .
" " Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea .
But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written , the above cited extracts will show .
Yet , owing to the long priority of his claims , and the profound ignorance which , till some seventy years back , invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm - whale , and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale - ports ; this usurpation has been every way complete .
As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature .
I promise nothing complete ; because any human thing supposed to be complete , must for that very reason infallibly be faulty .
The awful tauntings in Job might well appal me .
There are some preliminaries to settle .
Charley profanely hinted they were humbug .
Be it known that , waiving all argument , I take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish , and call upon holy Jonah to back me .
Above , Linnaeus has given you those items .
To be short , then , a whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL .
Almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat , but a vertical , or up - and - down tail .
Whereas , among spouting fish the tail , though it may be similarly shaped , invariably assumes a horizontal position .
By the above definition of what a whale is , I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers ; nor , on the other hand , link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien .
the DUODECIMO WHALE .
FOLIOS .
( RIGHT WHALE ).-- In one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans , being the one first regularly hunted by man .
There is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised .
Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans .
Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible , this isolated fin will , at times , be seen plainly projecting from the surface .
The Fin - Back is not gregarious .
Thus , the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale , each has a hump ; but there the similitude ceases .
In various sorts of whales , they form such irregular combinations ; or , in the case of any one of them detached , such an irregular isolation ; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis .
To proceed .
At any rate , the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him , since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one .
He is the most gamesome and light - hearted of all the whales , making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them .
( FOLIO ), CHAPTER V .
( OCTAVO ).
But possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan , most naturalists have recognised him for one .
He is of moderate octavo size , varying from fifteen to twenty - five feet in length , and of corresponding dimensions round the waist .
BOOK II .
I do so now , touching the Black Fish , so - called , because blackness is the rule among almost all whales .
He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature .
From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea - unicorn ' s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison , and as such , preparations of it brought immense prices .
It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies , the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn .
( OCTAVO ), CHAPTER IV .
From what I have seen of him at a distance , I should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus .
Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale , on the ground of its indistinctness .
III .
BOOK III .
Sailors put it on their hones .
Porpoise meat is good eating , you know .
But his mealy - mouth spoils all .
The white comprises part of his head , and the whole of his mouth , which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal - bag .
His oil is much like that of the common porpoise .
For small erections may be finished by their first architects ; grand ones , true ones , ever leave the copestone to posterity .
At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer ; and as such , is but one of the captain ' s more inferior subalterns .
Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward .
But Ahab , my Captain , still moves before me in all his Nantucket grimness and shagginess ; and in this episode touching Emperors and Kings , I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old whale - hunter like him ; and , therefore , all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me .
It is noon ; and Dough - Boy , the steward , thrusting his pale loaf - of - bread face from the cabin - scuttle , announces dinner to his lord and master ; who , sitting in the lee quarter - boat , has just been taking an observation of the sun ; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth , medallion - shaped tablet , reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg .
But ere stepping into the cabin doorway below , he pauses , ships a new face altogether , and , then , independent , hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab ' s presence , in the character of Abjectus , or the Slave .
A problem ?
With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ' s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him .
His were the shinbones of the saline beef ; his would have been the drumsticks .
was a butterless man !
Consider !
After their departure , taking place in inverted order to their arrival , the canvas cloth was cleared , or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward .
It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad , baronial , and superb a person .
And when he would hear Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself , that his bones might be picked , the simple - witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry , by his sudden fits of the palsy .
Now , as the business of standing mast - heads , ashore or afloat , is a very ancient and interesting one , let us in some measure expatiate here .
Admiral Nelson , also , on a capstan of gun - metal , stands his mast - head in Trafalgar Square ; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke , token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where there is smoke , must be fire .
It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast - head standers of the land with those of the sea ; but that in truth it is not so , is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy , the sole historian of Nantucket , stands accountable .
Here , tossed about by the sea , the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull ' s horns .
To be sure , in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you , in the shape of a watch - coat ; but properly speaking the thickest watch - coat is no more of a house than the unclad body ; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle , and cannot freely move about in it , nor even move out of it , without running great risk of perishing ( like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter ); so a watch - coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope , or additional skin encasing you .
With the problem of the universe revolving in me , how could I -- being left completely to myself at such a thought - engendering altitude -- how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whale - ships ' standing orders , " Keep your weather eye open , and sing out every time .
For nowadays , the whale - fishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic , melancholy , and absent - minded young men , disgusted with the carking cares of earth , and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber .
Heed it well , ye Pantheists !
The Quarter - Deck .
" D ' ye mark him , Flask ?
The hours wore on ;-- Ahab now shut up within his cabin ; anon , pacing the deck , with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect .
" Mast - heads , there !
But this did not last long .
"
"-- holding up a broad bright coin to the sun --" it is a sixteen dollar piece , men .
"
While the mate was getting the hammer , Ahab , without speaking , was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket , as if to heighten its lustre , and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself , producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him .
" Moby Dick ?
" Corkscrew !
"
What say ye , men , will ye splice hands on it , now ?
"
art not game for Moby Dick ?
" I am game for his crooked jaw , and for the jaws of Death too , Captain Ahab , if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow ; but I came here to hunt whales , not my commander ' s vengeance .
"
" Hark ye yet again -- the little lower layer .
I meant not to incense thee .
he laughs !
Reckon it .
From this one poor hunt , then , the best lance out of all Nantucket , surely he will not hang back , when every foremast - hand has clutched a whetstone ?
Yet not so much predictions from without , as verifications of the foregoing things within .
So , so ; it goes round excellently .
Well done ; almost drained .
That way it went , this way it comes .
Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him ; the honest eye of Starbuck fell downright .
Perchance ye need it not .
" Stab me not with that keen steel !
but the deed is done !
Once more , and finally , the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew ; when , waving his free hand to them , they all dispersed ; and Ahab retired within his cabin .
Oh !
Or , if you will , like so many ant - hills of powder , they all stand before me ; and I their match .
The prophecy was that I should be dismembered ; and -- Aye !
I lost this leg .
I now prophesy that I will dismember my dismemberer .
Dusk .
Oh !
that revelry is forward !
The long howl thrills me through !
Peace !
Ha !
hem !
Why so ?
lirra , skirra !
Midnight , Forecastle .

I , Ishmael , was one of that crew ; my shouts had gone up with the rest ; my oath had been welded with theirs ; and stronger I shouted , and more did I hammer and clinch my oath , because of the dread in my soul .
For not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible events ,-- as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi ; but , in maritime life , far more than in that of terra firma , wild rumors abound , wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to .
But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work .
There are those this day among them , who , though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale , would perhaps -- either from professional inexperience , or incompetency , or timidity , decline a contest with the Sperm Whale ; at any rate , there are plenty of whalemen , especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the American flag , who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm Whale , but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North ; seated on their hatches , these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe , to the wild , strange tales of Southern whaling .
" And however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these ; yet in their full terribleness , even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson , the superstitious belief in them is , in some vicissitudes of their vocation , revived in the minds of the hunters .
That to attempt it , would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity .
So that here , in the real living experience of living men , the prodigies related in old times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal ( near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface ); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain near Syracuse ( whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy Land by an underground passage ); these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen .
Already several fatalities had attended his chase .
No turbaned Turk , no hired Venetian or Malay , could have smote him with more seeming malice .
He piled upon the whale ' s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down ; and then , as if his chest had been a mortar , he burst his hot heart ' s shell upon it .
When you think it fled , it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form .
Winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where we here stand -- however grand and wonderful , now quit it ;-- and take your way , ye nobler , sadder souls , to those vast Roman halls of Thermes ; where far beneath the fantastic towers of man ' s upper earth , his root of grandeur , his whole awful essence sits in bearded state ; an antique buried beneath antiquities , and throned on torsoes !
The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause .
Gnawed within and scorched without , with the infixed , unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea ; such an one , could he be found , would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes .
But be all this as it may , certain it is , that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him , Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all - engrossing object of hunting the White Whale .
*
* With reference to the Polar bear , it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter , that it is not the whiteness , separately regarded , which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute ; for , analysed , that heightened hideousness , it might be said , only rises from the circumstance , that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love ; and hence , by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds , the Polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast .
*
I cannot tell , can only hint , the things that darted through me then .
never !
I assert , then , that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell ; a truth the more evinced in this , that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses ; and these I have frequently seen , but never with such emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl .
But how had the mystic thing been caught ?
Nor , in quite other aspects , does Nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies , fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible .
Nor , in some historic instances , has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary .
But though without dissent this point be fixed , how is mortal man to account for it ?
To analyse it , would seem impossible .
Or why , irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes , does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy , while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves , followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets ?
Or , to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance , purely addressed to the fancy , why , in reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe , does " the tall pale man " of the Hartz forests , whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groves -- why is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg ?
Old as Pizarro , this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new ; admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay ; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions .
I know that , to the common apprehension , this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible ; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon , especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality .
First : The mariner , when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands , if by night he hear the roar of breakers , starts to vigilance , and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties ; but under precisely similar circumstances , let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness -- as if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him , then he feels a silent , superstitious dread ; the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost ; in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings ; heart and helm they both go down ; he never rests till blue water is under him again .
Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee , " Sir , it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks , as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ?
Look to the bucket !
Then seating himself before it , you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye ; and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank .
At intervals , he would refer to piles of old log - books beside him , wherein were set down the seasons and places in which , on various former voyages of various ships , sperm whales had been captured or seen .
And where Ahab ' s chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of , allusion has only been made to whatever way - side , antecedent , extra prospects were his , ere a particular set time or place were attained , when all possibilities would become probabilities , and , as Ahab fondly thought , every possibility the next thing to a certainty .
Yet the premature hour of the Pequod ' s sailing had , perhaps , been correctly selected by Ahab , with a view to this very complexion of things .
Because , an interval of three hundred and sixty - five days and nights was before him ; an interval which , instead of impatiently enduring ashore , he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt ; if by chance the White Whale , spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feeding - grounds , should turn up his wrinkled brow off the Persian Gulf , or in the Bengal Bay , or China Seas , or in any other waters haunted by his race .
The latter was the eternal , living principle or soul in him ; and in sleep , being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind , which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent , it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing , of which , for the time , it was no longer an integral .
This man and this whale again came together , and the one vanquished the other .
No : the reason was this : that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini , insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea , without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance .
thou famed leviathan , scarred like an iceberg , who so long did ' st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name , whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay ?
Ere long , several of the whales were wounded ; when , suddenly , a very large whale escaping from the boats , issued from the shoal , and bore directly down upon the ship .
*
* The following are extracts from Chace ' s narrative : " Every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations ; he made two several attacks upon the ship , at a short interval between them , both of which , according to their direction , were calculated to do us the most injury , by being made ahead , and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock ; to effect which , the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary .
He came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered , and in which we had struck three of his companions , as if fired with revenge for their sufferings .
Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship , during a black night an open boat , when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore .
" The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing ; the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest , or dashed upon hidden rocks , with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation , seemed scarcely entitled to a moment ' s thought ; the dismal looking wreck , and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE , wholly engrossed my reflections , until day again made its appearance .
In another place -- p . 45 ,-- he speaks of " THE MYSTERIOUS AND MORTAL ATTACK OF THE ANIMAL .
Secondly : The ship Union , also of Nantucket , was in the year 1807 totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset , but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter , though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions to it .
Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter :
Captain D ' Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock , but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured .
In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius , a Christian magistrate of Constantinople , in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general .
Now , in this history of his , Procopius mentions that , during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople , a great sea - monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis , or Sea of Marmora , after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years .
In the Propontis , as far as I can learn , none of that peculiar substance called BRIT is to be found , the aliment of the right whale .
Surmises .
Though , consumed with the hot fire of his purpose , Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick ; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion ; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman ' s ways , altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage .
He knew , for example , that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over Starbuck , yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership ; for to the purely spiritual , the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation .
Starbuck ' s body and Starbuck ' s coerced will were Ahab ' s , so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck ' s brain ; still he knew that for all this the chief mate , in his soul , abhorred his captain ' s quest , and could he , would joyfully disintegrate himself from it , or even frustrate it .
Had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic object -- that final and romantic object , too many would have turned from in disgust .
It was a cloudy , sultry afternoon ; the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks , or vacantly gazing over into the lead - coloured waters .
I was the attendant or page of Queequeg , while busy at the mat .
As I kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp , using my own hand for the shuttle , and as Queequeg , standing sideways , ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads , and idly looking off upon the water , carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn : I say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea , only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword , that it seemed as if this were the Loom of Time , and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the Fates .
Meantime , Queequeg ' s impulsive , indifferent sword , sometimes hitting the woof slantingly , or crookedly , or strongly , or weakly , as the case might be ; and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric ; this savage ' s sword , thought I , which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof ; this easy , indifferent sword must be chance -- aye , chance , free will , and necessity -- nowise incompatible -- all interweavingly working together .
High aloft in the cross - trees was that mad Gay - Header , Tashtego .
she blows !
"
"
" cried Ahab .
" Time !
The ship was now kept away from the wind , and she went gently rolling before it .
One of the men selected for shipkeepers -- that is , those not appointed to the boats , by this time relieved the Indian at the main - mast head .
Such was the thunder of his voice , that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail ; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks ; with a wallow , the three boats dropped into the sea ; while , with a dexterous , off - handed daring , unknown in any other vocation , the sailors , goat - like , leaped down the rolling ship ' s side into the tossed boats below .
" Spread yourselves ," cried Ahab ; " give way , all four boats .
Easy , easy ; don ' t be in a hurry -- don ' t be in a hurry .
Start her -- start her , my silver - spoons !
a word with ye , sir , if ye please !
" returned Starbuck , turning round not a single inch as he spoke ; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew ; his face set like a flint from Stubb ' s .
" What think ye of those yellow boys , sir !
" Smuggled on board , somehow , before the ship sailed .
Give way , men !
Give way !
Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck , this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship ' s company ; but Archy ' s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them , though indeed not credited then , this had in some small measure prepared them for the event .
" Every man look out along his oars !
" cried Starbuck .
Upon this , Daggoo , with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way , swiftly slid aft , and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal .
Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself , under such circumstances .
So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth , but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that .
All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air .
How different the loud little King - Post .
O Lord , Lord !
Crack all your backbones , and bite your knives in two -- that ' s all .
But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger - yellow crew of his -- these were words best omitted here ; for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land .
The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible , owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud - shadows flung upon the sea .
Spring !
Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead , yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat , they knew that the imminent instant had come ; they heard , too , an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter .
Though completely swamped , the boat was nearly unharmed .
Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars , and lashing them across the gunwale , tumbled back to our places .
Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet , hollowing his hand to his ear .
"
"
Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger ; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties ; that every individual moment , indeed , then comprises a peril ; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale - boat in the hunt ?
The Spirit - Spout .
Every sailor swore he saw it once , but not a second time .
For a time , there reigned , too , a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition , as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on , in order that the monster might turn round upon us , and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas .
Close to our bows , strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us ; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea - ravens .
Rather Cape Tormentoto , as called of yore ; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us , we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea , where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish , seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store , or beat that black air without any horizon .
But calm , snow - white , and unvarying ; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky ; still beckoning us on from before , the solitary jet would at times be descried .
By night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed ; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines ; still wordless Ahab stood up to the blast .
All down her sides , this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust , while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar - frost .
Only her lower sails were set .
" Ship ahoy !
But turning to the steersman , who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway , he cried out in his old lion voice ,--" Up helm !
Besides , they would exchange the whaling news , and have an agreeable chat .
Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference ; that is , so long as both parties speak one language , as is the case with Americans and English .
Hence , I conclude , that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman , in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on .
But the whale - boat has no seat astern , no sofa of that sort whatever , and no tiller at all .
Merely make a spread angle of two poles , and you cannot stand them up .
She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians .
For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town - Ho himself .
* The ancient whale - cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast - head , still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin .
She was somewhere to the northward of the Line .
They supposed a sword - fish had stabbed her , gentlemen .
But the captain , having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes ; and therefore being very averse to quit them , and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous , though , indeed , they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather , the ship still continued her cruisings , the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals ; but no good luck came ; more days went by , and not only was the leak yet undiscovered , but it sensibly increased .
Pray , what is a Lakeman , and where is Buffalo ?
' said Don Sebastian , rising in his swinging mat of grass .
They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles , even as the Polynesian waters do ; in large part , are shored by two great contrasting nations , as the Atlantic is ; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East , dotted all round their banks ; here and there are frowned upon by batteries , and by the goat - like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw ; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories ; at intervals , they yield their beaches to wild barbarians , whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams ; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests , where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies ; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey , and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors ; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland , as well as Winnebago villages ; they float alike the full - rigged merchant ship , the armed cruiser of the State , the steamer , and the beech canoe ; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave ; they know what shipwrecks are , for out of sight of land , however inland , they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew .
Thus , gentlemen , though an inlander , Steelkilt was wild - ocean born , and wild - ocean nurtured ; as much of an audacious mariner as any .
" Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest , the Lakeman affected not to notice him , but unawed , went on with his gay banterings .
"' Aye , aye , my merry lads , it ' s a lively leak this ; hold a cannikin , one of ye , and let ' s have a taste .
I tell ye what , men , old Rad ' s investment must go for it !
If old Rad were here now , I ' d tell him to jump overboard and scatter ' em .
They ' re playing the devil with his estate , I can tell him .
"' Damn your eyes !
what ' s that pump stopping for ?
' Lively , boys , lively , now !
Such , gentlemen , is the inflexibility of sea - usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen ; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces .
To this , Radney replied with an oath , in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command ; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman , with an uplifted cooper ' s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by .
" Steelkilt rose , and slowly retreating round the windlass , steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer , deliberately repeated his intention not to obey .
Immediately the hammer touched the cheek ; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head ; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale .
' We have seen many whale - ships in our harbours , but never heard of your Canallers .
"' Canallers , Don , are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal .
"' Aye ?
'
Like Mark Antony , for days and days along his green - turfed , flowery Nile , he indolently floats , openly toying with his red - cheeked Cleopatra , ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck .
But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all ; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck , where , hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass , these sea - Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade .
'
look to those handspikes , my hearties .
'
"' Turn to !
Down ye go .
' cried the ringleader to his men .
Most of them were against it ; but at length , in obedience to Steelkilt , they preceded him down into their dark den , growlingly disappearing , like bears into a cave .
" At sunrise the Captain went forward , and knocking on the deck , summoned the prisoners to work ; but with a yell they refused .
The fetid closeness of the air , and a famishing diet , united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution , had constrained them to surrender at discretion .
And here , gentlemen , the foul play of these miscreants must come out .
" Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader , each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted , it would seem , upon the same piece of treachery , namely : to be foremost in breaking out , in order to be the first of the three , though the last of the ten , to surrender ; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit .
" At sunrise he summoned all hands ; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny , he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round -- thought , upon the whole , he would do so -- he ought to -- justice demanded it ; but for the present , considering their timely surrender , he would let them go with a reprimand , which he accordingly administered in the vernacular .
'
' The mate was in the very act of striking , when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm .
" Just after dark that day , when one watch had retired below , a clamor was heard in the forecastle ; and the two trembling traitors running up , besieged the cabin door , saying they durst not consort with the crew .
But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage , they all agreed to another thing -- namely , not to sing out for whales , in case any should be discovered .
" But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct , he kept his own counsel ( at least till all was over ) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart .
Upon this , and one or two other circumstances , Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge .
In this attitude , it was well known , he sometimes dozed .
' said a sailor .
"' Why not ?
For by a mysterious fatality , Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done .
Sir sailor , but do whales have christenings ?
'
' cried all the young Spaniards , crowding .
"' Nay , Dons , Dons -- nay , nay !
Nothing loath , his bowsman hauled him up and up , through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together ; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge , and keeling over , spilled out the standing mate .
All four boats gave chase again ; but the whale eluded them , and finally wholly disappeared .
After taking counsel with his officers , he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible ; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows ; stacked his muskets on the poop ; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril , took one man with him , and setting the sail of his best whale - boat , steered straight before the wind for Tahiti , five hundred miles distant , to procure a reinforcement to his crew .
He steered away from it ; but the savage craft bore down on him ; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to , or he would run him under water .
The captain presented a pistol .
With one foot on each prow of the yoked war - canoes , the Lakeman laughed him to scorn ; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock , he would bury him in bubbles and foam .
'
'
If I do not , may lightning strike me !
"' A pretty scholar ,' laughed the Lakeman .
'
Did you get it from an unquestionable source ?
"' Also bear with all of us , sir sailor ; for we all join in Don Sebastian ' s suit ,' cried the company , with exceeding interest .
'
Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight .
I see no need of this .
' This is the priest , he brings you the Evangelists ,' said Don Sebastian , gravely , returning with a tall and solemn figure .
The Hindoo whale referred to , occurs in a separate department of the wall , depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan , learnedly known as the Matse Avatar .
The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface , scarcely drawing one inch of water .
As for the book - binder ' s whale winding like a vine - stalk round the stock of a descending anchor -- as stamped and gilded on the backs and title - pages of many books both old and new -- that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature , imitated , I take it , from the like figures on antique vases .
It was introduced by an old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century , during the Revival of Learning ; and in those days , and even down to a comparatively late period , dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the Leviathan .
" In the abridged London edition of 1807 , there are plates of an alleged " whale " and a " narwhale .
" I do not wish to seem inelegant , but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow ; and , as for the narwhale , one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one , that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys .
Most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish ; and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship , with broken back , would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars .
But it may be fancied , that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale , accurate hints may be derived touching his true form .
Though Jeremy Bentham ' s skeleton , which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors , correctly conveys the idea of a burly - browed utilitarian old gentleman , with all Jeremy ' s other leading personal characteristics ; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan ' s articulated bones .
In fact , as the great Hunter says , the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it .
But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering , as the human fingers in an artificial covering .
" However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us ," said humorous Stubb one day , " he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens .
True , one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another , but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness .
Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales , and the True Pictures of Whaling Scenes .
Some of the Sperm Whale drawings in J . Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour ; but they are wretchedly engraved .
Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe , and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas , as in that triumphal hall at Versailles ; where the beholder fights his way , pell - mell , through the consecutive great battles of France ; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights , and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by , like a charge of crowned centaurs ?
For the most part , the English and American whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things , such as the vacant profile of the whale ; which , so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned , is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid .
In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery , there are two other French engravings worthy of note , by some one who subscribes himself " H .
Some of them have little boxes of dentistical - looking implements , specially intended for the skrimshandering business .
Your true whale - hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois .
An ancient Hawaiian war - club or spear - paddle , in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving , is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon .
Wooden whales , or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble South Sea war - wood , are frequently met with in the forecastles of American whalers .
But these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays .
Brit .
For leagues and leagues it undulated round us , so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat .
But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers .
But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it , but it is also a fiend to its own off - spring ; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests ; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned .
No mercy , no power but its own controls it .
Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider , the masterless ocean overruns the globe .
It seemed not a whale ; and yet is this Moby Dick ?
right ahead !
The White Whale , the White Whale !
in the same spot where it sank , once more it slowly rose .
No perceptible face or front did it have ; no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct ; but undulated there on the billows , an unearthly , formless , chance - like apparition of life .
As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again , Starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk , with a wild voice exclaimed --" Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him , than to have seen thee , thou white ghost !
So rarely is it beheld , that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean , yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form ; notwithstanding , they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food .
At times , when closely pursued , he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid ; some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length .
They fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean ; and that the sperm whale , unlike other species , is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it .
There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid .
The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp , slightly vapoured with tar , not impregnated with it , as in the case of ordinary ropes ; for while tar , as ordinarily used , makes the hemp more pliable to the rope - maker , and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use ; yet , not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale - line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected ; but as most seamen are beginning to learn , tar in general by no means adds to the rope ' s durability or strength , however much it may give it compactness and gloss .
At first sight , you would not think it so strong as it really is .
By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds ; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons .
Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub , not like the worm - pipe of a still though , but so as to form one round , cheese - shaped mass of densely bedded " sheaves ," or layers of concentric spiralizations , without any hollow but the " heart ," or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese .
First : In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat , in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon .
what cannot habit accomplish ?-- Gayer sallies , more merry mirth , better jokes , and brighter repartees , you never heard over your mahogany , than you will hear over the half - inch white cedar of the whale - boat , when thus hung in hangman ' s nooses ; and , like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward , the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death , with a halter around every neck , as you may say .
Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters -- some few of which are casually chronicled -- of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line , and lost .
For , when the line is darting out , to be seated then in the boat , is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam - engine in full play , when every flying beam , and shaft , and wheel , is grazing you .
All are born with halters round their necks ; but it is only when caught in the swift , sudden turn of death , that mortals realize the silent , subtle , ever - present perils of life .
" was the cry , an announcement immediately followed by Stubb ' s producing his match and igniting his pipe , for now a respite was granted .
" Start her , now ; give ' em the long and strong stroke , Tashtego .
" yelled Daggoo , straining forwards and backwards on his seat , like a pacing tiger in his cage .
Koo - loo !
Meanwhile , Stubb retaining his place in the van , still encouraged his men to the onset , all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth .
" Haul in -- haul in !
" Pull up !-- close to !
It is then they change places ; and the headsman , the chief officer of the little craft , takes his proper station in the bows of the boat .
To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart , the harpooneers of this world must start to their feet from out of idleness , and not from out of toil .
It is a notched stick of a peculiar form , some two feet in length , which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow , for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon , whose other naked , barbed end slopingly projects from the prow .
It is a doubling of the chances .
Nor , in general , is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse .
For , of course , each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery .
Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod ' s decks , that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep ; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck , and thrust rattling out of the port - holes .
But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome : a small , strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end , and a weight in its middle , while the other end is secured to the ship .
" A steak , a steak , ere I sleep !
If you have never seen that sight , then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil - worship , and the expediency of conciliating the devil .
Away , cook , and deliver my message .
You hear ?
"
" Do you is all sharks , and by natur wery woracious , yet I zay to you , fellow - critters , dat dat woraciousness --' top dat dam slappin ' ob de tail !
Talk to ' em gentlemanly .
"
In the first place , how old are you , cook ?
How old are you , cook ?
" rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word , so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question .
"
Take it , I say "-- holding the tongs towards him --" take it , and taste it .
And yet you come here , and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now , eh ?
heave to !
Now what ' s your answer ?
"
" Fetch him ?
" Didn ' t say dat t ' all ," said Fleece , again in the sulks .
But none of us are in heaven yet .
" All ' dention ," said the old black , with both hands placed as desired , vainly wriggling his grizzled head , as if to get both ears in front at one and the same time .
The Whale as a Dish .
Also , that in Henry VIIIth ' s time , a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises , which , you remember , are a species of whale .
Nevertheless , many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance , and then partaking of it .
In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish .
And with what quill did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders formally indite his circulars ?
When in the Southern Fishery , a captured Sperm Whale , after long and weary toil , is brought alongside late at night , it is not , as a general thing at least , customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in .
But it was not thus in the present case with the Pequod ' s sharks ; though , to be sure , any man unaccustomed to such sights , to have looked over her side that night , would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese , and those sharks the maggots in it .
Nor was this all .
This done , a broad , semicircular line is cut round the hole , the hook is inserted , and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus , now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass .
Into this hole , the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber , in order to prepare for what follows .
Whereupon , this accomplished swordsman , warning all hands to stand off , once more makes a scientific dash at the mass , and with a few sidelong , desperate , lunging slicings , severs it completely in twain ; so that while the short lower part is still fast , the long upper strip , called a blanket - piece , swings clear , and is all ready for lowering .
I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat , and learned naturalists ashore .
That same infinitely thin , isinglass substance , which , I admit , invests the entire body of the whale , is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature , as the skin of the skin , so to speak ; for it were simply ridiculous to say , that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a new - born child .
But no more of this .
Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale ; then , when this skin , as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale , will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil ; and , when it is considered that , in quantity , or rather weight , that oil , in its expressed state , is only three fourths , and not the entire substance of the coat ; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass , a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that .
Nor is this all .
Like those mystic rocks , too , the mystic - marked whale remains undecipherable .
of creatures , how few vast as the whale !
Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky , upon the fair face of the pleasant sea , wafted by the joyous breezes , that great mass of death floats on and on , till lost in infinite perspectives .
Espied by some timid man - of - war or blundering discovery - vessel from afar , when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls , nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun , and the white spray heaving high against it ; straightway the whale ' s unharming corpse , with trembling fingers is set down in the log -- SHOALS , ROCKS , AND BREAKERS HEREABOUTS : BEWARE !
There are other ghosts than the Cock - Lane one , and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in them .
The Sphynx .
Now , the beheading of the Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat , upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves : and not without reason .
Remember , also , that the surgeon must operate from above , some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject , and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured , rolling , and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea .
An intense copper calm , like a universal yellow lotus , was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea .
Taking a few turns on the quarter - deck , he paused to gaze over the side , then slowly getting into the main - chains he took Stubb ' s long spade -- still remaining there after the whale ' s Decapitation -- and striking it into the lower part of the half - suspended mass , placed its other end crutch - wise under one arm , and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head .
" Sail ho !
" cried a triumphant voice from the main - mast - head .
" That lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better man .-- Where away ?
" Three points on the starboard bow , sir , and bringing down her breeze to us !
not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter , but has its cunning duplicate in mind .
CHAPTER 71
The Pequod ' s signal was at last responded to by the stranger ' s setting her own ; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket .
He was a small , short , youngish man , sprinkled all over his face with freckles , and wearing redundant yellow hair .
that ' s he !-- the long - togged scaramouch the Town - Ho ' s company told us of !
He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel , and commanded the captain to jump overboard .
" Gabriel called off the terror - stricken crew from the further hunting of the whale .
"
Ahab stolidly turned aside ; then said to Mayhew , " Captain , I have just bethought me of my letter - bag ; there is a letter for one of thy officers , if I mistake not .
Of such a letter , Death himself might well have been the post - boy .
" Give it me , man .
The Monkey - Rope .
But in very many cases , circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole tensing or stripping operation is concluded .
Just so , from the ship ' s steep side , did I hold Queequeg down there in the sea , by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey - rope , attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist .
It was a humorously perilous business for both of us .
A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale , the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man .
Nevertheless , it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie , it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them .
This procedure of theirs , to be sure , was very disinterested and benevolent of them .
there is good cheer in store for you , Queequeg .
hands him , ye gods !
Do I smell ginger ?
Ginger !-- what the devil is ginger ?-- sea - coal ?
" Will you look at that kannakin , sir ; smell of it , if you please .
" It was not me ," cried Dough - Boy , " it was Aunt Charity that brought the ginger on board ; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits , but only this ginger - jub -- so she called it .
When Stubb reappeared , he came with a dark flask in one hand , and a sort of tea - caddy in the other .
And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures ; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all , and though she had passed numbers of them near the Crozetts without lowering a boat ; yet now that a Sperm Whale had been brought alongside and beheaded , to the surprise of all , the announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day , if opportunity offered .
Tall spouts were seen to leeward ; and two boats , Stubb ' s and Flask ' s , were detached in pursuit .
But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain .
" I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard ," said Stubb , not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan .
" Sink him !
Blast him !
" He sleeps in his boots , don ' t he ?
" No doubt , and it ' s because of his cursed tail ; he coils it down , do ye see , in the eye of the rigging .
" Pooh !
' says the old governor .
" No : never saw such a book ; heard of it , though .
But now , tell me , Stubb , do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now , was the same you say is now on board the Pequod ?
"
Flask ?
" How old do you suppose Fedallah is , Stubb ?
" pointing to the ship ; " well , that ' s the figure one ; now take all the hoops in the Pequod ' s hold , and string along in a row with that mast , for oughts , do you see ; well , that wouldn ' t begin to be Fedallah ' s age .
Now , if he ' s so old as all those hoops of yours come to , and if he is going to live for ever , what good will it do to pitch him overboard -- tell me that ?
" But he ' d crawl back .
"
Who ' s afraid of him , except the old governor who daresn ' t catch him and put him in double - darbies , as he deserves , but lets him go about kidnapping people ; aye , and signed a bond with him , that all the people the devil kidnapped , he ' d roast for him ?
" Do I suppose it ?
"
In good time , Flask ' s saying proved true .
As the crew toiled on , Laplandish speculations were bandied among them , concerning all these passing things .
As you behold it , you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him , in point of pervading dignity .
Far back on the side of the head , and low down , near the angle of either whale ' s jaw , if you narrowly search , you will at last see a lashless eye , which you would fancy to be a young colt ' s eye ; so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head .
But if you now come to separate these two objects , and surround each by a circle of profound darkness ; then , in order to see one of them , in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it , the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness .
The ear has no external leaf whatever ; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill , so wondrously minute is it .
While the ear of the former has an external opening , that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane , so as to be quite imperceptible from without .
Subtilize it .
Let us now with whatever levers and steam - engines we have at hand , cant over the sperm whale ' s head , that it may lie bottom up ; then , ascending by a ladder to the summit , have a peep down the mouth ; and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it , with a lantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach .
But let us hold on here by this tooth , and look about us where we are .
But far more terrible is it to behold , when fathoms down in the sea , you see some sulky whale , floating there suspended , with his prodigious jaw , some fifteen feet long , hanging straight down at right - angles with his body , for all the world like a ship ' s jib - boom .
As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale ' s head may be compared to a Roman war - chariot ( especially in front , where it is so broadly rounded ); so , at a broad view , the Right Whale ' s head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot - toed shoe .
A great pity , now , that this unfortunate whale should be hare - lipped .
The fissure is about a foot across .
is this the road that Jonah went ?
At any rate , if we yield to it , we must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem reasonable .
Seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about , would you not think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ , and gazing upon its thousand pipes ?
So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad .
When two large , loaded Indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks , what do the sailors do ?
So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster ; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats ; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity , and be ready to abide by this ; that though the Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien , and mixed the Atlantic with the Pacific , you would not elevate one hair of your eye - brow .
The Great Heidelburgh Tun .
Now comes the Baling of the Case .
A quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side , instead of the mutual tapering of both sides .
A large whale ' s case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm , though from unavoidable circumstances , considerable of it is spilled , leaks , and dribbles away , or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can .
Then , hand - over - hand , down the other part , the Indian drops through the air , till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head .
A short - handled sharp spade being sent up to him , he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun .
In this business he proceeds very heedfully , like a treasure - hunter in some old house , sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in .
These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the Indian , to whom another person has reached up a very long pole .
Now , the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way ; several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm ; when all at once a queer accident happened .
" and putting one foot into it , so as the better to secure his slippery hand - hold on the whip itself , the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head , almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom .
" Stand clear of the tackle !
One packed rush was made to the side , and every eye counted every ripple , as moment followed moment , and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen .
Why , diving after the slowly descending head , Queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom , so as to scuttle a large hole there ; then dropping his sword , had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards , and so hauled out poor Tash by the head .
" But in most creatures , nay in man himself , very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line .
Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics .
I but put that brow before you .
The Nut .
In the full - grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length .
So like a choice casket is it secreted in him , that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubic - yards of his sperm magazine .
It is plain , then , that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan , in the creature ' s living intact state , is an entire delusion .
The whale , like all things that are mighty , wears a false brow to the common world .
But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale ' s proper brain , you deem it incapable of being adequately charted , then I have another idea for you .
But the curious external resemblance , I take it the Germans were not the first men to perceive .
I rejoice in my spine , as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the world .
For , viewed in this light , the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord .
From its relative situation then , I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale .
And that the great monster is indomitable , you will yet have reason to know .
CHAPTER 81
The Pequod Meets The Virgin .
" Not that ," said Stubb , " no , no , it ' s a coffee - pot , Mr . Starbuck ; he ' s coming off to make us our coffee , is the Yarman ; don ' t you see that big tin can there alongside of him ?-- that ' s his boiling water .
As he mounted the deck , Ahab abruptly accosted him , without at all heeding what he had in his hand ; but in his broken lingo , the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale ; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp - feeder and oil can , with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness -- his last drop of Bremen oil being gone , and not a single flying - fish yet captured to supply the deficiency ; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one ( that is , an empty one ), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin .
His spout was short , slow , and laborious ; coming forth with a choking sort of gush , and spending itself in torn shreds , followed by strange subterranean commotions in him , which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity , causing the waters behind him to upbubble .
Whether he had lost that fin in battle , or had been born without it , it were hard to say .
" The ungracious and ungrateful dog !
"-- then in his old intense whisper --" Give way , greyhounds !
my lads , DO spring -- slap - jacks and quahogs for supper , you know , my lads -- baked clams and muffins -- oh , DO , DO , spring ,-- he ' s a hundred barreller -- don ' t lose him now -- don ' t oh , DON ' T !-- see that Yarman -- Oh , won ' t ye pull for your duff , my lads -- such a sog !
"
Down with the Yarman !
An instant more , and all four boats were diagonically in the whale ' s immediate wake , while stretching from them , on both sides , was the foaming swell that he made .
The whale was now going head out , and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet ; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright .
This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plain -- makes the wheel - spokes fly , boys , when you fasten to him that way ; and there ' s danger of being pitched out too , when you strike a hill .
this is the way a fellow feels when he ' s going to Davy Jones -- all a rush down an endless inclined plane !
Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock .
and to what ?
To three bits of board .
In that sloping afternoon sunlight , the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface , must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half Xerxes ' army .
" Stand by , men ; he stirs ," cried Starbuck , as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water , distinctly conducting upwards to them , as by magnetic wires , the life and death throbs of the whale , so that every oarsman felt them in his seat .
" Haul in !
Haul in !
In most land animals there are certain valves or flood - gates in many of their veins , whereby when wounded , the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions .
Even now , when the boats pulled upon this whale , and perilously drew over his swaying flukes , and the lances were darted into him , they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound , which kept continually playing , while the natural spout - hole in his head was only at intervals , however rapid , sending its affrighted moisture into the air .
Immediately , by Starbuck ' s orders , lines were secured to it at different points , so that ere long every boat was a buoy ; the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords .
But a sudden stop was put to further discoveries , by the ship ' s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea , owing to the body ' s immensely increasing tendency to sink .
In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke - chains , to pry them adrift from the timberheads ; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached , while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk , and the ship seemed on the point of going over .
In the Shore Whaling , on soundings , among the Bays of New Zealand , when a Right Whale gives token of sinking , they fasten buoys to him , with plenty of rope ; so that when the body has gone down , they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again .
many are the Fin - Backs , and many are the Dericks , my friend .
I claim him for one of our clan .
Jonah Historically Regarded .
Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter .
It was this , if I remember right : Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean Sea , and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days ' journey of Nineveh , a city on the Tigris , very much more than three days ' journey across from the nearest point of the Mediterranean coast .
Yes .
But not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the Mediterranean , and another passage up the Persian Gulf and Red Sea , such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days , not to speak of the Tigris waters , near the site of Nineveh , being too shallow for any whale to swim in .
Pitchpoling .
It became imperative to lance the flying whale , or be content to lose him .
Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities , the sleights of hand and countless subtleties , to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced , none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling .
It is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale ; its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking , jerking boat , under extreme headway .
Handling the long lance lightly , glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight , Stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand , so as to secure its free end in his grasp , leaving the rest unobstructed .
" That drove the spigot out of him !
The agonized whale goes into his flurry ; the tow - line is slackened , and the pitchpoler dropping astern , folds his hands , and mutely watches the monster die .
Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills , the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim ; hence , a herring or a cod might live a century , and never once raise its head above the surface .
If I say , that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality , inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element , which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle , I do not think I shall err ; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words .
Now , if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him , so that he sounds , he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air .
Not so much thy skill , then , O hunter , as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee !
No roses , no violets , no Cologne - water in the sea .
Oh !
But the question returns whether this gas - pipe is also a water - pipe ; in other words , whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath , or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth , and discharged through the spiracle .
I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all .
Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout .
My hypothesis is this : that the spout is nothing but mist .
And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty , misty monster , to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea ; his vast , mild head overhung by a canopy of vapour , engendered by his incommunicable contemplations , and that vapour -- as you will sometimes see it -- glorified by a rainbow , as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts .
At the crotch or junction , these flukes slightly overlap , then sideways recede from each other like wings , leaving a wide vacancy between .
The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews ; but cut into it , and you find that three distinct strata compose it :-- upper , middle , and lower .
When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form , mark what robustness is there .
And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son , the soft , curled , hermaphroditical Italian pictures , in which his idea has been most successfully embodied ; these pictures , so destitute as they are of all brawniness , hint nothing of any power , but the mere negative , feminine one of submission and endurance , which on all hands it is conceded , form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings .
To the whale , his tail is the sole means of propulsion .
His side - fins only serve to steer by .
In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil .
What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch !
Had this tail any prehensile power , I should straightway bethink me of Darmonodes ' elephant that so frequented the flower - market , and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels , and then caressed their zones .
As it seemed to me at the time , such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld , even in Persia , the home of the fire worshippers .
Dissect him how I may , then , I but go skin deep ; I know him not , and never will .
The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca , extending south - eastward from the territories of Birmah , forms the most southerly point of all Asia .
Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java ; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands , buttressed by that bold green promontory , known to seamen as Java Head ; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire : and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices , and silks , and jewels , and gold , and ivory , with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched , it seems a significant provision of nature , that such treasures , by the very formation of the land , should at least bear the appearance , however ineffectual , of being guarded from the all - grasping western world .
The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the Mediterranean , the Baltic , and the Propontis .
But while they freely waive a ceremonial like this , they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute .
in this zoned quest , does Ahab touch no land ?
does his crew drink air ?
For a long time , now , the circus - running sun has raced within his fiery ring , and needs no sustenance but what ' s in himself .
Mark this , too , in the whaler .
Clear old prime Nantucket water ; which , when three years afloat , the Nantucketer , in the Pacific , prefers to drink before the brackish fluid , but yesterday rafted off in casks , from the Peruvian or Indian streams .
Broad on both bows , at the distance of some two or three miles , and forming a great semicircle , embracing one half of the level horizon , a continuous chain of whale - jets were up - playing and sparkling in the noon - day air .
Unlike the straight perpendicular twin - jets of the Right Whale , which , dividing at top , fall over in two branches , like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow , the single forward - slanting spout of the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist , continually rising and falling away to leeward .
Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them ; the harpooneers handling their weapons , and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats .
And who could tell whether , in that congregated caravan , Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming , like the worshipped white - elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese !
So with stun - sail piled on stun - sail , we sailed along , driving these leviathans before us ; when , of a sudden , the voice of Tashtego was heard , loudly directing attention to something in our wake .
It seemed formed of detached white vapours , rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales ; only they did not so completely come and go ; for they constantly hovered , without finally disappearing .
But when the swift Pequod , with a fresh leading wind , was herself in hot chase ; how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuit ,-- mere riding - whips and rowels to her , that they were .
This was still more strangely evinced by those of their number , who , completely paralysed as it were , helplessly floated like water - logged dismantled ships on the sea .
Though banding together in tens of thousands , the lion - maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a solitary horseman .
Though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances , is in no wise unprecedented ; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated ; yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery .
They chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business .
" cried one , to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface , and for an instant threatened to swamp us .
" Hard down with your tail , there !
" cried a second to another , which , close to our gunwale , seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan - like extremity .
And if you cannot kill them all at once , you must wing them , so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure .
I mention this circumstance , because , as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold ; and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping ; or , possibly , being so young , unsophisticated , and every way innocent and inexperienced ; however it may have been , these smaller whales -- now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lake -- evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence , or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at .
Like household dogs they came snuffling round us , right up to our gunwales , and touching them ; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them .
The delicate side - fins , and the palms of his flukes , still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby ' s ears newly arrived from foreign parts .
" cried Queequeg , looking over the gunwale ; " him fast !
Who struck ?-- Two whale ; one big , one little !
We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep .
* The sperm whale , as with all other species of the Leviathan , but unlike most other fish , breeds indifferently at all seasons ; after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months , producing but one at a time ; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and Jacob :-- a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats , curiously situated , one on each side of the anus ; but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that .
When overflowing with mutual esteem , the whales salute MORE HOMINUM .
First , the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little , and tumble against each other , as if lifted by half spent billows from afar ; then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell ; the submarine bridal - chambers and nurseries vanished ; in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters .
Yes , the long calm was departing .
Of all the drugged whales only one was captured .
It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings .
Like fashionables , they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety .
all fish bed in common .
Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile , still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario , like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines .
In good time , nevertheless , as the ardour of youth declines ; as years and dumps increase ; as reflection lends her solemn pauses ; in short , as a general lassitude overtakes the sated Turk ; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens ; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent , repentant , admonitory stage of life , forswears , disbands the harem , and grown to an exemplary , sulky old soul , goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers , and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors .
The Forty - barrel - bull schools are larger than the harem schools .
The allusion to the waif and waif - poles in the last chapter but one , necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery , of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge .
Thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen , were there not some written or unwritten , universal , undisputed law applicable to all cases .
A Loose - Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it .
But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable brevity of it , which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to expound it .
Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif , or any other recognised symbol of possession ; so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside , as well as their intention so to do .
And when those defendants were remonstrated with , their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs ' teeth , and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done , he would now retain their line , harpoons , and boat , which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure .
Mr . Erskine was counsel for the defendants ; Lord Ellenborough was the judge .
con .
But ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter , the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted , and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in the above cited case ; these two laws touching Fast - Fish and Loose - Fish , I say , will , on reflection , be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence ; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture , the Temple of the Law , like the Temple of the Philistines , has but two props to stand on .
What is the Archbishop of Savesoul ' s income of L100 , 000 seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken - backed laborers ( all sure of heaven without any of Savesoul ' s help ) what is that globular L100 , 000 but a Fast - Fish ?
Heads or Tails .
Latin from the books of the Laws of England , which taken along with the context , means , that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land , the King , as Honourary Grand Harpooneer , must have the head , and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail .
Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites ; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them .
"
"
" It is his .
"
" It is his .
"
In a word , the whale was seized and sold , and his Grace the Duke of Wellington received the money .
But is the Queen a mermaid , to be presented with a tail ?
The Pequod Meets The Rose - Bud .
A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea .
I thought they would keel up before long .
"
By this time the faint air had become a complete calm ; so that whether or no , the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell , with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again .
are there any of you Bouton - de - Roses that speak English ?
"
" Never heard of such a whale .
"
" What ' s the matter with your nose , there ?
"
" What in the devil ' s name do you want here ?
"
All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib - booms .
Sounding him carefully , Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey - man had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris .
He was a small and dark , but rather delicate looking man for a sea - captain , with large whiskers and moustache , however ; and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watch - seals at his side .
" said he .
" What now ?
In fact , tell him from me he ' s a baboon .
" He vows and declares , Monsieur , that the other whale , the dried one , is far more deadly than the blasted one ; in fine , Monsieur , he conjures us , as we value our lives , to cut loose from these fish .
" Thank him heartily ; but tell him it ' s against my principles to drink with the man I ' ve diddled .
Whereupon Stubb quickly pulled to the floating body , and hailing the Pequod to give notice of his intentions , at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning .
You would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea ; and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs , it was like turning up old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam .
His boat ' s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold - hunters .
And this , good friends , is ambergris , worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist .
Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay ; is this nothing ?
But there is another thing to rebut .
The consequence is , that upon breaking into the hold , and unloading one of these whale cemeteries , in the Greenland dock , a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave - yard , for the foundations of a Lying - in - Hospital .
I partly surmise also , that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland , in former times , of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg , which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack , in his great work on Smells , a text - book on that subject .
As its name imports ( smeer , fat ; berg , to put up ), this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out , without being taken home to Holland for that purpose .
Now , in the whale ship , it is not every one that goes in the boats .
It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick - name , Pip by abbreviation .
ye have heard of him before ; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight , so gloomy - jolly .
had turned the round horizon into one star - belled tambourine .
Then come out those fiery effulgences , infernally superb ; then the evil - blazing diamond , once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies , looks like some crown - jewel stolen from the King of Hell .
It came to pass , that in the ambergris affair Stubb ' s after - oarsman chanced so to sprain his hand , as for a time to become quite maimed ; and , temporarily , Pip was put into his place .
He was full of the fire of the hunt .
He hated Pip for a poltroon .
Snatching the boat - knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , " Cut ?
It was under very similar circumstances to the first performance ; but this time he did not breast out the line ; and hence , when the whale started to run , Pip was left behind on the sea , like a hurried traveller ' s trunk .
Stubb was but too true to his word .
No boat - knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .
Stubb ' s inexorable back was turned upon him ; and the whale was winged .
Mark , how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea -- mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides .
Because there were two boats in his wake , and he supposed , no doubt , that they would of course come up to Pip very quickly , and pick him up ; though , indeed , such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity , is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances ; and such instances not unfrequently occur ; almost invariably in the fishery , a coward , so called , is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies .
It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid .
such a delicious molifier !
squeeze !
my dear fellow beings , why should we longer cherish any social acerbities , or know the slightest ill - humor or envy !
For now , since by many prolonged , repeated experiences , I have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower , or at least shift , his conceit of attainable felicity ; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy ; but in the wife , the heart , the bed , the table , the saddle , the fireside , the country ; now that I have perceived all this , I am ready to squeeze case eternally .
As its name imports , it is of an exceedingly rich , mottled tint , with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground , dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple .
This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket - pieces , when stript and hoisted from the whale .
The whaling - pike is similar to a frigate ' s boarding - weapon of the same name .
If he cuts off one of his own toes , or one of his assistants ', would you be very much astonished ?
CHAPTER 95
Besides her hoisted boats , an American whaler is outwardly distinguished by her try - works .
During the night - watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap .
It is a place also for profound mathematical meditation .
There are no external chimneys ; they open direct from the rear wall .
" All ready there ?
This served for a sea - sofa .
So seemed it to me , as I stood at her helm , and for long hours silently guided the way of this fire - ship on the sea .
But that night , in particular , a strange ( and ever since inexplicable ) thing occurred to me .
what is the matter with me ?
in my brief sleep I had turned myself about , and was fronting the ship ' s stern , with my back to her prow and the compass .
With books the same .
CHAPTER 97
There they lay in their triangular oaken vaults , each mariner a chiselled muteness ; a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes .
See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lamps -- often but old bottles and vials , though -- to the copper cooler at the try - works , and replenishes them there , as mugs of ale at a vat .
Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the mast - head ; how he is chased over the watery moors , and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep ; how he is then towed alongside and beheaded ; and how ( on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed ) his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner ; how , in due time , he is condemned to the pots , and , like Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , his spermaceti , oil , and bone pass unscathed through the fire ;-- but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsing -- singing , if I may -- the romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold , where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities , sliding along beneath the surface as before ; but , alas !
At length , when the last pint is casked , and all is cool , then the great hatchways are unsealed , the bowels of the ship are thrown open , and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea .
Away , and bring us napkins !
CHAPTER 99
And some certain significance lurks in all things , else all things are little worth , and the round world itself but an empty cipher , except to sell by the cartload , as they do hills about Boston , to fill up some morass in the Milky Way .
Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three Andes ' summits ; from one a flame ; a tower on another ; on the third a crowing cock ; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac , the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics , and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra .
aye , he enters the sign of storms , the equinox !
Here ' s stout stuff for woe to work on .
" No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold , but devil ' s claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday ," murmured Starbuck to himself , leaning against the bulwarks .
This coin speaks wisely , mildly , truly , but still sadly to me .
in my poor , insignificant opinion , I regard this as queer .
I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings ; your doubloons of old Spain , your doubloons of Peru , your doubloons of Chili , your doubloons of Bolivia , your doubloons of Popayan ; with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles , and joes , and half joes , and quarter joes .
here ' s signs and wonders truly !
That , now , is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the zodiac , and what my almanac below calls ditto .
Let ' s see now .
You ' ll do to give us the bare words and facts , but we come in to supply the thoughts .
Look you , Doubloon , your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter ; and now I ' ll read it off , straight out of the book .
As we pluck out the shafts , stand aside !
Oh , jolly ' s the word for aye !
It is worth sixteen dollars , that ' s true ; and at two cents the cigar , that ' s nine hundred and sixty cigars .
"
I ' ve studied signs , and know their marks ; they were taught me two score years ago , by the old witch in Copenhagen .
my old head shakes to think of thee .
here comes that ghost - devil , Fedallah ; tail coiled out of sight as usual , oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual .
Hark !
again .
Caw !
caw !
caw !
"
I can stand the rest , for they have plain wits ; but he ' s too crazy - witty for my sanity .
"
My father , in old Tolland county , cut down a pine tree once , and found a silver ring grown over in it ; some old darkey ' s wedding ring .
How did it get there ?
the precious , precious , gold !
the green miser ' ll hoard ye soon !
So cried Ahab , once more hailing a ship showing English colours , bearing down under the stern .
"
In less than a minute , without quitting his little craft , he and his crew were dropped to the water , and were soon alongside of the stranger .
So , deprived of one leg , and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention , Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again ; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain .
Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks , and gently landed upon the capstan head .
"
"
"
Seeing how matters stood , and what a noble great whale it was -- the noblest and biggest I ever saw , sir , in my life -- I resolved to capture him , spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in .
But a combing sea dashed me off , and at the same instant , the fish , taking one good dart forwards , went down like a flash ; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here " ( clapping his hand just below his shoulder ); " yes , caught me just here , I say , and bore me down to Hell ' s flames , I was thinking ; when , when , all of a sudden , thank the good God , the barb ript its way along the flesh -- clear along the whole length of my arm -- came out nigh my wrist , and up I floated ;-- and that gentleman there will tell you the rest ( by the way , captain -- Dr . Bunger , ship ' s surgeon : Bunger , my lad ,-- the captain ).
Now , Bunger boy , spin your part of the yarn .
His face was an exceedingly round but sober one ; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt , and patched trowsers ; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand , and a pill - box held in the other , occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains .
" It was a shocking bad wound ," began the whale - surgeon ; " and , taking my advice , Captain Boomer here , stood our old Sammy --"
" Oh , very severe !
he sat up with me indeed , and was very severe in my diet .
Oh !
why don ' t ye ?
) But , heave ahead , boy , I ' d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man .
"
There would be great glory in killing him , I know that ; and there is a ship - load of precious sperm in him , but , hark ye , he ' s best let alone ; don ' t you think so , Captain ?
What is best let alone , that accursed thing is not always what least allures .
How long since thou saw ' st him last ?
" Bless my soul , and curse the foul fiend ' s ," cried Bunger , stoopingly walking round Ahab , and like a dog , strangely snuffing ; " this man ' s blood -- bring the thermometer !-- it ' s at the boiling point !-- his pulse makes these planks beat !-- sir !
" Good God !
But this is not all .
That ship -- well called the " Syren "-- made a noble experimental cruise ; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known .
It was a fine gam we had , and they were all trumps -- every soul on board .
Yes , and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour ; and when the squall came ( for it ' s squally off there by Patagonia ), and all hands -- visitors and all -- were called to reef topsails , we were so top - heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines ; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails , so that we hung there , reefed fast in the howling gale , a warning example to all drunken tars .
They said it was bull - beef ; others , that it was dromedary beef ; but I do not know , for certain , how that was .
If you stooped over too far forward , you risked their pitching out of you like billiard - balls .
But the forecastle was not very light , and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it .
I will tell you .
The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders , Zealanders , and Danes ; from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery ; and what is yet more , their fat old fashions , touching plenty to eat and drink .
The title was , " Dan Coopman ," wherefore I concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam cooper in the fishery , as every whale ship must carry its cooper .
I was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one " Fitz Swackhammer .
of stock fish .
Now , whether these gin and beer harpooneers , so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been , were the right sort of men to stand up in a boat ' s head , and take good aim at flying whales ; this would seem somewhat improbable .
Did erudite Stubb , mounted upon your capstan , deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea ; and by help of the windlass , hold up a specimen rib for exhibition ?
I confess , that since Jonah , few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale ; nevertheless , I have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature .
In a ship I belonged to , a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag , to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons , and for the heads of the lances .
The weaver - god , he weaves ; and by that weaving is he deafened , that he hears no mortal voice ; and by that humming , we , too , who look on the loom are deafened ; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it .
These admeasurements I now propose to set before you .
There is a Leviathanic Museum , they tell me , in Hull , England , one of the whaling ports of that country , where they have some fine specimens of fin - backs and other whales .
Having already in various ways put before you his skull , spout - hole , jaw , teeth , tail , forehead , fins , and divers other parts , I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones .
Of this seventy - two feet , his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet , leaving some fifty feet of plain back - bone .
In general thickness , they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length .
So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part .
How vain and foolish , then , thought I , for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale , by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton , stretched in this peaceful wood .
The smallest , where the spine tapers away into the tail , is only two inches in width , and looks something like a white billiard - ball .
Thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple child ' s play .
Applied to any other creature than the Leviathan -- to an ant or a flea -- such portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent .
One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject , though it may seem but an ordinary one .
How , then , with me , writing of this Leviathan ?
But some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to Owen , the English Anatomist , it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale , though of a departed species .
When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons , skulls , tusks , jaws , ribs , and vertebrae , all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea - monsters ; but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical Leviathans , their incalculable seniors ; I am , by a flood , borne back to that wondrous period , ere time itself can be said to have begun ; for time began with man .
I look round to shake hands with Shem .
I am horror - struck at this antemosaic , unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale , which , having been before all time , must needs exist after all humane ages are over .
In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah , some fifty years ago , there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere , abounding in centaurs , griffins , and dolphins , similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns .
" Not far from the Sea - side , they have a Temple , the Rafters and Beams of which are made of Whale - Bones ; for Whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore .
But the truth of the Matter is , that on either side of the Temple , there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea , and wound the Whales when they light upon ' em .
"
But upon investigation we find , that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system ( embracing a distinct geological period prior to man ), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system , those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones .
And this work was published so late as A . D . 1825 .
But though for some time past a number of these whales , not less than 13 , 000 , have been annually slain on the nor '- west coast by the Americans alone ; yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter .
Nor , at the time , had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind , that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe ; and he too plainly seemed to see , that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove ; so , equally with every felicity , all miserable events do naturally beget their like .
Another has the toothache : the carpenter out pincers , and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there ; but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation ; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice , the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that , if he would have him draw the tooth .
Let ' s try another .
Well , manmaker !
Just in time , sir .
So , so ; it does pinch some .
He makes a fierce red flame there !
Aye , sir ; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work .
So he must .
' Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome ; here ' s one .
That ' s it , hey ?
How dost thou know that some entire , living , thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest ; aye , and standing there in thy spite ?
In thy most solitary hours , then , dost thou not fear eavesdroppers ?
Look ye , pudding - heads should never grant premises .-- How long before the leg is done ?
Bungle away at it then , and bring it to me ( TURNS TO GO ).
What was that now about one leg standing in three places , and all three places standing in one hell -- how was that ?
I don ' t wonder he looked so scornful at me !
But Ahab ; oh he ' s a hard driver .
Look , driven one leg to death , and spavined the other for life , and now wears out bone legs by the cord .
bear a hand there with those screws , and let ' s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a - calling with his horn for all legs , true or false , as brewery - men go round collecting old beer barrels , to fill ' em up again .
I ' m all aleak myself .
not only full of leaky casks , but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship ; and that ' s a far worse plight than the Pequod ' s , man .
Yet I don ' t stop to plug my leak ; for who can find it in the deep - loaded hull ; or how hope to plug it , even if found , in this life ' s howling gale ?
"
" Captain Ahab ," said the reddening mate , moving further into the cabin , with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself , but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself ; " A better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man ; aye , and in a happier , Captain Ahab .
And I do dare , sir -- to be forbearing !
" He waxes brave , but nevertheless obeys ; most careful bravery that !
" murmured Ahab , as Starbuck disappeared .
Upon searching , it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound , and that the leak must be further off .
And a well , or an ice - house , it somehow proved to him , poor pagan ; where , strange to say , for all the heat of his sweatings , he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever ; and at last , after some days ' suffering , laid him in his hammock , close to the very sill of the door of death .
But as all else in him thinned , and his cheek - bones grew sharper , his eyes , nevertheless , seemed growing fuller and fuller ; they became of a strange softness of lustre ; and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness , a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die , or be weakened .
There was some heathenish , coffin - coloured old lumber aboard , which , upon a long previous voyage , had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands , and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made .
So , to my fond faith , poor Pip , in this strange sweetness of his lunacy , brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes .
"
But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death ; now that his coffin was proved a good fit , Queequeg suddenly rallied ; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter ' s box : and thereupon , when some expressed their delighted surprise , he , in substance , said , that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this ;-- at a critical moment , he had just recalled a little duty ashore , which he was leaving undone ; and therefore had changed his mind about dying : he could not die yet , he averred .
They asked him , then , whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure .
He answered , certainly .
There is , one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea , whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath ; like those fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St . John .
Lifted by those eternal swells , you needs must own the seductive god , bowing your head to Pan .
And so it was .-- Most miserable !
A peculiar walk in this old man , a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait , had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners .
He was an old man , who , at the age of nearly sixty , had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrow ' s technicals called ruin .
But one night , under cover of darkness , and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement , a desperate burglar slid into his happy home , and robbed them all of everything .
Now , for prudent , most wise , and economic reasons , the blacksmith ' s shop was in the basement of his dwelling , but with a separate entrance to it ; so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness , but with vigorous pleasure , to the stout ringing of her young - armed old husband ' s hammer ; whose reverberations , muffled by passing through the floors and walls , came up to her , not unsweetly , in her nursery ; and so , to stout Labor ' s iron lullaby , the blacksmith ' s infants were rocked to slumber .
The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between ; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last ; the wife sat frozen at the window , with tearless eyes , glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children ; the bellows fell ; the forge choked up with cinders ; the house was sold ; the mother dived down into the long church - yard grass ; her children twice followed her thither ; and the houseless , familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape ; his every woe unreverenced ; his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls !
Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this ; but Death is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried ; it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote , the Wild , the Watery , the Unshored ; therefore , to the death - longing eyes of such men , who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide , does the all - contributed and all - receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable , taking terrors , and wonderful , new - life adventures ; and from the hearts of infinite Pacifics , the thousand mermaids sing to them --" Come hither , broken - hearted ; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death ; here are wonders supernatural , without dying for them .
Come hither !
"
Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly , sanely woeful to me .
" Welding an old pike - head , sir ; there were seams and dents in it .
" I , too , want a harpoon made ; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part , Perth ; something that will stick in a whale like his own fin - bone .
forge me the harpoon .
As , then , with regular , gasping hems , he hammered on the anvil , Perth passing to him the glowing rods , one after the other , and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame , the Parsee passed silently , and bowing over his head towards the fire , seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil .
At last the shank , in one complete rod , received its final heat ; and as Perth , to temper it , plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near by , the scalding steam shot up into Ahab ' s bent face .
Is not this harpoon for the White Whale ?
"
Here are my razors -- the best of steel ; here , and make the barbs sharp as the needle - sleet of the Icy Sea .
At one extremity the rope was unstranded , and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon ; the pole was then driven hard up into the socket ; from the lower end the rope was traced half - way along the pole ' s length , and firmly secured so , with intertwistings of twine .
These are the times , when in his whale - boat the rover softly feels a certain filial , confident , land - like feeling towards the sea ; that he regards it as so much flowery earth ; and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts , seems struggling forward , not through high rolling waves , but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie : as when the western emigrants ' horses only show their erected ears , while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure .
And all this mixes with your most mystic mood ; so that fact and fancy , half - way meeting , interpenetrate , and form one seamless whole .
But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries , yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing .
But the mingled , mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof : calms crossed by storms , a storm for every calm .
"
The Pequod Meets The Bachelor .
" Come aboard , come aboard !
Hast lost any men ?
And as Ahab , leaning over the taffrail , eyed the homewardbound craft , he took from his pocket a small vial of sand , and then looking from the ship to the vial , seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together , for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings .
For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor , whales were seen and four were slain ; and one of them by Ahab .
In vain , oh whale , dost thou seek intercedings with yon all - quickening sun , that only calls forth life , but gives it not again .
All thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here ; I am buoyed by breaths of once living things , exhaled as air , but water now .
CHAPTER 117
" Of the hearses ?
Such a sight we shall not soon see .
"
" Though it come to the last , I shall still go before thee thy pilot .
The grey dawn came on , and the slumbering crew arose from the boat ' s bottom , and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship .
The season for the Line at length drew near ; and every day when Ahab , coming from his cabin , cast his eyes aloft , the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes , and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces , and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon ; impatient for the order to point the ship ' s prow for the equator .
The sky looks lacquered ; clouds there are none ; the horizon floats ; and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God ' s throne .
Where is Moby Dick ?
" dashing it to the deck , " no longer will I guide my earthly way by thee ; the level ship ' s compass , and the level deadreckoning , by log and by line ; THESE shall conduct me , and show me my place on the sea .
"
" Aye ," cried Stubb , " but sea - coal ashes -- mind ye that , Mr . Starbuck -- sea - coal , not your common charcoal .
CHAPTER 119
So , too , it is , that in these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms , the Typhoon .
When darkness came on , sky and sea roared and split with the thunder , and blazed with the lightning , that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport .
The scud all a flyin ', That ' s his flip only foamin '; When he stirs in the spicin ',-- Such a funny , sporty , gamy , jesty , joky , hoky - poky lad , is the Ocean , oh !
" Avast Stubb ," cried Starbuck , " let the Typhoon sing , and strike his harp here in our rigging ; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold thy peace .
" But I am not a brave man ; never said I was a brave man ; I am a coward ; and I sing to keep up my spirits .
"
" The gale that now hammers at us to stave us , we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home .
"
" said Ahab , groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot - hole ; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire .
Now , as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil ; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast , is intended to conduct it into the water .
" cried Starbuck to the crew , suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux , to light Ahab to his post .
" Are they overboard ?
drop them over , fore and aft .
"
"
" Look aloft !
All the yard - arms were tipped with a pallid fire ; and touched at each tri - pointed lightning - rod - end with three tapering white flames , each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air , like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar .
"-- but slipping backward on the deck , his uplifted eyes caught the flames ; and immediately shifting his tone he cried --" The corpusants have mercy on us all !
To sailors , oaths are household words ; they will swear in the trance of the calm , and in the teeth of the tempest ; they will imprecate curses from the topsail - yard - arms , when most they teeter over to a seething sea ; but in all my voyagings , seldom have I heard a common oath when God ' s burning finger has been laid on the ship ; when His " Mene , Mene , Tekel Upharsin " has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage .
While this pallidness was burning aloft , few words were heard from the enchanted crew ; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle , all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence , like a far away constellation of stars .
The parted mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark - white teeth , which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants ; while lit up by the preternatural light , Queequeg ' s tattooing burned like Satanic blue flames on his body .
The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft ; and once more the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall .
But war is pain , and hate is woe .
"
[ SUDDEN , REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHTNING ; THE NINE FLAMES LEAP LENGTHWISE TO THRICE THEIR PREVIOUS HEIGHT ; AHAB , WITH THE REST , CLOSES HIS EYES , HIS RIGHT HAND PRESSED HARD UPON THEM .
The javelins cease ; open eyes ; see , or not ?
There burn the flames !
But thou art but my fiery father ; my sweet mother , I know not .
"
The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch .
AHAB STANDING BY THE HELM .
" Strike nothing ; lash it .
"
Midnight .-- The Forecastle Bulwarks .
And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary ?
What are you talking about , then ?
Why don ' t ye be sensible , Flask ?
" Yes , when a fellow ' s soaked through , it ' s hard to be sensible , that ' s a fact .
And what big generous hands they are , to be sure .
These are your iron fists , hey ?
No more monkey - jackets and tarpaulins for me ; I must mount a swallow - tail , and drive down a beaver ; so .
For during the violence of the gale , he had only steered according to its vicissitudes .
THE FAIR WIND !
Loaded ?
Has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant ?
If , then , he were this instant -- put aside , that crime would not be his .
aye , but still alive , and soon awake again .
Say he were pinioned even ; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers ; chained down to ring - bolts on this cabin floor ; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger , then .
A touch , and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again .-- Oh Mary !
Great God , where art Thou ?
" Stern all !
Thou know ' st what to say .
The sea was as a crucible of molten gold , that bubblingly leaps with light and heat .
" smiting him with his clenched fist .
Mr . Starbuck , last night ' s thunder turned our compasses -- that ' s all .
The magnetic energy , as developed in the mariner ' s needle , is , as all know , essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven ; hence it is not to be much marvelled at , that such things should be .
Instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel , so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging , the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal ; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated , so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife ' s knitting needle .
yesterday I wrecked thee , and to - day the compasses would fain have wrecked me .
With a blow from the top - maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance , and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade him hold it upright , without its touching the deck .
"
With these grey hairs of mine ' tis not worth while disputing , ' specially with a superior , who ' ll ne ' er confess .
"
The log was heaved .
Snap !
" I crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad sea parts the log - line .
Captain Ahab !
here ' s Pip , trying to get on board again .
" Away from the quarter - deck !
Pip !
Ding , dong , ding !
look down here .
Here , boy ; Ahab ' s cabin shall be Pip ' s home henceforth , while Ahab lives .
" What ' s this ?
This seems to me , sir , as a man - rope ; something that weak souls may hold by .
" There go two daft ones now ," muttered the old Manxman .
But here ' s the end of the rotten line -- all dripping , too .
I think we had best have a new line altogether .
The life - buoy -- a long slender cask -- was dropped from the stern , where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken , so that it slowly filled , and that parched wood also filled at its every pore ; and the studded iron - bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to yield him his pillow , though in sooth but a hard one .
But again the old Manxman said nay .
The lost life - buoy was now to be replaced ; Starbuck was directed to see to it ; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found , and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; therefore , they were going to leave the ship ' s stern unprovided with a buoy , when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin .
Dost thou hear me ?
" And shall I nail down the lid , sir ?
what possesses thee to this ?
And now I ' m ordered to make a life - buoy of it .
I like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair - and - square mathematical jobs , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not a cobbler ' s job , that ' s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at the end .
Lord !
what an affection all old women have for tinkers .
And that ' s the reason I never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when I kept my job - shop in the Vineyard ; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me .
But heigh - ho !
Nail down the lid ; caulk the seams ; pay over the same with pitch ; batten them down tight , and hang it with the snap - spring over the ship ' s stern .
Then , if the hull go down , there ' ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun !
Come hammer , caulking - iron , pitch - pot , and marling - spike !
THE COFFIN LAID UPON TWO LINE - TUBS , BETWEEN THE VICE - BENCH AND THE OPEN HATCHWAY ; THE CARPENTER CAULKING ITS SEAMS ; THE STRING OF TWISTED OAKUM SLOWLY UNWINDING FROM A LARGE ROLL OF IT PLACED IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FROCK .-- AHAB COMES SLOWLY FROM THE CABIN - GANGWAY , AND HEARS PIP FOLLOWING HIM .
Mr . Starbuck ' s orders .
"
"
Look , did not this stump come from thy shop ?
"
" Well enough .
" Aye , sir ; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg ; but they ' ve set me now to turning it into something else .
"
And yet , a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same , Carpenter .
What ' s that ?
"
" Art thou a silk - worm ?
There ' s a sound !
See !
He desired that ship to unite with his own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were .
" I will wager something now ," whispered Stubb to Flask , " that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back .
" He ' s drowned with the rest on ' em , last night ," said the old Manx sailor standing behind them ; " I heard ; all of ye heard their spirits .
Meantime , now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab ; and Ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without the least quivering of his own .
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case .
Soon the two ships diverged their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel was in view , she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot , however small , on the sea .
"
But I will never desert ye , sir , as Stubb did him .
Ding , dong , ding !
What ?
neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ' s no opening it .
Here , then , I ' ll seat me , against the transom , in the ship ' s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me .
Here , our old sailors say , in their black seventy - fours great admirals sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants .
Pass round the decanters ; glad to see ye ; fill up , monsieurs !
It domineered above them so , that all their bodings , doubts , misgivings , fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf .
And yet , somehow , did Ahab -- in his own proper self , as daily , hourly , and every instant , commandingly revealed to his subordinates ,-- Ahab seemed an independent lord ; the Parsee but his slave .
Still again both seemed yoked together , and an unseen tyrant driving them ; the lean shade siding the solid rib .
sharp !
" I will have the first sight of the whale myself ,"-- he said .
An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin ' s head , removing his cap to replace it , and thereupon Tanaquil , his wife , declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome .
Ahab ' s hat was never restored ; the wild hawk flew on and on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while from the point of that disappearance , a minute black spot was dimly discerned , falling from that vast height into the sea .
" and snatching Perth ' s levelled iron from the crotch , Ahab held it out , exclaiming --" Look ye , Nantucketer ; here in this hand I hold his death !
"
look yonder , men !
Sweet childhood of air and sky !
Forty -- forty -- forty years ago !-- ago !
forty years on the pitiless sea !
for forty years has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep !
When I think of this life I have led ; the desolation of solitude it has been ; the masoned , walled - town of a Captain ' s exclusiveness , which admits but small entrance to any sympathy from the green country without -- oh , weariness !
what a forty years ' fool -- fool -- old fool , has old Ahab been !
But do I look very old , so very , very old , Starbuck ?
mockery !
Close !
stand close to me , Starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon God .
No , no !
not with the far away home I see in that eye !
let us home !
it is done !
Come , my Captain , study out the course , and let us away !
See , see !
" What is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what cozening , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor commands me ; that against all natural lovings and longings , I so keep pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , I durst not so much as dare ?
But if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand - boy in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think thoughts ; unless God does that beating , does that thinking , does that living , and not I .
And all the time , lo !
Aye , toil we how we may , we all sleep at last on the field .
Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail .
"
All sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the air .
" There she blows !-- there she blows !
" I saw him almost that same instant , sir , that Captain Ahab did , and I cried out ," said Tashtego .
All ready the boats there ?
Lower me , Mr . Starbuck ; lower , lower ,-- quick , quicker !
A pale , death - glimmer lit up Fedallah ' s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth .
Like noiseless nautilus shells , their light prows sped through the sea ; but only slowly they neared the foe .
But these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea , alternate with their fitful flight ; and like to some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy , the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale ' s back ; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - toed fowls hovering , and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish , silently perched and rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers streaming like pennons .
With oars apeak , and paddles down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the three boats now stilly floated , awaiting Moby Dick ' s reappearance .
The breeze now freshened ; the sea began to swell .
" cried Tashtego .
But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .
And now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac Ahab , furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated ; frenzied with all this , he seized the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe .
It receives its designation ( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up - and - down poise of the whale - lance , in the exercise called pitchpoling , previously described .
But soon resuming his horizontal attitude , Moby Dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault .
And though the other boats , unharmed , still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways , Ahab and all ; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape .
Set the sail ; out oars ; the helm !
But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , for he seemed to have treble - banked his every fin ; swimming with a velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , pushed on , the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged , if not a hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an unintermitted , intense straining at the oar ; a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude .
Accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were soon swayed up to their cranes -- the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her -- and then hoisting everything to her side , and stacking her canvas high up , and sideways outstretching it with stun - sails , like the double - jointed wings of an albatross ; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby - Dick .
At the well known , methodic intervals , the whale ' s glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mast - heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone down , Ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle - watch in hand , so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired , his voice was heard .--" Whose is the doubloon now ?
D ' ye see him ?
Stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps intending , not vainly , though , to evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in his Captain ' s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed --" The thistle the ass refused ; it pricked his mouth too keenly , sir ; ha !
"
Cold , cold -- I shiver !-- How now ?
"-- Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main - mast --" Men , this gold is mine , for I earned it ; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead ; and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be killed , this gold is that man ' s ; and if on that day I shall again raise him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye !
And , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of a coast , whose general trending he well knows , and which he desires shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote , unseen headland , eventually to be visited : so does the fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night obscures the fish , the creature ' s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the pilot ' s coast is to him .
This ship and I are two brave fellows !-- Ha , ha !
Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides routed , as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison .
For as the one ship that held them all ; though it was put together of all contrasting things -- oak , and maple , and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp -- yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the individualities of the crew , this man ' s valor , that man ' s fear ; guilt and guiltiness , all varieties were welded into oneness , and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to .
Lower , all !
But ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were plain as the ship ' s three masts to his eye ; the White Whale churning himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling battle on every side ; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat , seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made .
As before , the attentive ship having descried the whole fight , again came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and safely landed them on her decks .
" Aye , aye , Starbuck , ' tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the leaner who he will ; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has .
" But no bones broken , sir , I hope ," said Stubb with true concern .
" Aye !
" Oh , oh , oh !
"
" My body , man , not thee .
Muster the men .
"
" MY line !
Ahab is for ever Ahab , man .
Fool !
' Tis Ahab -- his body ' s part ; but Ahab ' s soul ' s a centipede , that moves upon a hundred legs .
For ere they drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , to sink for evermore .
D ' ye feel brave men , brave ?
" As fearless fire ," cried Stubb .
Then as the men went forward , he muttered on : " The things called omens !
I ' LL , I ' LL solve it , though !
"
God only has that right and privilege .
And still this hair is growing now ; this moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it ' s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava .
How the wild winds blow it ; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to .
There ' s a most special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference !
" Nothing !
and noon at hand !
See the sun !
Aye , aye , it must be so .
Aye , he ' s chasing ME now ; not I , HIM -- that ' s bad ; I might have known it , too .
Come down , all of ye , but the regular look outs !
Steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod ' s quarter , so that now being pointed in the reverse direction , the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake .
I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him !
There ' s the difference now between man ' s old age and matter ' s .
Aye , aye , like many more thou told ' st direful truth as touching thyself , O Parsee ; but , Ahab , there thy shot fell short .
In due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his shallop ' s stern , Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the mate ,-- who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck -- and bade him pause .
"
" Truth , sir : saddest truth .
" The sharks !
" cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; " O master , my master , come back !
But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the boat leaped on .
It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale - boats in those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east .
what is this that shoots through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet expectant ,-- fixed at the top of a shudder !
I seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue .
The boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads -- a downward pointed arm , Ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but intending to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel ; the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow .
to their uttermost heads drive them in !
ha !
"
" Befooled , befooled !
gone down again ?
He seemed swimming with his utmost velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea .
Ahab ," cried Starbuck , " not too late is it , even now , the third day , to desist .
Glancing upwards , he saw Tashtego , Queequeg , and Daggoo , eagerly mounting to the three mast - heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were busily at work in repairing them .
those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars .
take the helm !
As both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked into a morass , Moby Dick sideways writhed ; spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow , and , without staving a hole in it , so suddenly canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung , Ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea .
" What breaks in me ?
" The whale , the whale !
Let not Starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ' s fainting fit .
" Stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help Stubb ; for Stubb , too , sticks here .
I grin at thee , thou grinning whale !
Look ye , sun , moon , and stars !
Oh , oh !
oh , oh !
cherries !
" The ship !
" cried Ahab from the boat ; " its wood could only be American !
" I turn my body from the sun .
Oh !
must ye then perish , and without me ?
from all your furthest bounds , pour ye now in , ye bold billows of my whole foregone life , and top this one piled comber of my death !
It so chanced , that after the Parsee ' s disappearance , I was he whom the Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern .
So , floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me , I was then , but slowly , drawn towards the closing vortex .
[ Paradise Lost by John Milton 1667 ]
Of Man ' s first disobedience , and the fruit Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste Brought death into the World , and all our woe , With loss of Eden , till one greater Man Restore us , and regain the blissful seat , Sing , Heavenly Muse , that , on the secret top Of Oreb , or of Sinai , didst inspire That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed In the beginning how the heavens and earth Rose out of Chaos : or , if Sion hill Delight thee more , and Siloa ' s brook that flowed Fast by the oracle of God , I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song , That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th ' Aonian mount , while it pursues Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme .
There the companions of his fall , o ' erwhelmed With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire , He soon discerns ; and , weltering by his side , One next himself in power , and next in crime , Long after known in Palestine , and named Beelzebub .
Yet not for those , Nor what the potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict , do I repent , or change , Though changed in outward lustre , that fixed mind , And high disdain from sense of injured merit , That with the Mightiest raised me to contend , And to the fierce contentions brought along Innumerable force of Spirits armed , That durst dislike his reign , and , me preferring , His utmost power with adverse power opposed In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven , And shook his throne .
But see !
So stretched out huge in length the Arch - fiend lay , Chained on the burning lake ; nor ever thence Had risen , or heaved his head , but that the will And high permission of all - ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs , That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation , while he sought Evil to others , and enraged might see How all his malice served but to bring forth Infinite goodness , grace , and mercy , shewn On Man by him seduced , but on himself Treble confusion , wrath , and vengeance poured .
Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet .
" Is this the region , this the soil , the clime ," Said then the lost Archangel , " this the seat That we must change for Heaven ?-- this mournful gloom For that celestial light ?
Be it so , since he Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid What shall be right : farthest from him is best Whom reason hath equalled , force hath made supreme Above his equals .
Farewell , happy fields , Where joy for ever dwells !
and thou , profoundest Hell , Receive thy new possessor -- one who brings A mind not to be changed by place or time .
What matter where , if I be still the same , And what I should be , all but less than he Whom thunder hath made greater ?
Awake , arise , or be for ever fallen !
As when the potent rod Of Amram ' s son , in Egypt ' s evil day , Waved round the coast , up - called a pitchy cloud Of locusts , warping on the eastern wind , That o ' er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night , and darkened all the land of Nile ; So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell , ' Twixt upper , nether , and surrounding fires ; Till , as a signal given , th ' uplifted spear Of their great Sultan waving to direct Their course , in even balance down they light On the firm brimstone , and fill all the plain : A multitude like which the populous North Poured never from her frozen loins to pass Rhene or the Danaw , when her barbarous sons Came like a deluge on the South , and spread Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands .
For Spirits , when they please , Can either sex assume , or both ; so soft And uncompounded is their essence pure , Not tried or manacled with joint or limb , Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones , Like cumbrous flesh ; but , in what shape they choose , Dilated or condensed , bright or obscure , Can execute their airy purposes , And works of love or enmity fulfil .
For those the race of Israel oft forsook Their Living Strength , and unfrequented left His righteous altar , bowing lowly down To bestial gods ; for which their heads as low Bowed down in battle , sunk before the spear Of despicable foes .
Next came one Who mourned in earnest , when the captive ark Maimed his brute image , head and hands lopt off , In his own temple , on the grunsel - edge , Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers : Dagon his name , sea - monster , upward man And downward fish ; yet had his temple high Reared in Azotus , dreaded through the coast Of Palestine , in Gath and Ascalon , And Accaron and Gaza ' s frontier bounds .
That proud honour claimed Azazel as his right , a Cherub tall : Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled Th ' imperial ensign ; which , full high advanced , Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind , With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed , Seraphic arms and trophies ; all the while Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds : At which the universal host up - sent A shout that tore Hell ' s concave , and beyond Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night .
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and soft recorders -- such as raised To height of noblest temper heroes old Arming to battle , and instead of rage Deliberate valour breathed , firm , and unmoved With dread of death to flight or foul retreat ; Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches troubled thoughts , and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds .
O Powers Matchless , but with th ' Almighth !-- and that strife Was not inglorious , though th ' event was dire , As this place testifies , and this dire change , Hateful to utter .
But what power of mind , Forseeing or presaging , from the depth Of knowledge past or present , could have feared How such united force of gods , how such As stood like these , could ever know repulse ?
Thither , if but to pry , shall be perhaps Our first eruption -- thither , or elsewhere ; For this infernal pit shall never hold Celestial Spirits in bondage , nor th ' Abyss Long under darkness cover .
War , then , war Open or understood , must be resolved .
Not Babylon Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equalled in all their glories , to enshrine Belus or Serapis their gods , or seat Their kings , when Egypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxury .
His hand was known In Heaven by many a towered structure high , Where sceptred Angels held their residence , And sat as Princes , whom the supreme King Exalted to such power , and gave to rule , Each in his Hierarchy , the Orders bright .
Meanwhile the winged Heralds , by command Of sovereign power , with awful ceremony And trumpet ' s sound , throughout the host proclaim A solemn council forthwith to be held At Pandemonium , the high capital Of Satan and his peers .
They but now who seemed In bigness to surpass Earth ' s giant sons , Now less than smallest dwarfs , in narrow room Throng numberless -- like that pygmean race Beyond the Indian mount ; or faery elves , Whose midnight revels , by a forest - side Or fountain , some belated peasant sees , Or dreams he sees , while overhead the Moon Sits arbitress , and nearer to the Earth Wheels her pale course : they , on their mirth and dance Intent , with jocund music charm his ear ; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds .
After short silence then , And summons read , the great consult began .
Where there is , then , no good For which to strive , no strife can grow up there From faction : for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence ; none whose portion is so small Of present pain that with ambitious mind Will covet more !
Who can advise may speak .
" He ceased ; and next him Moloch , sceptred king , Stood up -- the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heaven , now fiercer by despair .
Of wiles , More unexpert , I boast not : them let those Contrive who need , or when they need ; not now .
No !
" He ended frowning , and his look denounced Desperate revenge , and battle dangerous To less than gods .
But all was false and hollow ; though his tongue Dropped manna , and could make the worse appear The better reason , to perplex and dash Maturest counsels : for his thoughts were low -- To vice industrious , but to nobler deeds Timorous and slothful .
Thus repulsed , our final hope Is flat despair : we must exasperate Th ' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage ; And that must end us ; that must be our cure -- To be no more .
for who would lose , Though full of pain , this intellectual being , Those thoughts that wander through eternity , To perish rather , swallowed up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated Night , Devoid of sense and motion ?
That sure was worse .
This would be worse .
Better these than worse , By my advice ; since fate inevitable Subdues us , and omnipotent decree , The Victor ' s will .
This deep world Of darkness do we dread ?
while we dream , And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed This place our dungeon , not our safe retreat Beyond his potent arm , to live exempt From Heaven ' s high jurisdiction , in new league Banded against his throne , but to remain In strictest bondage , though thus far removed , Under th ' inevitable curb , reserved His captive multitude .
and what peace can we return , But , to our power , hostility and hate , Untamed reluctance , and revenge , though slow , Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest , and may least rejoice In doing what we most in suffering feel ?
Though Heaven be shut , And Heaven ' s high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength , this place may lie exposed , The utmost border of his kingdom , left To their defence who hold it : here , perhaps , Some advantageous act may be achieved By sudden onset -- either with Hell - fire To waste his whole creation , or possess All as our own , and drive , as we were driven , The puny habitants ; or , if not drive , Seduce them to our party , that their God May prove their foe , and with repenting hand Abolish his own works .
" Thus beelzebub Pleaded his devilish counsel -- first devised By Satan , and in part proposed : for whence , But from the author of all ill , could spring So deep a malice , to confound the race Of mankind in one root , and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve , done all to spite The great Creator ?
Here he had need All circumspection : and we now no less Choice in our suffrage ; for on whom we send The weight of all , and our last hope , relies .
With reason hath deep silence and demur Seized us , though undismayed .
Nor failed they to express how much they praised That for the general safety he despised His own : for neither do the Spirits damned Lose all their virtue ; lest bad men should boast Their specious deeds on earth , which glory excites , Or close ambition varnished o ' er with zeal .
Thither , by harpy - footed Furies haled , At certain revolutions all the damned Are brought ; and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extremes , extremes by change more fierce , From beds of raging fire to starve in ice Their soft ethereal warmth , and there to pine Immovable , infixed , and frozen round Periods of time ,-- thence hurried back to fire .
They ferry over this Lethean sound Both to and fro , their sorrow to augment , And wish and struggle , as they pass , to reach The tempting stream , with one small drop to lose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe , All in one moment , and so near the brink ; But Fate withstands , and , to oppose th ' attempt , Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The ford , and of itself the water flies All taste of living wight , as once it fled The lip of Tantalus .
Satan was now at hand , and from his seat The monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides ; Hell trembled as he strode .
And reckon ' st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven Hell - doomed , and breath ' st defiance here and scorn , Where I reign king , and , to enrage thee more , Thy king and lord ?
What fury , O son , Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart Against thy father ' s head ?
Pensive here I sat Alone ; but long I sat not , till my womb , Pregnant by thee , and now excessive grown , Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes .
But thou , O father , I forewarn thee , shun His deadly arrow ; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright arms , Through tempered heavenly ; for that mortal dint , Save he who reigns above , none can resist .
" She finished ; and the subtle Fiend his lore Soon learned , now milder , and thus answered smooth :-- " Dear daughter -- since thou claim ' st me for thy sire , And my fair son here show ' st me , the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven , and joys Then sweet , now sad to mention , through dire change Befallen us unforeseen , unthought - of -- know , I come no enemy , but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain Both him and thee , and all the heavenly host Of Spirits that , in our just pretences armed , Fell with us from on high .
For Hot , Cold , Moist , and Dry , four champions fierce , Strive here for mastery , and to battle bring Their embryon atoms : they around the flag Of each his faction , in their several clans , Light - armed or heavy , sharp , smooth , swift , or slow , Swarm populous , unnumbered as the sands Of Barca or Cyrene ' s torrid soil , Levied to side with warring winds , and poise Their lighter wings .
All unawares , Fluttering his pennons vain , plumb - down he drops Ten thousand fathom deep , and to this hour Down had been falling , had not , by ill chance , The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud , Instinct with fire and nitre , hurried him As many miles aloft .
Sin and Death amain , Following his track ( such was the will of Heaven ) Paved after him a broad and beaten way Over the dark Abyss , whose boiling gulf Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length , From Hell continued , reaching th ' utmost orb Of this frail World ; by which the Spirits perverse With easy intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals , except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace .
But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears , and from the walls of Heaven Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn .
Here Nature first begins Her farthest verge , and Chaos to retire , As from her outmost works , a broken foe , With tumult less and with less hostile din ; That Satan with less toil , and now with ease , Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light , And , like a weather - beaten vessel , holds Gladly the port , though shrouds and tackle torn ; Or in the emptier waste , resembling air , Weighs his spread wings , at leisure to behold Far off th ' empyreal Heaven , extended wide In circuit , undetermined square or round , With opal towers and battlements adorned Of living sapphire , once his native seat ; And , fast by , hanging in a golden chain , This pendent World , in bigness as a star Of smallest magnitude close by the moon .
Book III
before the sun , Before the Heavens thou wert , and at the voice Of God , as with a mantle , didst invest *** The rising world of waters dark and deep , Won from the void and formless infinite .
Yet not the more Cease I to wander , where the Muses haunt , Clear spring , or shady grove , or sunny hill , Smit with the love of sacred song ; but chief Thee , Sion , and the flowery brooks beneath , That wash thy hallow ' d feet , and warbling flow , Nightly I visit : nor sometimes forget So were I equall ' d with them in renown , Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ; Blind Thamyris , and blind Maeonides , And Tiresias , and Phineus , prophets old : Then feed on thoughts , that voluntary move Harmonious numbers ; as the wakeful bird Sings darkling , and in shadiest covert hid Tunes her nocturnal note .
O Father , gracious was that word which clos ' d Thy sovran command , that Man should find grace ; , that Man should find grace ; For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol Thy praises , with the innumerable sound Of hymns and sacred songs , wherewith thy throne Encompass ' d shall resound thee ever blest .
O son , in whom my soul hath chief delight , Son of my bosom , Son who art alone .
Say , heavenly Powers , where shall we find such love ?
Because thou hast , though throned in highest bliss Equal to God , and equally enjoying God - like fruition , quitted all , to save A world from utter loss , and hast been found By merit more than birthright Son of God , Found worthiest to be so by being good , Far more than great or high ; because in thee Love hath abounded more than glory abounds ; Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt With thee thy manhood also to this throne : Here shalt thou sit incarnate , here shalt reign Both God and Man , Son both of God and Man , Anointed universal King ; all power I give thee ; reign for ever , and assume Thy merits ; under thee , as head supreme , Thrones , Princedoms , Powers , Dominions , I reduce : All knees to thee shall bow , of them that bide In Heaven , or Earth , or under Earth in Hell .
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim Thee only extolled , Son of thy Father ' s might , To execute fierce vengeance on his foes , Not so on Man : Him through their malice fallen , Father of mercy and grace , thou didst not doom So strictly , but much more to pity incline : No sooner did thy dear and only Son Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man So strictly , but much more to pity inclined , He to appease thy wrath , and end the strife Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned , Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat Second to thee , offered himself to die For Man ' s offence .
Hail , Son of God , Saviour of Men !
Thy name Shall be the copious matter of my song Henceforth , and never shall my heart thy praise Forget , nor from thy Father ' s praise disjoin .
As when a vultur on Imaus bred , Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds , Dislodging from a region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids , On hills where flocks are fed , flies toward the springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes , Indian streams ; But in his way lights on the barren plains Of Sericana , where Chineses drive With sails and wind their cany waggons light : So , on this windy sea of land , the Fiend Walked up and down alone , bent on his prey ; Alone , for other creature in this place , Living or lifeless , to be found was none ; None yet , but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like aereal vapours flew Of all things transitory and vain , when sin With vanity had filled the works of men : Both all things vain , and all who in vain things Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame , Or happiness in this or the other life ; All who have their reward on earth , the fruits Of painful superstition and blind zeal , Nought seeking but the praise of men , here find Fit retribution , empty as their deeds ; All the unaccomplished works of Nature ' s hand , Abortive , monstrous , or unkindly mixed , Dissolved on earth , fleet hither , and in vain , Till final dissolution , wander here ; Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed ; Those argent fields more likely habitants , Translated Saints , or middle Spirits hold Betwixt the angelical and human kind .

The place he found beyond expression bright , Compared with aught on earth , metal or stone ; Not all parts like , but all alike informed With radiant light , as glowing iron with fire ; If metal , part seemed gold , part silver clear ; If stone , carbuncle most or chrysolite , Ruby or topaz , to the twelve that shone In Aaron ' s breast - plate , and a stone besides Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen , That stone , or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought , In vain , though by their powerful art they bind Volatile Hermes , and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the sea , Drained through a limbeck to his native form .
What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure , and rivers run Potable gold , when with one virtuous touch The arch - chemick sun , so far from us remote , Produces , with terrestrial humour mixed , Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious , and effect so rare ?
Glad was the Spirit impure , as now in hope To find who might direct his wandering flight To Paradise , the happy seat of Man , His journey ' s end and our beginning woe .
Fair Angel , thy desire , which tends to know The works of God , thereby to glorify The great Work - master , leads to no excess That reaches blame , but rather merits praise The more it seems excess , that led thee hither From thy empyreal mansion thus alone , To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps , Contented with report , hear only in Heaven : For wonderful indeed are all his works , Pleasant to know , and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance always with delight ; But what created mind can comprehend Their number , or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth , but hid their causes deep ?
Thy way thou canst not miss , me mine requires .
that now , While time was , our first parents had been warned The coming of their secret foe , and ' scaped , Haply so ' scaped his mortal snare : For now Satan , now first inflamed with rage , came down , The tempter ere the accuser of mankind , To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss Of that first battle , and his flight to Hell : Yet , not rejoicing in his speed , though bold Far off and fearless , nor with cause to boast , Begins his dire attempt ; which nigh the birth Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast , And like a devilish engine back recoils Upon himself ; horrour and doubt distract His troubled thoughts , and from the bottom stir The Hell within him ; for within him Hell He brings , and round about him , nor from Hell One step , no more than from himself , can fly By change of place : Now conscience wakes despair , That slumbered ; wakes the bitter memory Of what he was , what is , and what must be Worse ; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue .
Sometimes towards Eden , which now in his view Lay pleasant , his grieved look he fixes sad ; Sometimes towards Heaven , and the full - blazing sun , Which now sat high in his meridian tower : Then , much revolving , thus in sighs began .
Yet why not some other Power As great might have aspired , and me , though mean , Drawn to his part ; but other Powers as great Fell not , but stand unshaken , from within Or from without , to all temptations armed .
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand ?
they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vain , Under what torments inwardly I groan , While they adore me on the throne of Hell .
And higher than that wall a circling row Of goodliest trees , loaden with fairest fruit , Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue , Appeared , with gay enamelled colours mixed : On which the sun more glad impressed his beams Than in fair evening cloud , or humid bow , When God hath showered the earth ; so lovely seemed That landskip : And of pure now purer air Meets his approach , and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy , able to drive All sadness but despair : Now gentle gales , Fanning their odoriferous wings , dispense Native perfumes , and whisper whence they stole Those balmy spoils .
The birds their quire apply ; airs , vernal airs , Breathing the smell of field and grove , attune The trembling leaves , while universal Pan , Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance , Led on the eternal Spring .
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced Creatures of other mould , earth - born perhaps , Not Spirits , yet to heavenly Spirits bright Little inferiour ; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder , and could love , so lively shines In them divine resemblance , and such grace The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured .
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree Down he alights among the sportful herd Of those four - footed kinds , himself now one , Now other , as their shape served best his end Nearer to view his prey , and , unespied , To mark what of their state he more might learn , By word or action marked .
About them round A lion now he stalks with fiery glare ; Then as a tiger , who by chance hath spied In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play , Straight couches close , then , rising , changes oft His couchant watch , as one who chose his ground , Whence rushing , he might surest seize them both , Griped in each paw : when , Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech , Turned him , all ear to hear new utterance flow .
Sole partner , and sole part , of all these joys , Dearer thyself than all ; needs must the Power That made us , and for us this ample world , Be infinitely good , and of his good As liberal and free as infinite ; That raised us from the dust , and placed us here In all this happiness , who at his hand Have nothing merited , nor can perform Aught whereof he hath need ; he who requires From us no other service than to keep This one , this easy charge , of all the trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various , not to taste that only tree Of knowledge , planted by the tree of life ; So near grows death to life , whate ' er death is , Some dreadful thing no doubt ; for well thou knowest God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree , The only sign of our obedience left , Among so many signs of power and rule Conferred upon us , and dominion given Over all other creatures that possess Earth , air , and sea .
Till I espied thee , fair indeed and tall , Under a platane ; yet methought less fair , Less winning soft , less amiably mild , Than that smooth watery image : Back I turned ; Thou following cryedst aloud , ' Return , fair Eve ; ' Whom flyest thou ?
And do they only stand By ignorance ?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build Their ruin !
hence I will excite their minds With more desire to know , and to reject Envious commands , invented with design To keep them low , whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods : aspiring to be such , They taste and die : What likelier can ensue But first with narrow search I must walk round This garden , and no corner leave unspied ; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side , Or in thick shade retired , from him to draw What further would be learned .
Uriel , no wonder if thy perfect sight , Amid the sun ' s bright circle where thou sitst , See far and wide : In at this gate none pass The vigilance here placed , but such as come Well known from Heaven ; and since meridian hour No creature thence : If Spirit of other sort , So minded , have o ' er - leaped these earthly bounds On purpose , hard thou knowest it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal bar .
Fair Consort , the hour Of night , and all things now retired to rest , Mind us of like repose ; since God hath set Labour and rest , as day and night , to men Successive ; and the timely dew of sleep , Now falling with soft slumbrous weight , inclines Our eye - lids : Other creatures all day long Rove idle , unemployed , and less need rest ; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed , which declares his dignity , And the regard of Heaven on all his ways ; While other animals unactive range , And of their doings God takes no account .
These then , though unbeheld in deep of night , Shine not in vain ; nor think , though men were none , That Heaven would want spectators , God want praise : Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth Unseen , both when we wake , and when we sleep : All these with ceaseless praise his works behold Both day and night : How often from the steep Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air , Sole , or responsive each to others note , Singing their great Creator ?
Our Maker bids encrease ; who bids abstain But our Destroyer , foe to God and Man ?
Sleep on , Blest pair ; and O ! yet happiest , if ye seek No happier state , and know to know no more .
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake .
Thou wouldst thyself , no doubt And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain , where thou mightst hope to change Torment with ease , and soonest recompense Dole with delight , which in this place I sought ; To thee no reason , who knowest only good , But evil hast not tried : and wilt object His will who bounds us !
Let him surer bar His iron gates , if he intends our stay In that dark durance : Thus much what was asked .
till the wrath , Which thou incurrest by flying , meet thy flight Sevenfold , and scourge that wisdom back to Hell , Which taught thee yet no better , that no pain Can equal anger infinite provoked .
wherefore with thee Came not all hell broke loose ?
Courageous Chief !
Not that I less endure , or shrink from pain , Insulting Angel !
O name , O sacred name of faithfulness profaned !
Was this your discipline and faith engaged , Your military obedience , to dissolve Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme ?
But mark what I arreed thee now , Avant ; Fly neither whence thou fledst !
Book V
Such whispering waked her , but with startled eye On Adam , whom embracing , thus she spake .
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose , My glory , my perfection !
' In whose sight all things joy , with ravishment ' Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze .
' So saying , he drew nigh , and to me held , Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part Which he had plucked ; the pleasant savoury smell So quickened appetite , that I , methought , Could not but taste .
But first , from under shady arborous roof Soon as they forth were come to open sight Of day - spring , and the sun , who , scarce up - risen , With wheels yet hovering o ' er the ocean - brim , Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray , Discovering in wide landskip all the east Of Paradise and Eden ' s happy plains , Lowly they bowed adoring , and began Their orisons , each morning duly paid In various style ; for neither various style Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise Their Maker , in fit strains pronounced , or sung Unmeditated ; such prompt eloquence Flowed from their lips , in prose or numerous verse , More tuneable than needed lute or harp To add more sweetness ; and they thus began .
Fairest of stars , last in the train of night , If better thou belong not to the dawn , Sure pledge of day , that crownest the smiling morn With thy bright circlet , praise him in thy sphere , While day arises , that sweet hour of prime .
Moon , that now meetest the orient sun , now flyest , With the fixed Stars , fixed in their orb that flies ; And ye five other wandering Fires , that move In mystick dance not without song , resound His praise , who out of darkness called up light .
Ye that in waters glide , and ye that walk The earth , and stately tread , or lowly creep ; Witness if I be silent , morn or even , To hill , or valley , fountain , or fresh shade , Made vocal by my song , and taught his praise .
Raphael , said he , thou hearest what stir on Earth Satan , from Hell ' scaped through the darksome gulf , Hath raised in Paradise ; and how disturbed This night the human pair ; how he designs In them at once to ruin all mankind .
So saying , with dispatchful looks in haste She turns , on hospitable thoughts intent What choice to choose for delicacy best , What order , so contrived as not to mix Tastes , not well joined , inelegant , but bring Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change ; Bestirs her then , and from each tender stalk Whatever Earth , all - bearing mother , yields In India East or West , or middle shore In Pontus or the Punick coast , or where Alcinous reigned , fruit of all kinds , in coat Rough , or smooth rind , or bearded husk , or shell , She gathers , tribute large , and on the board Heaps with unsparing hand ; for drink the grape She crushes , inoffensive must , and meaths From many a berry , and from sweet kernels pressed She tempers dulcet creams ; nor these to hold Wants her fit vessels pure ; then strows the ground With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed .
On whom the Angel Hail Bestowed , the holy salutation used Long after to blest Mary , second Eve .
Hail , Mother of Mankind , whose fruitful womb Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons , Than with these various fruits the trees of God Have heaped this table !-- Raised of grassy turf Their table was , and mossy seats had round , And on her ample square from side to side All autumn piled , though spring and autumn here Danced hand in hand .
Wonder not then , what God for you saw good If I refuse not , but convert , as you To proper substance .
how , without remorse , The ruin of so many glorious once And perfect while they stood ?
yet for thy good This is dispensed ; and what surmounts the reach Of human sense , I shall delineate so , By likening spiritual to corporal forms , As may express them best ; though what if Earth Be but a shadow of Heaven , and things therein Each to other like , more than on earth is thought ?
Sleepest thou , Companion dear ?
Son , thou in whom my glory I behold In full resplendence , Heir of all my might , Nearly it now concerns us to be sure Of our Omnipotence , and with what arms We mean to hold what anciently we claim Of deity or empire : Such a foe Is rising , who intends to erect his throne Equal to ours , throughout the spacious north ; Nor so content , hath in his thought to try In battle , what our power is , or our right .
Let us advise , and to this hazard draw With speed what force is left , and all employ In our defence ; lest unawares we lose This our high place , our sanctuary , our hill .
Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers ; If these magnifick titles yet remain Not merely titular , since by decree Another now hath to himself engrossed All power , and us eclipsed under the name Of King anointed , for whom all this haste Of midnight - march , and hurried meeting here , This only to consult how we may best , With what may be devised of honours new , Receive him coming to receive from us Knee - tribute yet unpaid , prostration vile !
But what if better counsels might erect Our minds , and teach us to cast off this yoke ?
unjust , thou sayest , Flatly unjust , to bind with laws the free , And equal over equals to let reign , One over all with unsucceeded power .
Shalt thou give law to God ?
shalt thou dispute With him the points of liberty , who made Thee what thou art , and formed the Powers of Heaven Such as he pleased , and circumscribed their being ?
But to grant it thee unjust , That equal over equals monarch reign : Thyself , though great and glorious , dost thou count , Or all angelick nature joined in one , Equal to him begotten Son ?
by whom , As by his Word , the Mighty Father made All things , even thee ; and all the Spirits of Heaven By him created in their bright degrees , Crowned them with glory , and to their glory named Thrones , Dominations , Princedoms , Virtues , Powers , Essential Powers ; nor by his reign obscured , But more illustrious made ; since he the head One of our number thus reduced becomes ; His laws our laws ; all honour to him done Returns our own .
We know no time when we were not as now ; Know none before us , self - begot , self - raised By our own quickening power , when fatal course Had circled his full orb , the birth mature Of this our native Heaven , ethereal sons .
All night the dreadless Angel , unpursued , Through Heaven ' s wide champain held his way ; till Morn , Waked by the circling Hours , with rosy hand Unbarred the gates of light .
Servant of God .
that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain , where faith and realty Remain not : Wherefore should not strength and might There fail where virtue fails , or weakest prove Where boldest , though to fight unconquerable ?
thy hope was to have reached The highth of thy aspiring unopposed , The throne of God unguarded , and his side Abandoned , at the terrour of thy power Or potent tongue : Fool ! not to think how vain Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms ; Who out of smallest things could , without end , Have raised incessant armies to defeat Thy folly ; or with solitary hand Reaching beyond all limit , at one blow , Unaided , could have finished thee , and whelmed Thy legions under darkness : But thou seest All are not of thy train ; there be , who faith Prefer , and piety to God , though then To thee not visible , when I alone Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent From all : My sect thou seest ; now learn too late How few sometimes may know , when thousands err .
Now storming fury rose , And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now Was never ; arms on armour clashing brayed Horrible discord , and the madding wheels Of brazen chariots raged ; dire was the noise Of conflict ; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew , And flying vaulted either host with fire .
So under fiery cope together rushed Both battles main , with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage .
Long time in even scale The battle hung ; till Satan , who that day Prodigious power had shown , and met in arms No equal , ranging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confused , at length Saw where the sword of Michael smote , and felled Squadrons at once ; with huge two - handed sway Brandished aloft , the horrid edge came down Wide - wasting ; such destruction to withstand He hasted , and opposed the rocky orb Of tenfold adamant , his ample shield , A vast circumference .
Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved Memorial , where the might of Gabriel fought , And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array Of Moloch , furious king ; who him defied , And at his chariot - wheels to drag him bound Threatened , nor from the Holy One of Heaven Refrained his tongue blasphemous ; but anon Down cloven to the waist , with shattered arms And uncouth pain fled bellowing .
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The atheist crew , but with redoubled blow Ariel , and Arioch , and the violence Of Ramiel scorched and blasted , overthrew .
For strength from truth divided , and from just , Illaudable , nought merits but dispraise And ignominy ; yet to glory aspires Vain - glorious , and through infamy seeks fame : Therefore eternal silence be their doom .
Of evil then so small as easy think The remedy ; perhaps more valid arms , Weapons more violent , when next we meet , May serve to better us , and worse our foes , Or equal what between us made the odds , In nature none : If other hidden cause Left them superiour , while we can preserve Unhurt our minds , and understanding sound , Due search and consultation will disclose .
Deliverer from new Lords , leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods ; yet hard For Gods , and too unequal work we find , Against unequal arms to fight in pain , Against unpained , impassive ; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue ; for what avails Valour or strength , though matchless , quelled with pain Which all subdues , and makes remiss the hands Of mightiest ?
The invention all admired , and each , how he To be the inventer missed ; so easy it seemed Once found , which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible : Yet , haply , of thy race In future days , if malice should abound , Some one intent on mischief , or inspired With devilish machination , might devise Like instrument to plague the sons of men For sin , on war and mutual slaughter bent .
Arm , Warriours , arm for fight ; the foe at hand , Whom fled we thought , will save us long pursuit This day ; fear not his flight ; so thick a cloud He comes , and settled in his face I see Sad resolution , and secure : Let each His adamantine coat gird well , and each Fit well his helm , gripe fast his orbed shield , Borne even or high ; for this day will pour down , If I conjecture aught , no drizzling shower , But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire .
So warned he them , aware themselves , and soon In order , quit of all impediment ; Instant without disturb they took alarm , And onward moved embattled : When behold !
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe Approaching gross and huge , in hollow cube Training his devilish enginery , impaled On every side with shadowing squadrons deep , To hide the fraud .
Immediate in a flame , But soon obscured with smoke , all Heaven appeared , From those deep - throated engines belched , whose roar Embowelled with outrageous noise the air , And all her entrails tore , disgorging foul Their devilish glut , chained thunderbolts and hail Of iron globes ; which , on the victor host Levelled , with such impetuous fury smote , That , whom they hit , none on their feet might stand , Though standing else as rocks , but down they fell By thousands , Angel on Arch - Angel rolled ; The sooner for their arms ; unarmed , they might Have easily , as Spirits , evaded swift By quick contraction or remove ; but now Foul dissipation followed , and forced rout ; Nor served it to relax their serried files .
What should they do ?
Two days are therefore past , the third is thine ; For thee I have ordained it ; and thus far Have suffered , that the glory may be thine Of ending this great war , since none but Thou Can end it .
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned ; That they may have their wish , to try with me In battle which the stronger proves ; they all , Or I alone against them ; since by strength They measure all , of other excellence Not emulous , nor care who them excels ; Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe .
Thus was the first day even and morn : Nor past uncelebrated , nor unsung By the celestial quires , when orient light Exhaling first from darkness they beheld ; Birth - day of Heaven and Earth ; with joy and shout The hollow universal orb they filled , And touched their golden harps , and hymning praised God and his works ; Creator him they sung , Both when first evening was , and when first morn .
Again the Almighty spake , Let there be lights High in the expanse of Heaven , to divide The day from night ; and let them be for signs , For seasons , and for days , and circling years ; And let them be for lights , as I ordain Their office in the firmament of Heaven , To give light on the Earth ; and it was so .
Forthwith the sounds and seas , each creek and bay , With fry innumerable swarm , and shoals Of fish that with their fins , and shining scales , Glide under the green wave , in sculls that oft Bank the mid sea : part single , or with mate , Graze the sea - weed their pasture , and through groves Of coral stray ; or , sporting with quick glance , Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold ; Or , in their pearly shells at ease , attend Moist nutriment ; or under rocks their food In jointed armour watch : on smooth the seal And bended dolphins play : part huge of bulk Wallowing unwieldy , enormous in their gait , Tempest the ocean : there leviathan , Hugest of living creatures , on the deep Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims , And seems a moving land ; and at his gills Draws in , and at his trunk spouts out , a sea .
First crept The parsimonious emmet , provident Of future ; in small room large heart enclosed ; Pattern of just equality perhaps Hereafter , joined in her popular tribes Of commonalty : Swarming next appeared The female bee , that feeds her husband drone Deliciously , and builds her waxen cells With honey stored : The rest are numberless , And thou their natures knowest , and gavest them names , Needless to thee repeated ; nor unknown The serpent , subtlest beast of all the field , Of huge extent sometimes , with brazen eyes And hairy mane terrifick , though to thee Not noxious , but obedient at thy call .
Wherever thus created , for no place Is yet distinct by name , thence , as thou knowest , He brought thee into this delicious grove , This garden , planted with the trees of God , Delectable both to behold and taste ; And freely all their pleasant fruit for food Gave thee ; all sorts are here that all the Earth yields , Variety without end ; but of the tree , Which , tasted , works knowledge of good and evil , Thou mayest not ; in the day thou eatest , thou diest ; Death is the penalty imposed ; beware , And govern well thy appetite ; lest Sin Surprise thee , and her black attendant Death .
Here finished he , and all that he had made Viewed , and behold all was entirely good ; So even and morn accomplished the sixth day : Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting , though unwearied , up returned , Up to the Heaven of Heavens , his high abode ; Thence to behold this new created world , The addition of his empire , how it showed In prospect from his throne , how good , how fair , Answering his great idea .
And now on Earth the seventh Evening arose in Eden , for the sun Was set , and twilight from the east came on , Forerunning night ; when at the holy mount Of Heaven ' s high - seated top , the imperial throne Of Godhead , fixed for ever firm and sure , The Filial Power arrived , and sat him down With his great Father ; for he also went Invisible , yet staid , ( such privilege Hath Omnipresence ) and the work ordained , Author and End of all things ; and , from work Now resting , blessed and hallowed the seventh day , As resting on that day from all his work , But not in silence holy kept : the harp Had work and rested not ; the solemn pipe , And dulcimer , all organs of sweet stop , All sounds on fret by string or golden wire , Tempered soft tunings , intermixed with voice Choral or unison : of incense clouds , Fuming from golden censers , hid the mount .
Greater now in thy return Than from the giant Angels : Thee that day Thy thunders magnified ; but to create Is greater than created to destroy .
Their wandering course now high , now low , then hid , Progressive , retrograde , or standing still , In six thou seest ; and what if seventh to these The planet earth , so stedfast though she seem , Insensibly three different motions move ?
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed By living soul , desart and desolate , Only to shine , yet scarce to contribute Each orb a glimpse of light , conveyed so far Down to this habitable , which returns Light back to them , is obvious to dispute .
How fully hast thou satisfied me , pure Intelligence of Heaven , Angel serene !
As new waked from soundest sleep , Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid , In balmy sweat ; which with his beams the sun Soon dried , and on the reeking moisture fed .
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned , And gazed a while the ample sky ; till , raised By quick instinctive motion , up I sprung , As thitherward endeavouring , and upright Stood on my feet : about me round I saw Hill , dale , and shady woods , and sunny plains , And liquid lapse of murmuring streams ; by these , Creatures that lived and moved , and walked , or flew ; Birds on the branches warbling ; all things smiled ; With fragrance and with joy my heart o ' erflowed .
Each tree , Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye Tempting , stirred in me sudden appetite To pluck and eat ; whereat I waked , and found Before mine eyes all real , as the dream Had lively shadowed : Here had new begun My wandering , had not he , who was my guide Up hither , from among the trees appeared , Presence Divine .
' Sternly he pronounced The rigid interdiction , which resounds Yet dreadful in mine ear , though in my choice Not to incur ; but soon his clear aspect Returned , and gracious purpose thus renewed .
What callest thou solitude ?
Is not the Earth With various living creatures , and the air Replenished , and all these at thy command To come and play before thee ?
Whereto the Almighty answered , not displeased .
Thou in thyself art perfect , and in thee Is no deficience found : Not so is Man , But in degree ; the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help Or solace his defects .
I now see Bone of my bone , flesh of my flesh , myself Before me : Woman is her name ; of Man Extracted : for this cause he shall forego Father and mother , and to his wife adhere ; And they shall be one flesh , one heart , one soul .
To whom the Angel with contracted brow .
To whom thus , half abashed , Adam replied .
Book IX
But neither here seek I , no nor in Heaven To dwell , unless by mastering Heaven ' s Supreme ; Nor hope to be myself less miserable By what I seek , but others to make such As I , though thereby worse to me redound : For only in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts ; and , him destroyed , Or won to what may work his utter loss , For whom all this was made , all this will soon Follow , as to him linked in weal or woe ; In woe then ; that destruction wide may range : To me shall be the glory sole among The infernal Powers , in one day to have marred What he , Almighty styled , six nights and days Continued making ; and who knows how long Before had been contriving ?
though perhaps Not longer than since I , in one night , freed From servitude inglorious well nigh half The angelick name , and thinner left the throng Of his adorers : He , to be avenged , And to repair his numbers thus impaired , Whether such virtue spent of old now failed More Angels to create , if they at least Are his created , or , to spite us more , Determined to advance into our room A creature formed of earth , and him endow , Exalted from so base original , With heavenly spoils , our spoils : What he decreed , He effected ; Man he made , and for him built Magnificent this world , and earth his seat , Him lord pronounced ; and , O indignity !
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned .
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands Will keep from wilderness with ease , as wide As we need walk , till younger hands ere long Assist us ; But , if much converse perhaps Thee satiate , to short absence I could yield : For solitude sometimes is best society , And short retirement urges sweet return .
Offspring of Heaven and Earth , and all Earth ' s Lord !
Daughter of God and Man , immortal Eve !
So spake domestick Adam in his care And matrimonial love ; but Eve , who thought Less attributed to her faith sincere , Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed .
And what is faith , love , virtue , unassayed Alone , without exteriour help sustained ?
To whom thus Adam fervently replied .
O Woman , best are all things as the will Of God ordained them : His creating hand Nothing imperfect or deficient left Of all that he created , much less Man , Or aught that might his happy state secure , Secure from outward force ; within himself The danger lies , yet lies within his power : Against his will he can receive no harm .
For God towards thee hath done his part , do thine .
Thou never from that hour in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast , or sound repose ; Such ambush , hid among sweet flowers and shades , Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way , or send thee back Despoiled of innocence , of faith , of bliss !
Nearer he drew , and many a walk traversed Of stateliest covert , cedar , pine , or palm ; Then voluble and bold , now hid , now seen , Among thick - woven arborets , and flowers Imbordered on each bank , the hand of Eve : Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned Or of revived Adonis , or renowned Alcinous , host of old Laertes ' son ; Or that , not mystick , where the sapient king Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse .
As when a ship , by skilful steersmen wrought Nigh river ' s mouth or foreland , where the wind Veers oft , as oft so steers , and shifts her sail : So varied he , and of his tortuous train Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve , To lure her eye ; she , busied , heard the sound Of rusling leaves , but minded not , as used To such disport before her through the field , From every beast ; more duteous at her call , Than at Circean call the herd disguised .
His gentle dumb expression turned at length The eye of Eve to mark his play ; he , glad Of her attention gained , with serpent - tongue Organick , or impulse of vocal air , His fraudulent temptation thus began .
Wonder not , sovran Mistress , if perhaps Thou canst , who art sole wonder !
So glozed the Tempter , and his proem tuned : Into the heart of Eve his words made way , Though at the voice much marvelling ; at length , Not unamazed , she thus in answer spake .
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon ; For , high from ground , the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adam ' s : Round the tree All other beasts that saw , with like desire Longing and envying stood , but could not reach .
Serpent , thy overpraising leaves in doubt The virtue of that fruit , in thee first proved : But say , where grows the tree ?
So glistered the dire Snake , and into fraud Led Eve , our credulous mother , to the tree Of prohibition , root of all our woe ; Which when she saw , thus to her guide she spake .
Of the fruit Of each tree in the garden we may eat ; But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst The garden , God hath said , Ye shall not eat Thereof , nor shall ye touch it , lest ye die .
and not praise Rather your dauntless virtue , whom the pain Of death denounced , whatever thing death be , Deterred not from achieving what might lead To happier life , knowledge of good and evil ; Of good , how just ?
That ye shall be as Gods , since I as Man , Internal Man , is but proportion meet ; I , of brute , human ; ye , of human , Gods .
So ye shall die perhaps , by putting off Human , to put on Gods ; death to be wished , Though threatened , which no worse than this can bring .
Goddess humane , reach then , and freely taste !
Back to the thicket slunk The guilty Serpent ; and well might ; for Eve , Intent now wholly on her taste , nought else Regarded ; such delight till then , as seemed , In fruit she never tasted , whether true Or fancied so , through expectation high Of knowledge ; not was Godhead from her thought .
so to add what wants In female sex , the more to draw his love , And render me more equal ; and perhaps , A thing not undesirable , sometime Superiour ; for , inferiour , who is free This may be well : But what if God have seen , And death ensue ?
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told ; But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed .
So having said , as one from sad dismay Recomforted , and after thoughts disturbed Submitting to what seemed remediless , Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned .
But past who can recall , or done undo ?
However I with thee have fixed my lot , Certain to undergo like doom : If death Consort with thee , death is to me as life ; So forcible within my heart I feel The bond of Nature draw me to my own ; My own in thee , for what thou art is mine ; Our state cannot be severed ; we are one , One flesh ; to lose thee were to lose myself .
Engaging me to emulate ; but , short Of thy perfection , how shall I attain , Adam , from whose dear side I boast me sprung , And gladly of our union hear thee speak , One heart , one soul in both ; whereof good proof This day affords , declaring thee resolved , Rather than death , or aught than death more dread , Shall separate us , linked in love so dear , To undergo with me one guilt , one crime , If any be , of tasting this fair fruit ; Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds , Direct , or by occasion , hath presented This happy trial of thy love , which else So eminently never had been known ?
In recompence for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing fruit With liberal hand : he scrupled not to eat , Against his better knowledge ; not deceived , But fondly overcome with female charm .
So said he , and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent ; well understood Of Eve , whose eye darted contagious fire .
Her hand he seised ; and to a shady bank , Thick over - head with verdant roof imbowered , He led her nothing loth ; flowers were the couch , Pansies , and violets , and asphodel , And hyacinth ; Earth ' s freshest softest lap .
Would thou hadst hearkened to my words , and staid With me , as I besought thee , when that strange Desire of wandering , this unhappy morn , I know not whence possessed thee ; we had then Remained still happy ; not , as now , despoiled Of all our good ; shamed , naked , miserable !
What words have passed thy lips , Adam severe !
Too facile then , thou didst not much gainsay ; Nay , didst permit , approve , and fair dismiss .
Mean while the heinous and despiteful act Of Satan , done in Paradise ; and how He , in the serpent , had perverted Eve , Her husband she , to taste the fatal fruit , Was known in Heaven ; for what can ' scape the eye Of God all - seeing , or deceive his heart Omniscient ?
I miss thee here , Not pleased , thus entertained with solitude , Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought : Or come I less conspicuous , or what change Absents thee , or what chance detains ?-- Come forth !
That thou art naked , who Hath told thee ?
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied .
The Serpent me beguiled , and I did eat .
So spake this oracle , then verified When Jesus , Son of Mary , second Eve , Saw Satan fall , like lightning , down from Heaven , Prince of the air ; then , rising from his grave Spoiled Principalities and Powers , triumphed In open show ; and , with ascension bright , Captivity led captive through the air , The realm itself of Satan , long usurped ; Whom he shall tread at last under our feet ; Even he , who now foretold his fatal bruise ; And to the Woman thus his sentence turned .
Mean while , ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth , Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death , In counterview within the gates , that now Stood open wide , belching outrageous flame Far into Chaos , since the Fiend passed through , Sin opening ; who thus now to Death began .
Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon .
As when a flock Of ravenous fowl , though many a league remote , Against the day of battle , to a field , Where armies lie encamped , come flying , lured With scent of living carcasses designed For death , the following day , in bloody fight : So scented the grim Feature , and upturned His nostril wide into the murky air ; Sagacious of his quarry from so far .
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art Pontifical , a ridge of pendant rock , Over the vexed abyss , following the track Of Satan to the self - same place where he First lighted from his wing , and landed safe From out of Chaos , to the outside bare Of this round world : With pins of adamant And chains they made all fast , too fast they made And durable !
And now their way to Earth they had descried , To Paradise first tending ; when , behold !
O Parent , these are thy magnifick deeds , Thy trophies !
which thou viewest as not thine own ; Thou art their author , and prime architect : For I no sooner in my heart divined , My heart , which by a secret harmony Still moves with thine , joined in connexion sweet , That thou on earth hadst prospered , which thy looks Now also evidence , but straight I felt , Though distant from thee worlds between , yet felt , That I must after thee , with this thy son ; Such fatal consequence unites us three !
However , some tradition they dispersed Among the Heathen , of their purchase got , And fabled how the Serpent , whom they called Ophion , with Eurynome , the wide -- Encroaching Eve perhaps , had first the rule Of high Olympus ; thence by Saturn driven And Ops , ere yet Dictaean Jove was born .
See , with what heat these dogs of Hell advance To waste and havock yonder world , which I So fair and good created ; and had still Kept in that state , had not the folly of Man Let in these wasteful furies , who impute Folly to me ; so doth the Prince of Hell And his adherents , that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heavenly ; and , conniving , seem To gratify my scornful enemies , That laugh , as if , transported with some fit Of passion , I to them had quitted all , At random yielded up to their misrule ; And know not that I called , and drew them thither , My Hell - hounds , to lick up the draff and filth Which Man ' s polluting sin with taint hath shed On what was pure ; til , crammed and gorged , nigh burst With sucked and glutted offal , at one sling Of thy victorious arm , well - pleasing Son , Both Sin , and Death , and yawning Grave , at last , Through Chaos hurled , obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever , and seal up his ravenous jaws .
Thus began Outrage from lifeless things ; but Discord first , Daughter of Sin , among the irrational Death introduced , through fierce antipathy : Beast now with beast ' gan war , and fowl with fowl , And fish with fish ; to graze the herb all leaving , Devoured each other ; nor stood much in awe Of Man , but fled him ; or , with countenance grim , Glared on him passing .
To the loss of that , Sufficient penalty , why hast thou added The sense of endless woes ?
There I should rest , And sleep secure ; his dreadful voice no more Would thunder in my ears ; no fear of worse To me , and to my offspring , would torment me With cruel expectation .
The body properly had neither , All of me then shall die : let this appease The doubt , since human reach no further knows .
For though the Lord of all be infinite , Is his wrath also ?
How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man , whom death must end ?
That were to extend His sentence beyond dust and Nature ' s law ; By which all causes else , according still To the reception of their matter , act ; Not to the extent of their own sphere .
But say That death be not one stroke , as I supposed , Bereaving sense , but endless misery From this day onward ; which I feel begun Both in me , and without me ; and so last To perpetuity ;-- Ay me ! that fear Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution On my defenceless head ; both Death and I Am found eternal , and incorporate both ; Nor I on my part single ; in me all Posterity stands cursed : Fair patrimony That I must leave ye , Sons !
That name best Befits thee with him leagued , thyself as false And hateful ; nothing wants , but that thy shape , Like his , and colour serpentine , may show Thy inward fraud ; to warn all creatures from thee Henceforth ; lest that too heavenly form , pretended To hellish falshood , snare them !
While yet we live , scarce one short hour perhaps , Between us two let there be peace ; both joining , As joined in injuries , one enmity Against a foe by doom express assigned us , That cruel Serpent : On me exercise not Thy hatred for this misery befallen ; On me already lost , me than thyself More miserable !
But Adam , with such counsel nothing swayed , To better hopes his more attentive mind Labouring had raised ; and thus to Eve replied .
which will be lost By death brought on ourselves , or childless days Resolved , as thou proposest ; so our foe Shal ' scape his punishment ordained , and we Instead shall double ours upon our heads .
Book XI
To whom the Father , without cloud , serene .
O Sons , like one of us Man is become To know both good and evil , since his taste Of that defended fruit ; but let him boast His knowledge of good lost , and evil got ; Happier !
Lest therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the tree of life , and eat , And live for ever , dream at least to live For ever , to remove him I decree , And send him from the garden forth to till The ground whence he was taken , fitter soil .
Eve , easily my faith admit , that all The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends ; But , that from us aught should ascend to Heaven So prevalent as to concern the mind Of God high - blest , or to incline his will , Hard to belief may seem ; yet this will prayer Or one short sigh of human breath , upborne Even to the seat of God .
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek .
Lament not , Eve , but patiently resign What justly thou hast lost , nor set thy heart , Thus over - fond , on that which is not thine : Thy going is not lonely ; with thee goes Thy husband ; whom to follow thou art bound ; Where he abides , think there thy native soil .
gently hast thou told Thy message , which might else in telling wound , And in performing end us ; what besides Of sorrow , and dejection , and despair , Our frailty can sustain , thy tidings bring , Departure from this happy place , our sweet Recess , and only consolation left Familiar to our eyes !
To whom thus Michael with regard benign .
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied .
To which our sire .
Adam could not , but wept , Though not of woman born ; compassion quelled His best of man , and gave him up to tears A space , till firmer thoughts restrained excess ; And , scarce recovering words , his plaint renewed .
But is there yet no other way , besides These painful passages , how we may come To death , and mix with our connatural dust ?
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget ; For that fair female troop thou sawest , that seemed Of Goddesses , so blithe , so smooth , so gay , Yet empty of all good wherein consists Woman ' s domestick honour and chief praise ; Bred only and completed to the taste Of lustful appetence , to sing , to dance , To dress , and troll the tongue , and roll the eye : To these that sober race of men , whose lives Religious titled them the sons of God , Shall yield up all their virtue , all their fame Ignobly , to the trains and to the smiles Of these fair atheists ; and now swim in joy , Erelong to swim at large ; and laugh , for which The world erelong a world of tears must weep .
O pity and shame , that they , who to live well Entered so fair , should turn aside to tread Paths indirect , or in the mid way faint !
In other part the sceptered heralds call To council , in the city - gates ; anon Gray - headed men and grave , with warriours mixed , Assemble , and harangues are heard ; but soon , In factious opposition ; till at last , Of middle age one rising , eminent In wise deport , spake much of right and wrong , Of justice , or religion , truth , and peace , And judgement from above : him old and young Exploded , and had seized with violent hands , Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence Unseen amid the throng : so violence Proceeded , and oppression , and sword - law , Through all the plain , and refuge none was found .
Mean while the south - wind rose , and , with black wings Wide - hovering , all the clouds together drove From under Heaven ; the hills to their supply Vapour , and exhalation dusk and moist , Sent up amain ; and now the thickened sky Like a dark cieling stood ; down rushed the rain Impetuous ; and continued , till the earth No more was seen : the floating vessel swum Uplifted , and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o ' er the waves ; all dwellings else Flood overwhelmed , and them with all their pomp Deep under water rolled ; sea covered sea , Sea without shore ; and in their palaces , Where luxury late reigned , sea - monsters whelped And stabled ; of mankind , so numerous late , All left , in one small bottom swum imbarked .
O visions ill foreseen !
Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold , what shall befall Him or his children ; evil he may be sure , Which neither his foreknowing can prevent ; And he the future evil shall no less In apprehension than in substance feel , Grievous to bear : but that care now is past , Man is not whom to warn : those few escaped Famine and anguish will at last consume , Wandering that watery desart : I had hope , When violence was ceased , and war on earth , All would have then gone well ; peace would have crowned With length of happy days the race of Man ; But I was far deceived ; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste .
To whom thus Michael .
He looked , and saw the ark hull on the flood , Which now abated ; for the clouds were fled , Driven by a keen north - wind , that , blowing dry , Wrinkled the face of deluge , as decayed ; And the clear sun on his wide watery glass Gazed hot , and of the fresh wave largely drew , As after thirst ; which made their flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebb , that stole With soft foot towards the deep ; who now had stopt His sluces , as the Heaven his windows shut .
I revive At this last sight ; assured that Man shall live , With all the creatures , and their seed preserve .
Book XII
Much thou hast yet to see ; but I perceive Thy mortal sight to fail ; objects divine Must needs impair and weary human sense : Henceforth what is to come I will relate ; Thou therefore give due audience , and attend .
But God , who oft descends to visit men Unseen , and through their habitations walks To mark their doings , them beholding soon , Comes down to see their city , ere the tower Obstruct Heaven - towers , and in derision sets Upon their tongues a various spirit , to rase Quite out their native language ; and , instead , To sow a jangling noise of words unknown : Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud , Among the builders ; each to other calls Not understood ; till hoarse , and all in rage , As mocked they storm : great laughter was in Heaven , And looking down , to see the hubbub strange , And hear the din : Thus was the building left Ridiculous , and the work Confusion named .
But this usurper his encroachment proud Stays not on Man ; to God his tower intends Siege and defiance : Wretched man ! what food Will he convey up thither , to sustain Himself and his rash army ; where thin air Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross , And famish him of breath , if not of bread ?
Justly thou abhorrest That son , who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought , affecting to subdue Rational liberty ; yet know withal , Since thy original lapse , true liberty Is lost , which always with right reason dwells Twinned , and from her hath no dividual being : Reason in man obscured , or not obeyed , Immediately inordinate desires , And upstart passions , catch the government From reason ; and to servitude reduce Man , till then free .
Therefore , since he permits Within himself unworthy powers to reign Over free reason , God , in judgement just , Subjects him from without to violent lords ; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom : Tyranny must be ; Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse .
Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes To call by vision , from his father ' s house , His kindred , and false Gods , into a land Which he will show him ; and from him will raise A mighty nation ; and upon him shower His benediction so , that in his seed All nations shall be blest : he straight obeys ; Not knowing to what land , yet firm believes : I see him , but thou canst not , with what faith He leaves his Gods , his friends , and native soil , Ur of Chaldaea , passing now the ford To Haran ; after him a cumbrous train Of herds and flocks , and numerous servitude ; Not wandering poor , but trusting all his wealth With God , who called him , in a land unknown .
This also shall they gain by their delay In the wide wilderness ; there they shall found Their government , and their great senate choose Through the twelve tribes , to rule by laws ordained : God from the mount of Sinai , whose gray top Shall tremble , he descending , will himself In thunder , lightning , and loud trumpets ' sound , Ordain them laws ; part , such as appertain To civil justice ; part , religious rites Of sacrifice ; informing them , by types And shadows , of that destined Seed to bruise The Serpent , by what means he shall achieve Mankind ' s deliverance .
To whom thus Michael .
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names , Places , and titles , and with these to join Secular power ; though feigning still to act By spiritual , to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God , promised alike and given To all believers ; and , from that pretence , Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force On every conscience ; laws which none shall find Left them inrolled , or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave .
Beyond is all abyss , Eternity , whose end no eye can reach .
To whom thus also the Angel last replied .
[ The Tragedie of Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare 1599 ]

Wherefore reioyce ?

Cassi .
Vexed I am Of late , with passions of some difference , Conceptions onely proper to my selfe , Which giue some soyle ( perhaps ) to my Behauiours : But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu ' d ( Among which number Cassius be you one ) Nor construe any further my neglect , Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre , Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men
Cassi .
That you would haue me seeke into my selfe , For that which is not in me ?
And be not iealous on me , gentle Brutus : Were I a common Laughter , or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester : if you know , That I do fawne on men , and hugge them hard , And after scandall them : Or if you know , That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout , then hold me dangerous .
For once , vpon a Rawe and Gustie day , The troubled Tyber , chafing with her Shores , Caesar saide to me , Dar ' st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood , And swim to yonder Point ?
Men at sometime , are Masters of their Fates .
Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together : Yours , is as faire a Name : Sound them , it doth become the mouth aswell : Weigh them , it is as heauy : Coniure with ' em , Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar .
O !

Caes Would he were fatter ; But I feare him not : Yet if my name were lyable to feare , I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius .

Come on my right hand , for this eare is deafe , And tell me truely , what thou think ' st of him .

And then he offered it the third time ; hee put it the third time by , and still as hee refus ' d it , the rabblement howted , and clapp ' d their chopt hands , and threw vppe their sweatie Night - cappes , and vttered such a deale of stinking breath , because Caesar refus ' d the Crowne , that it had ( almost ) choaked Caesar : for hee swoonded , and fell downe at it : And for mine owne part , I durst not laugh , for feare of opening my Lippes , and receyuing the bad Ayre
Cask .

Cassi .
Will you Dine with me to morrow ?

And so it is : For this time I will leaue you : To morrow , if you please to speake with me , I will come home to you : or if you will , Come home to me , and I will wait for you
I will doe so : till then , thinke of the World .
Well Brutus , thou art Noble : yet I see , Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos ' d : therefore it is meet , That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes : For who so firme , that cannot be seduc ' d ?

And that is the theme of War , the fortune of battles , The making of perfect soldiers .
Be it so , then I answer ' d , I too haughty Shade also sing war , and a longer and greater one than any , Waged in my book with varying fortune , with flight , advance and retreat , victory deferr ' d and wavering , ( Yet methinks certain , or as good as certain , at the last ,) the field the world , For life and death , for the Body and for the eternal Soul , Lo , I too am come , chanting the chant of battles , I above all promote brave soldiers .
Ever the dim beginning , Ever the growth , the rounding of the circle , Ever the summit and the merge at last , ( to surely start again ,) Eidolons !
These with the past , Of vanish ' d lands , of all the reigns of kings across the sea , Old conquerors , old campaigns , old sailors ' voyages , Joining eidolons .
Densities , growth , facades , Strata of mountains , soils , rocks , giant trees , Far - born , far - dying , living long , to leave , Eidolons everlasting .
The prophet and the bard , Shall yet maintain themselves , in higher stages yet , Shall mediate to the Modern , to Democracy , interpret yet to them , God and eidolons .
Thy very songs not in thy songs , No special strains to sing , none for itself , But from the whole resulting , rising at last and floating , A round full - orb ' d eidolon .
( As if any man really knew aught of my life , Why even I myself I often think know little or nothing of my real life , Only a few hints , a few diffused faint clews and indirections I seek for my own use to trace out here .
Beginning my studies the first step pleas ' d me so much , The mere fact consciousness , these forms , the power of motion , The least insect or animal , the senses , eyesight , love , The first step I say awed me and pleas ' d me so much , I have hardly gone and hardly wish ' d to go any farther , But stop and loiter all the time to sing it in ecstatic songs .

We have watch ' d the seasons dispensing themselves and passing on , And have said , Why should not a man or woman do as much as the seasons , and effuse as much ?
We dwell a while in every city and town , We pass through Kanada , the North - east , the vast valley of the Mississippi , and the Southern States , We confer on equal terms with each of the States , We make trial of ourselves and invite men and women to hear , We say to ourselves , Remember , fear not , be candid , promulge the body and the soul , Dwell a while and pass on , be copious , temperate , chaste , magnetic , And what you effuse may then return as the seasons return , And may be just as much as the seasons .
Lo , the unbounded sea , On its breast a ship starting , spreading all sails , carrying even her moonsails .

masses !
I too , following many and follow ' d by many , inaugurate a religion , I descend into the arena , ( It may be I am destin ' d to utter the loudest cries there , the winner ' s pealing shouts , Who knows ?
I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion , Otherwise there is just no real and permanent grandeur ; ( Nor character nor life worthy the name without religion , Nor land nor man or woman without religion .
Warblings under the sun , usher ' d as now , or at noon , or setting , Strains musical flowing through ages , now reaching hither , I take to your reckless and composite chords , add to them , and cheerfully pass them forward .

I will make the true poem of riches , To earn for the body and the mind whatever adheres and goes forward and is not dropt by death ; I will effuse egotism and show it underlying all , and I will be the bard of personality , And I will show of male and female that either is but the equal of the other , And sexual organs and acts !
Toward the male of the States , and toward the female of the States , Exulting words , words to Democracy ' s lands .
land of cotton , sugar , rice !
Land of Ontario , Erie , Huron , Michigan !
Land of boatmen and sailors !
Inextricable lands !
Arctic braced !

I cannot be discharged from you !
Still the present I raise aloft , still the future of the States I harbinge glad and sublime , And for the past I pronounce what the air holds of the red aborigines .
O something ecstatic and undemonstrable !
[ BOOK III ]
2 Houses and rooms are full of perfumes , the shelves are crowded with perfumes , I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it , The distillation would intoxicate me also , but I shall not let it .
have you reckon ' d the earth much ?
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems , You shall possess the good of the earth and sun , ( there are millions of suns left ,) You shall no longer take things at second or third hand , nor look through the eyes of the dead , nor feed on the spectres in books , You shall not look through my eyes either , nor take things from me , You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self .
3 I have heard what the talkers were talking , the talk of the beginning and the end , But I do not talk of the beginning or the end .
Urge and urge and urge , Always the procreant urge of the world .
4 Trippers and askers surround me , People I meet , the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in , or the nation , The latest dates , discoveries , inventions , societies , authors old and new , My dinner , dress , associates , looks , compliments , dues , The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love , The sickness of one of my folks or of myself , or ill - doing or loss or lack of money , or depressions or exaltations , Battles , the horrors of fratricidal war , the fever of doubtful news , the fitful events ; These come to me days and nights and go from me again , But they are not the Me myself .
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning , How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn ' d over upon me , And parted the shirt from my bosom - bone , and plunged your tongue to my bare - stript heart , And reach ' d till you felt my beard , and reach ' d till you held my feet .

The blab of the pave , tires of carts , sluff of boot - soles , talk of the promenaders , The heavy omnibus , the driver with his interrogating thumb , the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor , The snow - sleighs , clinking , shouted jokes , pelts of snow - balls , The hurrahs for popular favorites , the fury of rous ' d mobs , The flap of the curtain ' d litter , a sick man inside borne to the hospital , The meeting of enemies , the sudden oath , the blows and fall , The excited crowd , the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd , The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes , What groans of over - fed or half - starv ' d who fall sunstruck or in fits , What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes , What living and buried speech is always vibrating here , what howls restrain ' d by decorum , Arrests of criminals , slights , adulterous offers made , acceptances , rejections with convex lips , I mind them or the show or resonance of them -- I come and I depart .
I am there , I help , I came stretch ' d atop of the load , I felt its soft jolts , one leg reclined on the other , I jump from the cross - beams and seize the clover and timothy , And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps .
The Yankee clipper is under her sky - sails , she cuts the sparkle and scud , My eyes settle the land , I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck .
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank , She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window .
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her .
From the cinder - strew ' d threshold I follow their movements , The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms , Overhand the hammers swing , overhand so slow , overhand so sure , They do not hasten , each man hits in his place .
In me the caresser of life wherever moving , backward as well as forward sluing , To niches aside and junior bending , not a person or object missing , Absorbing all to myself and for this song .
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life .
I believe in those wing ' d purposes , And acknowledge red , yellow , white , playing within me , And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional , And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else , And the in the woods never studied the gamut , yet trills pretty well to me , And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me .
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections , They scorn the best I can do to relate them .
) The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray , The pedler sweats with his pack on his back , ( the purchaser higgling about the odd cent ;) The bride unrumples her white dress , the minute - hand of the clock moves slowly , The opium - eater reclines with rigid head and just - open ' d lips , The prostitute draggles her shawl , her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck , The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths , the men jeer and wink to each other , ( Miserable !
I resist any thing better than my own diversity , Breathe the air but leave plenty after me , And am not stuck up , and am in my place .
I beat and pound for the dead , I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them .
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids , conformity goes to the fourth - remov ' d , I wear my hat as I please indoors or out .
Having pried through the strata , analyzed to a hair , counsel ' d with doctors and calculated close , I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones .
Night of south winds -- night of the large few stars !
O unspeakable passionate love .
22 You sea !
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions , There is no better than it and now .
23 Endless unfolding of words of ages !
Gentlemen , to you the first honors always !
Through me the afflatus surging and surging , through me the current and index .
Firm masculine colter it shall be you !
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you !
it shall be you !
Broad muscular fields , branches of live oak , loving lounger in my winding paths , it shall be you !
Speech is the twin of my vision , it is unequal to measure itself , It provokes me forever , it says sarcastically , Walt you contain enough , why don ' t you let it out then ?
Come now I will not be tantalized , you conceive too much of articulation , Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded ?
26 Now I will do nothing but listen , To accrue what I hear into this song , to let sounds contribute toward it .
I hear bravuras of birds , bustle of growing wheat , gossip of flames , clack of sticks cooking my meals , I hear the sound I love , the sound of the human voice , I hear all sounds running together , combined , fused or following , Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city , sounds of the day and night , Talkative young ones to those that like them , the loud laugh of work - people at their meals , The angry base of disjointed friendship , the faint tones of the sick , The judge with hands tight to the desk , his pallid lips pronouncing a death - sentence , The heave ' e ' yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves , the refrain of the anchor - lifters , The ring of alarm - bells , the cry of fire , the whirr of swift - streaking engines and hose - carts with premonitory tinkles and color ' d lights , The steam - whistle , the solid roll of the train of approaching cars , The slow march play ' d at the head of the association marching two and two , ( They go to guard some corpse , the flag - tops are draped with black muslin .
27 To be in any form , what is that ?
quivering me to a new identity , Flames and ether making a rush for my veins , Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them , My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself , On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs , Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip , Behaving licentious toward me , taking no denial , Depriving me of my best as for a purpose , Unbuttoning my clothes , holding me by the bare waist , Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture - fields , Immodestly sliding the fellow - senses away , They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me , No consideration , no regard for my draining strength or my anger , Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while , Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me .
Did it make you ache so , leaving me ?
)
So they show their relations to me and I accept them , They bring me tokens of myself , they evince them plainly in their possession .
I wonder where they get those tokens , Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them ?
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul , My course runs below the soundings of plummets .
Agonies are one of my changes of garments , I do not ask the wounded person how he feels , I myself become the wounded person , My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe .
List to the yarn , as my grandmother ' s father the sailor told it to me .
Only three guns are in use , One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy ' s main - mast , Two well serv ' d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks .
Somehow I have been stunn ' d .
I remember now , I resume the overstaid fraction , The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it , or to any graves , Corpses rise , gashes heal , fastenings roll from me .
is he Kanadian ?
prairie - life , bush - life ?
Behavior lawless as snow - flakes , words simple as grass , uncomb ' d head , laughter , and naivete , Slow - stepping feet , common features , common modes and emanations , They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers , They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath , they fly out of the glance of his eyes .
Earth !
To any one dying , thither I speed and twist the knob of the door .
The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail ' d coats I am aware who they are , ( they are positively not worms or fleas ,) I acknowledge the duplicates of myself , the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me , What I do and say the same waits for them , Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them .
and what is life ?
How the flukes splash !
Long I was hugg ' d close -- long and long .
My lovers suffocate me , Crowding my lips , thick in the pores of my skin , Jostling me through streets and public halls , coming naked to me at night , Crying by day , Ahoy !
If you tire , give me both burdens , and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip , And in due time you shall repay the same service to me , For after we start we never lie by again .
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look ' d at the crowded heaven , And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs , and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them , shall we be fill ' d and satisfied then ?
I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat , ( It is you talking just as much as myself , I act as the tongue of you , Tied in your mouth , in mine it begins to be loosen ' d .
)
Why should I wish to see God better than this day ?
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes , I see the elder - hand pressing receiving supporting , I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors , And mark the outlet , and mark the relief and escape .
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven , O suns -- O grass of graves -- O perpetual transfers and promotions , If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing ?
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest , Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight , Toss , sparkles of day and dusk -- toss on the black stems that decay in the muck , Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs .
Perhaps I might tell more .
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future .
Very well then I contradict myself , ( I am large , I contain multitudes .
52 The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me , he complains of my gab and my loitering .
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged , Missing me one place search another , I stop somewhere waiting for you .
From pent - up aching rivers , From that of myself without which I were nothing , From what I am determin ' d to make illustrious , even if I stand sole among men , From my own voice resonant , singing the phallus , Singing the song of procreation , Singing the need of superb children and therein superb grown people , Singing the muscular urge and the blending , Singing the bedfellow ' s song , ( O resistless yearning !
I do not ask any more delight , I swim in it as in a sea .
Is it one of the dull - faced immigrants just landed on the wharf ?
Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float , and the soil is on the surface , and water runs and vegetation sprouts , For you only , and not for him and her ?
the same red - running blood !

O bashful and feminine !
O to speed where there is space enough and air enough at last !
To have the gag remov ' d from one ' s mouth !
To ascend , to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me !
To rise thither with my inebriate soul !
Now we have met , we have look ' d , we are safe , Return in peace to the ocean my love , I too am part of that ocean my love , we are not so much separated , Behold the great rondure , the cohesion of all , how perfect !
We two , how long we were fool ' d , Now transmuted , we swiftly escape as Nature escapes , We are Nature , long have we been absent , but now we return , We become plants , trunks , foliage , roots , bark , We are bedded in the ground , we are rocks , We are oaks , we grow in the openings side by side , We browse , we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any , We are two fishes swimming in the sea together , We are what locust blossoms are , we drop scent around lanes mornings and evenings , We are also the coarse smut of beasts , vegetables , minerals , We are two predatory hawks , we soar above and look down , We are two resplendent suns , we it is who balance ourselves orbic and stellar , we are as two comets , We prowl fang ' d and four - footed in the woods , we spring on prey , We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead , We are seas mingling , we are two of those cheerful waves rolling over each other and interwetting each other , We are what the atmosphere is , transparent , receptive , pervious , impervious , We are snow , rain , cold , darkness , we are each product and influence of the globe , We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again , we two , We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy .

} Once I Pass ' d Through a Populous City
In paths untrodden , In the growth by margins of pond - waters , Escaped from the lite that exhibits itself , From all the standards hitherto publish ' d , from the pleasures , profits , conformities , Which too long I was offering to feed my soul , Clear to me now standards not yet publish ' d , clear to me that my soul , That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades , Here by myself away from the clank of the world , Tallying and talk ' d to here by tongues aromatic , No longer abash ' d , ( for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare elsewhere ,) Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself , yet contains all the rest , Resolv ' d to sing no songs to - day but those of manly attachment , Projecting them along that substantial life , Bequeathing hence types of athletic love , Afternoon this delicious Ninth - month in my forty - first year , I proceed for all who are or have been young men , To tell the secret my nights and days , To celebrate the need of comrades .
Scented herbage of my breast , Leaves from you I glean , I write , to be perused best afterwards , Tomb - leaves , body - leaves growing up above me above death , Perennial roots , tall leaves , O the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves , Every year shall you bloom again , out from where you retired you shall emerge again ; O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor , but I believe a few will ; O slender leaves !

} Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes
I saw in Louisiana a live - oak growing , All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches , Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green , And its look , rude , unbending , lusty , made me think of myself , But I wonder ' d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near , for I knew I could not , And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and twined around it a little moss , And brought it away , and I have placed it in sight in my room , It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends , ( For I believe lately I think of little else than of them ,) Yet it remains to me a curious token , it makes me think of manly love ; For all that , and though the live - oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide in a wide flat space , Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near , I know very well I could not .
} I Hear It Was Charged Against Me
A promise to California , Or inland to the great pastoral Plains , and on to Puget sound and Oregon ; Sojourning east a while longer , soon I travel toward you , to remain , to teach robust American love , For I know very well that I and robust love belong among you , inland , and along the Western sea ; For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea , and I will also .
You friendly boatmen and mechanics !
You twain !
and all processions moving along the streets !
That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihood , chattering , chaffering , How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits , How often I question and doubt whether that is really me ; But among my lovers and caroling these songs , O I never doubt whether that is really me .

[ BOOK X ]
O the joy of my spirit -- it is uncaged -- it darts like lightning !
to go with a locomotive !
O the fireman ' s joys !
The watching , the endurance , the precious love , the anguish , the patiently yielded life .
O to have been brought up on bays , lagoons , creeks , or along the coast , To continue and be employ ' d there all my life , The briny and damp smell , the shore , the salt weeds exposed at low water , The work of fishermen , the work of the eel - fisher and clam - fisher ; I come with my clam - rake and spade , I come with my eel - spear , Is the tide out ?
I Join the group of clam - diggers on the flats , I laugh and work with them , I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man ; In winter I take my eel - basket and eel - spear and travel out on foot on the ice -- I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice , Behold me well - clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon , my brood of tough boys accompanying me , My brood of grown and part - grown boys , who love to be with no one else so well as they love to be with me , By day to work with me , and by night to sleep with me .
something in a trance !
To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work , To plough land in the fall for winter - sown crops , To plough land in the spring for maize , To train orchards , to graft the trees , to gather apples in the fall .
to walk ankle - deep , or race naked along the shore .
Joys of the free and lonesome heart , the tender , gloomy heart ?
the something which obeys none of the rest , It is offensive , never defensive -- yet how magnetic it draws .

4 Muscle and pluck forever !
What invigorates life invigorates death , And the dead advance as much as the living advance , And the future is no more uncertain than the present , For the roughness of the earth and of man encloses as much as the delicatesse of the earth and of man , And nothing endures but personal qualities .
Do you think a great city endures ?
6 How beggarly appear arguments before a defiant deed !
How the floridness of the materials of cities shrivels before a man ' s or woman ' s look !
I see the headsman withdraw and become useless , I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy , I see no longer any axe upon it ,
I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of my own race , the newest , largest race .
Shapes of the using of axes anyhow , and the users and all that neighbors them , Cutters down of wood and haulers of it to the Penobscot or Kenebec , Dwellers in cabins among the Californian mountains or by the little lakes , or on the Columbia , Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio Grande , friendly gatherings , the characters and fun , Dwellers along the St . Lawrence , or north in Kanada , or down by the Yellowstone , dwellers on coasts and off coasts , Seal - fishers , whalers , arctic seamen breaking passages through the ice .
Shapes of doors giving many exits and entrances , The door passing the dissever ' d friend flush ' d and in haste , The door that admits good news and bad news , The door whence the son left home confident and puff ' d up , The door he enter ' d again from a long and scandalous absence , diseas ' d , broken down , without innocence , without means .
After all not to create only , or found only , But to bring perhaps from afar what is already founded , To give it our own identity , average , limitless , free , To fill the gross the torpid bulk with vital religious fire , Not to repel or destroy so much as accept , fuse , rehabilitate , To obey as well as command , to follow more than to lead , These also are the lessons of our New World ; While how little the New after all , how much the Old , Old World !

No , the real words are more delicious than they .
Human bodies are words , myriads of words , ( In the best poems re - appears the body , man ' s or woman ' s , well - shaped , natural , gay , Every part able , active , receptive , without shame or the need of shame .

Of the interminable sisters , Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters , Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters , the elder and younger sisters , The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest .
With her ample back towards every beholder , With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age , Sits she whom I too love like the rest , sits undisturb ' d , Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror , while her eyes glance back from it , Glance as she sits , inviting none , denying none , Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face .
Seen at hand or seen at a distance , Duly the twenty - four appear in public every day , Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion , Looking from no countenances of their own , but from the countenances of those who are with them , From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance , From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things , From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky , From our countenances , mine and yours , faithfully returning them , Every day in public appearing without fall , but never twice with the same companions .
Whoever you are !
I swear I see what is better than to tell the best , It is always to leave the best untold .

Forth from their masks , no matter what , From the huge festering trunk , from craft and guile and tears , Health to emerge and joy , joy universal .
To fashion ' s , custom ' s discord , To the mad Babel - din , the deafening orgies , Soothing each lull a strain is heard , just heard , From some far shore the final chorus sounding .
Thou too surroundest all , Embracing carrying welcoming all , thou too by pathways broad and new , To the ideal tendest .
Give me O God to sing that thought , Give me , give him or her I love this quenchless faith , In Thy ensemble , whatever else withheld withhold not from us , Belief in plan of Thee enclosed in Time and Space , Health , peace , salvation universal .

Let others dispose of questions , I dispose of nothing , I arouse unanswerable questions , Who are they I see and touch , and what about them ?
I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends , but listen to my enemies , as I myself do , I charge you forever reject those who would expound me , for I cannot expound myself , I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me , I charge you to leave all free , as I have left all free .
( Remember you surging Manhattan ' s crowds as you pass ' d with your cortege of nobles ?
3 In the name of these States and in your and my name , the Past , And in the name of these States and in your and my name , the Present time .
I know that the past was great and the future will be great , And I know that both curiously conjoint in the present time , ( For the sake of him I typify , for the common average man ' s sake , your sake if you are he ,) And that where I am or you are this present day , there is the centre of all days , all races , And there is the meaning to us of all that has ever come of races and days , or ever will come .

And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea , And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather , Over the hoarse surging of the sea , Or flitting from brier to brier by day , I saw , I heard at intervals the remaining one , the he - bird , The solitary guest from Alabama .
Close on its wave soothes the wave behind , And again another behind embracing and lapping , every one close , But my love soothes not me , not me .
do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers ?
O it is the shape , the shape of my mate .
O trembling throat !

Soft !

Cock ' d hats of mothy mould -- crutches made of mist !
what is all this chattering of bare gums ?
Does the ague convulse your limbs ?
Worse and worse -- can ' t you stand it ?
Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair , the lair of slaves , Like lightning it le ' pt forth half startled at itself , Its feet upon the ashes and the rags , its hands tight to the throats of kings .
O hope and faith !

Nevertheless , be ready , be not weary of watching , He will soon return , his messengers come anon .

All you are doing and saying is to America dangled mirages , You have not learn ' d of Nature -- of the politics of Nature you have not learn ' d the great amplitude , rectitude , impartiality , You have not seen that only such as they are for these States , And that what is less than they must sooner or later lift off from these States .
Skirting the river road , ( my forenoon walk , my rest ,) Skyward in air a sudden muffled sound , the dalliance of the eagles , The rushing amorous contact high in space together , The clinching interlocking claws , a living , fierce , gyrating wheel , Four beating wings , two beaks , a swirling mass tight grappling , In tumbling turning clustering loops , straight downward falling , Till o ' er the river pois ' d , the twain yet one , a moment ' s lull , A motionless still balance in the air , then parting , talons loosing , Upward again on slow - firm pinions slanting , their separate diverse flight , She hers , he his , pursuing .
A thousand perfect men and women appear , Around each gathers a cluster of friends , and gay children and youths , with offerings .
What a filthy Presidentiad !
) Are those really Congressmen ?
Then I will sleep awhile yet , for I see that these States sleep , for reasons ; ( With gathering murk , with muttering thunder and lambent shoots we all duly awake , South , North , East , West , inland and seaboard , we will surely awake .

O Manhattan , my own , my peerless !
To the drum - taps prompt , The young men falling in and arming , The mechanics arming , ( the trowel , the jack - plane , the blacksmith ' s hammer , tost aside with precipitation ,) The lawyer leaving his office and arming , the judge leaving the court , The driver deserting his wagon in the street , jumping down , throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses ' backs , The salesman leaving the store , the boss , book - keeper , porter , all leaving ; Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm , The new recruits , even boys , the old men show them how to wear their accoutrements , they buckle the straps carefully , Outdoors arming , indoors arming , the flash of the musket - barrels , The white tents cluster in camps , the arm ' d sentries around , the sunrise cannon and again at sunset , Arm ' d regiments arrive every day , pass through the city , and embark from the wharves , ( How good they look as they tramp down to the river , sweaty , with their guns on their shoulders !
War !
Arm ' d year -- year of the struggle , No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year , Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano , But as a strong man erect , clothed in blue clothes , advancing , carrying rifle on your shoulder , With well - gristled body and sunburnt face and hands , with a knife in the belt at your side , As I heard you shouting loud , your sonorous voice ringing across the continent , Your masculine voice O year , as rising amid the great cities , Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen , the dwellers in Manhattan , Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana , Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Allghanies , Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania , or on deck along the Ohio river , Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers , or at Chattanooga on the mountain top , Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue , bearing weapons , robust year , Heard your determin ' d voice launch ' d forth again and again , Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round - lipp ' d cannon , I repeat you , hurrying , crashing , sad , distracted year .

From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird , Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all , To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs , To Kanada till I absorb Kanada in myself , to Michigan then , To Wisconsin , Iowa , Minnesota , to sing their songs , ( they are inimitable ;) Then to Ohio and Indiana to sing theirs , to Missouri and Kansas and Arkansas to sing theirs , To Tennessee and Kentucky , to the Carolinas and Georgia to sing theirs , To Texas and so along up toward California , to roam accepted everywhere ; To sing first , ( to the tap of the war - drum if need be ,) The idea of all , of the Western world one and inseparable , And then the song of each member of these States .
Pennant : Come up here , bard , bard , Come up here , soul , soul , Come up here , dear little child , To fly in the clouds and winds with me , and play with the measureless light .
And what does it say to me all the while ?
O it stretches -- it spreads and runs so fast -- O my father , It is so broad it covers the whole sky .
Father : Cease , cease , my foolish babe , What you are saying is sorrowful to me , much ' t displeases me ; Behold with the rest again I say , behold not banners and pennants aloft , But the well - prepared pavements behold , and mark the solid - wall ' d houses .
Poet : I hear and see not strips of cloth alone , I hear the tramp of armies , I hear the challenging sentry , I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men , I hear Liberty !
) Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow ' d after the lightning , Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky ; These , and such as these , I , elate , saw -- saw with wonder , yet pensive and masterful , All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me , Yet there with my soul I fed , I fed content , supercilious .
from deeps more unfathomable , something more deadly and savage , Manhattan rising , advancing with menacing front -- Cincinnati , Chicago , unchain ' d ; What was that swell I saw on the ocean ?
How the true thunder bellows after the lightning -- how bright the flashes of lightning !
stride on , Democracy !
And do you rise higher than ever yet O days , O cities !
Then the Mother of All with calm voice speaking , As to you Rebellious , ( I seemed to hear her say ,) why strive against me , and why seek my life ?
When you yourself forever provide to defend me ?
City of ships !
( for all races are here , All the lands of the earth make contributions here ;) City of the sea !
Proud and passionate city -- mettlesome , mad , extravagant city !
The General watch ' d them from this hill , They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment , Then drew close together , very compact , their flag flying in the middle , But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them !
Every one else seem ' d fill ' d with gloom , Many no doubt thought of capitulation .
Fast as she can she hurries , something ominous , her steps trembling , She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap .

From the stump of the arm , the amputated hand , I undo the clotted lint , remove the slough , wash off the matter and blood , Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv ' d neck and side falling head , His eyes are closed , his face is pale , he dares not look on the bloody stump , And has not yet look ' d on it .
I dress the perforated shoulder , the foot with the bullet - wound , Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene , so sickening , so offensive , While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail .
Long , too long America , Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn ' d from joys and prosperity only , But now , ah now , to learn from crises of anguish , advancing , grappling with direst fate and recoiling not , And now to conceive and show to the world what your children en - masse really are , ( For who except myself has yet conceiv ' d what your children en - masse really are ?
1 Give me the splendid silent sun with all his beams full - dazzling , Give me autumnal fruit ripe and red from the orchard , Give me a field where the unmow ' d grass grows , Give me an arbor , give me the trellis ' d grape , Give me fresh corn and wheat , give me serene - moving animals teaching content , Give me nights perfectly quiet as on high plateaus west of the Mississippi , and I looking up at the stars , Give me odorous at sunrise a garden of beautiful flowers where I can walk undisturb ' d , Give me for marriage a sweet - breath ' d woman of whom I should never tire , Give me a perfect child , give me away aside from the noise of the world a rural domestic life , Give me to warble spontaneous songs recluse by myself , for my own ears only , Give me solitude , give me Nature , give me again O Nature your primal sanities !
Give me interminable eyes -- give me women -- give me comrades and lovers by the thousand !
( The soldiers in companies or regiments -- some starting away , flush ' d and reckless , Some , their time up , returning with thinn ' d ranks , young , yet very old , worn , marching , noticing nothing ;) Give me the shores and wharves heavy - fringed with black ships !
O an intense life , full to repletion and varied !
the torchlight procession !
Manhattan faces and eyes forever for me .
The moon gives you light , And the bugles and the drums give you music , And my heart , O my soldiers , my veterans , My heart gives you love .
Sons of the Mother of All , you shall yet be victorious , You shall yet laugh to scorn the attacks of all the remainder of the earth .
One from Massachusetts shall be a Missourian ' s comrade , From Maine and from hot Carolina , and another an Oregonese , shall be friends triune , More precious to each other than all the riches of the earth .

Or by an agreement on a paper ?
Nay , nor the world , nor any living thing , will so cohere .
While my wife at my side lies slumbering , and the wars are over long , And my head on the pillow rests at home , and the vacant midnight passes , And through the stillness , through the dark , I hear , just hear , the breath of my infant , There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me ; The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal , The skirmishers begin , they crawl cautiously ahead , I hear the irregular snap !

MEMORIES OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN ]
All over bouquets of roses , O death , I cover you over with roses and early lilies , But mostly and now the lilac that blooms the first , Copious I break , I break the sprigs from the bushes , With loaded arms I come , pouring for you , For you and the coffins all of you O death .
)
Approach strong deliveress , When it is so , when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead , Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee , Laved in the flood of thy bliss O death .
From me to thee glad serenades , Dances for thee I propose saluting thee , adornments and feastings for thee , And the sights of the open landscape and the high - spread shy are fitting , And life and the fields , and the huge and thoughtful night .
The night in silence under many a star , The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know , And the soul turning to thee O vast and well - veil ' d death , And the body gratefully nestling close to thee .
And I saw askant the armies , I saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle - flags , Borne through the smoke of the battles and pierc ' d with missiles I saw them , And carried hither and yon through the smoke , and torn and bloody , And at last but a few shreds left on the staffs , ( and all in silence ,) And the staffs all splinter ' d and broken .
I saw battle - corpses , myriads of them , And the white skeletons of young men , I saw them , I saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war , But I saw they were not as was thought , They themselves were fully at rest , they suffer ' d not , The living remain ' d and suffer ' d , the mother suffer ' d , And the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer ' d , And the armies that remain ' d suffer ' d .

Have you consider ' d the organic compact of the first day of the first year of Independence , sign ' d by the Commissioners , ratified by the States , and read by Washington at the head of the army ?
Do you see who have left all feudal processes and poems behind them , and assumed the poems and processes of Democracy ?
Are you faithful to things ?
Are you not of some coterie ?
animating now to life itself ?
Have you too the old ever - fresh forbearance and impartiality ?
little and big ?
What is this you bring my America ?
Is it uniform with my country ?
Have you not imported this or the spirit of it in some ship ?
Is it not a mere tale ?
a rhyme ?
will it improve manners ?
original makers , not mere amanuenses ?

Already a nonchalant breed , silently emerging , appears on the streets , People ' s lips salute only doers , lovers , satisfiers , positive knowers , There will shortly be no more priests , I say their work is done , Death is without emergencies here , but life is perpetual emergencies here , Are your body , days , manners , superb ?
Have I not through life kept you and yours before me ?

AUTUMN RIVULETS ]
Life ' s ever - modern rapids first , ( soon , soon to blend , With the old streams of death .
Thou groan ' st with riches , thy wealth clothes thee as a swathing - garment , Thou laughest loud with ache of great possessions , A myriad - twining life like interlacing vines binds all thy vast demesne , As some huge ship freighted to water ' s edge thou ridest into port , As rain falls from the heaven and vapors rise from earth , so have the precious values fallen upon thee and risen out of thee ; Thou envy of the globe !
Nor do I forget you Departed , Nor in winter or summer my lost ones , But most in the open air as now when my soul is rapt and at peace , like pleasing phantoms , Your memories rising glide silently by me .
Exult O lands !
7 Loud O my throat , and clear O soul !
All till ' d and untill ' d fields expand before me , I see the true arenas of my race , or first or last , Man ' s innocent and strong arenas .
Busy the far , the sunlit panorama , Prairie , orchard , and yellow grain of the North , Cotton and rice of the South and Louisianian cane , Open unseeded fallows , rich fields of clover and timothy , Kine and horses feeding , and droves of sheep and swine , And many a stately river flowing and many a jocund brook , And healthy uplands with herby - perfumed breezes , And the good green grass , that delicate miracle the ever - recurring grass .
Not alone on those warlike fields the Mother of All , With dilated form and lambent eyes watch ' d you .
The Mother of All , yet here as ever she watches you .
Well - pleased America thou beholdest , Over the fields of the West those crawling monsters , The human - divine inventions , the labor - saving implements ; Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving hay - rakes , The steam - power reaping - machines and the horse - power machines The engines , thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain , well separating the straw , the nimble work of the patent pitchfork , Beholdest the newer saw - mill , the southern cotton - gin , and the rice - cleanser .
All gather and all harvest , Yet but for thee O Powerful , not a scythe might swing as now in security , Not a maize - stalk dangle as now its silken tassels in peace .
Under thee only they harvest , even but a wisp of hay under thy great face only , Harvest the wheat of Ohio , Illinois , Wisconsin , every barbed spear under thee , Harvest the maize of Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , each ear in its light - green sheath , Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns , Oats to their bins , the white potato , the buckwheat of Michigan , to theirs ; Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama , dig and hoard the golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas , Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania , Cut the flax in the Middle States , or hemp or tobacco in the Borders , Pick the pea and the bean , or pull apples from the trees or bunches of grapes from the vines , Or aught that ripens in all these States or North or South , Under the beaming sun and under thee .
} There Was a Child Went Forth
There was a child went forth every day , And the first object he look ' d upon , that object he became , And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day , Or for many years or stretching cycles of years .
Far hence amid an isle of wondrous beauty , Crouching over a grave an ancient sorrowful mother , Once a queen , now lean and tatter ' d seated on the ground , Her old white hair drooping dishevel ' d round her shoulders , At her feet fallen an unused royal harp , Long silent , she too long silent , mourning her shrouded hope and heir , Of all the earth her heart most full of sorrow because most full of love .
Yet a word ancient mother , You need crouch there no longer on the cold ground with forehead between your knees , O you need not sit there veil ' d in your old white hair so dishevel ' d , For know you the one you mourn is not in that grave , It was an illusion , the son you love was not really dead , The Lord is not dead , he is risen again young and strong in another country , Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave , What you wept for was translated , pass ' d from the grave , The winds favor ' d and the sea sail ' d it , And now with rosy and new blood , Moves to - day in a new country .
} The City Dead - House
1 Something startles me where I thought I was safest , I withdraw from the still woods I loved , I will not go now on the pastures to walk , I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea , I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me .
Is not every continent work ' d over and over with sour dead ?
} To a Foil ' d European Revolutionaire
Did we think victory great ?
Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone ?
Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves ?
Manhattan ' s streets I saunter ' d pondering , On Time , Space , Reality -- on such as these , and abreast with them Prudence .
The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence , Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality .
Not one word or deed , not venereal sore , discoloration , privacy of the onanist , Putridity of gluttons or rum - drinkers , peculation , cunning , betrayal , murder , seduction , prostitution , But has results beyond death as really as before death .
Charity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing .
Who has been wise receives interest , Savage , felon , President , judge , farmer , sailor , mechanic , literat , young , old , it is the same , The interest will come round -- all will come round .
Singly , wholly , to affect now , affected their time , will forever affect , all of the past and all of the present and all of the future , All the brave actions of war and peace , All help given to relatives , strangers , the poor , old , sorrowful , young children , widows , the sick , and to shunn ' d persons , All self - denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks , and saw others fill the seats of the boats , All offering of substance or life for the good old cause , or for a friend ' s sake , or opinion ' s sake , All pains of enthusiasts scoff ' d at by their neighbors , All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers , All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded , All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit , All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name , date , location , All that was ever manfully begun , whether it succeeded or no , All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his mouth , or the shaping of his great hands , All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe , or on any of the wandering stars , or on any of the fix ' d stars , by those there as we are here , All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are , or by any one , These inure , have inured , shall inure , to the identities from which they sprang , or shall spring .
} The Singer in the Prison
Ceaseless she paces to and fro , O heart - sick days !
It was not I that sinn ' d the sin , The ruthless body dragg ' d me in ; Though long I strove courageously , The body was too much for me .
Depart -- a God - enfranchis ' d soul !
Warble me now for joy of lilac - time , ( returning in reminiscence ,) Sort me O tongue and lips for Nature ' s sake , souvenirs of earliest summer , Gather the welcome signs , ( as children with pebbles or stringing shells ,) Put in April and May , the hylas croaking in the ponds , the elastic air , Bees , butterflies , the sparrow with its simple notes , Blue - bird and darting swallow , nor forget the high - hole flashing his golden wings , The tranquil sunny haze , the clinging smoke , the vapor , Shimmer of waters with fish in them , the cerulean above , All that is jocund and sparkling , the brooks running , The maple woods , the crisp February days and the sugar - making , The robin where he hops , bright - eyed , brown - breasted , With musical clear call at sunrise , and again at sunset , Or flitting among the trees of the apple - orchard , building the nest of his mate , The melted snow of March , the willow sending forth its yellow - green sprouts , For spring - time is here !

In one a trio beautiful , Grandmother , loving daughter , loving daughter ' s daughter , sat , Chatting and sewing .

) This glaze of God ' s serenest purest sky , This film of Satan ' s seething pit , This heart ' s geography ' s map , this limitless small continent , this soundless sea ; Out from the convolutions of this globe , This subtler astronomic orb than sun or moon , than Jupiter , Venus , Mars , This condensation of the universe , ( nay here the only universe , Here the idea , all in this mystic handful wrapt ;) These burin ' d eyes , flashing to you to pass to future time , To launch and spin through space revolving sideling , from these to emanate , To you whoe ' er you are -- a look .

And that there is no God any more divine than Yourself ?
} To a Common Prostitute
As to me I know of nothing else but miracles , Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan , Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky , Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water , Or stand under trees in the woods , Or talk by day with any one I love , or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love , Or sit at table at dinner with the rest , Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car , Or watch honey - bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon , Or animals feeding in the fields , Or birds , or the wonderfulness of insects in the air , Or the wonderfulness of the sundown , or of stars shining so quiet and bright , Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring ; These with the rest , one and all , are to me miracles , The whole referring , yet each distinct and in its place .
To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle , Every cubic inch of space is a miracle , Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same , Every foot of the interior swarms with the same .
is it through you ?
You !
Others may praise what they like ; But I , from the banks of the running Missouri , praise nothing in art or aught else , Till it has well inhaled the atmosphere of this river , also the western prairie - scent , And exudes it all again .
Who learns my lesson complete ?
It is no small matter , this round and delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit for ever and ever , without one jolt or the untruth of a single second , I do not think it was made in six days , nor in ten thousand years , nor ten billions of years , Nor plann ' d and built one thing after another as an architect plans and builds a house .
as every one is immortal ; I know it is wonderful , but my eyesight is equally wonderful , and how I was conceived in my mother ' s womb is equally wonderful , And pass ' d from a babe in the creeping trance of a couple of summers and winters to articulate and walk -- all this is equally wonderful .
Dim smitten star , Orb not of France alone , pale symbol of my soul , its dearest hopes , The struggle and the daring , rage divine for liberty , Of aspirations toward the far ideal , enthusiast ' s dreams of brotherhood , Of terror to the tyrant and the priest .
Miserable !
In a far - away northern county in the placid pastoral region , Lives my farmer friend , the theme of my recitative , a famous tamer of oxen , There they bring him the three - year - olds and the four - year - olds to break them , He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him , He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock chafes up and down the yard , The bullock ' s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes , Yet see you !
how uneasy they are when he moves away from them ; Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them , ( books , politics , poems , depart -- all else departs ,) I confess I envy only his fascination -- my silent , illiterate friend , Whom a hundred oxen love there in his life on farms , In the northern county far , in the placid pastoral region .
Now only do I know you , O fair auroral skies -- O morning dew upon the grass !
Only a public school ?
The lights and shadows of your future , good or evil ?
thee , singing bird divine !
The mothers fit for thee ?
Now airs antique and mediaeval fill me , I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals , I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love , I hear the minstrels , gleemen , troubadours , of the middle ages .
Now the great organ sounds , Tremulous , while underneath , ( as the hid footholds of the earth , On which arising rest , and leaping forth depend , All shapes of beauty , grace and strength , all hues we know , Green blades of grass and warbling birds , children that gambol and play , the clouds of heaven above ,) The strong base stands , and its pulsations intermits not , Bathing , supporting , merging all the rest , maternity of all the rest , And with it every instrument in multitudes , The players playing , all the world ' s musicians , The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration , All passionate heart - chants , sorrowful appeals , The measureless sweet vocalists of ages , And for their solvent setting earth ' s own diapason , Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves , A new composite orchestra , binder of years and climes , ten - fold renewer , As of the far - back days the poets tell , the Paradiso , The straying thence , the separation long , but now the wandering done , The journey done , the journeyman come home , And man and art with Nature fused again .
I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden , Amid the scent of night - roses , radiant , holding his bride by the hand , Hears the infernal call , the death - pledge of the horn .

I hear the dance - music of all nations , The waltz , some delicious measure , lapsing , bathing me in bliss , The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets .

To you a new bard caroling in the West , Obeisant sends his love .

Passage to India !
Struggles of many a captain , tales of many a sailor dead , Over my mood stealing and spreading they come , Like clouds and cloudlets in the unreach ' d sky .
Who Justify these restless explorations ?

8 O we can wait no longer , We too take ship O soul , Joyous we too launch out on trackless seas , Fearless for unknown shores on waves of ecstasy to sail , Amid the wafting winds , ( thou pressing me to thee , I thee to me , O soul ,) Caroling free , singing our song of God , Chanting our chant of pleasant exploration .
What dreams of the ideal ?
what plans of purity , perfection , strength ?
Are thy wings plumed indeed for such far flights ?
Passage to you , to mastership of you , ye strangling problems !
of you gray rocks !
O clouds !
Passage , immediate passage !

Have we not darken ' d and dazed ourselves with books long enough ?
Thou knowest my years entire , my life , My long and crowded life of active work , not adoration merely ; Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth , Thou knowest my manhood ' s solemn and visionary meditations , Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee , Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them , Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee , In shackles , prison ' d , in disgrace , repining not , Accepting all from Thee , as duly come from Thee .
By me and these the work so far accomplish ' d , By me earth ' s elder cloy ' d and stifled lands uncloy ' d , unloos ' d , By me the hemispheres rounded and tied , the unknown to the known .
The end I know not , it is all in Thee , Or small or great I know not -- haply what broad fields , what lands , Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know , Transplanted there may rise to stature , knowledge worthy Thee , Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn ' d to reaping - tools , Haply the lifeless cross I know , Europe ' s dead cross , may bud and blossom there .
The wretched features of ennuyes , the white features of corpses , the livid faces of drunkards , the sick - gray faces of onanists , The gash ' d bodies on battle - fields , the insane in their strong - door ' d rooms , the sacred idiots , the new - born emerging from gates , and the dying emerging from gates , The night pervades them and infolds them .
The blind sleep , and the deaf and dumb sleep , The prisoner sleeps well in the prison , the runaway son sleeps , The murderer that is to be hung next day , how does he sleep ?
Darkness , you are gentler than my lover , his flesh was sweaty and panting , I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me .

6 Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together , Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead .
My mother look ' d in delight and amazement at the stranger , She look ' d at the freshness of her tall - borne face and full and pliant limbs , The more she look ' d upon her she loved her , Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity , She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace , she cook ' d food for her , She had no work to give her , but she gave her remembrance and fondness .
1 To think of time -- of all that retrospection , To think of to - day , and the ages continued henceforward .
If the future is nothing they are just as surely nothing .
To think how eager we are in building our houses , To think others shall be just as eager , and we quite indifferent .
Thumb extended , finger uplifted , apron , cape , gloves , strap , wet - weather clothes , whip carefully chosen , Boss , spotter , starter , hostler , somebody loafing on you , you loafing on somebody , headway , man before and man behind , Good day ' s work , bad day ' s work , pet stock , mean stock , first out , last out , turning - in at night , To think that these are so much and so nigh to other drivers , and he there takes no interest in them .
To think how much pleasure there is , Do you enjoy yourself in the city ?
or in womanly housework ?
These also flow onward to others , you and I flow onward , But in due time you and I shall take less interest in them .
7 It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your mother and father , it is to identify you , It is not that you should be undecided , but that you should be decided , Something long preparing and formless is arrived and form ' d in you , You are henceforth secure , whatever comes or goes .
if I were to suspect death I should die now , Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well - suited toward annihilation ?
Pleasantly and well - suited I walk , Whither I walk I cannot define , but I know it is good , The whole universe indicates that it is good , The past and the present indicate that it is good .
9 I swear I think now that every thing without exception has an eternal soul !
Darest thou now O soul , Walk out with me toward the unknown region , Where neither ground is for the feet nor any path to follow ?
Whispers of heavenly death murmur ' d I hear , Labial gossip of night , sibilant chorals , Footsteps gently ascending , mystical breezes wafted soft and low , Ripples of unseen rivers , tides of a current flowing , forever flowing , ( Or is it the plashing of tears ?
the Lord Christ gazes -- lo !
Hermes I -- lo !
3 Aloof , dissatisfied , plotting revolt , Comrade of criminals , brother of slaves , Crafty , despised , a drudge , ignorant , With sudra face and worn brow , black , but in the depths of my heart , proud as any , Lifted now and always against whoever scorning assumes to rule me , Morose , full of guile , full of reminiscences , brooding , with many wiles , ( Though it was thought I was baffled , and dispel ' d , and my wiles done , but that will never be ,) Defiant , I , Satan , still live , still utter words , in new lands duly appearing , ( and old ones also ,) Permanent here from my side , warlike , equal with any , real as any , Nor time nor change shall ever change me or my words .
4 Santa Spirita , breather , life , Beyond the light , lighter than light , Beyond the flames of hell , joyous , leaping easily above hell , Beyond Paradise , perfumed solely with mine own perfume , Including all life on earth , touching , including God , including Saviour and Satan , Ethereal , pervading all , ( for without me what were all ?
} As If a Phantom Caress ' d Me
That music always round me , unceasing , unbeginning , yet long untaught I did not hear , But now the chorus I hear and am elated , A tenor , strong , ascending with power and health , with glad notes of daybreak I hear , A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves , A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe , The triumphant tutti , the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and violins , all these I fill myself with , I hear not the volumes of sound merely , I am moved by the exquisite meanings , I listen to the different voices winding in and out , striving , contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion ; I do not think the performers know themselves -- but now I think begin to know them .
} A Noiseless Patient Spider
O living always , always dying !
Now I absorb immortality and peace , I admire death and test propositions .

A huge sob -- a few bubbles -- the white foam spirting up -- and then the women gone , Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on -- and I now pondering , Are those women indeed gone ?
3 Brain of the New World , what a task is thine , To formulate the Modern -- out of the peerless grandeur of the modern , Out of thyself , comprising science , to recast poems , churches , art , ( Recast , may - be discard them , end them -- maybe their work is done , who knows ?
) Thee in an education grown of thee , in teachers , studies , students , born of thee , Thee in thy democratic fetes en - masse , thy high original festivals , operas , lecturers , preachers , Thee in thy ultimate , ( the preparations only now completed , the edifice on sure foundations tied ,) Thee in thy pinnacles , intellect , thought , thy topmost rational joys , thy love and godlike aspiration , In thy resplendent coming literati , thy full - lung ' d orators , thy sacerdotal bards , kosmic savans , These !
} Thou Orb Aloft Full - Dazzling
This now is too lamentable a face for a man , Some abject louse asking leave to be , cringing for it , Some milk - nosed maggot blessing what lets it wrig to its hole .
Well , you cannot trick me .
I saw the face of the most smear ' d and slobbering idiot they had at the asylum , And I knew for my consolation what they knew not , I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my brother , The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen tenement , And I shall look again in a score or two of ages , And I shall meet the real landlord perfect and unharm ' d , every inch as good as myself .
Off the word I have spoken I except not one -- red , white , black , are all deific , In each house is the ovum , it comes forth after a thousand years .
What charm thy music works !
O how the immortal phantoms crowd around me !
O glad , exulting , culminating song !
A reborn race appears -- a perfect world , all joy !
all over joy !
good and evil !
( This is curious and may not be realized immediately , but it must be realized , I feel in myself that I represent falsehoods equally with the rest , And that the universe does .

Ah poverties , wincings , and sulky retreats , Ah you foes that in conflict have overcome me , ( For what is my life or any man ' s life but a conflict with foes , the old , the incessant war ?
} Mediums
In midnight sleep of many a face of anguish , Of the look at first of the mortally wounded , ( of that indescribable look ,) Of the dead on their backs with arms extended wide , I dream , I dream , I dream .
Thick - sprinkled bunting !
Long yet your road , fateful flag -- long yet your road , and lined with bloody death , For the prize I see at issue at last is the world , All its ships and shores I see interwoven with your threads greedy banner ; Dream ' d again the flags of kings , highest borne to flaunt unrival ' d ?
What best I see in thee , Is not that where thou mov ' st down history ' s great highways , Ever undimm ' d by time shoots warlike victory ' s dazzle , Or that thou sat ' st where Washington sat , ruling the land in peace , Or thou the man whom feudal Europe feted , venerable Asia swarm ' d upon , Who walk ' d with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade ; But that in foreign lands , in all thy walks with kings , Those prairie sovereigns of the West , Kansas , Missouri , Illinois , Ohio ' s , Indiana ' s millions , comrades , farmers , soldiers , all to the front , Invisibly with thee walking with kings with even pace the round world ' s promenade , Were all so justified .
I see the ships , ( they will last a few years ,) The vast factories with their foremen and workmen , And hear the indorsement of all , and do not object to it .
But I too announce solid things , Science , ships , politics , cities , factories , are not nothing , Like a grand procession to music of distant bugles pouring , triumphantly moving , and grander heaving in sight , They stand for realities -- all is as it should be .
O book , O chants !
years of the unperform ' d !
is there going to be but one heart to the globe ?
for lo , tyrants tremble , crowns grow dim , The earth , restive , confronts a new era , perhaps a general divine war , No one knows what will happen next , such portents fill the days and nights ; Years prophetical !
what life , what joy and pride , With all the perils were yours .
} Song at Sunset
Good in all , In the satisfaction and aplomb of animals , In the annual return of the seasons , In the hilarity of youth , In the strength and flush of manhood , In the grandeur and exquisiteness of old age , In the superb vistas of death .
Wonderful to be here !
and how the sun , moon , stars , dart on and on !
( surely it is alive !
O setting sun !
O air and soil !
O my dead , an aroma sweet !
} Camps of Green
is it too only halting awhile , Till night and sleep pass over ?
She swiftly courses from the shore , Joy , shipmate , joy .
} These Carols
Is there a single final farewell ?

Enough O deed impromptu and secret , Enough O gliding present -- enough O summ ' d - up past .
SANDS AT SEVENTY ]
Isle of the salty shore and breeze and brine !
I stand as on some mighty eagle ' s beak , Eastward the sea absorbing , viewing , ( nothing but sea and sky ,) The tossing waves , the foam , the ships in the distance , The wild unrest , the snowy , curling caps -- that inbound urge and urge of waves , Seeking the shores forever .

what Sirius '?
what boundless aggregate of all ?
What subtle indirection and significance in you ?
what fluid , vast identity , Holding the universe with all its parts as one -- as sailing in a ship ?
On for your time , ye furious debouche !
Proudly the flood comes in , shouting , foaming , advancing , Long it holds at the high , with bosom broad outswelling , All throbs , dilates -- the farms , woods , streets of cities -- workmen at work , Mainsails , topsails , jibs , appear in the offing -- steamers ' pennants of smoke -- and under the forenoon sun , Freighted with human lives , gaily the outward bound , gaily the inward bound , Flaunting from many a spar the flag I love .
Then last of all , caught from these shores , this hill , Of you O tides , the mystic human meaning : Only by law of you , your swell and ebb , enclosing me the same , The brain that shapes , the voice that chants this song .
