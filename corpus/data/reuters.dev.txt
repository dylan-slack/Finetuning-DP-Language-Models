The future of the U . S ./ Soviet long - term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year , Lyng said , but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long - standing agreement .

NEW LME ALUMINIUM CONTRACT WELCOMED BY TRADE The London Metal Exchange ' s , LME , decision to introduce a dollar - denominated aluminium contract , with the Port of Singapore listed as a delivery point , is a positive move , physical traders and LME dealers said .
Trade sources said the LME ' s new contract will conform with existing industry practice , where 99 . 70 standard re - melt material , priced in dollars , is most commonly traded .
The Soviet Union also produces 99 . 50 pct , but has declined as an exporter recently , they said .

The standard price of other beef , mainly produced from dairy steers , is set at 1 , 020 yen against 1 , 090 and the ceiling at 1 , 325 against 1 , 420 .
But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling .
But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U . S . Meat exporters because of Japan ' s rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC .
In 1984 , Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9 , 000 tonnes a year until March 31 , 1988 .
In 1987 / 88 , the quota will rise to 177 , 000 tonnes from 168 , 000 in 1986 / 87 , ministry officials said , adding Japan wants to keep self - sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct .

IWC ups Soviet grain 1986 / 87 import estimate three mln tonnes to 29 mln - official
To this end , Japan and the U . S . Must make medium - and long - term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations .
In its monthly market report , the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987 / 88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986 / 87 .
The IWC raised the 1986 / 87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes .
After damage to its maize crop last year , the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops .
Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986 / 87 , the IWC said .
Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7 . 16 billion stg from 6 . 73 billion in January .
Exports rose to a record 6 . 93 billion from 6 . 20 billion .
Bank Negara said although Malaysia ' s net borrowing dropped in 1986 , its external debt rose due to the 30 pct appreciation of the basket of currencies against which the ringgit is pegged .
These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency .
The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure , the report says .
