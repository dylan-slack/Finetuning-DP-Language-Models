I'm sorry for your loss, Chip
I'm getting mine shipped to me in a few weeks!
I do. Peeping Toms are my fetish.
Well that was a fun 4 months. Goodnight everyone!
Goodell can't pronounce Mariota
Sounds like packet loss. Are you on wireless?
In all fairness, it is Kreider.
Marioto? You had one job, Goodell.
Don't write it in cursive. 
https://i.imgur.com/0tlqT2F.gifv
Fuck yes!!!! We didn't draft Mariota!!!!
Yeah! we need more of them (:
After all that... unbelievable disappointment. 
Need ideas for tomorrow, anyone?
How the fuck does Goodell fuck his name up?
Mariota Vs. Winston week 1!
Looking good. Ready for a funeral :)
"They hate us because they ain't us!"
MEREDITH pls don't hurt yourself

Think *the Carter Family* name is taken
There will be (hopefully) tomorrow.
"Marcus Mariato"

Jesus Roger
MARIOTA IS A TITAN HOLY SHIT 
Well that was anti-climactic
did we just have a Brett Favor moment?
Could we get a link to the video as well?
3 runs on 1 hit, SMALL BALL 
I'm actually shocked as hell.
Did he just call him Marioto?
"Her pussy gets so wet, you would not believe."
Mariato? **Goodell, you had one job**
Mispronounced Mariota and Oregon...
That's not how you pronounce names!
Mariota vs Luck vs Bortles vs Watt!


Id like to see the replay of that penalty
i didn't see that part of the AMA.
What happened to your dogs hand? :(
This is the spoiler thread...
That's what the sneeple want us to think.
Dude will wonder why that comment hot 15 updongs 
HAHAJAJAJAHAJAJ SAD EAGLES FANS
Hahaha roger come on dude 
and no more speculation, hes off the board!!
Just another QB to kill in the AFC South.
Did anyone notice Goodell said "Marioto"
First name butcher of the night
NOBODY COULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING!!'n
Two more periods to keep up this momentum.
Did he really just mispronounce the name?
THEY WEREN"T SUPPOSED TO DO THAT
WHAT?!?!? DID ANYONE SEE THAT COMING?
So are caffeine and alcohol.

SMALL BALL! NATIONAL LEAGUE! STRATEGERY!
Oh thank Halas they didn't trade up!
Aw, Google isn't working for you?  
People have emergency funds? 
CALLING IT, MARIOTA IS GONNA GET TRADED!!!
He's in zen mode. 
 iZEN't that ZENsational?
Nice period. Get Forslund and Pierre some coffee.
HAS ANYONE CHECKED TO SEE IF CHIP IS STILL ALIVE?
Yeah. It was quick but I was looking for her. 
Now they will just get even more stupidly rich.
Yeah figured that, thanks!
Chances the Titans keep Mariota?
I wanted some crazy trade :(
FUCKING KREIDER. GOALIE RUNNING SHITBAG. 
Depends on how much I get from insurance really.

Im just looking at the character issues

Wow, RIP Mettenberg era 2014.
Maybe you're a supergenius? 
The Titans killed all of my hopes and dreams. 
Where's the replay of that penalty???
Who da fuck is Marcus Marioto?
1 hit 3 runs. I'm cool with that
That was probably supposed to be her then 
THANK THE LORD BRING ON COOPER OR WILLIAMS!!!!
MARIOT-O?! He fucked up his name

Did he just call him Marioto?
"Her pussy gets so wet, you would not believe."
Mariato? **Goodell, you had one job**
Mispronounced Mariota and Oregon...
That's not how you pronounce names!
Mariota vs Luck vs Bortles vs Watt!

Is Goodell retarded? Serious question
How many retired people are there in the US? 
Heard you guys have a great freshman goalie
Are the draft events expiring too?

Marcus Marioto? lol Jesus, Roger.

Blood Orange. I see what you did there. 
Booing the call. Like every fanbase.
You still need to perform an exploratory wipe.
Your pidgeot evolved into Mariotto 
I'm sorry for your loss. Move on. 
Calling it now, Mariota is going to get traded. 
Not to sound rude but how do you know?
Don't buy it, its just a cover.
Yo who is the girl to the left of Mariota
That is both vile and hilarious. 
It's for pets. My dog is a covert pisser.
Arsonal beat Pat and Thesaurus totally beat Pat.
One does not simply finish GTA.
Marioto sounds like a pokemon
19 years ago I believe, 1996
And she's obviously so proud of it too.
That paint job didn't start out very well.

If you want to properly simulate how frequent a result is on a table, it's a good idea to have it appear more than once. Since each number on the die has the same chance to appear as any other (assuming the die is "fair"), the only way you can simulate frequency of a result is to manipulate the table. If you go this route, I'd suggest using a larger table than what 2-20 would provide.As others have pointed out, leaving items blank is redundant. You can probably fill them with a reference to a non-combat encounter table. Now, one thing you can do is have some encounters only happen a set number of times. Do this would make sense because as you kill off wandering monsters, you're less likely to encounter them.
More like tens of thousands of dollars, but not many hundreds of thousands.Individual cash transactions in Japan up to around ten thousand dollars are common and normal.
You're not saying anything interesting here. You're just spouting flowery bullshit. Conveying an actual message in simple language is much more poetic than just babbling on about nothing.
It's a great analogy and does work if you don't look too deeply into every individual action the characters conduct. But I don't think it was how Rockstar conceptualised Trevor from the outset. This makes more sense.

No they wont be adding it into the game because of how powerful it is already for hybrid characters. They increased the other Legendary options to supplement the power increase for non-hybrids that would compete with the Power Cosmic. Now, pretty much all the legendaries are on a relative playing field (as far as level 80's go)
From a nonreligious standpoint (or just not that particular religion), *any* circumcision is just barbaric and sadistic. All you're doing is removing pleasure sensors from your kids' genitals to prevent them from enjoying ~~sex~~ sin as much.

&gt;  the fundamental assumption in Amazon's move is that erotica is bad and wrong and "risky."it being risky isn't the same as it being bad/wrong, which they definitely haven't said or even implied. it is risky, but nowhere have they said erotica is bad or wrong at all. i also DON'T feel like it's the fact that it's erotica at all or erotica in general, but the fact that it's blatant pi, which technically isn't something amazon likes on their pages, hence why it's bannable and why we tell people to stay away from it dailycan you seriously blame amazon for not wanting to be associated with a stepbrother impregnation series with such a blatant awkward title? in this day and age of social media it would take one article on buzzfeed or somewhere else to sink their credibility and make them look weird as hell, they already get enough backlash as it is like with that gamergate scandal

I had a copper IUD before, with my previous partner. My body hated it or something because it started to fall out. I ended up getting pregnant because of that. I made the decision I made, and then I get another IUD put in. That one ended up falling out too :( I don't know why my body hates them, but I just kind of gave up after that...I've been thinking about trying the Nuva ring though, so I just have to make a doctor's appointment to go get it. I really don't want to go through the things I had to experience again :(
&gt;Yes, absolutely many of them do. But some do so because they just feel more comfortable as the opposite gender. That's...the same thing.  Anything is more comfortable than feeling suicidal while wearing pants.
No, my first was day one, it was loud. About 6 months later I bought another, it was the quite one I love. Then about 2 weeks ago I bought another, and to my displeasure it was louder than even the first. I only speak of Bumper button noise, I've never noticed the stick noise being to loud. I will say that the one I most recently purchased feels noticeably sturdier than the others, and doesn't have that squeaky, flexy feel.

If someone gives you shit for the character that you play they are being an asshole. Don't be afraid to call them out on it, surely it can't be acceptable behaviour in your community?
First of all you said the word "dealer".  This implies that at least one of these, maybe both, are new bikes.  Never buy a new bike, as a first bike, if possible.  You don't want to be stuck with the depreciation, as a year or two into riding, you will find that the bike that was perfect to learn on, is not the bike you want as a skilled rider.  If you shop smart, buy a used bike from an individual, you can sell that learner bike for what you paid or more, possibly. As long as you don't do a bunch of "custom" crap to it.&gt; I would probably use the bike for around town and maybe about 30 minutes of freeway driving 2 or 3 times a week.This is exactly what I thought before I bought my first bike.  Now I ride approximately 400 miles of canyons every weekend, ride the track at least once a month, and take at least two long distance (2000+ miles) trips a year on my bike.  Who knows what kind of riding you will enjoy once you become a skilled rider?
I have little to no knowledge of programmin but I can imagine that programming for video games it VERY different than programming for a web site. That and with the video game industry getting bigger and bigger and more and more people seeing it as a way to make good money the market is likely flooded. You are going to have to be very good and be able to prove it to break into it.I'm not trying to discourage you but these are the facts. If that is what you really want to do then do it. Look on codeacademy.com and get some programming books on-line or from your local library. I would suggest writing your own game and trying to get it published as an Indy title to get your name out there. Good luck.
I know that in other cultures it's considered perfectly normal and there is nothing sexual about it. I try not to be ethnocentric. But that shit is fucking gross!
When will prisons admit the innocent? When will graveyards admit the living? When will nursery schools finally admit people of all ages? Why must we segregate so?When will the Olympics accept the unfit? When will the Tour de France accept the lowly motorist? When will the FIFA world cup accept teams of people who aren't interested and will refuse to play football? Why must we pigeon-hole? When will heterosexuals finally accept partners of the same sex? When will monogamists respect the views of multiple polygamists to marry them? When will people accept as friends people whom they hate? - Isn't it bigotry to only like certain people from society?When will the bakers end their hateful campaign on the gluten intolerant? When will the gluten intolerant become tolerant? When will newspapers like the guardian finally cater for the illiterate? - do they not deserve to suffer too?
The language was "great leader" not "great primer minister" he managed to stay afloat as leader of the nation for 11 years. That's the point, not what he did or didn't accomplish.
Nonsense. Informing would be something along the lines of "Canada's latest budget means tax policy has changed. To see how it might affect you, go to gc.ca or contact your local MP". No soothing female VO, sprightly nu-folk jingle or flat-out pimping party interest. This is partisan marketing.  What's infuriating is that Ontario had a regimen wherein all advertising had to be vetted by the AG for just such partisan intrusion in to 'informing'. Sadly, the OLP gutted it in the latest budget. So they seem to be learning well.
If it's not used to evaluate the worth of a film, and only to show films are male-centric, then we're still left with the question of "so what?". The film industry changes with society and society may change because of the media we see. If male-centric films were a problem then the market will force films to change - and the bechdel test remains pointless. That leaves it's only function as some sort of shaming weapon, since it's pointless for anything else.

I believe it's Youtube. They have a video stabilization option as one of it's enhancement features and I think it gets chosen as a default on videos that it detects as being shaky. So you sometimes see this wavy effect because it's been processed after upload.
The guys at Lion's Den were famously wild, getting into feuds and making up week in and week out. Ken was brutal on guys and people would lose patience, there have been a lot of stories from him about guys getting into real fights in the gym mid-spar, though over time they'd make up but not without a lot of roughing up.Actually if you ever run into Ken Shamrock I highly recommend asking him about the old days in training, he may be a brash asshole but he's got a lot of interesting stories about that.

Maybe I'm wrong but isn't that exactly what the article was saying?  The Pats aren't in a position to be taking the top 2 QBs, so their QB market is the later guys, and those later guys haven't been particularly strong. I think this is the point of the article.
That would be the coolest resistance pack ever. Besides these 4 wolfhound variants are kinda bullshit - only 1 has DHS. None have endo or anything interesting. The hardpoints are essentially the same. I looked at sarna - they basically made 1 up just to fill the 4th variant slot. So why not add grinner or the allard variant so something truly is unique!
I had a sub one time in high school who took the entire class period to take attendance. She would ask people to say their name and something about them. She then commented on them with things like "Are you a virgin? Don't lie to me, liars go to Hell," and "Oh I bet you like to party."
Huh I didn't know St. Pauli was based in Hamburg!Yeah airports are just confusing to me, especially when a city has multiple major airports. Melbourne has two that always comes up, but I think only one of them is international...so I wasn't sure about other cities. Thanks though.
one of the most powerful things you can do is slow down the enemies in rotation, at first you do this by just hiding near where they want to rotate and backstab them. later this has the effect of them checking every single corner when rotating and that slows them down a ton.
Despite all the Genisys hate, I'm still hoping that this movie will surprise people. It can't be *that* bad, and at the very least, we'll get an entertaining action movie. Maybe it looks bad now, but if the Terminator has taught me anything, it's that looks can be deceiving. I'll hold all my judgements until I see it.

Lallana really works his socks off. I hope he gets a good run without injury next season because not only is he incredibly talented, he's and absolute workhorse too. IF he can cut some of the niggly injuries out I can see him becoming a real big player for us.
Claims follow the policy though, do they not? A loss is a loss, and that will still go against the whole policy. Only *tickets* for the accident will follow the driver.
There was a guy in one of the towns near me that had both his arms blown off attempting to steal copper from strip mining equipment.  He won't be doing that again.  Not only because of his injuries but because he received a very good settlement form the mining company that didn't "provide enough warning of the voltage present" or "do a good enough job keeping people out".

I would suggest a gyarados, because m-Sceptile covers well it's weakness with it's ability, or a pokemon with discharge such as scarf jolteon, zapados, thundurus, or any other pokemon that can use discharge in order to get the most out of lightning rod. 
Especially because they've heavily stressed how it is a successor and isn't tied in with BK at all. Maybe they've only done that for legal reasons, but it seems like they want to innovate and mix it up without people being disappointed.I mean, these are the guys who made BK. No strangers to innovation. I'm very hopeful we'll get a good mix of old and new.
Almost no one here bothers to read Dabiq, which is really a shame. There is more information about this conflict in a single Dabiq article than a hundred Western articles. So many stupid posts here would be gone if the posters bothered to read even a single edition.

My involvement in this thread started with pointing out that yes, there are people who think involving money with modding in whatever way will ruin the hobbyist feel of it and destroy the community.I then pointed out that donations have had an abysmal track record so far for modders.I don't know if Valve's system would have worked or not, and/or if the eventual faults could be ironed out. It was killed before it ever got that far.
I never claimed a moral high ground, I never said I was better then anyone, all I said is there's nothing wrong with teaching kids religion and yes it does have to be a big problem to be concerned. If someone is killed over leaving a religion once every while it's not a big deal, it's a big deal when there a lot getting killed, people will do fucked up things and there's not much you can do about It, grow up
By the way, the detecting of issue number isn't very good (probably because I name volumes/runs/however you wanna name them with "v1" , and then the issue number), it would be easier to fix if there was some filename standardisation everywhere (like on the scene's film releases, e.g. Film.Name.2007.BluRay.720p-GrOuP), but I don't know... I guess the app could tell you how to name your files so they can be detected? Maybe you have a better idea...edit: ComicRack works better... kind of. On [this one](http://imgur.com/tH9Q8U3) it works well but on [this one](http://imgur.com/2kMmnss) it for some reason detects the scanner's name as part of the series' name.

"Watch your plates of meat, Joe Blake's about"  &gt; "be careful of snakes" I reckon Aussie rhyming slang is the ticket.  Some examples:Joe Blake -   "snake" Steak and kidney - "sydney"Plates of meat - "feet"Dog n bone - "phone"Ducks n geese - "police"Etc etc etc 
Can I animate one of the dinosaur vore fanfiction where they eat beloved waifus of well respected franchises as dubstep plays in the background, censoring the breasts with horrible placed God of light shenanigans but keeping the vore untouched as a bunch of hideous bunch of middle aged pudgy guys masturbate to it, obviously animated by kyoani,  or is using names from other franchises illegal unless they pass by a repaint and one character name change? If that doesn't get less than 2.0 I'm sceptical on mankind chances of salvation. 
I can't listen to these crappy "reviews" when things haven't even been finalized. Not only that but the poor execution of the discussions doesn't help their cause.

It's not clear whether you're presenting this view as your own or as an objective, nonjudgmental summary of the way Christians think. If it's the latter then you'd do well to make that clear.

Thousands of people clip along at 80mph along I-80 perfectly legally every hour without (or with very little) incident. But if you try and do 80mph down Broadway in NYC, you're gonna have a bad time. Likewise, if I-80 is covered in half a foot of snow and you try and do the speed limit, you're gonna have a bad time. A "safe speed" is entirely dependent on your situation and the conditions you're faced with. If we want to make the roads safer, reducing speed limits is a cop out and doesn't address the real reason why accidents happen (even ones where "speed was a factor"). What we need to do is make safer drivers. Equip them with extensive training and give them the tools to make safe assessments of their surroundings. This is exactly why the German autobahns are safer than US highways, because in order to get a driver's license in Germany you have to go through a rather rigorous driver's ed school. 
This situation is definitely perplexing. Except this, is there any other things of his behavior that confuses you?Without knowing his side, I am not sure what to think, but if does have a girlfriend at the moment he was with you, I wonder if you are better off without him...

Don't worry, you can go lower than what they've quoted you so far.  PM me your salesman, I can give you the guy I had.  Beware, their finance guy is a dick, get your own financing from a credit union, and don't fall for any of their warranties.
Yea, thats why i said it depends on the market.  the reality is many jobs prefer a bachelors.  But if you have a strong resume, strong skills, and certs, you can compete.  But there will always be those jobs you simply wont have access to or will be at a disadvantage because of not having the degree.  But dont let that stop you.  Do everything you can to get everything else to make you more marketable.
It's highly unlikely. Bleeding doesn't mean contraceptive failure, it just means you're using a progestogen-only method, and one of the side effects is irregular bleeding, which may be light, heavy, prolonged or for a very short amount of time. Unpredictable and annoying, yes. Sign of pregnancy...no. :) nexplanon is so effective, with a tiny 0.05% failure rate. Like it has been mentioned, you've got the most reliable birth control available. Relax! 
I posted this last night, but I think Mark Buehrle is under rated. Only rated an 83 but his control and speed change make him hard to hit I find. If using the meter pitching with him, it is very "forgiving" if you miss that little bar on the way back down. 
I think you are being downvoted because MAC addresses are designed to be unique and changing it could cause conflicts. That said, my ISP will give out a new IP address if the MAC address of the router or computer that is connected directly to the modem is changed. OP may well have an ISP that does the same. 
The dismantling of the Eagles' franchise on a wing and a prayer? No, I don't love this. A bit of a hyperbole, but the cost is simply too high. If this were a proven NFL QB it would be a different story.
But these protests could have been an opportunity for black Americans to improve their situation (in the 60's peaceful protest's did quite a bit).  Instead they rioted and looted which highlights the need for the police that they are protesting in the first place. I'm not condoning how the police treat people, it's just that engaging in criminal behavior is not the best way to draw attention to a corrupt/brutal police department. 
Yeah, that won't make things awkward.  I am quite sure she's aware that she is naked in her yard.  She trusts you'll ignore seeing her enjoying her space.  Just like she'll ignore you enjoying yours.
I never did. You just want to make sure she's not in direct sunlight. Stay in the shade with her, keep her covered with lightweight clothing/blankets, wide brimmed hat (if she'll keep it on anyway), stroller with the umbrella covering her... I'm sure there's more I'm not thinking of. :) Keeping her out of the sun isn't really that hard, unless you're living somewhere with no trees/gazebos/overhangs. I mean, she's probably not crawling yet, so you don't have to worry about her wanting to run around. Get bubbles, babies love those.I'm sure you're aware that during summer, it's not just sunburn but heat stroke and such to watch for, too. Babies are susceptible, so keep that in mind.
There are hundreds of other Community FFA DM servers. I usually suggest [-abM- | FFA Deathmatch | 128 tick | dust2-mirage-cache-inferno](http://www.gametracker.com/server_info/64.74.97.240:27015/). 128tick, FFA, reload on headshot kill, etc...
I didn't initially realize this when I saw the tweet today, but Everyday Eternal is now hosted at a different domain – this means you'll also have to update your iTunes subscription if you're depending on that to see new episodes (I'd missed the last one because of this).
I agree fully. In steam. i put in 5 dollars every 3-4 days to buy shit. This is the same thing as the illegal downloading thing isnt it? People dont download movies and games ONLY because its free. Alot of people do it because its even easier to do. Right? So if Nexus would add a "Steam" like client to add money over? Could that help you think? 
&gt; "...makes Star Trek more than just another TV series."Okay, no.  Please don't put this show on a pedestal.  It's a great show, but it seriously doesn't deserve that.  No show does.
I think this is a pretty good season and I have really enjoyed all the episodes thus far. I also don't hate every single person in the game like some do. You don't like the way the story is being told, I get that. I don't like the Godfather and it is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Doesn't do it for me. Did I watch it wrong? Just because I don't enjoy a story doesn't mean it's shit or "hot garbage". You have every right to your opinions, but don't expect people to not put you in your place when you call them facts and tell people that they can't watch a TV show correctly since they disagree with how you view it.
... so does this mean I can't drunkenly make 2am posts about Sbarro pizza anymore? :(^^^^^^I'm ^^^^^^so ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^little ^^^^^^bit ^^^^^^kinda ^^^^^^sorry
&gt; far behind in what way? The control suites weren't even close to parity back then- most of the suite was simply missing in the WPF library.The WPF PivotGrid/FormLayout controls didn't show up until a late 2009 Beta release, RibbonBars were added in 2010.1,  The Scheduler, RichEdit, and SpellChecker in 2010.2, Docking in 2011.1, TreeList/Gauges in 2011.2, etc, etc, etc.The only major control that I'm aware of offhand that hit WPF before WinForms was the Map control- and that did eventually make it to WinForms.
I'm not so sure, to be honest. According to Phillips and Axelrod's *Encyclopedia of Wars*, it stands at 7% of all wars caused, and less than 2% of the death toll.I'd say more wars are a result of empire-building and maintaining, by different groups at different times.This is, of course, not to say that religion has not been used to commit terrible atrocities, but only that it cannot be seen as the cause of more war than any other ideology or goal.
See I don't think you actually agree. I'm saying "time A+n" is later that same night when you actually engage in sex. Not the next day if you regret your choices.&gt;Similarly, if your case hangs on baldly asserting at time A+n that you dispute that consent was present at time A, _then you have no case._  It doesn't matter whether you had consent at time A, what matters is whether you have consent when you actually engage in sex. Time A and time A+n can be minutes apart.&gt;Again, what is your proposed alternative?What someone wears is never a clear signal of consent for sex. Ever. If that's all you've got, then you've got nothing. The alternative is to actually have a case where you actually have consent.
I think for Google maps at least if you lose signal, you can carry on the path and be fine. Not sure what would happen if you went off the path though...Also I found that Google maps needs very little cell service to function, like one bar to get directions over 4G (HSPA+)
Been decades since I heard this variant at the local block party:"the gal I'm gonna marry ain't born yet and her mama's dead"as proclaimed (rather "tipsilly" I might add) by a crotchety old uncle belonging to one of our neighbors; never forgot that one. 
Not an answer to your question but I'm curious about doing a DIY Vitamin C mist and I need some insight on this! Hopefully someone could answer with some helpful feedback :)
Don't laugh too hard about that. I used to have a joke shirt that had "Australian Bomb Squad" on the front and "If you see me running keep up" on the back and I wore it to a training session down in Sydney one day (for a company that was very laid back about "casual" wear) when a serious bomb threat was called into the building. I ended up on the front page of the Sydney daily rag thingie they used to hand out at train stations
What I recommend as a pretty much go to power supply does not mean that everyone gets it. While I do try to fit it into just about every budget, it sometimes just isn't possible. I do recognize that every situation is different but most of the time most people are working with the same amount of money and want the same performance. It's just a nice starting stone to work with. 
If you don't anwser Mayweather-pacquiao I don't think you understand the magnitude of this match up. We won't get a fight of this scale for a very very long time.Or you just don't care about boxing which is fair enough.
[Throw back to the cannon](http://imgur.com/AWwQyg2) This school really likes to take what we hold dear and change it reagardless of the publics support. 
Wow, I've actually rode down that road. Can confirm, picture is saturated. Also there is really no need, NZ was beautiful literally everywhere I looked.
Maybe 2 hit kills? Lower the overall ammo to 4 missiles, nerf turning radius and increase damage and you've got yourself a lib killer. I wouldn't mind this.
not at all older, haha, I'm 20.. the surface means nothing to me, it's who someone is at their core, I can be attracted to a body, but I can only fall in love with the person inside.. it certainly does take maturity, and honestly, that can come from all ages, for me it's my life that has brought me to be the person who I am.. I care and I truly think women are absolutely astounding, granted my gender can be too, I just don't have the same feelings for them. :)
I have to be frank -- this is pretty fucking stupid. It's one thing to go fight as an individual without children, or one that is older and has grown children, but to leave one's young children in such a situation is pretty low. The good she can do in this world through being there for her children is many many times greater than the small contribution she can make to YPG. Before you label me sexist, I'd say the same thing for men in her circumstances.I'm guessing that she suffered from some level of ennui/existential despair in the United States and wanted to find a new greater life purpose. Interestingly enough, that ennui is also what often motivates people to embrace Daesh/other jihadi groups. The [of course significant] difference lies in what values are embraced as representing the 'higher purpose.' Fortunately she chose those of PYD. edit: I looked at her facebook. She's with the Peshmerga in Iraq, not YPJ in Syria. 
&gt;You're criticizing the U.S. for using it's navy to protect it's citizens and their territory.  They aren't escorting all ships, **they're escorting U.S. flagged ships.**  It's not like they're blockading Iranian ports.Have US flagged ships been detained?  I keep hearing about a cargo ship owned by a Dutch conglomerate that went from Turkey to Saudi Arabia and was heading elsewhere...  
One level 47 doesn't really compete with three, fully fusioned gold cards ~10 levels lower.Only reason I won, was my gear and Johnny's energy drain lvl 1 atk.
Good job man.That being said, a no death run really isn't as hard in Bloodborne as compared to the previous souls games, especially due to the shortness of the game, the lack of falls and the really easy late game bosses.
Alright so first issue - the case and power supply don't have their prices listed and probably because of the seller parameters, so now I'm over budget by an extra $120.
Nothing frustrates me more then the guy in ranked that goes  0/6 blaming the rest of the team for being "toxic" and "tryharders". The "I only play for fun guys, I instalock ashe support and go 0/6 cuz its so much fun". Bah
I skipped a line in that analogy.Consider you are sick. You need medicine to get well again. (You are alive and need to reproduce to replace yourself) medicine is necessary for that. But it is bitter. Only if it was sweet...
Yeah but you can hear that anywhere. I'm from California. People have speech issues everywhere. I live just across the river from Cincinnati and I really don't hear this here more than anywhere else. Just saying. 
People say that, but then they also want the ash trays removed from public areas so people smoke less. I'm going to smoke. I can either throw it in an ash tray, on the ground or light a trash can on fire. Your choice.
The ONLY ways you can level those up is if you do bounties for them, and for Vanguard, you get Marks and Reputation when you do the Heroic and Nightfall, and you get Crucible rep and Marks by just playing Crucible
I was in sales in the past but I loved it..there's books you can get that basically teach you sales skills. I read them but I found that it did come naturally to me..I'd chat to customers, get them to like me. Even with marketing, a lot of it involves teamwork but maybe you're someone who works better on your own?
Or it would demonstrate that voting SNP gives you a marginalised representative with no power, and risks some of their support slipping, and/or risks a shift in votes in England (consider which parties can *afford* to run another full-blown campaign in short order) such that a majority can be formed without the SNP...
[I normally play with these settings](http://pastebin.com/TwxQDNRC), its pretty good. On Ultra it was VERY VERY Cinematic. it was so cinematic that my usb devices lost connection to my pc. 
Oh man... I love Skyrim Redone so much. I'd love to hear his perspective on this issue - that's easily one of the biggest and most extensive mods out there.
From what position is he giving you trouble?  In the jungle he clear is still very slow, even with Cinderhulk, and he can be punished early.  As a support, he suffers to Morgana, who makes it much more difficult to all-in, and disengage supports like Janna and Alistar.  The moment he ults the adc the support can knock the adc out of the fight, making his ult knock-up useless.  Generally Naut is weaker against highly mobile teams, both he and his spells are slow and well-timed disengage stops him.
Thanks for spreading the news of his gofundme page.It's also a lesson for all of us not to break up a black fight.Minor gripe:  It's "lives," not "lifes."
When my first was a baby he was crying at a shopping mall because the shopping was keeping him awake past his sleep time (for the uninitiated, this is every couple of hours).I was approached by an old lady who said the best way to stop a baby crying was to hold him upside down under a tap. I was speechless, and really wish now I'd tried it with her.
Meh, these problems are easily solved with a vote kick system like Diablo 3 or any other number of fully featured MMO's. The real problem is bungie is in denial about this being an MMO.
Absolutely adore Garrus. With you from beginning to end, no matter what route you take-- be it paragon or renegade, bro or LI-- he is a rock to your Shepard. Nobody else quite displays the same amount of loyalty and trust that Garrus does.  He's interesting, intelligent, has a great sense of humor, and an incredibly attractive voice.Absolutely loathe Jacob. Being unable to have a conversation without fawning over him as femShep, no matter how hard I try, is infuriating-- not to mention what happens in ME3 if you romanced him in ME2. My blood just boils. I'm Commander Shepard, dammit! He doesn't have that much sway over me! My latest playthrough, I gleefully accepted his volunteering to go through the vents as tech guy during the suicide mission...if you know what I mean.
Im guessing the creators of the TEdit will start to consider OSX when they release the official version of terraria for mac, which shouldnt take long considering devs have stated that they plan to release it alongside or around the time 1.3 . 
So I thought the turbo rda my friend had was cool and I bought one. It came with a note that said some juices may destroy the plastic turbine. What juices are not that harsh? I'm not a big premium juice guy so I wouldn't know. Thanks!
Fredericksburg is the 49th most densely populated area in the United States. Los Angeles is 47th. I think we are no longer "pretty rural".http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_statistics_of_the_United_States
I'll be honest, I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. I've never been affected by problems like these and I'm not well-read enough to offer solutions. But I do know the solution isn't to write them off by saying "No one's forcing them to open businesses in those neighborhoods." 
The hop additions split up a lot of the bags if I remember correctly. A scale is quite useful for splitting them up. I believe I even had to store some half used hop bags for the dry hop but don't quote me on that. Fortunately, I have a vacuum sealer. If you can, use a large vessel for the blow off. I didn't. http://i.imgur.com/F6Wy2kI.jpg http://i.imgur.com/99WYFVM.png I also used the liquid yeast and these photos were the next morning when I checked on it after pitching at around 1am. So maybe 6-7 hours! And that room was about 60° f. I'd still highly recommend the cold crash to drop out all that hop matter. There's a ton and a tight trub/hop residue will minimize losses. It's a fantastically delicious beer. Blows away everyone that tries it. I fined with whirlfloc but it still chill hazes badly but after a few weeks in the fridge (I threw them all in to preserve hop flavor and aroma once carved properly) it clears up amazingly. Cheers!
I don't think its fair to punish trans people for the actions of criminals or to assume that a trans person is likely a criminal. Japan needs to find a way to treat the cause rather than the symptom.
I just rewatched all of A Certain Magical Index and Scientific Railgun again, and I realized I want Raildex III more than almost anything else. The whole universe is just the coolest and best ever. I need more. The whole April Fools Joke about season 3 was just hitting below the belt. It has been about 2 years since the last season, and I am losing hope for more. It actually makes me angry thinking if they do not make any more seasons. I just needed to vent, I WANT MORE RAILDEX
You (your brain) tells your Nervous System (the thing that lets you feel pain and move) that it wants the arm to move, and nervous system sends a message to the muscles which move for you. Basically. Very basic.
Thanks for taking the time to read and comment, I'm glad you liked the story.I looked over the "your" and "you're" issue and fixed the ones i found, so thanks for pointing that out. Regarding why Werryn didn't just run off: I'll admit that it was strictly a plot device when I came up with it. He does have a penchant for games of chance, however, so I'll try and find a way to make it logical. I wanted Cornido to seem somewhat inept. He's inflated by his sense of superiority, but he doesn't have as tight a grip on his subordinates as he thinks, hence Werryn's numerous escapes and the fact that Lethah treats helps him (to an extent) once her master leaves. I'll try and address that.I was noticing the dialogue thing too as I was editing. I will probably try and temper that on my next revision.Again, I really appreciate you taking the time to critique. Thanks!
With the Tomislav, I'd build on its silent spin-up ability rather than trying to turn it into a glorified assault rifle (back when it had much faster spin-up.) Passive health regeneration could be a good way to achieve this - you can camp out a spot for longer without needing a Medic or Sandvich and the noise that comes with it.
I know you were kicking off a pun thread, but there genuinely was a headline like that in Ireland the other day. Both the PSNI and the Garda were involved in a marijuana bust and the paper's headline was "800kg of Marijuana captured in joint sting"
Or if you were a [toddler](http://www.webmd.com/parenting/news/20141215/toddler-dies-liquid-nicotine) and got ahold of undiluted nicotine base.I didn't say it was a common thing- In fact, I clarified that most people are not at risk of death from drinking e-liquid. But a death from liquid nicotine did just happen recently, so you can't say it's out of the realm of possibility.
Ultimate Nick Fury has been literally based off of Samuel L. Jackson for fifteen years. That's longer than Spiderman has had organic webshooters. Getting to play him if they ever made a movie was his sole condition for allowing them to use his likeness--this isn't like taking Thor's hammer and handing it to le omg edgy feminist, he's basically the only guy who COULD play the role.

Oh my.. There has bern several people reporting this. You're playing in tier 5 and researching a tier 1. It is even stated on the statcards of tier 5 (as an example) planes that they're supposed to / good to research planes in tier 4 - 5. Also, if you hover over the amount of RP you got I believe it tells you that RP is affected depending on which tier you're flying in, and which one you're researching.
Thats what Ive been trying to say this whole time!Theyd have to be crazy to believe not raising your children for generations while simultaneously glorifying a culture of crime and complete disregard for their own communities is a good idea.Good call.
Anyone else looking to make a name for themselves as a bounty hunter? If that is successful enough, it could be waylaid into starting a mercenary group. Of course I am also interested in Economic activism. I have an idea for a player buyers co-op that aims to be a non-profit economic buying org that is able to be a competitive market force to rival mega corporations. Also interested in Exploration. Could definitely see myself as a sensor expert, or science officer on a ship, although I would be hesitant to captain one myself (at least initially).So I guess I am going to try to run the full gamut and make a name for myself. Looks like I will be quite busy.

In case it wasn't immediately obvious, the spare coil they give you is a .5 ohm coil, the one that comes in it is .3. I assume you're using the .5 if you're getting anything at 30 watts. I'm loving the Atlantis 2! I had the original and the larger juice channels it has make a big difference as does the top airflow adjustments by the drip tip. Have you found a source for replacement coils yet?
If by "Is he a toddler..." you mean, "Is he naive" about the matter, then yes... benefiting from privilege does tend to blind people to the biases and mistreatment that certain other people experience. Although my boyfriend sees me as his equal, he seems to forget that not everybody sees me or other women in that same light. He may have the power and privilege to gain free drinks without such being seen as a down payment on a night of physical pleasure, and he can just walk away. Myself and other women don't have that luxury because there are still enough people who believe we don't own our own bodies and the rights to say no to unwanted attention (and not be criticized for taking authority over ourselves).
After the fact, in another thread, he said he used photoshop to make this: http://www.reddit.com/user/HipsterMegaMan (latest comment at the time of typing)  Kind of a jerk.
Collection is in quotations because I feel like this is a small collection compared to some. Either way, I thought I would share so people can compare formulas. I often see Anastasia, Kat Von D, and Lime Crime swatches on here so I thought it'd be nice for some to see different brands, too! Edit: Thought I'd say my favorite ones to wear are the Hourglass ones, as they don't feel as drying as the Kat Von D colors, which would be my second choice. I just bought the Dose of Colors shade today and I'm wearing it now and I like it so far! I'll probably be purchasing more from them in the future. My least favorite are the NYX colors, but you get what you pay for.
pretty much sums it up. I have never ran into a chick who digs me that won't give it up. I have had a few that didn't want to appear easy, but the vibe I give off is one that I don't care, so it works out.
I think you're on the right path here, clean bulk and find a number (220 apparently) you're comfortable with to hit cutting. Cutting once you've got underlying muscle will only help you in the end for both seeing definition and also making the best of a calorie deficit.

Solo maining is perfect if you want to develop very quickly. The only downside besides bad MU's is that it may be more difficult to pick up a seconday if you ever want to.
I played the PC version, and it was awesome. Even without spending cash. The mobile version is supposed to be just a direct port, with only some textures being not as good. Same experience though!
The emergency fund is needed for more than just unemployment so I don't think the recommendation should be much lower in the UK.  It's for any emergency.  It's phrased as "months of spending" because that helps scale the fund size upwards (in an easy to follow way) to cover the larger expenses that people tend to have as their responsibilities grow.
I'm sorry, I wasnt trying to point out how bad women have it and so men have no reason to complain, I was just trying to show that from a woman's perspective, a lot of his arguments would seem ridiculous. Like I said, when I first started reading I thought he was being sarcastic.Being recognized for what you do is good because it motivates you to create a name for yourself, even if its as small as rescuing kittens. My point was that trying to DO things makes you a better person, trying to LOOK better only makes you more vain.You dont need to be an ass about it.
Yeah, they do this every year on May 1 and it's always frustrating because I usually pay for it before then BUT I GOT YOU THIS TIME MLB! I ONLY BOUGHT A MONTH BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D DO THIS SHIT! 
yes, it's amazing. As someone who's never played demon's, after more tan a month bloodborne has been released, I'd say BB=DS1 &gt; DS2; I was expecting bloodborne to be good, but what I've played is something veeeeery incredibly amazingly terribly mindblowingly good
You could go Boots &gt; Midas &gt; Shadowblade &gt; Octarine Core.Octarine Core is straight up broken on splitpushing heroes like Furion because you can move around the map a lot quicker than the enemy team can respond. Get an Aghs after that and the enemy team can literally never leave their side of the map. 
&gt; why are so many scientists taking it seriously?They are not. They are by and large ignoring it, because, duh, conversation of momentum.The fact that it claims to work within established phenomena described by mathematical theories that can be proven to have conservation of momentum really is a fatal flaw. It's q.e.d. Wrong.Now if I do a bunch of weird calculations and claim to prove that 1+1 = 3 then it might be an interesting puzzle to figure out where the flaw in my calculations is, but you don't need to find the flaw to know that I must have made a mistake.

I don't think I'm gonna change your mind, but just know that you can't force someone into rehab or to get help unless they broke some kind of law. Also there are factors like raising the prices to where kids can't get it among others. But I don't think I will be able to convice you anyway

I haven't said anything about your background.  I've said Noether's theorem is taught very early in introductory Physics courses.Obviously implying that if you were to actually introduce yourself to the discussion, you would find that there is more to it than a simple ignorance on behalf of the participants.
Rebound anxiety is anxiety that is greater than anxiety before you took the benzo. Punching holes through doors is not anxiety, so this is definitely not rebound anxiety. I've never heard of this and I always wake up feeling great after a sleep on benzos. Like others have said definitely lower your dose. You said they are pressed 3.5 so they aren't pharmaceutical. Is there a chance that it isn't xanax at all? Or maybe another active ingredient in it? This is most likely the reason IMO.
Rather than doing the expected thing and throwing curved punches at the head, punch them right in the solar plexus. It's that small space between your chest and your stomach. It's a dense cluster of nerve cells and supporting tissue. If someone takes a hard blow there they will quite literally have the wind knocked out of them, and you can use it as a excuse to demolish them.
I thought it might be that Rheagar and Ashara had a thing and she was cast aside for Lyanna. Ned fell in love with Ashara and being a second son didn't expect to have to marry for Lordship. idk how it fits with the kids, but it could explain Ashara crying at Harrenhall after Lyanna is crowned love and beauty. Ashara goes to Ned for comfort(turn to stark) 
I don't feel its naive to say that its team hopping at all, every roster he has left has been publicly stated to be his own choice. I think that it is just rationalizing in his favor to attribute some shadowy falling out / dropping to his situation.Your second point confuses me a bit. You are absolutely right in that he joined elements and it didn't work out how he wanted it to, and that Fnatic now want him back. However I don't see how those are pertinent points to the idea that he is simply following success rather than creating it. They want him back, but that doesn't mean he isn't riding on their coattails (to take steal your phrase).Don't mistake this for hate, I do not dislike Rekkles (although his social media interactions leave a LOT to be desired). He is an extremely gifted player and I hope he does well on Fnatic (big yellowstar fanboy), but I think that my opinion is pretty justified considering the kind of information that has been released to the public. 
That's great. I hope you enjoy them. I do not begrudge anyone the opportunity to see them. They're just not my thing.  I just don't care for tribute bands regardless of their talent.  Completely my own preference.
I live in Kalamazoo and I'm surprised.. this is the first I've heard of this chase, we had a police chase in the news a few days ago but it was in a different area and far less climactic.  I'm also surprised someone got pulled over for speeding, usually there are more important things to do than pull over speeders.  you should share this with /r/kzoo
I know!  It was such a disaster.  I broke up with that boyfriend about 15 years ago, but I drove past his mom's house a couple years back and that car was still in their driveway.  It was a beater even back then!
The problem is that the legislation being put forth (e.g., SB277 in California) require all vaccination -- even for non communicable diseases -- before education. Being vaxed at age 5 for a sexually transmitted disease (hep b) is more important than learning how to read. It just doesn't make sense. But if you say that, you're called a nut, a kook, or compared to Jenny McCarthy in an unfavorable light. It's a freaking witch hunt funded by the pharmaceutical companies. As such, even asking the question or thinking alternatively than the mainstream story is avoided by doctors.OP: I highly recommend looking at the Japanese vax schedule. Vaccination as a practice is great. Vaccination as it is practiced at the moment is seriously suspect. 
Both experience and title? I agree, but from the sounds of it you aren't getting director experience because you are "an IT Director which involves all responsibilities of a system admin plus the computer teacher". 
Have you checked the engine oil level?I would advise you to take your car to a Toyota dealer and explain exactly what happened. Ask them to diagnose the problem, document the needed repairs and call you before any repairs are done.I would take that documentation to place that did your most recent oil change and confront them with it. They will either write you a check or deny responsibility.  If they write you a check for the full amount of the Toyota dealer's estimate, plus the cost of a rental car for the time your car will be in the shop, that's great!  If they deny responsibility, you'll need to take them to small claims court.
I believe that, if we win on Saturday and therefore take the title, it won't just be that he has been promoted 4 times in 5 seasons; he will have won the Championship title 4 times, with 4 clubs, in 5 seasons.Here's hoping...
Treads - midas - ahgs - octo. in that order, secure farm..ulti + midas = mega farm / push (pushing will be big). and now with octo it works with treants, your ulti and midas for even more push and farm to get you a deso or mjolnir
Yeah actually, I had already decided on modding deadinsky from the get-go LOL. We work very closely and well with each other given the nature of our roles on the main subreddit. You know, except when he's out kicking puppies. Other than deadinsky everyone's up in the air. 
I do the water change and redose every 48 hours and closely monitor the fish. Temp has very little effect on marine ich. Freshwater ich is affected by temp change. 
Yeah I don't have a problem with his score or anything. It's just it's ridiculously  off compared to his original score. Especially since it wasn't after any considerable amount of time or a rewatch 
I have until the end of the month till the lease breaks, but will be to go back home for summer in two weeks. As for telling the complex..won't it be obvious I told?
Valium is great for dentist appointments. I see it prescribed all the time. You will still be able to complain if you feel the pain and it's not going to paralyze your muscles from being able to speak or move. Just make sure you take it 30 minutes to 1 hour before your appointment and make sure you have someone to drive you as this medication can make you dizzy and sleepy. 
Disagree about what?The fact that the people who tend to pass our interviews also tend to have college degrees isn't something you can disagree with. It's just a fact.We don't in any way require applicants to have a college degree. But our standards are high -- and becoming higher -- and rarely do we see high school graduates who are good enough.
[here](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/117461-New-Mobile-Processing-Lab-mechanics?p=1878064&amp;viewfull=1#post1878064) is a post by rover dude discussing the mechanics. In fact that entire thread is pretty interesting. Go have a read :)
Are you being dense intentionally?You know that rape occurs between married couples and/or many abusive relationships, right? And people stay and reason away those rapes. So are you saying that because someone would continue communication, the rape didn't happen? Jesus, what the fuck??
You'll definitely enjoy it, but of course you'll have much more of a blast if you actually know the characters. That's one reason why I love HotS and Infinite Crisis much more than LoL, Dota and so on, because the characters in LoL etc. don't have "real lore". The characters are made up specifically for the moba game and thus everything feels much more contrived to me.Anyways, yeah you'll have fun with HotS, because it's a fast paced, easily enjoyable moba that doesn't take 50 minutes of your life everytime you play it :) 
I'm 29 and my t levels were terrible and I felt terrible when I was tested six months ago. I didn't physically want sex but I sure did mentally and it was driving me nuts.My number 1 issue was stress, which is lowered by lifting and managing my work-life balance as well as a few supplements (ashwaghanda and maca pills). My number 2 issue was inactivity which lifting, especially compound lifts like squats, has fixed. 
I was private about it, but then my friends stole my sketchbook and proceeded to tell everyone ever. Nothing bad came of it, minus the fact that someone looked in my sketchbook &gt;w&gt;
Then make noise. make a scene. Don't let the party dictate this shit for you. Get the fuck off your ass and go out there and make some fucking noise, even if you're the only person out there doing it. Yea it's hard and it sucks but it's worth it in the end.
They have different animations and attack patterns. Clot clots are the same, they shamble around and try to diddle you. Cysts limp more and if they fail to grab you they flop on the floor and cry to themselves or try to look for their contacts or something. Slashers will rush you and do leap attacks and I think they can attack twice, but I'm not sure.Statwise they're identical.
It's always been a huge problem. Nowadays cops can't get away with it as often since they're caught red-handed on video now. Edit: Wow, quick to downvote. If you have something to say, say it. 
I have a portal ~100 feet from my front door and there have definitely been days which the thought of putting on pants and walking over to it has been too much. If it wasn't in a park, pants might be filed as optional.
Lol this is what he was talking about. Little bitter internet atheists who love to tell Christians how silly and inferior they are while bragging about how great Europe is. You just played into the stereotype.
I am using 'Western Poland' to demonstrate reach. They found the ruins of a fort in Thuringia, and found coins and other artifacts in the surrounding area, including Poland, but the discovery of the fort hundreds of miles from the Rhine AKA 'the border' of the Roman empire suggests that the Romans were militarily active in that part of the world.And those people were certainly Germans, as the Romans were certainly Italian. No ethnic bloodline is pure and Roman forces were multinational, and subsequent German tribes drove out the tribes that resided in what is called Germany today. Those tribes migrated into Europe and eventually mixed in with the ethnicity already in Roman Europe. 
Partially. I'm not particularly salty about Fire Beast Hunter and Wind Lizardman since I happened to get those from event SDs and am already done with Veromos. But when I was searching for a B10 farmable team before I got him, every team had Acasis in it. When someone asks for a farmable team for B10 in June, Acasis should not be part of that "farmable" team, because odds are, they won't have Acasis, and/or weren't around for the HoH. When a past HoH monster is basically recommended 95% of the time as a "farmable" line up, it doesn't do them much good.Yes, Com2Us gives all the monsters you need for the fusion, but that's assuming people were around for the time. It kinda irks me when "fuse Veromos" is the default response for people trying to reach mid-game.
I am so sorry, this is Fallopia japonica, knotweed. I've seen it come through the side of buildings. It's invasive, it will only expand, it's [really hard to get rid of.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/10171425/Ive-gone-to-war-with-Japanese-knotweed.html) People are driven to extremes by this plant.  
WE's form now sure.  But please remember WE at IEM was literally formed 2 days before the days began.Also CJ also shit the bed at the tournament.  So having both Korean teams being horrible, it is more likely that this was not preparation/jet lag but an indication of league weakness.
*Avatar.* I didn't dislike it when I watched it the first time, but I definitely was not mindblown like everybody else. After seeing it twice after with friends and family though, I liked it.
That's really touching, but I think the quote is too deep for me because I don't really understand the meaning ! To be fair I've never read one of Mark Lawrence's books yet. Anybody want to explain it to me ?
Xpecial seems to have the same misinformation as Hotshot. He wasn't playing top lane before this split. He was playing mid. And he was already moving to NA. 
Hahahaha I don't have the Aloe Vera line (besides the sunscreen) nor do I have the variety of toners that COSRX offers, but one day I will catch them all! I unfortunately don't own pH strips (gosh..should've taken some from the lab) but I've read on Wishtrend that the pH levels for both of the cleansers are around 9, which sounds crazy to me. I'll try to do a little more research on that and elaborate on it during my mini-review, but yeah...haha.EDIT: Okay, so now Jolse lists the pH of the Hyaluronic Acid cleanser at around 5-5.5, which seems more reasonable. I'm still trying to find one for the Salicylic Acid cleanser.
Driving from Cleveland to Ontario for the Quarterfinal matchup. Should the WNT win their group (which they will) and win their round of 16 matchup (which they will), they will be playing there. 
That's missing the point - some people are better with controllers than they are with a keyboard and mouse. Would you rather they just didn't play at all if they play better with a controller?
Question, one of my homes had a cinder block basement that had been skim coated, and ultimately it was the skim coat that was falling off, not the block. Did you take a screwdriver to it?
Not sure how to call this one, in fact. Might have to see if the judges will accept Alabama as being a country. Also worth noting that his choice of wording subtly implies that he feels like "our" map and "a" map are two separate and distinct things.
I think you're a bit confused. Black/Gold looks tacky because it looks like you're trying too hard to be "luxurious". The $10,000 Apple Watch is actual luxury. It's made of real gold. It isn't trying to be anything it isn't by being those colors.
By that logic the engine is perfect for battlefront. It's desgined to simulate mass military battles, just like battlefront.On top of that Dayz is on the Arma 2 engine, this is Arma 3. It's a way more advanced engine.
I'll post better pics tomorrow or the day after - pretty drunk now as it's [Vappu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walpurgis_Night) here in Finland tonight and tomorrow, and right now the process isn't writing to disk...
Shadow Amulet has always been a good pickup on CM imo but it was kind of cheesy since it was easily countered and didn't go anywhere. Now that it helps her EHP, can help allies, and can be used to initiate it is gonna be really good I think. Definitely really strong in pubs. 
Thankfully, I've never had to deal with this. At most gigs I've played, every band brings all their own shit. At a few gigs, there was an agreement that the drummers would share some stuff, but that was at this one venue that frequently booked a ton of bands to play short sets and that was how they kept things moving. I think the drummers used their own cymbals; the rest of the kit was provided. And I hated that venue.
They're claiming to have achieved a 29% efficiency improvement over Tesla's equipment.  I do not believe Tesla left that kind of engineering improvement on the table for anyone to exploit.
Have you reread Op man. I tried rereading One Punch Man but stopped at around 6th chapter. But atm I'm busy reading manga from this post ttps://www.reddit.com/r/manga/comments/34bxps/disc_favorite_manga_that_will_never_have_an_anime/
Katalox should make for fantastic, dark, fingerboards too, and it's not red listed or on the CITES list. The downside? It's ridiculously hard (about 3600 on the Janka scale!) and eats tools for breakfast. Still, might be a good alternative for those willing to pay extra to offset the cost of the lumber and tool-wrecking involved.
As a pagan and an *embarrassing* fan of Minecraft, that would make for an exceptionally boring mod. There's not particularly any special effects to the magic of any traditions. No zooming or wooshing or pretty lights (any of you guys get pretty lights?)Um, I guess if you wanted to you could dig into some Wiccan rituals. Or alchemical symbols. You could have some kind of...astral projection thing for beds.It's just...a lengthy research process, to go from not knowing anything about paganism to "getting started on development".Follow a project development lifecycle. At *least* use Waterfall. Spend lots of time on the Discovery phase. Like lots.
Yeah it was probably a poor decision on my SS's part, but that's what they wanted us to do so...I mean it was the last hour of peak so it wasnt a big deal 
This is exactly true. I personally think the Hull series will have limited functionality when it comes to defending itself from a surprise attack. However, there will undoubtedly be a mechanism for unloading those ships.  Given enough time (and that time could be surprisingly short), a Hull E loaded with already-piloted ships could jump into a system, get prepped in a corner, and dump all of the ships to then "hatch" and fend for themselves. This isn't too unbalanced because A) it isn't much better than just simply having all of the ships fly there on their own and B) they are pretty much sitting ducks the entire transit time. Additionally, while you could deploy all of these ships - what about refueling/repairing?
Meh.  Boudica ended up losing that number to only 10,000 Romans when they returned.  She ended up either poisoning herself, or committing suicide.  The rest of her people were then raped, enslaved or killed and her old home was annexed into the Roman Empire.  Worthy uprising by Boudica, but ultimately futile.   
This makes the civilization game I'm playing as rome gainst her much more interesting. I already pretty much destroyed her, her only cities left are garbage that aren't worth razing, my real worry is pocatello, who has an army 20X the size of mine, on a whole other continent, so invading is gonna be a pain
I expect racism from the defaults, because it appeals to a low common denominator of humour from a mostly white audience. It's a bit worse in the subs I actually like... especially when it's veiled in "politically correct" language, like "I'm not racist, I just don't like thugs," or "I'm not anti-semitic, I'm just anti-Zionist and the Jews I don't like are secretly Zionists."
hehe, yes so annoying...  O_OI looked for info in the official dev's website and I found nothing. Weird... announced for 2015, and they are still taking pre-orders show for the game here is the note at ign:http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/30/dead-island-2-delayed-to-2016oh well... if this makes Dying Light 2 comes sooner and stronger, it's good news to me...
No, I don't think you quite understand what I'm saying. Sanders himself is an avowed socialist. He personally identifies as a "democratic socialist". He's no a centrist by any definition of the term. The fact that you believes he is just go to show how skewed /r/politics is.
Does it not cover murders? &gt; And as a 2014 study by University of North Carolina found, since the 9/11 attacks, Muslim-linked terrorism has claimed the lives of 37 Americans. In that same time period, more than 190,000 Americans were murdered

I hope he's right, "within five years, 50 percent of the congregants will fall away from their church" if SCOTUS rules against religious discrimination.
I had console friends, no PC gaming friends until i went through a guild recruitment forum on a kickstarter game. Been with them for 2 months now and there all great, helps when the guilds large enough to have options.
We just had to send our backup solution back to the vendor, because multiple on site engineers couldn't figure out what was wrong. It took them weeks to admit it :/
&gt; All some people need is money for cigarettes, money for alcohol, money for weed, and they're content.I think that's an extremely oversimplified statement.  You left out rent, food, and things that form the basis of basic human existence.  If you're saying homeless people and drug addicts are "content," I think you're dead wrong.
Honestly of all your worries you can completely forget everything except education(send them to a private school) and hockey quality(miss the habs).As far as the heat goes, you spend most of the winter indoors because of the cold, well you spend most of the time here indoors during the summer, and you don't have to shovel or scrape sunshine. Get a house in Gilbert or Chandler, one of the lowest crime rates in the nation.(Escapee from western NY)... my thoughts.
You implied with your answer that I was asking SF to become more violent in its artstyle while I in my original post was explaining that SF is totally different to MK and thus things like breaking armor or blood on the other characters is pretty much impossible because of the low gore approach of capcom towards SF. Basically you said the same thing as I while at the same time accusing me of wanting to have more violence in the next SF installment, which is the opposite of what I said with my post.
Why not get a good 500 or 600w psu? You can browse /r/hardwareswap and there are a few that pop up every now and then for a good price. A 500w new isn't more than like $40-$50 usually 
Wondering if you guys are looking to progress into mythic progression for BRF and future raid tier. I am a 686 Arms warrior looking to find a place to fully clear heroic content and take on the mythic progression, I may not be a good player but I am trying to improve.
I was a pretty popular football player in high school, but I injured myself during a keg flip and went to community college.Now there was this really nerdy girl who got hooked on drugs and ended running through a plate glass window. She had a lot of work done, but I didn't realize how hot she was until my friend Jeff pointed it out to me.
No offence my friend, but I feel like you are missing the broader purpose of Nofap. If you have no desire to commit to nofap and nofapwar and you see porn and fapping as not a problem in your life since you are only 15 than maybe you should not participate. It seems to me as if you view Nofap solely as a way to get closer to your crush and you value that more than all the benefits of Nofap. I hope you find a true reason to go with Nofap otherwise maybe you shouldn't participate because you are doing it for the wrong reasons. Feel free to disagree I do not mean to sound condescending.
Well I am a doctor of scientific studying and such. I can confirm your body cells think that carbohydrates (scientific name for carbs) are fat and makes them fat. But with some pills you can make your body cells believe that carbohydrates are actually fibres and that will make you skinny. 
Sorry I missed the part where I said I speak for anyone but myself. Don't be so stupid, it's quite obvious I only mean myself. If you care about tipping and like to argue about tipping on the Internet you go ahead. It's not something I feel strongly about. I just don't really care lol. 
That's interesting. My friend who just got into running about a year ago is doing a neurobiology PhD at Harvard that I recently learned has to do with smelling. He explained it in a lot of detail but I wasn't really able to retain a lot of it.
One of the few places I haven't bought from...My usual routine is to buy 10, evaluate them quickly, and then buy more if they seem to be good, before the batch changes.
3x GCs just now. 2x $100 - Whirl 2, Huawei Valiant$13 for a new Whirl 2 - Claims damaged screen and corroded battery. Amazed that they would give me $13 for a cracked screen + water damaged phone, if it WERE true.
My daughter, 15 months old just marches up to me all the time and just demands *Up*.  If reaching up does not work she hugs the knees like she is going for a double leg takedown.
[Here's how to find the appropriate office to send to or drop off](http://election.dos.state.fl.us/SOE/supervisor_elections.asp). It is your county Supervisor of Elections office. I know in my county they have a drop box that you can just drop it in at anytime in you don't want to mail it.
Not my own, but my roommate's. Her and I have talked numerous times about how she dreams she drives on a bridge and ends up driving over the edge and dying. Or she assumes she dies because she always wakes up after falling off the bridge before hitting the water or land below. The thing is, it's never the same bridge or the same place. Always different.
This is primarily a relationship oriented discussion. However, one thing that others haven't mentioned yet is that many financing plans offer several months that are interest free. I'm not recommending it either way, but keep that in mind.
No, I know, and I'm perfectly happy with what I have and I wasn't saying I don't belong here. I just meant that I don't have that specific problem due to my length.From what I hear, it sounds like it's probably better overall to have slightly above average length than a ridiculous amount of length, anyway.

The new pro pricing is very recent, and was announced maybe a week ago. Previous to that, there was no trial period.Textra is an awesome, simple SMS app that sees regular updates. It's the kind of app that is well worth supporting, especially at $.99. Devs gotta eat.I think up you need to change your point of view. You should always expect to pay for something, and just be pleasantly surprised on those occasions that it's free.
i think like lalionnemoddeuse sid, it's mostly a a sine wave, mixed with some saw. Predominantly sine though.He's using portamento as well to bend the notes. Vibrato for sure.That's just my guess though. Good luck.

I mean he definitely has counters, and the best one is bursting him before he gets a lot of damage out. Once he uses BKB your physical damage carries are your only hope since by the time BKB wears off he's done enough damage to contribute meaningfully even if he does right after. PA, silencer to ult after he uses BKB, and other carries with a damage item or two plus a Daedalus are going to be the main way to "counter" him as effectively as possible. Skywrath will be great to help burst him if you can disable him  outside of BKB and the silence will be godly against him on par with how effective it is against storm spirit. Above all else, I think Pugna outclasses all other counterpicks from how thoroughly nether ward shuts Leshrac down at all stages of the game, and his effectiveness is completely item independent, just needing a few levels in ward before Leshrec is no longer able to survive around him. 
Ok I just read Slaughterhouse-Five and didn't really pick up on that. Do you mind elaborating what I missed? I thought it was a way for him to tell about the bombings of Dresden without saying it through his own POV. Since he mentioned his own character two or three times.
I agree with clyde below.  Its not size that matters. Its how they look.  ive seen small ones that are way hotter than huge real or fake ones. Personally i cant stand fakes. They only look good in clothes
Well... over the past decade, I've seen quite a few similar headlines in the science-news.Hopefully however... perhaps... this will be a genuinely pragmatic breakthrough, that might actually lead to real/effective longevity treatments for the general population (or at least somewhat wide spread treatments for the rich initially)?
Why is Rolf bad? I mean, he's archer so he's automatically at a disadvantage, but he isn't so bad. He's low level yeah, but comes with his OP bow of doom. He got better availability than Shinon, and Shinon's bases are so bad when he rejoins that his growths won't save him. He's outclassed by Astrid, but he joins early and can get a big advantage while  Astrid is trying to catch up using Paragon. 
  Gerrymandering works. My congressman was Bentivulio. He was a first rate clown, but a Repub in a solidly red district, The Repubs set it up so McCotter could not lose. Then he fucked it up by faking signatures on the election ballots. Bentivulio lost the primary to a guy who made a fortune foreclosing homes. He won of course. I have worked and donated for the opposition, but it is a waste of time.
Depends on what you consider to be "using". Every day I try to better myself, meditate, learn something new, etc. I have a never ending list of books to read and skills to learn. I try to make every action I take a reflection of the bigger picture. That is definitely magical. In terms of specific rituals and actual nuts and bolts craft, its a pretty rare thing. Life has taken care of me well, and when it hasn't, I've always learned more than I could ever hope. I do the best I can to play the field as it is, not as I want it to be. The instances where I think my personal will is worth projecting over the existing flow are few, and I usually have better success following synchronicities and reading the signs along the way so to speak. My last ritual was making a talisman out of an object of immense personal importance. I guess the tl;dr would be: constantly yet selectively

If this occurs regularly I'd consider it a problem. She is twenty-eight. Even if she didn't expect your game to take that long she should be content with the fact that you did what you promised- contact her after the game.  This is accountability, this is good enough in my book. No partner of mine has ever had to explain their every move and exact time frame of said moves. Yeah sometimes I felt disappointed when things didn't work out the way I'd hoped. It's not always great to be waiting for someone's text if you expect to hear from them. I get that. But she is in no position to punish you. She's your partner. 
He would need to have incredibly strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire to have a chance. So it's less about people voting for him and more about Dems in Iowa and New Hampshire voting for him.
Firstly, I didn't think I was defending a position, I thought I was having an interesting conversation. Secondly, when you picked out what I thought was the least relevant portion of my response, I didn't have much to say that I thought would be interesting or very relevant to the conversation at large. So I made a joke, instead.  What was I supposed to do, ask you to respond to a different portion of my comment? Wouldn't have been a big deal at all, but apparently you were perceiving this entire conversation as some sort of adversarial debate, even though I alluded to this being an interesting conversation and even complemented your writing. So that's on you. Whatever, I'm done.
It was a 3 second clip repeated a bunch of times. Cars don't always move.The blinking blue light has a regular frequency when you adjust for the fact that it's a short clip repeated, and can be explained by the same as the red light which is blinking - a light on top of a tall structure to warn planes.
Allow me to quote you, Catnip. I mean, you never asked for Shadow's permission when you quoted him earlier in this thread, but for the sake of etiquette. Humor me on the formality. 
You play Dota too?  Who is your favorite hero? Looking forward to playing it sometime because my pc broke. I once set μ's as my IGN and everyone thought I was taking statistics.

...on a shit ton of land.I agree with you about the house.  Something about hearing the rain hit the roof/walls, feeling the wind shake it a bit, even sensing the heat and cold makes it feel more real than having a home with thick outside-shielding walls and windows.
&gt;Barely over 50%, which means nothing when there are 6 times as many of them.52.4% actually. I personally don't think it's fair to use per-capita as most people aren't going to commit a hate crime. So it's using the fact that America is predominately white to gain a statistical advantage and basically paint a different picture.Let me ask you another question, and please be honest. If per-capita made white people look worse, would you use it? 
&gt;...as a percentage of their income.This is a key qualifier. Somebody worth 50k would need to give $500 to equal 1% which is much more likely than Bill Gates for instance who would need to give ~$8,000,000,000 to give the same percentage.(PS: Gates gives more than anyone to charity so this might be a poor choice to use as an example but still...)
Yes, Korea is better right now. But that doesn't mean they will be forever. That doesn't mean Froggen, who obviously is taking the challenge of creating a world class team without any Koreans can't be successful.
I'm very happy with the vibration alarm my Surge has, it wakes me up every time just fine. But the way the app represents the sleep data, is terrible and has way too little detail.
Especially since they changed the rules to where you can't leave the festival once you go in. I remember the first year you could leave and go to a bar or restaurant and come back in no problem.
&gt;Maybe you are. if your aim isn't very good a little RNG can be a helping hand. but my aim is good. really good. I have been accused of hacking twice today. and let me tell you, standing still makes a difference. Try it.You were clearly talking down to this guy, and then you went on boasting about how your aim is good, really good. If your aim was really good, it would easily carry you out of Nova.
Today I took out new toys for my daughter and they had farm animals on them, so naturally I sang "old McDonald had a farm" she started sobbing!!! She stopped as soon as I quit singing that song, any other song was fine but not old McDonald.I confess I thought it was hilarious so I did it multiple times to see if she still cried....she did every time. 
Which is why I ALSO stated this in the main post. I said the CC immunity in because it seems he can get cced in MID-AIR. Which just makes no sense. People keep comparing Hou yi's leap to neith's backfip because they both can't go over walls but can go over player made deployables, and I'm just wondering why neith got the better end of the bargain
I was at a show with a similar situation, there to see a friend's band and check out the other acts. Show time was 9pm and I had little else to do that evening so I was there at 8:30, grabbed a beverage and found myself a good spot. New sound guy at the venue was having a hell of a time getting everything going so they were just finishing up line checks at about 5 past. Then the band leaves the stage to "get ready" for 10 minutes. Already 15 minutes into their set time they're finally starting up. Standard four band bill usually means 40-45 minute sets with 10-15 minute change overs. These guys started 15 minutes late and played a 65 minute set. When they finished they took their time breaking down what little wasn't backline, and 3/5 of the band took their gear and left during the middle of the next band's set. Wasn't even on the bill and I was pissed at these guys.

Not sure if it was in the books, but Renly could have solidified his claim by having the High Septon (who seems very corruptible) denounce Stannis on religious grounds.  Although that would have opened Renly up to accusations about his being gay.  (Not sure if the anti-gay sentiment in Westeros is political, cultural, or religious though)
It's exactly ethnocentric to judge another culture based on your own culture.... That's literally the definition of the word. Doesn't mean you don't do it. Just that it's not a neutral perspective. 
Googling "angelic script" gave me this page: http://images.frompo.com/i/hebrew-angelic-script which has lots of similar looking characters but none all matching one set.
If you're always willing to have sex when you're home, like you say you are, I think it's completely reasonable to ask him not to choose porn over you. 
Oh this is bs. Throughout and post season 4 Phi Phi was literally harping on at Sharon for these 'party city' looks and calling that out as a negative thing. And since then her instagram has been plastered with cosplay and novelty looks, I think that alot of time has passed and it's easy to forget how annoying she was, but this just brings it all back, she's the biggest hypocrite as well as the most irritating.EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lILJsvFISYgI don't think you guys read the 'post season 4' part of my comment, this video shows she's clearly grown and changed with her attitude to Sharon's looks since then, maybe reading an instagram post doesn't exactly mean someone has changed either.
I am going with mayweather since he is so hated despite his talent. He also knows how to sell tickets. But yea I hope he wins just so I see so many people get disappointed.Even if he was to win people would either say it is because pacquiao is past his prime or because the fight was rigged.
Not in the game, but I've seen real-life replays of it, yeah. I see what you mean.&gt;Also, the laws of the game require a goalkeeper.Interesting. I did not know that.Thanks again for answering my questions. Like I said, I'm pretty ignorant of the sport, so I figured this was the thread in which to ask them.
It takes a brave corps director to be able to stand in front of the corps and tell them shirts are now mandated. There hasn't been talk about it where I'm from, and I hope it doesn't spread. I'm okay with shirts being mandated for meals, inside, and at ensemble when it's known that a lot of people are coming to watch. Other than that, no thank you.
*Hugs*Hope you pull through and stay on your meds.Many of my friends are HIV+. At least one has AIDs but is taking his medicine and the viral load is fairly low.

Have you had a liver issue or transplant? If the answer is NO, then my post asking for help from "Non-Experts" who have is why this type of forum exists!! So let's hear your extremely educated response! 
No, this is a Danish experimental band, but their stuff is really interesting. THe album was released independently and then picked up by a label so it went dark again, but it's something to look out for
[Darby O'Gill and the Little People.](http://jimlanescinedrome.blogspot.com/2013/04/luck-of-irish-darby-ogill-and-little_29.html)And yes, it's Disney.
So the U.S. drops extra large condoms labeled as medium. How would they know if the Soviets instead interpreted it as the U.S. calling the Soviets penises large, therefore giving them a bigger boost in their moral.
When we took the standardized test in elementary school I scored super low in reading comprehension. My teacher thought that was weird and looked at my test results. Turns out I answered every answer completely but in short, concise sentences which wasn't want they wanted. They wanted page long essays. I still sucked at fluffing papers my senior year of college. 
I get calls from accident claims asking if I have had a road accident within the last 3 years.  I tell a different story each time. Once I got decapitated. 
MAN! I haven't had cooked (whether baked or fried) bologna since I was a poor kid in the trailer park. You're giving me nostalgia overload right now. I need to try this!
Then again, if you're soliciting advice from strangers on the internet for a major life decision, might as well make sure you get a lot of opinions I guess.
So something I discovered was that a VV will actually have a hard time adjusting to the resistance of a Ti wire, since as it heats up the resistance fluctuates. While pumping out a consistent voltage will prolong the life of the cartridge. I talked with customer support and this how I discovered this. 
My current teammate has developed arthritis, I don't know if it's from clawing or lifting, but I know he's talked about how he can't claw anymore as it physically hurts him. 
I think if Lebron gets one Cleveland he's in the conversation since he seems like the clear cut best player since MJ and soon the majority of ppl would have watched Lebron and not Mike. I think Duncan has less of a shot due to his peak but in 20 years where ppl look back at Duncan's resume they might give him the Bill Russel / Kareem treatment.The 3 finals losses from Lebron I'd a silly argument. For some reason he gets the boxing treatment in the NBA
This is me lol. If I was the other guy though, it wouldn't be a turn off. Although, if we've been together for a while, I will probably ask him to live with me.
1. on passion https://vimeo.com/859272822. depends on what type of shit you're willing to deal with. Personal example: I got a masters degree in a psychotherapy because i was passionate about how people functioned. I'm currently having second thoughts because of the following things: Antiquated government regulations for business and practice, dismal pay, almost a tumbler-esque SJW liberal groupthink in the industry. Not the shit I'm willing to put up with for a median income of 43,000(us) no matter how many people i help3. Good start. Something I missed out on while studying myself. Left college without a network or even an internship. I'm paying for it as we speak.Edit: formatting
&gt;In reality I don't think it's right to ban all GMOsThen why are you voting to ban them? GMOs are a tool, not a corporation. Banning them sends a very bad message, especially when we are going to rely on GMOs-- particularly salt tolerant and drought resistant varieties-- when climate change starts to hit us in full force.The best analogous situation I can think of would be banning drug synthesis to stick it to big pharma. Suddenly we can't make any of the drugs that bring a lot of good to this world: aspirin, insulin, lipitor, etc. Yeah, it might hurt pharma a bit... but does it help us? Are we better off isolating salicylic acid from willows?The measure is spiteful: it hurts local farmers with the hope of hurting corporations. Monsanto and Dupont can go to hell, we agree on that point. But this is not the right approach to reduce their influence.
I am bushed.  Such a long long long day.  I am swamped with work, trying to catch up with late reports at school, and I am just trying to keep swimming...right now it feels like I am not moving and starting to sink   :(
Yeah, I've felt similar for the past 9 years. It's a double-edged sword: it's nice to be content alone often, but sucks when you want friendship. Stay strong. You're totally not alone. &lt;3

I could totally agree to that if and only if the acid/panic clean chance would be 100%. When 50% is good enough the situation is not so desperate that you couldn't go without it. If you need that acid/panic removed 100% right now to not die, it still does not help. 
It's not wrong. But that means you're against all DLC no matter what. And that means after a game is released the developers have no incentive to add content.
i'm not being a dick. your original question is phrased so broadly as to be unanswerable. this is why i asked focusing questions in response.there are a shitload of synths inside FL studio. it depends on your version # and edition you got. the easiest one if you want to learn how to make your own sounds is probably 3x osc. if you just want to jam immediately use fl keys. the best one bundled with FLS is probably sytrus.most people get 3rd party synths like massive, sylenth, nexus, omnisphere, or any number of solutions. you might try googling "synthesizer VSTs" to see if there are any that jump out as promising to you.lastly, i think you should begin to understand why questions like "how do i add synths or chords to my beats?" are frowned upon. you should have googled that. even in the "no stupid questions" thread, it is selfish to ask us to hand you information that is readily available. you will not make good music without a personal drive to learn.
It's different for "professional programs" (law, med, dentistry, pharmacy, arguably business).  Those programs are very rarely funded, and generally have very good employment prospects.  Research programs (getting a MA or PhD in whatever discipline) are the classic "grad school", and it's almost always a bad idea to pay for those.
You're an idiot. A tiny whiff of smoke is enough to set off an asthmatic reaction. Especially with the shit that is put into cigarettes to make them stronger (more addictive). Smoking inside the house, if you have kids, is irresponsible and mean spirited. Smoke lingers, and even when the smoke is gone the smell is still prominent which can also set off a reaction.If your kid doesn't already have breathing issues, if you smoke in the house (even if he isn't around or you "blow towards a window") you're making it a lot more likely he'll develop it. If you want to be irresponsible with your own body, go do it outside in the backyard or something. Stop being a shit parent/sibling/uncle/aunt/etc...
So, obviously not actually home games. Ten more days I think?Edit to add the obligatory "worst possible place to ever have to play a home game." Fucking hell. It's gonna hurt to play there as the "home team." 
Unless that diagnosis was given to you by a qualified physician, please please please do not jump to conclusions.  I understand where you are coming from, and the period of not knowing the diagnosis is the scariest part.  See an endodontist, if you have not already.  
Looking at the UHC calendar just a few minutes ago (at 8:05 EST)and I see a game that says FFA/To2/To3/To4. I think this is a red flag because it could mean it's voted team size. Or it could mean that there are different team sizes in the game. For obvious reasons, you cant have a solo and a To4 in one game. Just the host trying to attract the people with no friends and the people with friends.
I've noticed in some places I've lived (near the beach), and not others. I wonder if there is some sort of difference in taste buds or taste training like a chef would have.

Oh god, that sounds HORRIBLE. BF2 has a bug like that; if you were flying a jet and you were a typing a message quickly and it ended with an E, pressing enter would eject you from the jet and send you flying to your death. SO FRUSTRATING.
I had one of those moments as well. I said hello to an old woman as I walked down the street. She stopped and stared at me for a second and then screamed "Don't you say hi to old ladies you god damn bastard!" She was a lovely thing
Because you know you have to be "OBSESSED" to look decent...as cheesy as that saying is, it's perfect here: "Obsessed' is a word the lazy use to describe the dedicated."
Stop reading.  Download a sound bank and start deconstructing synths.  You'll learn way faster doing this.  Who gives a fuck what the author of some book thinks the best way to define an LFO is?  Turns knobs and let your ears define the parameters of your synth.  Did you read a book on how to ride a bike before you started?  Books and definitions are for people who are afraid to make mistakes.  Artists embrace mistakes and create masterpiece out of them.The guys writing book on how to make good music are the one's who weren't good enough to actually make good music
I read this message earlier but I didn't know it was you.I should have known, there was only one person who continuously brought up the election of May 7th.
She jerks you until your hard, then rolls the condom on and continues to jerk you with the condom on. When your hard, with the condom on, she jumps on you. 
Yeah, that made no sense whatsoever. It makes the video feel like "Every 3D Zelda game versus the godlike LttP". He included footage of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker and made little jabs at them IIRC.And yeah, Mario 64 controls may not be ideal (especially on the N64 with that god awful control stick) but they're not game-breaking. For godsakes, children played and beat it no problem.

Nah, you weren't joking. You were serious until you saw how much you got downvoted then decided to take it back and play it off as a joke. Lol, nice one. 
That's amazing.  Of course he would be running for congress as basically the candidate equivalent of a sovereign citizen.  And list smart meters and chemtrails as his top priorities... 
I didn't mean swatting hasn't occurred in my other post, only that there was a fake story that circulated about a teen being sentenced to 25 yrs for doing it.
It's not inherently sexual, there's nothing wrong with it. Some animals feed their kids by chewing their food for them, there are even theories our enjoyment of lip contact sorta comes from the same place.
I haven't looked at Minecraft yet but isn't there supposed to be a female character being added? At their age range it does seem to be lacking a bit for decent playable female characters. I was pretty impressed with the job they did with Lara in the Tomb Raider reboot but nooo way they're playing that anytime soon! Aurora from Child of Light is pretty good and there are quite a few of the Skylanders characters that are pretty decent, I like the undead Roller Derby girl personally. I'll probably buy Korra in the morning. Be a nice surprise when they get home from school. Thanks again for your replies.

I don't think we've got any information about the restrictions of playing with friends, only verifications that we WILL be able to play with them.Not sure if any other info exists yet.
Sorry, I should have thought of that.  I know that some Costco stores sell Sticky Toffee Pudding (from the Sticky Toffee Pudding company in Austin, TX).  But not my Costco.  If I want that stuff (and I always do) I have to go to Whole Foods ... The opposite of Costco.All that to say ... I feel your pain!
Kids can write the exams at 12 but cannot get their PAL until age 18. They can get a minor's permit at 16 where they can carry their parent's firearms. The hunter safety course can be taught at 12 and that is the year kids can get their own tags and hunt. It is very common for kids to write both at the same time as they are very similar in content. I am quite interested in doing a course in the Kindersely area as I've heard from a few people there is a lot of interest.

No idea, but the general consensus is to do testing, take what works, drop the rest. Nobody tells you to believe stuff that doesn't fit into your experiences, the opposite is true.
Well... yes. You can waive your 5th Amendment rights (potentially) by speaking to police officers without the guidance of legal counsel. But that's not what I mean. I think LEO's (and possibly others) have a special sort of clause about questioning when it's internal. If Internal Affairs  (or whomever) is investigating you, you can't "plead the fifth" and not answer their questions about how you conducted yourself on the job. I think the flip side is that the information they may obtain can't be used against you for criminal proceedings - you may get demoted or suspended or whatever, but they're not allowed to turn that info over to prosecutors  (they have to collect their evidence on their own). Someone who knows more about this should probably elaborate/clarify. 
Burying your head in the sand is **not** going to make the issue go away.   Also using dismissive remarks like "young activists" shows your ignorance and/or strong bias.  These are real issues and we all need to look at and clean our own backyard before we go and judge other neighbours.

I've always wondered what temperature you guys vape at to get your AVB so golden. It looks so much more potent than my own (and probably is) because I vape the shit outta my herb and I need way more than a gram of AVB to get an effect. We're all getting high one way another but I'm just a little curious about the mystical golden AVB and its potency. More so how does your AVB compare to my almost black AVB lol.
Sooo many things... Some people are not aware that the sun is bigger than the earth. Some people don't know that the sun is a star. When it comes to science, so many people are not aware of really basic things that you and I would find important to know even if we don't use that knowledge in everyday life.Another funny one is when people say we come from monkeys, or more precisely from chimpanzees.

I just tell those people that 'theory' applies to Darwin's proposed explanation of the mechanism that drives evolution, not whether or not it happened. There's overwhelming fossil evidence that it has, and no serious scientific debate to the contrary.
I've been to a lot of these protests, and it seems that black men are much more clearly and obviously seen by police as 'big scary savages/criminals', whereas women are not.I have seen some protests for trans women of color being killed. This is a good point, though. 
I agree - I feel that the cheat sheet isn't as much for reference or facts during the exam, than it is for helping you summarize the information and drill it into your mind while actually preparing the cheat sheet. However, i think my cheat sheet for the final exam was a lot more useful than it was for the midterm. I didn't fill it up with facts I remembered anyway, but rather only the things that I had actual difficulty remembering, or had the possibility of forgetting while working under time pressure (like those common phenotype ratios for specific genetic crosses). I LOVED everything ecology, haha, and evolution/phylogenies as well. It just seems to naturally sink into me. I didn't do well on the second midterm that focused on genetics, which brought my grade down... But from that, I knew what I had to focus on for the final (paid extra attention to genetics... Khan Academy bio videos EXTREMELY helpful). My prof was Pollock.

You need legendary or exotic gear to get higher :) Your best bet is probably running Strikes and saving up Vanguard Marks until you can buy a piece of legendary gear from the tower vendor. That should take you to upwards of 25-26, and you're more or less good to go on the Vault! (a lot of people will say you need to be higher level, but if you can handle yourself in the game, 26 is fine for the raid - I did my first at 25!)Also, if you're on XBone, feel free to add me if you ever need a hand in the raid - I love to show people the ropes! GT is the same as username :)
Since it is written in thai, im going to guess its not a known group and that there is no version of the doujin online.And it looks like a quite long story, considering how thick is the book.
I'd say that is most likely not your order from DTRH. I just ordered from him a couple weeks ago and, without divulging too much about his stealth, I'll just say that there's no way you would have to sign for what you will receive from him.
Jarlial tries his best to dodge the halberd blade but he is too close, the blade swipes left and digs into his thigh. He rolls with the blow and dashes left. He slows down to heal his leg. Sabre drawn ready for another attack.
He's a senator.  Senators almost never have the executive skills you need to be president, and every ~~president~~ senator who has gone straight to the presidency has been bad at the job.  He's a socialist, so even if by some miracle a 75 year old senator was a good executive, almost everything he'd push for would be a disaster.
Visas currently for Ukraine are still somewhat limited, I support giving Ukrainians work visas where necessary, but the current situation creates a lot of people who will illegally work in the EU and won't pay taxes which I believe is bad.
&gt; wrong thing very, very easy.I wonder what percentage of people back then actually followed the advice from MS that everything should be COM/DCOM written in VB or C++ and ASP should only ever be glue for these compiled bits of business logic.When the `.` bug exposed everyones code, had a look at microsoft.com, there was not one single line of ASP logic on there.&gt;  culture than their code.Yeah, all combined no doubt, but the site did become pretty unstable.
That stuff is great too but I was really talking about more basic CCW stuff. How to clear jams, how to reload, how to draw properly, Tueller drill, point shooting, etc. Those more advanced skills are great to know, but the average CCW is probably never going to have to clear a building or make it through an extended fireright.
Do you know how I can prepare for pre and post shipment?There doesn't seem to be a site that is clear and states everything that I'd need.  For example, what documents need to be filed before the product ships.  What documents need to be filed once the shipment arrives.Thanks!
I like it too for some reason, it's on a "Show me your genitals," level of bad, like it's intentionally shitty.Watching it again, this has to be a joke, the socks and everything, this can't be real. 
My idea of a dream rig has changed so many times over the years... Right now it's probably a Mayones 8 string into an axefx. Seems kinda boring, but I like simplicity.
I agree, the few times that I've read the Spartan Daily I've seen all of the things you've mentioned. Then again it is a campus paper, and often actual news outlets are just as bad.I haven't read any other school papers so I can't really give an opinion there.
Your broker will be stepping in and getting involved with the earnest money released.Absolutely get your own attorney to represent you at this point. I'm guessing as soon as the buyer's attorney gets notice from your attorney that he can't push you around any longer, all these "title" problems will clear up quickly. After seeing the assholery presented here, your attorney will likely be rather fired up and happy to write a Demand letter. Good attorneys LOVE bitch-slapping scumbag attorneys around!
Thank you. Hey, it might work out and ill have egg on my face. But theres just something to what the spurs have done with the whole culture and sum greater than parts thing.

Thanks! So I rendered it with the default scanline renderer, [this](http://i.imgur.com/Vy09R0x.jpg) was the result straight out of Max. I used two lights, one skylight for the soft shadows/ambient occlusion and one orange target direct light, with shadows enabled, for the sunlight.  I edited the image in After Effects (don't ask why), also I rendered a [zdepth pass](http://i.imgur.com/l5Sf4c6.jpg) which allowed me to add fog/atmosphere into the scene. I then tweaked the colours and added some glow.
As everyone else is saying, 2 weeks is minimum, but a little more is appreciated, especially if you're in the middle of a project. My advice is to try to dump as little work as possible in your boss's lap. 
This guy is 100% right, it is in the provincial park (bow valley park) and Camping fees are too high, most places have gone to $28-$31 a night. I have spent my whole 36 years in this area and this part of Yam has been a bone in most locals ass since the the 1970's.Where is quarry sits you can not see from the hiway. At one time you could camp by the lake for free but that trail head is now closed. Then some ass when and took out all the hangers that were on the bluffs at yam. now they are taking more of the quarry. This is not right. Get off your lazy butts and see this before its all gone. I would love to have the day off and chain my butt to it to protest, as this are need more protection.  on a said side bar- Fee's are to go up again under the new budget also. 
Horticulturist Ent here Weed wasn't invented.. It's just as it always has been, except with modern day understanding and growing methods we can minimise the growth time and maximise the thc potency,However if you're interested the oldest recorded use of cannabis is 2727 BC from a chinese emperor :)
Please, do not think that all of Android's users are like this. Those people are immature and probably trolling too. I am not brigading, I just browse /r/funny and saw this post (horrible, I know.) Most of us aren't delusional. However, iPhones and Androids are very comparable. Without competition, Apple wouldn't have gotten this far, and frankly neither would have Google. I like both phones and so do many others. I would suggest not commenting on the brigadier's posts because that would make them comment even more. I was just trying to offer my opinion and the point of view of an Android user. However, I now see that you don't care and just want to insult us at any cost.
Thanks, ya'll! I'm excited to see what everyone suggests.Once I'm able to start posting, I know it'll be a challenge to pare my submissions down to just four.
If this kid can shoot as advertised he can start right away for UNC and barring sanctions could be the missing piece they need to go deep into the tournament next year.   He'd be a fool not to go to Chapel Hill.  And I'm not biased at all.  
It's just something that happens, probably insufficient packaging materials to properly protect it.I'm not sure about USPS, I'd assume they have a similar policy, but FedEx and UPS packages are automatically insured for up to $100, more than that can be purchased by the shipper.
I think that you're lucky you even got away from her,. From what I'm seeing and from your descriptions, she's pretty similar to my mom. The whole mocking thing and like being manipulative. I think that for now you should just focus on getting better and being in a better place, a place where you don't really care about her opinions, and they don't affect you, that's when you'll truly know. This is actually something my friend told me and I'm really glad I met her. I still have to live with my nmom. I'm almost 20,  and she's basically trying to force me to be dependent on her, but I'm trying to work my way out. So i think for now, just enjoy yourself and be happy, and get to that place where she doesn't really affect you with her opinions  
Once you get the Zuni bonus, you should use *both* FA and FS. You want as many fetishes as you can get!However, keep in mind that the build you're going for isn't very cohesive. You've got some DoT stuff and some pet stuff. End-game builds focus on one or the other (DoT = Jade, Pet=Carnevil, MoJ, or Tik).Don't feel like you have to follow one of the end-game builds, just keep in mind that you won't progress as far :-)
Nah man, he's projecting. He's the only one who could have stopped this, but he's blaming you to feel better about his own shitty decisions - don't take that personally.
I know exactly what reputable means, and you have given me no reason to think any other LGS is better. They all have people working in them with incorrect information, and always will.
Walked into Selfridges London today just to browse and I was so surprised they had it. Was going to cop a couple supreme and palace tees but as soon as I saw these I knew I would never forgive myself if I didn't get them 
No, there wasn't any soreness involved. And I am squatting twice a week, but lately, I've been having a lot of problems with my form. I do think my form was better today though, but that obviously didn't help. Also, lack of depth is not an issue for me.
I couldn't disagree with you more.  Sure, players lose out on the rabbit hole of super character customization, but there were too many problems with DC creep and OPness in the earlier versions where the goal has and still seems to be "line up around the bad guys and roll dice until they die"I like that you can make a character in 5e in 20 minutes and have a plan for his future.  I like that a DC 20 check is really really difficult at level 1 and still mildly difficult at level 20.  I like that there aren't 25 skills to put points into, maiming everyone not intelligence/skill point powerful from doing things other than combat.I find the simplification and condensation of the rules lend themselves to much more lively role play by everyone, and not just the skill sluts in the party.
i'm sure a lot of people said it out of anger to be honest. Shouldn't take it personal. I was being a douche last night because I was sad the Red Wings season was over. 
Omg... Cluster feeding. I dont miss those days. I would be done the next day! Good thing you made it through the day!My day was 👌. Finished marking and layout gas lines, went to another site that needed 5 houses pinned yesterday but lo and behold *nothing was poured* when we got there. Pump truck was set up, but no concrete.Got home early because we didn't have a quick job to do after, so went to the store with baby and SO to get some food. SO did something to his back, so he's hobbling around. I played with son, he did dishes and dinner, I ran around with him after dinner, washed him up, brushed his teeth, chased him around the apartment trying to get his PJ's on, got them on and sung lullabies and put him to bed.Now I'm just enjoying quiet time and about to step out for fresh air on the back porch!
I do not think I will do the Kindgra. The Gyarados HGSS is fairly worn. The holo art is fine but it is mainly just those darn creases. Here are pictures: http://imgur.com/a/Nyhgn. If you are okay with non-NM, would you trade him for shadowless Poliwrath?
That can be one way of looking at it, but Caleb would most likely make people FIND pages for resources they want. I heard gary was remaking the library, so he may have a page copying setup included.
You can get accustomed to the sensation of moving around in a 3D computerized environment, though. He seems to watch Arin play games just fine, so I think a lot of it really is just him not being used to it, and getting disoriented because of that. It's likely something he could work towards
I can definitely see what you mean. Honestly, I can't believe I didn't think to check and see about Saturn comparisons, they are definitely the same ballpark. Looks crisp. I think I'll start putting a little extra in the Framemeister savings per week :)
It's an egg vs chicken scenario for me.  If we vote third party before our voting system is reformed, the R/D candidate we like least is more likely to win.  However, if we always vote R/D, then the R/D candidates have no reason to ever try to reform the voting system.  We have tried the latter option for the last few hundred years, I think it's time to give option A a real chance.
Of course it's their game, but that doesn't mean I have to like it, nor does it mean "it's exactly what gaming needs." I'm not telling them not to make it, I'm just saying I don't have any interest in it or any games *like* it. Maybe I'll eat my words when it comes out and it will be amazing but I dunno.
Most likely buying unbans.Minimum for admitting to xray before the screenshare is 1-2 weeks. It then goes to 4. Then A perm usually. It's really the admins discretion that is dealing with the situation.

I think you had a good concept and some pretty good lines but your flow could use some more improvement. I think this would've benn pretty good if the flow was spot on. Great job though! 
Oops!!  I posted on yesterdays thread instead of todays!I'm still sitting at 12 lbs lost, my goal is 15 lbs a month.Haven't eaten yet today but I do go grocery shopping and get lots of yummy food. I'm making chicken enchiladas tonight for dinner and I'm already salivating just thinking about them!
Sorry, bad wording.Some people transition just because they feel better as the opposite gender - like fixing your clothes being a few sizes too tight. They're not all necessarily suicidal over the smallest triggers.
No, it is not. The Epistle of Paul to the Colossians is the 12th book of the New Testament, written by (according to your religion) the chosen successor of Jesus, in His name, according to His wishes.
Ambassador Class.  +1 for knowing one of the ships patrolling the DMZ when O'Brien got captured.What is the stock top warp cruising speed for USS Voyager (Intrepid class starships)?
The most ideal decision IMO would be 3 movies, 2+ hours each, with the insignificant SOL scenes cut out to keep a consistency in the atmosphere. I don't want Miura to come back to direct HF, if he did, I would ["Drown in my sorrows" **"and die!"**](#shocked)  I think that since Takayuki Hirao is going to be directing God Eater, then Ei Aoki(since he was the director of F/Z and did a great job with it), Takizawa Shinsuke(director of KNK movie 7), or another director of one of the better KNK movies like Obunai Mitsuru should do it. My most ideal choice would be either Aoki or Shinsuke, though.       
I'm relatively new here, but I shall still miss your presence. I always enjoyed having the opinion of someone with the same opinions on a lot of things as I used to have before I converted (albeit much more learned than myself) around to challenge me as I read the conversations here. 
The Keystone pipeline has been built utilizing cathodic protection, where a current is run through the pipe to prevent the formation of a galvanic cell, and therefore corrosion. A failure or misapplication in an active galvanic protection system could result in accelerated wall loss, but that is bordering on wild speculation. 
&gt;Primarily that a towel when you sit down is unlikely to be enough to eliminate health concerns.What other health concerns are you worried about?This is going to sound sarcastic but it isn't: Do you seriously think that seeing naked people causes *distress* to others? How so? Why?

&gt; Oh, please, for the love of Clow Reed, do NOT bring that up. While I don’t think the English dub is the exact spawn of the devil, seeing as it did introduce many to Cardcaptor Sakura, what it did to the original should be classified as straight up murder.I was really confused for a moment there until I realised you were talking about the North American English dub where they changed the opening. I myself watched the Malaysian dub (which had horrendous voice acting but otherwise left the plot alone) and later the Animax Asia English dub (I liked it, but YMMV) (EDIT: Just realised NIS used the Animax dub in their 2014 release), which I still prefer to this day. I don't think I've ever watched CCS subbed, but the dubs I watched were pretty faithful to the original Japanese and was, of course, uncut, so I never had to suffer through Madison Taylor and the censoring.
I hate it so far.  We were robbed of a decent send off and now we get a 10 minute montage of the funeral? I'm really curious about what the 2 hours are for.
There used to be an android app that looked like a tic tac toe game, but when you opened it and pushed "x" 3 times it opened a special private browser. 
&gt; I agree it's a somewhat hyperbolic statement, but I'm ranting here, not writing a paper. It's really not too hyperbolic. These plugins and their counterparts are close enough that most consumers wouldn't know the difference, and the people who would are more than likely listening to artists who actually shell out the money for the analog gear anyway.
Oh no doubt. He has a lot of potential. Just love the ESPN hype. Let's put him down so people think he won't go. They should just realize we are all here to see the hopeful madness of the second pick.
I wear mine on game day whether I'm watching at home or at the pub, quite proudly actually. I had no idea it was such a big deal and you aren't "supposed" to wear it... I also couldn't give a shitting fuck. I'm not going to spend big money on something like a football jersey and then never wear it. Downvote me if you will, but this whole "only around the house or to the gym" sounds like a massive pile of hipster wank. Edit: spelling.
Having been there I have mixed feelings. Service was good not great, food the same, but if I hadn't read all the hype I might have felt better about it.

On Gray Boy, he does actually stay dead for a moment when you kill him, so she could have stolen his power away during that time.I totally agree on her getting started, though.

No, i want a legitimate new source that covers these topics, theres alot of them without any US bias, and yes native american treatement was taught in US schools, im asking for an unbiased source, the source you gave me was blatantly biased and im sure doesnt provide both sides of the story, im still waiting, for an unbiased source.
When I was a freshman in college, I had just moved to a major city from the country. I was in a Subway inside of a little mall and a guy approached me and asked for money to buy a sandwich. Because I was an idiot, I thought to myself "well, a dollar won't get him a sandwich... but $5 will..." and handed him a $5 bill. He thanked me and then left the restaurant.Though looking back on it, I don't know where he went. There was a McDonald's across the hall and I like to think he went there since he could get more for the $5. But I'm not sure. I haven't given money to anyone who asks since though because my innocence was shattered that day realizing that people weren't always honest.
To be fair, if the Ledbetter equal pay rule were applied in this scenario, the underpaid male CEO's would have their pay increased purely based on their gender so that it was commensurate with the pay packages of those female CEO's.This is a perfect example of why pay decisions based on gender alone are such nonsense.  It often results from a very poor understanding of how pay should be based...non-gender based factors, like performance, company size, skills/talents, etc.
"Used: An item that has been used previously. The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended."Can't blame him I guess. Oh well, they look like they're in pretty good shape even with use! SOLD!
Not like he was the first to come up with that idea. There's the Church of Christ, Scientist and the other few churches that were based on copyrighted sacred texts. Hubbard definitely did it best, though.
Dang, sorry you have to deal with those kinds of people! I've generally been met with lust and positive curiosity, and I don't mind that. Mostly because it makes me feel cool, hip, and with it
I'm happier, but that could be mostly due to the new meds.Well that's probably not fair. Things go pretty well actually... the only complaints I have are moderately inane in the grander scheme of things.

I'm not saying winning a ring makes no difference to his legacy, I'm saying it doesn't make enough of an addition to his legacy to separate him from the pack of guys in that conversation. When you've been playing at such a high level for nearly 20 years and have gotten the career accolades and success Duncan has, winning another ring at the end of your career on a smaller role than 90% of his other years just inches your legacy forward.When people are comparing the greats, you need more than just inches to distinguish yourself.
I think Renly was making a deal with Cat when he died by the hand of the ghost (Melisandre/Stannis) and Renly had a lot of soldiers that would have helped Robb keep the trust of his bannermen.The inevitable defeat in the war forced the Boltons' treason, so I guess Stannis kind of indirectly had a hand in it all?
The reason they claimed it was a lie for so long is because they knew the damage it would cause to the membership. They talk about it within the last year due to no longer being able to hid it.Mormons still deny it ever happened and is an antimormon lie on LDS.ORG chat
Oh my god, this. While they can technically survive utilizing only plant proten, i.e. soybean meal as part of a complete feed, it's so much better for them to have insect or even animal protein. Studies have shown the diets of Junglefowl contain up to 50% insect/animal protein. *50%*. Junglefowl being the direct ancestors of domestic chickens. It's sad how misinformed people are.
Could also be preemptively making an excuse for looking sloppy or not up to your perceived standard, like when you say "pardon the mess" when people come over even though you feverishly spent the last 6 hours cleaning. 
Three to keep in mind:The Machine by Marz Brewing, a relatively new brewery (gonna explode with their sour beers), Headwaters from Victory Brewing, which is the closest thing I've found (in terms of consistency and hop bite) and an exceptional pale ale as is, and Charlatan from Mercenary Brewing is another one that mirrors it well.Some say Daisy Cutter from Half Acre, but I have yet to try that one.
CBD is a completed different molecule all together (legal federally), which produces different metabolites that are not included on standard drug tests. Though theoretically it is possible to test for them, but since CBD is legal there should be no trouble.
Last week I was in denial, then angry... I've passed through the five stages of grief and I'm at acceptance now.  I figure I'll watch through the end of the season and see what happens next year.  Twelve years is a long time to stay committed to a show, though.
Is this the part where I confess to spending a good few minutes at the weekend trying to find the penalty spot? (it was a god awful pitch with several bare patches in the box an very little paint) In my defence, we were winning 5-1... *whistles innocently*Also, there's a sweet factory next to my training ground. I defy anyone to remain focused when the air smells like waffles.
nah, we're done for the map. I have no motivation to rebuild here purely because of how little powers there were/are. Thanks for the offer though. Good luck
It's pretty bad.  I worked with a chick who took some kind of math class for art students. Her final was a shitty comic.She doesn't know what an "average" is or how to find it.
Super armor is a property of an attack that makes you more resistant to staggering while it's happening. For example charge attacks for players, a lot of enemies have it in on attacks.
Til. A quick search finds only a third of buses are CNG, the rest are diesel. Brisbane transport have done a good job making it appear as though they are clean and green on pure gas, turns out it's just hot air...
You are working in a rep range you have never trained before. 1RM calculators and estimates based on different rep ranges are bogus. If you want a good 1RM, then train it. Story time: Based my percentages for higher reps on a 1RM calculator. Surprise, couldn't do it. I think it was a gruelling 275 lbs. that I couldn't get up. I normally did a 5x5 routine and thought it would transfer over better to 1RM. Just because your muscles dont exhaust at 4 reps with less weight, doesn't mean you can recruit your nerves and flex and stay stable enough to lift a heavier weight safely. This really bothered me so I switched to Bulgarian style. In 4 month I squatted 365 lbs. But my 5 RM barely changed ~295. It's because I stopped training 5 RM's and only focused on 1 RM. Does that make sense? You are not magically going too to get better at a specific skill (1 RM squat) by training your 5 RM squat. And yes everything will affct you, including mental state and sleep.
I understand her side, but I also feel bad for him. I don't condemn her for just wanting to get where she's going, but rejection still stings even if it's just a photograph.I'd like to think if I was some sort of celebrity I would grin and bare it to make someone smile over a signature. But I don't live that life so it's not fair of me to say. Watson was basically stalked the second she turned 18. It was creepy. 
A brief lapse of judgement does not mean a job was done poorly.  That's like saying Michael Jordan played poorly because he threw the ball out of bounds one time.
Ultimately you have to figure that out for yourself and don't rush it.  Otherwise you may end up regretting what you get later.  I've got two half-sleeves that took forever to complete because I wanted to make absolutely sure I wouldn't second guess them later in life. I had the design for my first tattoo for over a year before I had the work done.  15 years later and I still love it.
see, I stopped playing for a while after the third generation. I played 1,2 and 3 basically at launch, then the new x/y ones. Crystal's what cemented the series for me though (that and fucking eevee man. 2cute) Emerald did a good job reinforcing it.
Uh, before you order a cooler you should be sure it fits in your case. If you have an ATX case you should be okay, but I think some mATX cases are too small to fit it. Check on PCPartPicker's compatibility to see if they're compatible just to be sure. It's a highly-rated cooler, efficient and quiet for the price. I think you'll definitely see your temperatures drop considerably. =)
You should also dedicate an extra queen to spend all of her energy on injecting your macro hatch to make full use of it. Super useful when you're building lots of cheap units like zerglings and drones.
Top ranged? Probably IM, iceman, and magneto?Silver Surfer movement build is kind of dashy...Or you can play melee nova, he's moving all over the damn screen.
I hate saying this but if you're buzzed or drunk enough to remember the previous night when you said yes to a sober person. It is not rape. It may have been a mistake but too many people will call rape and ruin a person's life because they got drunk and were ashamed of their actions. I know I'll get down voted to hell for this but it's true.  
Same goes for almost any game mechanics. Patents need to go, since the dawn of time humans have copied methods and reiterated upon them to make them better. The only purpose patents serve is greed as well as stagnating human ingenuity and development.

They are wary of bitcoin the currency because acceptance of that would take away a lot of their privileges. It's purely political.Which is great, because it will impose a financial cost on their political prejudices once bitcoin succeeds anyway.

Drivers who THINK they are fast, but are really not. I have absolutely no problem with someone passing me and continuing on. I hate it when someone works hard to pass me, then drives slower than I was going.

Hey, gamers of /r/anime, what have y'all been playing this past week? Come talk about whatever you've been playing, be it video games, card games, board games, or whatever.I just got Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate early in the week, so I've been playing a decent amount of that. I've fallen in love with the Charge Blade and I just got to the first Urgent Quest, where I have to hunt the Kecha Wacha.Other than that, I got the Virtual Console of the original Punch-Out on my 3DS last weekend and I've gotten as far as Soda Popinski in the World Circuit.(Also, I got a few people last week, anyone who plays League on NA, leave your summoners if you want to play with me and possibly a few other Redditors after I get home from college next week)
That's... actually a really good question! I'd never thought of that aspect for it. I'm going to steal that line of logic for future use, if you don't mind tremendously. 
As an owner of both thats going to end up making the Xbox the winner to me. We all know what happens when one console has a demanding lead over the other. The leader stops investing and the loser invests a shit ton to try and catch up. I do personally enjoy the Xbox console more so it getting the love it deserves makes me happy. Who really gives a shit about who outsells who. Both consoles are selling extremely well in an ever expanding market. 
I'm not worrying about it in terms of alignment so much as just mentioning the alignment, I figure it's better i do  that than leave it out.As far as my character goes, he saw him crush a statue, who was a person, out of the way after a harrowing encounter to unblock a trapdoor. That definitely upset me and altered how I feel about him, but I didn't confront him then and decided to let it go because I realize our overall mission is far more important.That being said, if I learn that wasn't a one time thing, there will be action at the very least.
The Keeper robes are indeed from the last one in EDL. The medium is in the Hissing Wastes at the armor merchant in the Canyon. As for the Heavy, its a random chest drop and the armor itself is only tier two instead of tier three like the Light and Medium.
I don't watch american Football at all, in fact it's rare that I watch any sporting events in general. It may be more ignorance on my part that I am aware of Cricket lasting for an extremely long time, longer than most sporting events.
I haven't gone there regularly for a couple years. What I do now is every month or two, show the top posts from the last month and browse them to see if there was anything interesting.
East Asian concepts of filial piety and absolute respect for authority create a cultural environment that is incredibly hospitable for abusive parents/spouses. There's also the communist revolution/civil war that happened in China/Taiwan and created a generation of emotionally stunted people and paranoia. Then there's also the fact that East Asia was heavily agricultural and the way rice grows means that you need everyone to work together without question. This system leads to low value for individuality, and high value on the needs of the whole group. It also explains why Asian parents are extremely prone to grooming their kids for college a certain way just because everyone else is doing it. There's a consistent formula for farming/weather, the thought pattern carried over to everything else. 
Yeah, I feel like the era of great designers isn't over, but the big production companies in Japan make so many anti-gamer choices that it's ruining creativity.   I honestly can't believe some of the choices that Konami has made in their gaming department when it comes to Kojima.  It's mind boggling. But if you think about their other markets (Arcade, gyms, etc.) they probably don't even care.  
You could put engines on them so you don't get tired! And maybe have them going around a track to make it better for spectators! And what about going through the night too to make it more challenging?
Do you guys already have the game updated to 0.17? I was thinking that the notes for changes haven't been uploaded because the update has yet to be released.

But as far as I know the cap looks to be for Pelikan, and it looks like it may possibly be brown or red?I only know l--------l so much about Pelikan and their products however :/, but at least it's a start.
Ah thanks so much for checking. I also heard that HKID is enough to qualify for public hospitals. Will get it confirmed. I also need to confirm the insurance amount that I may get from work to finalize  upon it.
Oh my god I almost keeled over laughing.I'm finishing up my PhD in the next year or so and this is pretty much exactly how I feel in that situation - and I'm getting a head start on villainhood, as I've called the ones who work for me my "minions" for years.
Eh, I get your point, but I'm just saying that I have done well despite teachers probably saying things like this about me, and even if they think their bias isn't apparent, kids can tell how someone feels about them. Young kids have a way of internalizing the perceptions of adults and making such judgements on them can actually really damage them.
&gt;which is 100% false. Can we at least start there? Yes, we can start there.  I haven't been able to recreate the laymen bullshit google searches that got me there, but you are right.  I can promise you I didn't utilize any sketchy sites but I must have misinterpreted the stats.  I apologize.[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-rape_movement) is an article that encompasses my views on the subject, hopefully more usefully than my original attempt.  I'm not anti-feminist, I'm just anti-good old days mentality.  Exactly what are the drivers precluding female college students reporting sexual assault?  I'm genuinely interested?
I fear my AK-47 are sold out. I can offer you AKM, but in limited amounts, 50 thousand maximum, simply because we do not have more. Thank you very much for your kind offer, but I fear I do not know what am I fighting yet.[M] Maldives 500,000 AK-47s. WHAT?
He isn't far right. He isn't calling for a ban on abortion or making gay marriage illegal again. He is just making the tough calls to start digging out of a hole.  You can't just move the goal posts on what far right means because you don't happen to like the man for cutting finding from some programs you favor.  Programs that have been a huge monetary drain for a long time. Why do you think  Madigan isn't putting up a fuss? Because he knows it has to be done and he is happy to let a republican take the flack from people like you for getting it done.  The hyperbole is over the top when you put it in those terms.
That might be incorrect. Just use http://www.wiibackupmanager.co.uk/It'll create the necessary folder and place it in the correct way for you.Be sure to use the /r/wiihacks sticky post. It has lots of useful information and up to date-ish tutorials.
Thanks for the advice! Like I said I don't have much experience with performance cars so I wasn't sure. I don't have any qualms about it if thats what needs to be done, just needed advice.
Also, I'm recovering from major surgery, but my health is a bit on the poor side, so I'm taking much longer to recover than I should have. Therefore, if I was about to have to go fight this and take all kind of time to do so, I'd like to know in advance.
It is were the blue tabs should be.  if you still can find them send a picture, and I can point them out. The 960 comes standard with at least one HDMI port. 
Seeing mornings without a throbbing headache is nice... So I really enjoy going to get breakfast at a waterfront cafe. That being said, if I'm hung over I'd still go to that cafe, just two hours later and with better stories. 
Why do I have a feeling its more the teenage girls than boys acting this way?  I hate kids these days and I blame the shitbag parents of my generation that have raised them to be shitbags themselves.  
It's funny to me, I've been arguing with two people mainly about this. Both saying he should be fired because it wasn't professional, classy, etc. And when I look at comments to see if I'm dealing with trolls, I see one has literal rape jokes. The other hangs out on fat people hate like I hang out here on game day. People are hypocritical idiots. 
welcome to league bro wanted to quite lol cuz he lost his 11. promo to 1 afk and one jarvanorianna botlane lol he was mad so much until i carried him &lt;:
I've been a part of this. My group moderator asked what my greater power was. I told him it was me. I have free will, I am witness to the consequences of the decisions I make. I had made it clear that I chose to make poor decisions in the past and wanted to change on my own terms. It was still insisted that I needed God to help guide me.
Since you're new: "thrust" is how much force the engine puts out when it's running. "Delta-V" is what you need a lot of to get to Mun. Delta in mathspeak means change, and v stands for velocity. To make a craft that can change it's velocity by lots and lots, it helps to have rocket stages and to minimize the non-fuel mass of the upper stages.Once you're in orbit it's generally better to have a lightweight puny engine that can run for a long time than a heavy powerful one that uses up all its fuel in 2 seconds. This is because it takes work to carry a big heavy engine around.The other thing to look at is the Vacuum ISP for the engines. This is essentially their fuel efficiency. High ISP engines give their exhaust lots of velocity which (due to conservation of momentum) means your spacecraft gets lots of velocity.
227 - A friend told me that he (a templar) couldn't kill Oak in normal. Confused why, I headed out with him to Oak's camp and saw him repeatedly die. After a few more attempts we found out that he took the talent that allowed you to get 1 extra totem but caused you to not deal damage with any other ability. I was laughing really hard.
Hell fucking no. He dump me for one girl, broke up with her for me, and while we were back together we planned to go overseas to work (we both were going to do it anyway, just agreed on the same place). During this he was talking to her the entire time and ended up bringing her overseas to work where we had organised to work. I could see her bedroom form mine. Needless to say, they are together now. 
Oh my bad on the Fletcher thing. I thought he had left but when I checked whoscored to see who United had available in that position he was still listed. You're also right about Mata not being a natural CM though he has appeared there 10 times this season according to whoscored and Fellaini has appeared there 14 times this season based on the same source. That still leaves Herrera, Di Maria, and Blind.Maybe it's not the deepest position at United but I still believe them to have more depth there than out wide. 
&gt;One thing to consider is that there's probably an element of racism in this, as it's been well-documented that memberships in "Patriot Groups" absolutely skyrocketed[1] after Obama was elected president.I think you're mistaking partisanship with racism. If Obama was white the same thing would have happened. The far right had a similar reaction to Clinton's election and the left did basically the same with Bush.

I don't know how you could think it's expensive. It's a ridiculously powerful synth, with a 50+GB sample library, 10,000 patches and a ridiculously awesome synth, effects, modulation, envelope engine.I'm used to paying $1000+ for string libraries (LASS, symphobia, adagio, etc.), so Omnisphere always seemed like a steal to me. Hell, Serum or Diva are half the price and don't offer even 1/10th the features.EDIT: Realized I'm on a forum where most people probably have no money. Apologies.
Ghostery is spyware. I recommend uBlock, Disconnect, and https-everywhere for privacy and security that won't cost functionality. If you can tolerate mysterious site failures, toy with NoScript.
I got very bored with it. I played it when it first came out hoping it would be something like TW. As far as the gameplay goes it never felt very strategic in that it really ended up with everyone just piling onto everyone else in a massive blob with the kitted out commanders dueling in the center.There were capture points to make it strategic, but this never really mattered as if you didn't pile all your forces into the enemy they would break your people and win pretty quickly anyhow. And after all that, the only thing that really mattered was the commander and making him as badass as possible just so that you could beat the opponent's commander, and whoever won that basically won the game. In the end it had nowhere to go strategically; there was no room for dynamic gameplay.
Wait until you get the rest of your grades and then talk to your departmental advisor about your options.  Tons of people are in the exact situation that you are in and that's what advisors are there for.In the meantime, try to figure out what you want - if you want to leave the program then you need to explore all possible options for transferring or switching majors.  If you want to stay in the program there might be summer semester options to get you caught back up.

The same size?  Wow, that is crazy.  I live in Ohio, and the religion section was multiple walls, but the science section was limited to just one quarter of an aisle.
Is anyone else having this glitch in the inventory screen after buying the Butcher Western Pack? It crashes the game each time I clic it. http://imgur.com/gallery/6pVHoEy 
The leaked numbers showed otherwise. There was a steady increase but also a big drop. Meltzer said it had an impact, but wasn't enough to counteract the casual subscriptions coming in, and ultimately #cancelwwenetwork was the first time many even heard of the network, so it backfire for smarks and became advertising. However, had there been no growth (ie at a slower time of year), Keller estimated it would have cut subs by a third. 
Are those 1RM or working sets? I'm about 175 right now. Hoping to get down to 165, just trying to maintain my strength. Bench is at 225x8, squat is 275x8 and DL is 315x8. I'm curious as to what you look like at my goal weight given that I'm also 5'8 and were either around the same strength or I'm stronger depending on if your lifts were 1 rep or 8
I got two of my friends to start playing. One has never played and always talked shit on it; the other played ten years ago. I just stuck to it and kept playing, and they got addicted after they got a few levels. I also told them that we are going to be a pk team (best way to get your fellow LoL friends to play). 
Oof, If I remember correctly:Tiz: Salvemaker/WhitemageAgnes: Arcanist/BlackmageRingabel: Pirate/SwordmasterEdea: Ranger/SpellfencerNot the greatest offensive power save for Ringabel, but I made it and had a great time nonetheless. 
And unlike a lot of old shows, it doesn't play a lot in syndication because the music rights tied into all the old songs they played have proven prohibitively expensive.  Even the DVD releases have been cut all to shit.
I also think it's a good thing to remember that words only have as much power as you give them. If I made a decision to suddenly take offense to the word potato I could also demand that others couldn't tell me that it was inoffensive.People need to stop giving the words of a stranger so much power over their emotions. I've heard that friends use fag and faggot in the same way black people use nigger amongst others of "their own group" and have even let friends use it. And that whole situation where "only we can say it" is beyond ridiculous and only proves my point, that it's all about intention.A word is only offensive if it is being used to offend, or on offense. Getting upset and offended at the mere existence of the word. Is asinine. And only serves to create more instances in the future for you to get offended.

If you reach the armor cap it means you block 80% of all incoming physical damage. If you improve your armor beyond that point, it won't help you block any more damage, you'll always be hit by 20% of an enemies physical attack.At this point you don't need Heavy Armor enchantments on your gear. Maybe magic resist enchantments would be a better choice, because magic ignores your armor.

I kinda prefer it with the splits so i can see how the runner is doing compared to their PB and what they could've done better or differently. Some people prefer just clean gameplay, no commentary or splits. Some people separately locally record game feed for this very reason.
You need Legendary gear, or a full set of Rare gear from Iron Banner. And if you're getting ready for VoG, I'd say the minimum to go in would be Level 27, considering it starts with Level 26, but the enemies go to Level 28 in VoG
"Well I hope the person who reads it isn't lewd. Who know what sort of mental images your exchange would give them?" Gelrysn said in mock seriousness. 
His remake isn't out yet though. At least the new one, which is sounding hella good, and that was a month+ ago. His synth is super close and everything. I'm excited to hear it done. Also, Tuesday and Eine Fette is wrong. Not bad, just wrong.
Not specifically a recurring dream exactly, but a recurring element that continually appears (horrifically) in my dreams.At some point in my dream, I suddenly find myself unable to stand up or stay conscious.  I find myself stumbling around, leaning on things, and fighting to not pass out.  It's really scary and embarrassing.  I wish I could figure out why I keep dreaming about it.  I have for many years.
Ah cool. Well it is cost optimised to do faders in multiples of 8. Hence why they are 14+2, 22+2, and 30+2. We didn't think it was that big of a deal but underestimated how much audio guys like to work in multiples of 8 :)
Most of the kung jin players i've played use the bojutsu variation because it's like the go to variation, but I main with him and I use the Shaolin variant, there aren't really that high damaging kombos, but i can still pull off some stuff with it
Congrats on your graduation! High school or college?I hope it leads to good things for you guys:) I'm not sure what your feelings are for your ex (like if you like them again or just wanna be friends) but it's always better to have friends than enemies
He might be a great support but its almost impossible for me to listen to him. Between the mumbling and the lack of coherence its actually pretty challenging. "Life is...ones journey through life"
He has definitely been a player and incurred the displeasure of most parties in his day, some more than others.A Fine Gael activist as a student and has an economics degree.  He definitely has his dislikes and likes to be "old and wise".
I myself live in Northern michigan- the breeder I'm talking about is Prism Bettas in Midland. https://www.facebook.com/PrismBettas  This lady has some BEAUTIFUL fish and incredibly good deals. She really cares about them, too, and it shows!
Lol. Quando vi estava na app do telemovel, e aí sim, tenho os new a aparecerem por omissão. Depois vim postar pelo PC. Melhor assim, pensei que tinha infringido alguma regra da redditiqueta :)
uh, I have indeed. We have some Radler in the fridge, but that's a bit too sweet and low in alcohol to be my first choice at present. Leaning toward a red or maybe a mixed drink like a G&amp;T or something
It is. The only reason I wanted to host it all through the Emperor's Grace's network is so that when I disappear (as you know, time is marching on), the thing would have been continued with the invited parties and hopefully have expanded to encompass the Imperial community at large.Once I got back into a position where I had more free time, I intended on setting something up externally and on it's own.
Woh, that was fast!!Yeah it's pretty sad to see someone leave but I have been so addicted to FNaF that I haven't been so much into my other hobbies, and I find that pretty bad. But I hope I'll see you later too!!
You don't think it would be cool to see and be able to read the originals?  I work in retail and take 20-25 checks per day, so I wouldn't say they're completely obsolete, but I don't completely disagree with you.  And also, I don't think just because it's old, we shouldn't preserve certain traditions/heritages.
Cyclist here. Not the only thing about me, but certainly the most notible. One Piece has inspired me to ride a lot. It's my way of being free and going out of my comfort zone for adventure! I named both of my bikes One Piece names. As for work, I'm in the design/engineering department for a solar power company. I choose the way we connect PV system to the home. 
No, it's not you. Despite all the talk around here about how it's all a big brotherhood of watch lovers, I just see an undercurrent of snobbery about it all. It's kind of like, "Nice toy, little boy, now go play so the grownups can talk about their real watches." Like I said, I'm a bit put out with people in general.   
Since your numbers seem so bad, I decided to check my own numbers.Electricity is .10 kwh.  3x290x does 2300h/s on claymore's 9.1.   killawatt shows 830 watts at the wall with cpu idle.  .830x24 = 19.92 kwh19.92 x $.10 = $1.992/dayincome estimates to $1.08/day1.08-1.99= -0.91 (loss)so even though my hash per watt (2.77h/w) is better than yours (.6h/w), I am still not profitable.  Though I only mine when it is cold outside so that the mining costs will be offset by my heat cost savings.  I will not likely mine anymore this year, unless there is a price spike for monero.
On average you'll get one good spell, methinks, since you have a shot at two spells.Again, I really do think it's meta dependent. I think there are some match-ups against which Nefarian is better than Ysera, and others where Ysera is better. I don't think Nefarian would see tournament play mainly because tournament metas tend to have more BGHs than ladder. I think if the ladder had a lot of Druids, Priests, and Warrior, then this card would be better than Ysera in, say, a control Warrior deck.
Well, my sister is my best friend. She can be insensitive at times but she is definitely not untrustworthy. She is absolutely my #1 cheerleader and was more of a mother to me than our actual mother, but she doesn't see what the big deal is about this particular issue. 
True, but it's not as though this law/system is brand new. It seems to have been in place for some time. This passenger is clearly being neglegent in his responsibility to adhere to the set laws. Leaving a scene like that without leaving information *IS* illegal and this guy deserves to be fined for ignoring local laws.
This is a somewhat complex question. The side effects of anabolic steroids are generally mild, at worst comparable to hormonal birth control when used at moderate doses. The FDA, DEA, and AMA all recommended against making them controlled substances. Their legal status is even more indefensibly stupid that marijuana.That said, the argument against allowing free reign in sports is that they do have potential health drawbacks when used in high doses, and many athletes would feel compelled to use them in high doses if it were allowed.At this point, I think the biggest reason they're still illegal is stigma brought about by media hysterics, much like what was seen with marijuana up until very recently.
Evolution of comics as a medium. Superman also went from fairly silly to super-serious-business over the decades. Comics used to be for kids, nowadays they're, well... not.
If you think this is an interesting concept, try reading some science fiction.  Science fiction is full of questions like this that are played out in various interesting ways.
Why do you keep downvoting my posts? It's pretty hilarious. It's how I know you've read them. You say you'll stop being rude and then you just downvote everything for no reason.Ehhh whatever.

You act like his policy aren't still in place also 1962 isn't 100 years ago. Anytime you start a sentence with "Not to be racist or anything" just stop because whatever you're about to say is racist. Your "legitimate" point about Ivy League colleges isn't legitimate lets say you're right and being black gets you automatic acceptance into a Ivy League institution -_-.  You would still have to pass on your own merits. Ivy league schools do give preferential acceptance but its usually to people who come from legacy families like George W Bush.  
Question. Do the teachers'/staff rooms have sound proof walls? Seems like it would be important for teachers to blow off steam without other students hearing them.
The telco's should really look up setting up a voip system for places like this, or even the council's that run them.1 fiber line can easily be set up to run voip for the whole complex easily. With only 2 people using it would be cheaper than running a copper line, with even more people the cost of running it would be very small. 
I did that..for all the months I worked. (Low rent for sleeping on a floor). Suddenly I have £7,000 and no idea, but then I lost my job, gave away some to pay off parents debt and went to Canada. 
I agree. Ignoring this match, both clubs each have two matches against top 7 clubs + a winnable match against someone below them in the table. Whoever wins this will most likely end in 8th. If it's a tie advantage Swans!Im hoping for the win like always but wouldn't be disappointed with a tie. 
I admit, I grew up near the Pacific Ocean (Seattle) and still confuse Pacific with specific all the time. I do try to correct myself immediately once I realize (and I usually hear myself say it and cringe). It's one of those old habits I can't break, like saying "item" wrong. 
I've gotten a couple off of Ebay, I have enough pens that it really doesn't matter if they take a while. If wait time is a problem, you're not going to do much better than Goulet or Anderson (although I do not believe Anderson sells Jinhao pens).With any fine nib you'll find that you get more feedback than its broader counterpart. If you like the size of the Metro fine, you will probably like the EF 2000 nib, although you will find it to be larger than the Pilot nib.
&gt; It's honestly shit posts like this that ensure the shitty reputation of this sub lives on.Why what's wrong with it?&gt; Lol the downvotes. Stay buttmad r/atheism.Maybe you're downvoted because you just arbitrarily whinged without saying why?
Thank you so much for all of the ideas! Quinn is a favorite of mine, but I named my dog Quinn like a ninny. My SO did not love it, so it wouldn't have worked for a child for us, though. You have a lot of good suggestions. :)Edit: I didn't realize that Lincoln was in the top 100 for males, and I appreciate you pointing that out! Another name in my top 10 is Charlotte with the nickname Charlie.
Okay like fuck the fact that they didn't show us Derek's funeral. I'm still bitter that the Harry Potter movies never showed Dumbledore's funeral (one of my favorite scenes in the books).We need closure. 
I don't think an ama that takes up an hour or two every week or even on a per month basis if that's all the time they can afford would have any impact on the progression and development of future content/patches/bug fixes. So I guess no, I wouldn't rather have them devote an extra hour or two trying to fix bugs/develop content they have been working on for years, I would rather have an ama. But I agree many questions that basically everyone in the community wants an answer to would get dodged but that's not to say an ama wouldn't be informative. You could think of it as an interactive weekly update with Deej.
Once again I appreciate your argument but it's just not hitting home. You're basically saying that people shouldn't make things because others can steal it.
I'm just as shaken myself tbh. Don't think I'll recover fully for the rest of the day. But for now just thank god she is alive. That's all that matters.
Thank you for your advice! I am seeing my trainer soon, so will ask her. I previously mentioned it to her, but she's pregnant and busy, so did not want to push. 
These were climate scientists going out to document how all the sea ice was disappearing.  Instead, there was so much, it took two ships and a helicopter to rescue them because the first rescue ship got stuck.  Sea ice to that extent does not just show up after a few days of cold, it takes solid amounts of time to build up.  Furthermore, they were stuck in the summer, which is supposed to be the time when the ice would normally be reduced, but it was still crazy excessive, far more than they thought. That is tantamount to a scientist saying they're going to study a drought and ending up nearly drowning in a tsunami.
So this is a step down transformer. I think you take the primary voltage and divide it by five . Take that and subtract ten percent . That's your secondary voltage. Then , take the output current, 2.7, add ten percent and divide that by five. To get the primary current.
https://youtu.be/iv_lhvWEjaII think this is pretty close from what I can tell!  The girl talks a little excessively but it's a decent tutorial.  Also if your hair is pretty straight, you might want to curl it or do a hot roller set beforehand.  I know it seems silly to curl your hair if you're just going to brush it out and style it, but it gives your hair more "movement" and actually makes it easier to style for looks like this.  My hair is pin straight but I get good success with retro and vintage styles after using pincurls or hot rollers.  Good luck and please get pictures of the result! :)
I might get some crap for this, but I always loved the Penguins of Madagascar TV show. It doesnt have an over arching plot or deep characters, but honestly it is really funny. 
Exactly, I code cheats myself but also code mods, and I can certainly say that every good modder is also a hacker. Whether evil or not, that's another question.
&gt; ... Once again, you are failing to grasp the concept of 'force'I would argue that withholding your friendship with someone over an ideological dispute is a type of forcing the issue. So is public shaming of a person who dares to dissent. Your semantic arguments can be used against your door example-- I choose to open my door, and then I choose to listen to the person standing there. He's not literally forcing me, if you want to get technical about it.It would actually be impossible to literally force someone to believe something, unless we're talking about actual brainwashing. And even if you want to talk about laws forcing beliefs, in NA that's a non-issue. So what are you really saying? Because before you said that Christians force their ideologies, and pro-LGBT don't. If we're talking about literal forcing, neither do at this present time. But if we're talking about in-your-face pushiness I'd say they both have evidence of such behaviour.
I'm a fat fuck but if someone showed me this I beat the ever loving shit out them. I'm fat. I am fat because I'm lazy and I like food. I hate how other fat fucks are making me look sooooo much worse 
If you haven't given it a full charge yet, that could be why.  Also if changing settings don't help, then you may want to calibrate the battery by letting it drain to 0 and then giving it a full charge.
The government as a whole might not have it, but it can be interpreted that only individuals need to have that sort of wealth. Even if no singular member in Mt. A has 1,500d, the citizenry as a whole definitely does, and that's what counts. Even if the entirety of Mt. A did not have 1,500d, you would still fit the other criteria.
eh, I wouldn't really be interested in adding that much if at all because the price of the dopplers will be still heading downward, but I'm interestededit: just add me and we can discuss

Yeah no worries. My husband and I were in promo for Gold several times last season then this season my husband played his placements this season and won 9/10 and got B2. He was so pissed. I dicked around in mine and won like 5/5 and got B1. Now I wish I had tried harder.
Stage 6 is it?It is recommended to use stunners in this stage. Personally, I used the following teams and they worked.Rachel(Lead)/D'art/Maria (Rachel was the only one who survived)Archon(Lead)/Nightingale/Susanoo (overkill)Yeowoodong(Lead)/D'art/Nightingale (epic overkill)The point is you need to deal as much damage as possible within the first few seconds and attempt to wipe them out. It won't do you good with an endurance battle.
I know nothing about indie scents and will look into what you mentioned. Guys have AS from artisans (Fine, B&amp;M etc...) but I'm not sure about colognes. Are the fragrances you mentioned EDT or EDP? 
That is a nice area I would not expect much crime. Edmond doesn't have much crime in general minus a few areas.The start up scene is a bit low. I see more in Tulsa.Cost of housing is cheap here for the amount of house you get
There just isn't a point when leagues will continue to be separated. I'm sure female teams would practice and devote more time to the game if they had to. However, like stated previously, there is no point if the competition isn't at the level professional male teams are at.
I don't think the bottleneck was the ISP connection, but the actual access points and the signals jamming. You see the same sort of thing at large press conferences where the attendees/journalists complain about poor WiFi because of the sheer amount of people in one location.WiFi only has 12 channels so when you have huge crowds like at EDC all sharing those 12 wireless channels, they begin to jam up and become really slow.
I feel slightly off when I don't have any, and a little more lethargic. Ibuprofen kills the headache, no problem. At the moderate amount I drink, the supposed health benefits are worth the mild dependency.
Maybe if they quit killing white farmers they would have more opportunity in agriculture.  That way they could realize their full potential doing menial farm labor.
But there are more to comms than just when action is happening. You have to consider the information they should be sharing about their lane when action isn't really going on. I'm not an expert by any means, but to assume that the only comms that go on or that all of their comms are like the ones in the highlight reels is just an overly presumptuous statement in my opinion. I'm sure their communication issues stem deeper than that, but honestly there is no way to know for sure without having access to them in full.
There are quite a few Ex-Vegas people now living in Cedar City.  As others have pointed out, it's close enough for visits, but far less expensive and much cooler overall.At ~30,000 it's still small, but does have most of the convenient big chain stores / restaurants that are absent in smaller towns like Beaver, Kanab and Fillmore.
My mom got through about 2 pages and then quit because she said she could tell it was going to be as "dark" as the show, of which she's toiled through the first 8 episodes (that's right, still doesn't know about Ned or dragons) of season 1. She's interested in the story and the characters but is very sensitive and finds it overall too dark and disturbing to stomach. I'm pretty close with my mom, so it's a bummer that I can't share ASOIAF with her. She swears she's never going to read the books or watch the show, but I still bend over backwards to protect her from spoilers.
This was mine, last year. Addressing my junior English class about the need to stop swearing all the time, and I was getting pretty irate. Happened to glance at one of the worst offenders, and he says, "Why are you looking at me?"I immediately snap back with, "I'm not looking at you, you aren't that pretty!" Stunned silence from the class, then everyone going, "Ohhhhhh!"
It's not ironic at all. It's par for the course; these people who demand justice the most will soon be shown to have the deepest infestation in their own hearts and the most rotten demons dwelling within them, and they will tell you that by the virtue of some man from aeons ago or by the virtue of whatever is expedient they have been redeemed. They want to be free to criticize, judge, and manipulate and direct others, but do not themselves want to be held to the same scrutiny. This one thing I have just said is the thing which stokes their ire the hardest, because they can't face the fact that after all this time, for all of their good behavior, they would have to face Lucifer and still see that he is their moral equivalent and that they aren't any better.
See, you went to a massive city where you have to walk around and be active if you want to survive. Ever notice how attractive and fit seemingly everyone in Manhattan is? You go to smaller suburban cities in the UK and it'll be just like suburban cities in America.
Can you post the set? I'm utterly fascinated by Protean Kecleon and have wanted to feature it in a team for some time now. Always curious how others use it.

Similar sentiment with GMOs. Just about every fruit and vegetable that we regularly eat are GMOs. We've genetically modified them through grafting and other techniques for thousands of years to make them larger, tastier, grow better, last longer, and more.
Yes but the slash does not have enough force to knock his feet back and if it did he would have fell over face first. Picture a baseball player running home getting tripped: how can he possibly slide feet first? K turned the slash into a reverse slide. It's science yo. 
Miss Congeniality, by its own definition, "reflects the respect and admiration of the delegate's peers, who voted for her as the most congenial, charismatic and inspirational participant."JDF was a super sweetheart, but it was others who constantly came to her aid to build her up, not the other way around.No one can deny she was a VERY nice queen, but was she the one who worked at building up and inspiring others during her tenure? Not so much. Fame and Max fit this bill far more IMO.
I'm not going to chime in on console vs PC, but just for the future. If you end up wanting to hook up your ps3 controller to the PC, you need to download special drivers. DS3 tool works great, but Better DS3 is, well, better. A bit more complicated of a set up process, but worth it to me. 
It's also $15 on G2A. Say what you will about key selling sites and G2A, it's worked flawlessly for the dozens of games I've purchased through them so even though my anecdotal personal experience is biased, it's a legit site and worth looking at if you're scrapped for cash.
Not a specific recurring dream, but I will go through periods at a time in my life where every single night, without fail, I will die in my dream.  I'll usually usually never die in the same way, but it becomes kind of a strange game I play with myself as I lay in bed at night, trying to guess how I'll go out this time.  Fall off a cliff? Get stabbed by a childhood friend? Head on collision? Surprise me!This will usually happen for a month or so, and then I'll be back to normal, dreaming about me free climbing skyscrapers made out of library books and shit.
It's fun to watch both sides declare victory on this so quickly when it hasn't even gone into effect. Washington already has the highest state minimum wage in the country and we do alright on unemployment stats and "business friendly" indexes.I guarantee that $15 an hour will do nothing to fix the massive inequality in this shitty area that's growing way too fast.

Well its fairly common in canada.. my grandparents on my dad's side are buried beside each other, they bought the plot like 10 years prior to their passing, which was also almost 8 years apart. Almost every plot around them is double plots for couples in this manner. 
Personally, in this instance, I'd rather see distracted driving enforced too heavily than too light. Get the social acceptance out of the way, make it a stigma like DUI is. Then maybe lighten up on pulling people over for putting on chapstick. 
That's a misuse of "racist".  The best you can say accurately is "close minded", or at a stretch, *maybe* "ethnocentric ".  Though in general I just prefer "don't be an uptight little bitch". 
I was actually wondering why the Len over Shaq, then I kept reading haha. You are right, Len does fit a bit better on the starting 5 as he'll keep a quick pace with everyone else on the floor.I'm curious if you see Len playing 30+ minutes next season. This a very fast paced high perimeter defense team. Biggest weakness I see in defense at the front court positions, but would be fun to watch these guys

Depends. Even while tired. Kings Haki works on how much will power people have and how much physically stronger the user is than the target.Hence why Luffy could only knock out 50,000 fishmen at the given moment.

&gt; A coffee habbit can get expensive if you have to buy it several times a day.Yeah, I figured 10-30 cents per capsule is way better than $2-5 per cup of coffee.  &gt; That amazon deal is alright, but you can find a better price on capsules from one of the reliable sellers listed in the beginners guide. Powdercity for example does 90 capsules for $10.Thanks! Seems like Powdercity has the best pricing of the lot in the supplier list. If the initial testing with the capsules from Amazon goes well then I'll order more from Powdercity :)

Believe it or not, the Blu!  From there I got the V2 cigs, which I really liked, then Halo Triton.  Currently I'm using a Provari Mini, an eGo One, and the Aspire Nautilus premium kit. I'm a 47 year old quitter so getting here gradually over 6 months has been great.  I don't think I'll move to boxes or sub-ohm tanks (I actually gave away a subtank nano because I didn't like it) but it's been the best way to get and keep me off cigs.  Really, really happy about it. I haven't had a single one since I picked up that Blu.

It's subjective, but I could argue against that. Ramsay Bolton is basically just a rabid animal - a psychopath with no capacity for empathy, and no emotional need to have relationships with people. While he has his place in the Game of Thrones world, he's an ultimately hollow creature, however terrifying.But Walter White... the truly, deeply chilling thing about him is that he started out with a relatively typical personality, and then a series of emotional blows and ego-trips and twists of fate ended up having him do more and more monstrous things. And each time he descended lower - "Broke Bad" - you could still see there was a very human logic behind Walter's motivations, even while each of those steps down took him further and further away from humanity.
Contract says they both have to consent. End of story. Does bring up a good point though. Why does a women get to choose to bring an embryo to term but the man doesn't when it's natural. A guy should have equal chance to choose if he wants to be a parent and right now men don't have the right.
Uhhh... for the first decade or so postwar that's definitely not the case. PRC support was crucial for the viet minh, they were given an unassailable strategic rear once the CCP won the mainland in 1949, plus a huge amount of logistical and advisory support. It's hard to overstate just how crucial this was to ultimate victory over the French. During the American phase Chinese units operated SAM batteries in the north and quite a few Chinese soldiers were killed in this undeclared air war. It was only later that cooperation turned to rivalry.
Just curious, since you are on this forum (so I assume you like Hip-Hop) and you're clearly pretty far from the Men's Rights dipshits on Reddit, how do you consume Hip-Hop? This genre is riddled with misogyny to the point where it's part of Hip-Hop's identity. If the sexism isn't explicit objectification like Slick Rick, it's often implicit (male gaze, male mc's being favored etc.). Do you draw a line somewhere? because if Slick Rick bothers you, I assume Rick Ross, Project Pat, Juicy J, Cam'ron, Dr. Dre, Tupac, Snoop Dogg, and plenty of others probably bother you in some ways too. Just wondering since I support/sympathize with the women's rights movement, but I also still listen to R. Kelly (who is by all accounts a terrible person) because I feel like I can separate them in my head.

Not really. All open with maximum length, it can actually seat 8. Crammed, yest, but it works. I had Christmas dinner in my very small apartment with 8. I will say it can seat 6 comfortable. You can even be four eating on it "folded" in (it doesn't actually fold, so don't know what to call it), if there is only plates and cups on the table, not the actual food.It also depends greatly on how comfortable someone is with sitting around a table leg, and also with which chairs you choose. I suggest going to Ikea and trying out the table and chairs with it. That's really the only way. Because their recommendations are odd. Sometimes too low, sometimes too high.

Is it a keeper? If not, I wouldn't trade Dickerson and Myers for him. You're right, if Cutch doesn't steal 30+ bases he's basically the same as Dickerson, possibly with less RBIs. Though I don't think it's accurate to take sample sizes and extrapolate them over an entire 162 game season, however, Dickerson's stats last year over a full season would have propelled him into a first rounder. Though I'm not necessarily sold on Myers quite yet (though he is very talented), I would not flip Dickerson and Myers for Cutch in a non-keeper quite yet. I have a feeling you could revisit that trade at any time this season as long as Dickerson doesn't find himself on the shelf for his plantar fasciitis.

I think sometimes Europeans get away with this when English isn't their native language. If they grew up learning American English, watch American movies etc all the time, then their American accent is pretty natural - it's not an imitation. Just like you, it's actually the way they learned to speak English.

That's interesting. In europe i have to explain to people why i still think my 7 year old BMW is a great car. Cheap base early model petrol and diesel e60s are about £3k ($4500) and people think that owning a 5 litre car is just idiotic. I have the same problem with my Lexus but I don't even bother telling people how much work i put into a 17 year old car because most would just ridicule me.

I was fortunate enough to knock out most of my graduate school while still an undergrad. Tuition was the same for 12 credits as it was for 21, so I loaded up.Upon graduation; I paid for my remaining graduate courses (9 credits over the course of 3 semesters taking one class at night each term) with 0% offers from credit cards that I had and my mother had at the time. Sure there was a minor % hit in a fee, but I generally had 12-18 months to pay off all of it as I worked. I just made sure to put that money away and have everything paid down by the last month.

In my experience, playing this as rpg lite is a recipe for disaster.  Most of the unfavorable opinions of the game on bgg are caused by this.  Even in our own game group we had players who expected rpg lite even when I said it is not that type of game.You really have to work at it and take every edge you can as overlord, at least in the games we played.  If that means taking advantage of bad plays or focus firing a hero than so be it, it may be the only window for victory the overlord has.
Yep.Edit: To reiterate what I said at the end of my last post. Even when the podcast gets real silly, the humor still comes from some form of intelligence.With all due respect, the only thing funny with Dave Klein was "haha this guy is crazy and gives no fucks, what the fuck is going on?"Idk, it's not actual comedy is what I'm saying.

Eh, Right of Conquest. By that logic you could say that America really only belongs to the animals that were here before any humans crossed the Bering Strait. 
I would agree with that argument if there were some consequences for the "bad apples." If I watched a video like that, and then saw that the follow up was that the officer was fired and charged for what he did, then I would be able to say "there's just a few bad apples". But the reality is that the worst punishment the officer in the video is going to see is maybe a few days of paid suspension, and he'll be back patrolling the streets again. I don't see how I, as a citizen, can trust or respect any NYPD officer while there continues to be absolutely zero consequences for thugs like the officer in the video. 
Oh, one more feature I forgot to mention, which the Neutrino has but the Teensy lacks, is the ability to switch seamlessly between USB and external power.  With the Teensy you have to cut a jumper on the underside of the board if you don't want VIN to feed back into the USB bus or vice versa.  I found the Teensy's solution was kind of a pain when you have already soldered together your board.  When testing, it's easy to forget and leave the power on when you plug the USB in to reprogram it, and if you cut the jumper, it can get annoying to have to turn the device on to program it.

Incredibly vibrant and thick mascara, going up to or nearly up to the eyebrow, and usually a bright color; bright blush; very vibrant and liberally applied lipstick; super long eyelashes; really long colored nails. Something like that, I guess. It's hard for me to explain since I don't know half of what women use. I'm trying to describe it in a way that excludes gothic and/or metal/hardcore makeup looks because as long as they're not overdone (like anything, honestly), there are definitely fans of that.

**not an expert**I think that's a capacitor which holds power until it needs to be used and is then discharged. I'd guess in RAM they keep specific blocks powered.

I've always been curious about that. I always see girls gushing about their new littles who they've met maybe a month before, and I'm like "it can't ALWAYS work out like that right?" There's bound to be some mismatches but I never see it. Maybe it's just because I'm really shy and it takes me a bit to warm up to people, but I find it odd.

By any chance is anyone else getting "Your request was not completed successfully." on every HIT they try to accept? It's continually telling me to "Please try it again. If you continue to receive this message, please try your request again later."
Not saying it needs more range. Just that its frustrating how it functions. I'd trade a shorter fear for a shorter duration of the tether any day though. Because its always feels like eternity waiting for them to be feared.Also are you a Pokemon?
It looks like the all seeing eye is closed, with a broken pyramid. Very interesting symbolism. Paradigm shift, end the oligarchy, etc. [Here's two more.](http://imgur.com/Lfn6bxS) [and the second](http://imgur.com/EdMhyyJ) 
Except that doesn't make any sense. The medium in your examples have gone obsolete, but we still watch the content: I can watch 100 year old movies in digital format on my computer or TV. The same is technically true for nostalgic games (via emulators), but the attitude that OP laments is not that the kids don't like the medium (gameboy), but rather that they wouldn't be interested in the incredible discovery of the games which fueled his childhood. There ya go.
Great work, and awesome style! I've been doing tokens for friends for a while too, but it's awesome you're giving the print ready files! Keep it up, dude!
I was the same. i only did it for my bachelors (and HS) but as a teacher, it is definitely my favorite event. i love the traditions. Good thing about walking is that they are so busy reading names no one even realizes youre walking. lol
Does twc have a dedicated test site? Always want to test from there first. Also, you may want to check your PC firewall or antivirus.  If it's scanning everything you browse, that can cause it to drop. Also, if you have anything like Game Now QOS or the like, turn that off. 
It really shouldn't make a difference for the sake of the argument.  But just so you know, it *is* my personal view, but at the same time I hope I am presenting my reasoning in an accurate way.
I don't see the point of 90% of the crap made today, but plenty of folks disagree with me, and pay money for said crap.Obviously it's a niche market, but then again so is the Miata. I wouldn't argue that Mazda is wrong making a car that 99% of drivers will never buy. I can see why some people would be attracted to the velcro cap thingies, though I wouldn't be one of them. The main problem I see is that the soft floppy material one would be mounting these velcro cap thingies to is not designed for such work. It will probably de-laminate or deform pretty quickly. Back in the day, Nikon made a couple of hard-ish leather cases, with metal F bayonets in the bottom, on which you could mount your lenses, so they wouldn't go rolling around and damaging each other. People bought them, but obviously the idea never went mainstream.
You know what would be a good idea? If, in this game, you can recruit other Nintendo characters using amiibo. Sounds crazy. Let me explain:Imagine being able to use Palutena, Pit, Link, Zelda, Mewtwo, Ness, Shulk, or other characters in this game. An amiibo tap would allow you to unlock a Paralogue/DLC Map where you can recruit these characters through a fight. Oh boy, do I want this to happen. Or we can just get an FE:IF amiibo line. :D
I wouldn't. I dropped 200ug at a music festival (i'd done L about 10 times before this - only in the comfort of my home &amp; my friends'), and while it was amazing, i'd wished I hadn't. The trip itself was great, but being in a public space, I found myself stressing about people "knowing" i was on it. My friend, who was also on L (it was his second time) didn't do that great. While I held my composure fairly well, it was obvious he was having a hard time trying to be comfortable - he kept asking me "Does it look like i'm on drugs?" - i'd say to him "Only because you're thinking about whether you look like you're on drugs" haha. People deal with different scenarios differently, but i'd personally wait until you're comfortable with it until you do it in a place like that! Excuse the essay!
Not to mention that that's not a significant thing at all. Almost anyone can do that with training. Just like most people's brains try to wake them up before the dangerous loud sound that always wakes them up at the same time every day.
I played it again recently and with the overhead map to remind me where stuff was it was pretty easy.We bombed SO much stuff back then.  We made graph paper maps of each dungeon.  Good times, but yeah, EXTREMELY time-consuming.
That's not a definition of government shared by anybody else.  I mean, according to your definition dictatorships can not be governments.  A monarchy can not be government.  And me and my neighbors planting trees together does not make us a government, despite your absurd definition.
Every single person responding to you is showing you that you're utterly wrong about Brown v. Ohio. You do not have any idea what you're talking about. The Ohio Revised Code, as I already showed you, clearly states what I noted. I have no idea how you aren't getting that. Literally, just read the source.
I disagree. It's poetry. It's the voice of the people. It's a reflective of time and place. there are movements just like the transcendental movement or enlightenment movement. There are innovations in hip hop. Culture is culture. 
The developers have been very picky about which devices they allow it on. They probably aren't allowing it on devices that they haven't tried it on to prevent a flood of bad reviews
He is one of the greatest to have played, and there is an argument for him being the best.  I think he went out of the game in such a sense of shame that he is considered a second tier player.  One of the best, but not on the stage of Maradona, Cruyff, Pele, Beckenbauer, etc.  I believe that if he had scored the header that was saved only a few minutes before the headbutt, it would have propelled him into people's memories in a different way.  He would have won two World Cups, with two goals in each game.  I'm not sure he is my greatest of all time, but I do think there is a good argument for him being the greatest World Cup performer of all time.  Had he scored on that header, there is no doubt he would be.
not that i think it was all skill, but i am damn well going to cling to the fact that i drafted Justin Tucker last overall in his rookie year and he was absolute money on my championship team.
It just makes me realize what an opportunist cunt Anderson Cooper is.He's like Ellen DeGeneres crossed with PT Barnum... but, hey, nobody would ever attempt to make the argument that American "news" media isn't a circus.
&gt;perfectly reproduce music as it was writtenHow do you *perfectly reproduce* symbols on paper into the abstract realm of sound? Performance is always a translation/interpretation of the score. A better analogy would be a pianist reproducing another pianist's recordings exactly. Which no good pianist does.
Yeah. The ability to toggle them off would be nice so Stability Assist System doesn't become inStability Assurance System when attempting to go fast. Want to be super maneuverable but no faster than 350 m/s or so, turn them back on.
Women definitely have an easier time bedding a guy, the whole being able to pick and choose from all the guys giving you attention thing helps. I guess if you're not picky about who you bang you could go twice a day if you know where to meet people.
I talked to Jon the other day, and he told me he's working on a live-action version of every single post ever made on this sub, all with practical effects and as few takes as possible. Sounds pretty 'arthouse' to me, but knowing Jon, it will b quit sw00d lel gr0mmit
"Shouldn't be too hard" does not mean the same as "Should be trivial".I write software for a living.  I know how much work can be involved in a seemingly simple change.  (A running joke at one workplace was "How hard can it be?" -  "Brain surgery?  How hard can it be?")  If I had to guess, I'd say there's at least 2-3+ man-months involved across UI design, coding, testing, bug fixing, performance optimisation, translation, etc.
Compositionally, I love the photo. I think you have a nice foreground against a beautiful background. If i were to be nitpicky, i would say crop the photo when shooting (not post), so that you move in a little, and lift that bottom end up and tighten the edges.You already admitted that the exposure is a tad over, but do you shoot in raw? If so, you can easily move the exposure down in editing and it would look killer. Also, as I'm sure you know, just take that iso down to 100. Always try to keep ISO at 100, and manipulate other settings for exposure, as 100 iso will get you the best quality.
Alternative:Not the Bees!GGAs an additional cost to cast Not the Bees, you may reveal an Insect card from your hand.Counter target spell unless its controller pays 1. If you revealed an Insect card or controlled an Insect as you cast Not the Bees, counter that spell instead.
Bradford wouldn't sign anywhere, it's a misnomer that he wouldn't sign specifically with the Browns. Bradford is pulling a Flacco and betting on himself. Right now coming off two knee surgeries and not having played in 2 years his value is as low as it is gonna get, if he plays well next year he will be due a much bigger pay day. If he does have a good year and we have a good record why wouldn't he sign with us?
Let me rephrase it this way:&gt; No matter how many people consider it to be included in the idea marriage, it does not change the idea of marriage's definition.Unfortunately, there is no way to argue about this issue.  You just have a different idea of what marriage is, and there is no way to prove the contrary or the agreeable.

Why did Riot tell them they had to tone it down though? Sneaky consistently gets 20k viewers, and they are hilarious together. But he explicitly said Riot said he had to stop saying 'welcome to my butthole' when people subbed. I get the are technically a Riot employee, because they are playing in their league, but shouldn't this be outside of their control? 
Did you just get upped a dose? Every time that you are upped there can be the flare up and that sounds similar to the flare ups that I experienced. My worst flare up lasted for about two weeks and then my face improved. My only other idea would be that your skin is sensitive to the new moisturizer that you are using. Accutane does make your face quite sensitive and that could be causing the breakouts. Maybe try going back to your old moisturizer for a couple weeks and see if your face clears up? 
China has a long history of corruption and abuse, but the recent chairman Xi jinping has nabbed a lot of people in his anti corruption scandal. This includes ex security chief Zhou Yong Kang, who was one of the most feared Chinese politicians. China still has a long way to go, but they're not just paying lip service to anti corruption anymore. They are taking the first steps down the right path. On top of that, china's internet generation won't let these cops get away without a fight. I think your statement that these cops will for sure get away with this mischaracterizes the current political situation of China.

Caffeine is a common ingredient in headache relief medications, such as Migraine strength Excedrin.  Caffeine causes vasoconstriction.  In one study caffeine use reduced cerebral blood flow by an average of 27 percent. 
I've read somewhere that the BLU very rarely gets updates and that there isn't much support? I've heard much about the BLU and it definitely seems like a good buy. Does the blu have like the quick camera motion "thingies"? I mean I think that's definitely a feature I would like, whether it be a quick button or the twist motion that the Moto X has, and the Glance feature. Camera itself isn't that big of a deal, because i'm not trying to be the king of facebook or anything. but something that will let me take good enough pictures so that I can tell the details.Something else that's a bit concerning, is that the network/4g coverages are a bit less than what the 640 covers. And the processor, the snapdragon 410 and 400 is there that much of a difference?
Your prioritizing your friends' feelings over your boyfriends'. After 2.5 years together, his feelings should *at the very* least edge out those of friends who are acting egregiously shitty. 
That's an interesting point but religion I think is more about belief than practice, even though they often go hand in hand. I could *believe* God would send people to hell if they didn't go to church on Sunday, but sleep in knowing I'm a blatant blasphemer. 
Yeah, "Far left" means that you're a revolutionary communist or something. He's a social democrat/ democratic socialist, which is a very mainstream ideology in most of the developed world.
&gt; Film guy himself created the confrontation, he was the only aggressive one there.LOL. One of the girls got annoyed that he didn't blindly accept her opinions. Asks him why he isn't covering the *real issues*, tu quoque fallacy right there.

Well we saw at Silverstone that Porsche almost nabbed the win by saving a pit stop. It's perfectly feasible that they could do it again at a heavier fuel burn circuit or save maybe 3 or 4 pit stops at Le Mans.I'm already loving it! And it's only getting better from here :D
Not only did you deliver, but in under an hour! I dunno if it's allowed here, but this montage should have it's own post to get the recognition it deserves. Very well done Evolution of Haitchface drawing guy, very well done.
This is perfect timing, was just looking for graph-based libraries for clojure that can handle di-graphs in order to offer a suggestion for replacing a god-awful Python system.Have to hand in my Dissertation tomorrow and this is a lovely link for a parting shot at that Python piece of shit!
Just a little time, but yes, we have some. She's been doing better since I started giving her the insulin shots. Sweet pup. I'll google when I'm ready. Thank you. 
Yeah, I'm super poor, so can't afford anything other than my phone. The last game I owned was GTA: SA on ps2 like 10 years  ago. I don't have anything now.
The amount used is negligible. You don't mothball a facility and put people out of work just to use resources/create environmental impact by moving it to another location.

Its not that shes not a virgin. The fact that upsets me is she had sex with guys who didnt give a shit about her and it was treated almost a sport. I knew someone was going to give me shit saying i wanted her to be a virgin. I could give two shits about that. Its the fact that 11 of these guys fucked her for sport and there was no connection at all.
If there is one thing I'm extremely overly confident about it's my ability to learn and put that knowledge to quick and efficient use. I know it will be difficult, but I trust myself entirely in that department. 
I was born in a small town in Texas but moved away when I was two or three. Had a convo with my brother about who we would have know. If we had stayed. A week later at a ski resort I met a girl born and raised in that same town who just moved away
Let the Bucs take Winston, let the Titans take Mariota.  Let those guys deal with the incessant media coverage. Let them deal with the media making news out of nothing.  Give us our peace back!  Go Browns, fuck Pittsburgh, Baltimore
There's a 10-15 minute long high after I'm done where I'm patting myself on the back, and another hour before I fall back into my usual mental patterns. I never expected this, but it's really nice. I'm just trying to figure out how to extend that kind of mental stability now.
oh yeah, it's all terribad, i didn't mean to detract from any of that.  This is essentially what a very inexperienced army looks like as they form and try to take territory.  I think they use religion much the way the Inquisition did, as a way to get what they want and to control the local populace so that they can divert attention away from local policing and concentrate on the fronts.

This is my go-to strat when I random a support. I just use the extra gold to buy mid a bottle. However, 9 times out of 10 when I do this they lose mid. I'm not sure how that works out.
That's a dumb argument. If anything, it's people voting for what they believe to be the lesser of two evils in an election that seemed to be fairly close. If it appeared either of the two large party candidates were going to run away with the election or a libertarian candidate appeared to at least have something close to a chance to contend, maybe they would have voted for who they actually wanted to win rather than voting against who they didn't want to win.
My first thought is you should absolutely still be making web comics. Then again, I don't know your whole story, and don't wanna tell you how to live and whatnot
Doesn't this violate its spectrum license agreement? Not to mention the Carterfone decision (13 F.C.C.2d 420). I forsee Verizon losing money and possibly spectrum if this is true.
This is the most boring gameplay video I have seen. Like, either commit to the honorabru junk and just duel to the death without healing or play freely and heal when you get an opportunity.  This is just two kids enjoying swatting each other on the head over and over again until their dad says stop.
the blue metal is all one simple texture. there's a sky image in the reflection channel, the reflections from the scene, and the lights are set to visible and volumetric.

FYI if you're using reddit is awesome, you can access the side bar from the top of the subreddit beside the refresh button. It's a little "i" icon with a circle around it. 
Thank god, then there is still time to prevent further rapeet: why am being downvoted?? should expect this from reddit being full of cis white males, expect a report to r feminism regarding this sub..
Not to me. I am white and 58, but sometimes the only people on earth i think make any sense and know what the hell is actually going on are people i know who are not white.
Such a wonderful person to buy from! Great communication, super fast shipping, and items arrived safe and well-packaged. Would definitely do business with this person again!
Sure thing, people thought It was weird though. I know imgurians are usually pretty good about sourcing Reddit but when Imgur stuff comes to Reddit, it never happens and that's not cool.
This is literally a fear i've had ever since i was as young child. Literal holes in my skin with maggots crawling in and out, and liquid just pussing out. How the fuck can I avoid this aside from your everyday wash your hands? This is literally nightmare inducing shit.What can I do to reduce the risk as much as possible for something like this to occur?
Yeah, we have this rule in France that organs must be anonymous and free. But how do you do anonymous with a face? I guess they would just ask every one not to actively seek each other's identity for their own sanity and hope for the best.
I think the quality of the video is good. I believe YouTube downgrades the video data rate, so that's probably why some of it is a little blocky in some spots.  The camera seems really smooth. What are the specs on the quad you are flying? Sounds like you have some pretty good sized motors on it.
If I were alone at home in my house and not on Facebook or any social media and my husband was murdered outside of his job or on his way or simply disappeared ...how would I prove I'm innocent? This has crossed my mind so so so many times! it's kinda scary that I could end up in prison for life if my "bestie" simply said I did it. Even though there was no physical evidence 
One problem with credit transfers is the irritating bastards who spam you trying to sell in game credits for real cash.Games like everquest and WoW suffered hugely from these (ususally chinese)plat farmers,who just farmed cash non stop from the simplest methods then annoyed the hell out of everyone trying to sell it.I seriously hope ED does not end up the same.
Also, thanks to your insight, I can finally see all the dimensions of the answer to the golden ellipse as well!    y = y^2 + 2     http://imgur.com/bf2nHCO.jpg     More analysis is necessary, but this is a big step.
I don't think they are any more excusable than are the police actions that they are protesting.  However, they are an understandable reaction in many ways, when the law does not respect and obey the law.  Were I in their situation I may very well be voicing my frustration in that manner, yet I still believe they should face the consequences of those actions.
Because reality. These people give zero fucks about you, they give zero fucks about your morals. The only thing they understand is the currency they deal in - pain and suffering and even still the lowest of the low are glad to die for their cause. Thoughts? Suggestions?
Reddit doesn't listen to what Riot actually says.  Like the recolour poll that was out a while ago yet everyone apparently missed it yet I got it on all 3 of my alts.
Grad student, and if I manage to get Stevens housing (Single room and secretly have SO live there too, it's ~1750/mo which is a little too steep for us.Okay, yes I should definitely check that they accept students and will be careful for scammers!
It only works for inspecting weapons/armour. Just so you can see the piece without the name/flavour text/perks. It doesn't do anything outside of that.
I love going on long car rides and listening to nostalgic music with him. We both had similar tastes in music growing up so we always find some good tunes! 
I think the idea is, the pounds you are over or under your ideal weight, will benefit you more if you are over.I could gain 60 pounds and I'd be 180 pounds, and have something nice and soft to sit on for once. I could suffer severe illness and have a greater chance of a faster recovery. I'd stand a better chance of surviving a serious car accident, statistically, as well as childbirth. At 180 pounds, I would survive longer during cold water exposure if I was in a boating accident. I could still bike everywhere, and be shit at stairs. I'd be fat. It would be fine.If I lose 60 pounds? I ded. No seriously. I would *be dead*. So being overweight has more benefits than being underweight, pound for pound, yes. That's not "pro-fat propaganda" that's just "Your body can deal with being overweight more than being underweight" Plenty of peeps out there are 320 pounds and still alive. If I was 200 pounds underweight, I'd have negative mass. I'd be superdead.
Wait a second... jugg, sven... and davion. Did you grab those 3 heros from my CM gangrape smut? You little rascal. (Kidding of course, they're all masked swordsmen, so it'd be reasonable that it's just coincidence that we had the same 3 guys. By the way, not being sarcastic if I'm coming off that way). Gotta say, you pulled it off much better than I did.
It's 5 years and hundreds of millions of dollars later, it's time they start fucking putting out.  They aren't indie anymore, they need to figure their shit out. It would probably help if they had more than 4 people working on the game.
Technically, he's not wrong. As asked, Riker would have been offered command of the Titan *before* accepting said offer.Without specifically mentioning "which commands did Riker turn down" there is a lot of room to interpret.
Is this a dose taken once you develop a tolerance?I mean shit I basically lose focus of reality entirely from 200ug so I can't even imagine moving on a 1500ug dose.

This could be an acceptable sentence in AAVE, African American Vernacular English.  It may be a spoken in past inceptive tense, identifying the beginning but ongoing state of it being cold.  
O_oForgiveness granted, and upvotes. Nobody *ever* admits to being wrong on the internet!Yeah, it's a pretty silly stance. It's more an attempt to hold to this sub's general lightheartedness.
I listen to a lot of progressive and psychedelic rock and whatnot, I always think "I should really get stoned and listen to this, it'll be great." And it's just ok...One time I was folding laundry high as a kite and listening to my regular spotify playlist when the live version of Take Me To The River by the Talking Heads came on. My undershirts, the music and I were all as one.
I ordered one volume of the Negima manga off a used book site once. It had one of those stickers in the front, directly covering a character's face, and "Property of [insert library name here]" permanently stamped across the top of the pages in big, dark letters. Used book site, I know, but I was not happy.
&gt;I spend about 90% of my time alone too due to illnessDude are you me?Living alone sounds awful, like even when I don't see people for days it's at least comforting knowing there's people in the house. Pets are rad, I have allergies and illness means upkeep can be tricky (and I imagine that could be a problem for /u/stufstuf if you're busy with a job/study or whatever) but there's different types that can fit different owners! My hedgehog died like a month ago and it really makes you realise how helpful animal friends are.I remember being confused that being alone could make me *more* self conscious but somehow it's the case. And I think it's annoying since when I finally get out I can just be worrying about my skin. This seems like a really sweet supportive community who'd be cool if people need to talk. Sending love~

I don't know if anyone has recommended this yet, but you can do a lot of your grocery shopping online these days. A lot of areas have local "pick up your stuff and drive it to your door" type services. Also, Amazon Pantry has gotten very good for everything but fresh produce.There's also services that will deliver meal ingredients to you so you can start cooking and becoming comfortable with that aspect of food management. https://www.freshnfitcuisine.com/https://www.hellofresh.com/Etc... those are just what I found on a quick google search. With how much you're already spending on Fast Food, you're likely to find a service that at least saves you a little each month. Good luck!

Ahh, if it's the Retina Macbook (Pro?) then more than likely I would think it's a MLB issue. As long as you rule out any possible software cause, that is the only culprit left from a hardware perspective.Is it still under warranty? Might be worth booking a genius appointment.
Make me laugh with either a ridiculous random comment, joke or story. A guy I met who is a firefighter was telling me about his first days as a paramedic. (in Canada firefighters are first responders and go through paramedic training) He and his partner were picking up an extremely drunk aboriginal person and taking him to the hospital. The patient was  extremely drunk but conscious and aware of whats happening. Anyway the guy I met is driving his partner is in the back tending to the patient and the two of them are playing a game of who can call the patients "daddy" the most during the shift. So his partner is checking the guys blood sugar levels with some device and says to the guy " ohhh you got dat high blood sugar diabeetus, thats why you so sweet daddy" I laughed hysterically then we spent the rest of the night playing the "daddy" game. Now were best buds.    
Head over to /r/DIYbeauty/ where the lovely /u/valentinedoux/ is moderator - don't make up a recipe use a tried and trusted one from someone with a science background/ experienced and skilled DIYer. Most blog recipes are very poorly designed.Although L-AA is one of the most popular active for newbies to DIY it is actually one of the worst to choose, it is picky about its bedfellows, the pH and the percentage matter greatly. Ultimately formulation and dermatology are sciences.You need a scale accurate to 0.01g which can be found from cosmetic ingredients suppliers or elsewhere (often sold as jewellery scales). Warm your water slightly to get things to dissolve. If you did not have an accurate scale you may be trying to get too much baking soda into solution.
You know, I never got the whole "imagining them in their head" I mean its not like some fucking fantasy with a crazy plot, its just a burger resturant with a funny family. Is that so crazy?

My favorite youtube channels as of late have been [Extra Credits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) and [Total Biscuit](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1Ms_5qBTawC-k7PVjHXKQ).My favorite podcast (though that isn't saying much since I don't listen to podcasts all that often) is the Co-Optional Podcast hosted by Total Biscuit. It's pretty entertaining and about gaming so it doesn't get much better.

I had a friend for over 10 years. He was my dads best friends son. Thats why we were friends for so long. He was an ex-gang banger from brooklyn. Later turned medical doctor. Very unique guy, in that regard. 100% asshole. He lied all the time to me. He berated me in private and in public. Extremely selfish, couldnt put himself in other peoples shoes, ever. He used to say the if u cant handle me at my worst u dont deserve me at my best line. Anyways, i cut him off last year.

It was bad (I played like 3 games with it) but boy was it fucking fun. It was also the same time that scuttle crab gave you a vision boost if you stood still and sitting there autoing a turret as valor would give you vision making his split pushing amazing.
Heh, thanks. Though I AM realizing something. With cyanogenmod they seem to have an issue with wifi and bluetooth on at the same time. Using wifi on my phone is a hassle, once I disconnect the watch and turn bluetooth off, it works 100%. That might have been the problem.
*Crap.* "Well, er, we're peaceful. And we could be useful. We might need to work together, at least for now, to survive. At the very least, we're resources, and you wouldn't want to waste us, would you?"My colonization plan is, so far, not going very well.
Did this once, I had all my lights on and I was playing video games with the windows open for an hour or two. When I finally got up to take a break I had hundreds of the damned things all over the inside of my windows, on my walls, and all over the ceiling. Vacuum made quick work of them.
If I had the time I would pull over and have a chat,"Actually, the law specifically states that I don't, is there anything else you want to bitch about"
Meanwhile, I have 3 GZLs, a Verdandi, and Sasuke, but none of the rest.If only one of those had been an LZL, my LMeta team would have had a nice boost.
Agreed. Matt Smith is in the movie, he's fairly famous after playing the 11th Doctor and on a EW magazine with the Terminator cast, they said his part was secret. So there's definitely a catch.
Not sure. There hasn't been a new one since one late 80's. The most recent attempt was the Keck Outriggers which would have expanded the keck interferometer, legal action delayed it until NASA pulled out. Pan-Starrs 1 was built recently on another island and faced great resistance.
I think that the word has a much more general meaning, that is doesn't (shouldn't) have to be prejorative, and that you can have a literalist interpretation without being fundamentalist. In short, I think it completely misses the mark when the two are identified.
I understand that vegans make up a pretty small portion of even non-dairy milk sales... But the reason people buy non-dairy is because they can't have dairy for some reason. Like, people with allergies or lactose intolerance will not have a use for this either. What a stupid idea. 
I don't really remember anyone getting it on a solo laner in the SPL, but I do agree that if it were made substantially cheaper it would almost be guaranteed to be picked up by solo warriors.
&gt;Final Edit: I just realized the top 1/2 of your post left me with a bad taste. No need to include it. You might be frustrated but no reason to berate other players. Monster Hunter is a pretty high learning curve game and it isn't that easy for people to grasp the concept of the game and its mechanics from the start. Especially since you are talking about high-rank, which is 'early' in the game.Yea,  I'm not going to lie it was pretty tasteless comment on my part. But it was my way of venting since I never kick people when I'm hosting, and I never vent in the chat. Part of the reason I wrote it was to express my impatience, rather than attack other players. It's actually really awesome that Capcom does this, since HR 7 is full of weeder monsters that can destroy unsuspecting players. Such as Teostra. At the same time it can get frustrating, because a battle like Dalamandur takes a bit longer and it can easily go down the drain. Thanks for the advice!

I think Drupal is lacking the construct other frameworks call "migrations". in Rails/Django/other, the database is modeled as a series of "migrations": statements that change the database, like inserting columns, adding indexes, etc. a good framework can automatically generate the inverse (although it may be destructive).in the real world, it's often much more complicated: we deploy code that supports schema and schema+1, run data upgrades when a resource is loaded for the first time (or as a background task so we can drop schema-1).
I don't speak two languages, but I did start using the DuoLingo app, and let me tell you, that app would be completely impossible to use if I weren't using swiftkey. So slick.
I'm not bitter. I'm just saying in Europe growing up we used to laugh at religious Americans. It was just a statement. Sorry if this upsets you. As long as you believe it who cares huh? We can laugh at you and you can continue to believe. Everyone is happy. I never bragged about Europe though. He got weirdly defensive and bragged about America. All I've said is that we laugh at religious Americans over here. It's just a simple truth. 
Had a girl lose her shit on me and went on how I'm a racist because I said that Robert Downey Jr. Was attractive when we were taking about sexy actors. 
Not really. Death's Bite's free Whirlwind is way too good to replace. Turn 4 Death's Bite into turn 5 Patron or turn 7 Deaths bite into turn 8 Warsong+Patron are amongst the best plays you can make with the deck
Did you just argue that doing things out of weakness is worse than intentionally doing them? Come on. Seriously? I know you don't believe that. We disagree and that's fine but that was a ridiculous statement.

This season's runways are actually outstanding in my opinion because you can take literally any outfit from the final tally and say "Oh, that was for Death becomes Her", or "That was Jetset Eleganza" compared to previous seasons where you have someone like Darienne and you have to wonder "Hold on, what week did she wear this?". The themes are actually interesting and give a lot of room to show versatility, and they're much more identifiable than past seasons' runways. Remember season 4 when there were two runways we didn't even get a theme for? Remember generic themes like "fabulous drag" and "girly drag" and how lukewarm those runways turned out? Even this season's "Green" theme was less than stellar, because it was very broad and only a few queens (Like MKD and Pearl) actually had solid concepts for their looks aside from the color.
You'd be literally exploring other worlds. Yes, the road there will probably long and boring, but you'd go to places never before seen by any human, maybe even make *first contact*.If that concept doesn't seem absolutely exciting, you're not human.

Shilliew is too blood thirsty for the most violent prison in the world. Megellan didn't think Shilliew would behave and fight with his former coworkers. Megellan thought Shilliew would just kill everything he saw until something brought him down. Shilliew is like a predator, he wants to hunt. The prisoners are his favorite pray. It wasn't too hard of a stretch that Shilliew would kill prisoners and guards, but he would probably want to kill more prisoners before he was taken down. The fact he let Blackbeard walk without trying to kill any of them was one of the biggest surprises in the arc

I think the best plan is a plan that you actually want to follow and feel confident that you can complete.  If the 3 day plan is just for her and the Endomodo plan is for you, maybe let her try it.  Happy wife, happy life.  But writing her own 3 day a week plan probably won't help her get in great shape.  Maybe suggest the FIRST program because it has been shown to work for some people and it would do more for her than whatever she comes up with on her own.

Nahh i think the announcer was just inferring through his body language. I feel for Stras because it seems to me like he gets less run support than the other pitchers but I'd have to look at the stats.
It would be even *better* if Rand was President, but that doesn't mean it would be wrong to explain how the police response to peaceful demonstrations is what ends up leading to the riots simply because something better could be done.It is against my conscience to criticize someone for speaking the truth.  Rand said something true in his interview, and you said something true in the above post.  When people speak the truth we should agree with them regardless of their political views.

To me, those people are no different than feeders. One does it for some fucked up sexual gratification, the other does it to keep the money rolling in.

**It's because the CPD is over using them.** They basically have **hourly fly by's** for the east-central, south and east side of Columbus (basically south of Morse rd and east of the I-71). The CPD started doing this in 2013 with the intention that constant fly bys' would somehow deter crime (it hasn't). It just annoys residents since the pilots fly the helicopters at such low altitudes. Another reason may be [b/c of dragnet surveillance as is being done in Chicago and over other metropolitan cities](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/planes-mimic-cellphone-towers-collect-data/), basically the region the pilot flies over gets all its' data usurped, stored and digested. The CPD should get drones, I don't how residents would feel but I doubt the CPD would give two shits. 
I see a fair point here, but the Students are supposed to trust their teachers, and them talking shit about students, and having them potentially find out would completely kill aeny kind of relationship. 
I didn't say anything to the contrary. In fact, they are supposed to be able to have discretion as to when to give a warning vs ticket/arrest. The problem is there is no oversight for this. Even when they do get brought before a grand jury, it is in the DAs best interrsts not to fight for a conviction

 I once had a puppy when I was 6 or 7.. We were inseparable as any young outdoorsy girl and her pu ppy would be. We always went out exploring the woods around my family's yard together. I went to go climb a tree and the limb snapped causing me to land on my sweet puppy, killing him. I carried him bloody all the way home crying... I'm pretty sure I haven't climbed a tree since then and I am 21.  Accidents happened.. But at least all of his life he knew love. I am sorry for your loss.
Why would jaden/jadie be from standard when the duel academy is in fusion? Which has been shown to 1) fusions which were a big thing in GX 2) have different colored academy jackets (red, yellow and blue) 3) (and this really seals it for me) their elite group is called the obelisk force, they wear blue jackets, and are considered the best students at academia, very much like how obelisk blue was in GX.Plus as far as my knowledge goes, the god cards don't exist outside of yugi and jadens world, so naming them after obelisk doesn't make sense from any other world

I don't have a problem with indigenous culture or people honouring/respecting it, but it's not my culture. Australia is about Multiculturalism. I come from an English background and I was born here. Aboriginal culture *isn't* my culture and if it was considered that I would see it as a bit of a snub to my heritage. 
For some reason it claims my card is 1.2GB, I assumed the rest was used up by my system or something.edit: So it turns out my card is 1.2GB, huh, news to me, I have had this card for four years and somewhere along the line I forgot it was not 2GB.
Assuming it's a base ex-l without nav/DVD, good price. If it has either of those, great price. Only concern (personally) is driving a 129K mileage vehicle, so as reliable as Hondas are, do plan for some repairs.

Yeah, it's pretty interesting talking to other people outside of the tech industry about this. Nobody even thinks about this kind of thing as a threat to their job, or how it will affect society at all. Even if they know all about the tech, they'll say it's cool and that it'll really help a lot with things. They just don't make the connection I think. I work at a company where almost half of our 30,000 employees are truck drivers, and another large chunk of them work in warehouses just moving product around. I also have a friend who drives a UPS truck. None of them feel threatened or worried in the least bit. They all think they'll be retired by the time that happens anyways.
It's just for a while... Like when you LOVE coffee but stop drinking it so you can measure if it's reduction relieves your migraine a little? Although, as I said I would start asking my partners to use condoms instead if I don't want to stop in that A/B test period
I didn't really know who to answer, but I read the thread. This is honestly so gross. Rape culture is so integrated in the lives of men that it becomes something we excuse bc it's assumed that masculinity is in need of constant relief. Instead of dismissing this case, whether it's true or not, we should focus on educating ourselves about consent (the absence of no is not yes/ no means no/ she can change her mind at any point/etc).

^ pretty much this. You can tell who they are too because they'll start dorans ring and be useless for the entire first 20 mins (laning phase) as she stands in the bush or autos the enemy support while sniping cs. When she isn't doing that, she'll be rolling over dying in her free time, giving free kills to the enemy adc because she thinks its a solo lane and she  can kill 1v2. Then when she is 0/8/2 or something she'll afk because 'omg noob team can't carry' with her only item completed in the 20 minutes being sorc boots (because no gold income).
Seems like maybe you could just, I don't know, not click on the fucking link then? There are a lot of posts in this subreddit I don't care about either, like second league English football, but other people clearly care because they're on the front page, and I don't go out of my way to go post in there *HEY FUCK YOU GUYS THIS IS STUPID AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT!!*
&gt; it gives a very confusing message.does it though? from what i can understand they basically said hey we aren't cool with this shit so don't post any more of it, "are you going to pull my catalog" and they said "no we would never do that to an author" aka no you can leave the stuff you have up but don't publish any more. that doesn't seem very confusing to me; she already got away with publishing it and people are already letting it chart, so they're being nice enough to let her keep it up. all they're saying is write different stuff in the future, it doesn't seem vague to me

I agree. If we benefited overall from the EU, it would be worth being in. But we don't so it's not. Perhaps, if the aid money for the poorer areas of the UK wasn't sent on the scenic route via Brussels (a trip from which around 60% of the money does not return), they might be far better off (on account of having had over twice the development funds). Instead, we spend billions on building airports every 6 feet.

&gt;Sit down, strap up, practice like the rest of us did.So you want him to practice for 2 years?He's right, the skill level gap between new players and vets is nigh impossible to cover. You would have to play the game for months on end to come close to the amount of hours the vets have put in.
I think the modified version of FE8 made by this sub has Myrhh with unlimited stone usage, if my request went through. I sadly never got to play it but I can imagine her being game breaking if that's the case, if she isn't already.Great unit, fun to use, good support logs, nice dragon sprites and a little more breathing room in stone usage. It's also nice for her that she isn't hated on so much.

There's basically 2 ways to do Shiva EX.  Either your tank eats a stack to make sure that she's always facing the right way going into bow phase, or your tank dodges and DPS/Healers better be ready to move just in case she isn't facing the right way.Honestly, if you have good healers, it's just better for the tank to take a stack to prevent multiple DPS/Healers from dying since the stacks will fall off before the next bow phase.  Requiring only one person to have raid awareness will always be more successful then requiring 8 people to have raid awareness.
Umm... do you possibly have Anorith's, Omnynite's, or Lileep's hidden abilities? If you don't... hmm, that ok, and in that case if you could trade me a poke(doesn't really mater which), but could it be one with it's hidden ability?

I mean I've been trying to use Brighton more in my runs and he's gotten pretty good at times. Best thing I do for him is save the speed ring for him so he can double in Manster and then scroll him up once out. But there are still always other units I deploy first.
Yes, but it's not how much total responsibility you have; it's how much responsibility each individual is taking upon herself, as well as the intensity of that responsibility. Think about it, if you ran a company would you rather pay 100 people $50,000 per year to give you the result of x, or 1 person $5,000,000 per year to give you the result of x. Hiring the 100 people will entail a much higher cost of collaboration and collective decision making.

a couple things to note on trump.  he said his playstle for the paladin deck was mostly focused on "best case scenarios" in regards to the quartermaster.  that "it could be good" and also noting that it isnt necessarily correct to think that.  also,  when someone asked him to take out harrison,  he said there were lots of weapon classes being played ATM and harrison was a good card to keep in.   when i stopped watching trump today (durign one of his deck evaluations) he said he hasnt played enough games yet to determine if its good or just bad,  and that he wasnt drawing particularly well.
See my other response re: moral relativism. His personal life may inform his political one, but isn't relevant to the debate on the issues he espouses. This would be no different than releasing pictures and chat of a gay activist to demonstrate his depravity in smearing *his* work.
It really depends on the current state of your character (is it fully geared? Is the bank fully upgraded?) and what you intend to do in the game (do you want to buy the most expensive sets? Do you want to fully equip alts with endgame gear? Do you even need a fully upgraded bank?).
You can still have spotting during pregnancy too. Usually its just the cervical mucous plug falling loose, but if you're having regular periods (and not with heavy clots), it could mean the pregnancy is fine but you're still having a tiny bit of period.It's like how some women taking certain forms of birth control will have no period, and some will end up with really mild periods instead.
there was this one dude i worked with he was a bucs fan and he was really shitty and lazy and complained all the time so i want winston to be a bust. fuck you jammel seriously you were a lazy fuck
So much for staying vigilant.  I'm betting that Gabe will slowly have something similar creep in to squeeze more money.  Personally I don't think I'll ever be a fan of Valve or Steam again, just a customer.
Thanks for chiming in! Yes, that's pretty much the case - kids are different, she's a friend, so I wanted to hear her story on what kinds of things the kid would do that would make her not take him to the concert, that's all. :-)
On my end, it was meant as a compliment. I'm thinking other folks might aim to hide such evidence through sanding, etc. But to my eye, the "raw" quality of it was a big plus.
Actually, only dynamic mics do this. There are other types of microphone that I would imagine would be much less susceptible to the influence of a large external magnetic field (e.g. condenser mics).However they will still contain metal which could be slightly problematic. It must be possible though since there is generally an intercom in MRI scanners so there must be a microphone near the patient's head somewhere.
I am not sure how anyone can claim that the bible is an intelligently written guide to moral right and wrong. Of course if you never actually read the bible I guess you could draw this conclusion.I might suggest you sit down and read the book and get back to us on how moral it is to hate and murder and do violence upon people that do not follow moronic rules.
I took that final ahead of my roommate at the time (she was in another section of the same prof so she was like the next day's exam period or something). I just told her "Good fucking luck" and let it go at that. She came straight back, went to her boyfriend's apartment, and drank an indeterminate amount of Southern Comfort. 
I don't think you know as much about modern China as you think. About the only thing they've improved apon recently is their carbon footprint. On top of that you don't seem to have a very in accurate  understanding of the US either, just what you here on reddit which your just taking as fact without any study it appears.
You already sound addicted, maybe not to hydro, but to getting high in general, a poly-drug addict.  You shouldn't use drugs to make you feel better when you're upset, that's a really bad habit.  I recommend you stop using the Hydro right now, only use them once or twice every other month or so and if you can't do that then get rid of them before you find yourself in deep shit.  It's very easy for opiates to become a problem because they don't feel like a problem, they feel like a solution....to everything.  If you really need to get high that badly use something else, opiates aren't something you just take whenever you feel like it, because you will *always* feel like it.  Fuck getting in trouble by your parents dude, getting caught smoking weed is much better then getting sucked into opiates. Using opiates takes immense will power, more then most people have.  
Yeah that's why it says 15 - 25 minutes. The first time I made them (the ones in the pictures) I cooked em the full 25. I've found since then that about 18 - 20 minutes is perfect for how I like em.
Mine generally are not very loving, and the pose of the OP's cats will never happen. 2 of mine are siblings, and they just don't really care for each other that much. The 3rd one has alienated herself because she's pure adorable evil.
Basically you play Block N Load (Jagex's newest game, currently free for 2 days) for 5 friendly matches and you'll unlock the Cogwheel override for RuneScape (Cogwheel being the robotic character there). Additionally the dwarven warsuit outfit will be a skin for Cogwheel on that game.
If it's just the "remixed classics" aspect of the song you like, Pogo does a lot of other movie/Disney remixes, and I can also heartily recommend anything by [melodysheep](https://www.youtube.com/user/melodysheep). His [Symphony of Science](https://youtu.be/zSgiXGELjbc) is amazing.
Take 5 d6 and roll them. Lowest score wins. Everytime you roll your dice you must keep at least one of the dice then reroll the remaining. All 3s are equal to zero. Always gets everyone involved.
I hope you can get your medications sorted out. I personally like Wellbutrin a lot for many reasons if you want to look into it, but of course everyone's different.Also I meant to respond to the "now i've basically fucked that all up" in your OP: I don't see it that way. You can go forward living the way you want to live. You don't have to punish yourself for bad decisions made because of a real illness. It can be okay to forgive yourself and move on from there. 
Then I would suggest getting the proper color scheme blocks for radiant style weapons. Currently your gold is rather brownish, the white on the bow itself is unnecessary for a radiant color scheme. My suggestion would be try to keep the main color consistent. Maybe keep it attached to itself throughout instead of just random colors here and there. ----Radiant Gold RGB: 211,158,34 or 248,204,80Radiant Blue RGB: 61,255,249(References from Radiant Corona helmet)
This is completely wrong, you should be going the extra 30% damage to mines at least and spamming mines in the bushes leading to a shrine or at the shrine. EZ
Think of the original sentence as being TSVO (T is the tense). In VSO, the verb moves up to that tense position giving you VSO. But if we introduce an auxiliary you start with TSAuxVO. So it's Aux that now moves up.    Compare with English:  John sees the dog. vs. John *does* see the dog. Not *John do sees the dog.

One thing I try to do is make sure I don't rely on perception and disable traps for everything. Mix it up a bit and have puzzles and traps able to be solved by a number of different methods. Think about all the skills available and figure out ways to implement traps that use them.That said, don't pigeon-hole individual traps so they need a specific single way to be solved. If you're doing one-shots, then you don't know what talents your party will cover. Make it general enough so that they have options, don't just make it so that, say, you absolutely need spellcraft to know which spell is protecting the next room, or swim to cross a moat, etc.
Twelve/Clara is my favorite Doctor/companion duo as well.  There had previously been a tie for my personal top spot (Ten/Donna and Four/Sarah Jane) but they got bumped down once series 8 aired.

I was out to visit friends and see the A's play the royals a few years back and went to Arthur Bryant's, which compared to anything in California was excellent.  That and the Negro Leagues Hall of Fame and it was a good day.  
Story of my cousins and I at Christmas:4 of us playing No Thanks. Two get really competitive and really, REALLY want to win. After the fifth game, we had a good knowledge of the game, and I thought to myself "I'll show you how it's played". i.e. Three of the four players are going hard...We end up giving the win to the fourth player, who had NO CARDS in front of her, and 3 tokens left...She got a score of -3 just by watching the us fight.
yeah, I wouldn't have thought much of it if it was 120Hz limit, but 90 is 54hz less (over a third of max) than what the monitor is capable of. I wonder why such a limit exists. 
Why do you think they aren't reducible to maths? Have you simply never heard of statistics?By the way: even 'hard sciences' have truths that are not mathematical statements. They also have mathematical statements that are known lies.
Primaries vary by state - Illinois has an open primary, so as long as you are registered to vote this form should cover your bases.  They may release a new form for 2016, but they have not as of yet (that is off of your IL official website).  I'd just check back every few months to see if anything changes.  Here is IL official site:http://elections.il.gov/Default.aspx

My bestfrient and I have very emotionally demanding jobs, and usually smoke after a long day. Everything in my personal life has gone to shit recently too, and I'm constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack. Made this as a joke after a lovely after-work sesh today to remind myself to take my medicine and relax a little. 
The only thing nexon has really done is add more guns. Period. The game is mostly dead, they're just trying to milk it for what it's worth before Dirtybomb and CA2 come out
Agree, it's never complete.  I don't mean this the wrong way because everyone has their preferences, but over time you may gravitate to some more interesting stock.  IMO platy/guppies are somewhat mindless despite their bright colors.  They don't do anything cool solo, and don't school together as a group (besides bang).I've learned the hard way that it's best to focus on one or two great schools (tetras, rainbows) complimented by some fish that are interesting for reasons other than their schooling behavior.  IMO Bolivian rams, pearl gouramis, BN pleco, Gudgeons, Garras, angels, kribensis, apistogramma can be very cool alone.  Cory cats and Loaches obviously are very cool but prefer groups.This is not at all meant to be a criticism by the way as it's all about what you like and preferences will change over time based on your experiences.
As presented the stuff is pretty shocking and unacceptable.  But I think naming and shaming would be a better approach here.  Also the full paper and review would be better than snippets.I do have an impulse to wonder if this story is out of context since there is no naming.For example, maybe this quote is relevant to the study:“Perhaps it is not so surprising that on average male doctoral students co-author one more paper than female doctoral students, just as, on average, male doctoral students can probably run a mile a bit faster than female doctoral students"I don't know what the study is about but presumably their study found that male students co-authored more papers than female ones and attributed it to sexism.  Maybe the reviewer had a point that alternative explanations weren't considered or investigated.
When you say agricultural science is it agronomy, animal science, crop science, something else or just everything? Anyway I wish I could remember more chemistry. 
He was one of the original Kerbals when the game first came out in early access. He's the first in the list of the kerbonauts  (Kerbal astronauts) so he's always the default on any vessel. Also, from [here:](http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Jebediah_Kerman)&gt;He is the only kerbal with the attribute badS = True. Short for "badass", this makes Jeb's facial expression and general reaction be "happy" ones in almost all situations which might trigger "afraid" reactions in the typical kerbonaut. Whatever effect his dead-middle ratings for Courage and Stupidity would have on personality are overridden by his sheer badassery.
I've got Professor Messer's videos and i'll give them a try, I avoided his website because its layout seemed pretty unprofessional to me. I'm currently throwing together my own study guide too since I actually have to cram (I have to take both tests within the next 8 or so days)I honestly never watch the lectures, but their tests and labs are okay. My only game breaking problem with TestOut is they use Silverlight and for school I use a Chromebook flashed with my custom Ubuntu-like OS so there is no Silverlight.
Also, I'm totally sure there's no way at all any of the Ayyteam denizens might also have a GG sockpuppet, or vice versa. They're two completely different groups! Nobody in the history of the internets has ever used an alt account to stir shit up with plausible deniability!
It depends on why you're complaining. If a worker isn't doing their job, the management should be informed. If they're actively being hostile to customers, they need to be removed.
This game is bittersweet for me.  It killed the traditional locked camera angles, and the unique feel that Resident Evil had going for it the entire series.  Feels like the last actual resident evil game to come out was Code Veronica.  Everything else has been shit, just with RE4 was just a one-off spin off.
This would depend highly on the antiviral though.Interferon seems particularly bad. http://www.rxlist.com/pegasys-side-effects-drug-center.htmValacyclovir has very few side effects though.
There was a recent research that pointed that "Squirming and fidgeting helps ADHD people concentrate". So I believe this is an extension of that. I feel the same too.
Yes. I'll phrase it a different way. The first case is like a cue ball hitting another ball. Assume this is all on an ice rink. The second case is like a cue ball hitting a ball-sized blob of play-dough. The first case goes faster because the cue ball reflects off.

Think of it this way, if you give birth at exactly 40 week then we would say that is 9 months on the dot. If you start another week (40+1 or further) then you have entered your 10th month of pregnancy. You wouldn't be exactly 10 months, just IN the 10th month. I am struggling to explain effectively. 
I have a corsair 750d case. Should be pretty easy to figure out. The only thing is that I already have a fan where the second HDD cage should be, So the airflow would do a 90 degree bend to line up parallel to the 295x2.  Does it matter if the airflow sort of collides perpendicularly inside the case?  
It happens all the time.  People often join 2 or 3 different groups at the same time to make sure they have a group.  The problem with that is they obviously don't give a shit about what happens to the other groups they leave hanging.  As long as they get their game time fuck everyone else!
I have no one else to tell this to so I'm just going to write here that I just did a really satisfying tempo 10k in 36:19, which is nearly a minute faster than I did in a race a month ago. I got into a really good rhythm and definitely could have gone longer. Thursday night tempos are almost invariably my best runs.

I will talk to my husband about it again.I think talking about maintaining attractiveness in marriage brings up a lot of insecurities in a lot of people (including me! Hence the post :D) but I didn't expect this much anger. There have been a lot of comments about my personality, including one about me not being "the brightest bulb", when all I wanted was some advice about my relationship! I really didn't mean to offend anyone.
Hey, so it sounds like maybe you are jumping from program and diet to program and diet willy-nilly, because other people have success with them.  I feel like you don't have your goals in mind, or maybe you don't know your specific goals.  Can you tell us some specific goals you have in mind?  It's ok, breathe a little, we don't hate you for anything you have said.
It appears you've never had to read statutory definitions of roadways. As defined in [the Nebraska Revised Statutes](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=60-332):&gt; Highway means the entire width between the boundary limits of any street, road, avenue, boulevard, or way which is publicly maintained when any part thereof is open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.

I agree, but in the meantime .. I discovered that Olay Poogle works and that's what I've been saying for months.Seriously though, all my devices have names and I'd prefer to call them by their name, especially when the alternative is having my tablet, phone and Chromebook all respond at once.
Or just,  you know,  not care about people running around trying to hump you in a video game.  It's the most pathetic,  pedantic issue I've ever seen addressed with seriousness. 
Then you have been vastly under-exposed to the people in the conservative faction of Christianity.  Your experience is severely out of balance with the actual distribution. 
Your abs will still be there when you get to 130lbs. Its unlikely that they will be much more defined though.When you went up in weight from 130lbs to 145lbs was that intentional? Were you eating and doing ab workouts with the intention of adding 15lbs to your midsection?If so then yeah your abs will be fucking ripped if you cut down to 130lbs but if not and that 15lbs was passively gained or unintentional then when you do finally reach your goal weight of 130lbs they may only marginally look better.
This will, of course, need to be added to the [List Of Things Supposedly Caused By Global Warming](http://whatreallyhappened.com/WRHARTICLES/globalwarming2.html).

Sorta? CCGs kind of fall into one of two camps: wildly successful or low profile. This isn't to say that the low profile games aren't liked or played, just that the existence of things like Magic/YGO/Pokemon severely warp people's perceptions of what a successful TCG is.
There are several YA books that are not dystopian novels! Are you against Urban Fantasy or anything like that? I always recommend **The Archived by Victoria Schwab**. It's an urban fantasy that a completely new take on urban fantasy and the afterlife. 
Then you are actively avoiding seeing the errors. Look at Microsoft update and read some of the notes on the patches.. small things like 'ad user can elevate privileges to that of domain admin trivially.'My favorite is when MS sends out patches that break things like oh say fonts.. How does one manage to break fonts -- and more importantly how the hell is font-rendering in the NT kernel space? Linux and BSD boxes are hosting a very large chunk of the internet and they are a huge target space - to pretend like they don't get targeted would be equally as bad as saying MS patches never seem to be 'important.'  Linux machines aren't innately secure if they are misconfigured or left to bit rot with little maintenance and TLC, but they also are very reselient even as a massive target as long as configured and attended to in general.EDIT: and as far as 'crash the os' -- that means lost time and money, calling a spam bot somehow infinitely worse is silly.

As long as she's complaining in English, I don't see any problem. Use the opportunity to teach her the wealth of colourful expressions available in English for expressing distaste with something. If nothing else, you might get some interest by explaining the literal meaning of expressions like 'Osaka sucks balls'.
There is some science to this, if I can recall correctly. From what I heard that when people lose a lot of weight out of the blue, their body might store more 'energy' for a reserve, which makes you gain some weight after losing an initial load.Please call me out if this isn't true.
Ha, to each his own I guess. It's not that my sets at planned, it's just I have 2 or 3 songs I know transition well in my crate. When I'm using Serato, fuck it, I can find 100 tracks in the BPM and key for a seamless transition. I guess is all about the night you are trying to make and the music the crowd wants to hear. If it's a disco set, I'm going to make it super tight and seamless, if playing jazz, well, I do whatever the hell I want! 
I have played the campaign, and it's pretty much just OK. Good CGI though. I haven't completed it because I can't play the Goo for shit which is why I have turned to online play.
Oh it's a line from BBC's SherlockBUT basically it a sociopath feels less empathy, has antisocial behavior, and is narcissistic.

As a tank, I take full responsibility for killing people when this happens... *However* there is actually plenty of time to dodge this mechanic if it *is* turned.  Her position is locked into place before that Titan-like set of plumes/bombs go off, it's just that people don't realize she's locked into place until she's already drawing out her bow (which is in itself enough time for a lot of people.)
You could always try lifegain/life drain with [[Selenia, Dark Angel]]. She's monetarily cheap, she goes back to your hand before you can pull some board wipes, creature saccing for value, etc. You can go easily Angel tribal or the typical slow drain that BW does well (Extort, Sanguine Bond...). Add in [[Crovax the Cursed]] and you've got Vorthos all over the place!
You wouldn't have any greater of a chance of a freeze/shatter than a ignite or shock. It would all just be based on what stage of the damage it would be at the time. Most of the time you would just get a physical explosion.
So it serves to reason that AP could be buffed to make up for that somewhat.  It has little effect on the tank in CW or when anyone competitive is playing it while helping the average pubbie who won't load gold by default.   The 15cm E100 gun has just as bad pen, but it has much better stats otherwise, which makes it feel much better to use in your average pub game without having to load gold to compete against most anything with solid armor

When I was a kid, before all these lame teacher restrictions, we had a teacher named "Mr. Clausnitzer". He was *old school*. If he caught you sleeping, he'd KICK your desk and scream, "WAKE UP! IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SLEEP IN THE HALL!" And would then proceed to pick up the desk to force you out of it.After shuffling you out of the classroom, he'd say, "When you are ready to join the world, knock on this door. Until then, sweet dreams sleepy head."He taught ancient history. He was the BEST teacher I ever had in child hood. I don't remember many of my other teachers, but I'll never forget that old dude.
Feb 21, 1988. Here's a website that claims to have a link to watch it - I make no claims if it will work or has a virus or whatever.

Hey pick whatever class you think you wanna play since you posted first or we can play a few rounds and see what we think you'd be best at. And honestly we can always swap roles around as we see fit once we get a full roster. Feel free to add me on steam and I'm gonna make a group once I respond to everybody's posts to organize things a little better. And I'm fairly new too but I feel like I have a decent handle on things, if nothing else I can point you to some guides to start with and we'll go from there. The only issue may be the european timezone (sorry I didn't clarify that I was US in the post) but I'll check how far off you are and we'll see if the schedule's gonna work for you.
Download Zandronum, from here: http://zandronum.com/You may need to copy your Doom wad files to the proper directories.Zandronum is for multiplayer.It has a server list. Its pretty active. Some games are more active at different times. For example: You wont always see people playing Who Dun it, or Deathmatch. It depends on the time of day.Once you are playing Zandronum, I suggest you switch to openGL mode in the in game options. It makes some of the games like Who Dun It look nicer.Here is a site with mods: http://www.moddb.com/games/doom/modsA great mod to get is Brutal Doom. For a challenge, try the MLG mod with Brutal Doom.
Seriously, there is some prime material in these comments right now. I really hope Seth Rogen or someone on his staff reads all of these ideas. Definitely some good inspiration.

I watch around 20 movies a month because of Moviepass and I love it. Only pain is the 24 hour rule. Calculate how much you would watch with how much tickets are at your theater, and you'll see if it's worth it
i know, its like the number 1 factor in my losses but i cant help it, i love my stats, maybe take 25 out of strike and put it into stam for one more bar would work?
Ehh... Maybe you haven't had a chance to run with a group that totally consists of min maxxers. If I were to allow the multiple applications of debilitate to stack like that, my group would do exactly that. I've got a few that will scrounge the deepest darkest, vaguest places in the rule books to maximize their damage potential. But its like you said, up to the DM, though I can't think of any DM I know who would interpret it that way
Ah yes this is me to a T. I'm genuinely happy being sober. I always get ripped on for being the sober one at get togethers and events but I love experiencing events where I can utilize all of my senses to their fullest.  The hangovers aren't worth it either. 
Honestly, I wish we could just take the Heroes from both games and shove them into DotA 2. I mean, there's a few copies that we can get rid of. It would be a hell of a game though. Maybe when custom games come out... I might actually take the time to do it myself.

Lekadol mi nikad nije pomogao. Kafetin odmah pomogne unutar dvadeset minuta. Ketonal samo ako je bol baš ubitačna, ali ide na recept. Najsigurnije i najjeftinije je kafetin uzet, kutija je 18 kuna. Nesmije ga se pit previše jer se može pojavit ovisnost, tri tablete u tri dana max.
Yep. It's not just you. A lot of folks on Mturkgrind reported the same thing.https://www.mturk.com/status/Hope you don't have a lot of stuff queued up. This might take a while.
I have read stories that google used to seek to buy binned RAM on substantial discount. It wasn't good enough for consumer grade, but the [BADRAM](http://rick.vanrein.org/linux/badram/) patch to linux effectively allows you to kmalloc the bad bytes and throw away the references (intentional memory leak) so nothing legitimate can use them.
No, he was supposed to save Starling City, and that list was meant to help. Once he learned about the Undertaking, he realised he didn't have to stop all the people on the list.
&gt; Edit: I'm actually surprised that I wasn't downvoted to fuck for not supporting that body positivity and HAES bullshit.This is primarily a reddit construct or rather the idea that it's widespread is anyway. Reddit is literally the ONLY place I've even heard of any of the fat acceptance BS. Oh and that said, being skinny doesn't make you healthy either. Weight is an important factor but it's still one of many. 
I was being a little tounge and cheek. Theyre pretty cheap since youd literally only need micrograms. Its just getting them to emit light can be tough - PL modes need shorter wavelength pumps just like any phosphor, and EL modes havent been robustly developed yet. Also theyre super sensitive to oxidation, so hermetic packaging is a must. So yeah, not really great advice for OP. I think he'd do well to buy tons of the cheap stuff then hand bin them. Glad to know his pwl target though =)
Source for that? I'm genuinely curious as say a county or municipal officer hasn't been sworn in by a different county government and is therefore not granted the privilege of enforcement. Also variance and unfamiliarity with non-homogeneous laws. 
I can think of about 3 or 4 moves that contend for best and about 14 or 15 that contend for worst. That's Brian in a nutshell IMO.Javy was really bad especially given his prior track record in NY and what the Yankees gave up to get him, but I think other moves involving big money have had a more severe, ruinous effect on the organization (namely the CC extension).
Can I be the first to say something offensively racist about this?If no one does, then The Internet has not done its job.Something offensively racist.  there.:)
They're usually not THAT bad but I have 2 really intensive classes this semester AND job/internship interviews at the same time. It's been really tough this time around. 
You would have to create your own software to achieve that.  The G5 uses bluetooth and according to the meeting notes has the algorithms built into the transmitter.  Theres no reason you couldn't code your own pebble program to achieve this. I feel that accuracy and safety is a huge concern, its a little different from nightscout. 
I hope you realize that I have no idea by what you mean.You've insulted me to prove no point. I'll stand up and say, I don't understand why you are so angry. Explain it to me, to be honest I'm not "particularly concerned" with you either. Edit: are there not poor, huddled masses, refuse in America? I'm concern more about them than anyone trying to be immigrated, but when we take each other in, we have a responsibility, not self-responsibility, to each other...I proudly accept to be my brother's keeper. And that IMHO a is an American tradition. 
Like any other steel common in knife making, if it has a good heat treat it will work for most users. I have a bionic 2.0 and it holds an edge well, a little difficult to sharpen because it is very hard, but mine polishes up well with a little elbow grease. D2 isn't stainless, but it isn't highly prone to corrosion either. That said, you may want to get the acid wash version to help protect the blade, especially if you live in a humid environment or are a particularly sweaty individual. All in all though I really like mine. It took some breaking in but it is a good flipper now.  My main complaint is the way the bevel flairs out where it ends at the ricasso. Pretty annoying while you a sharpening. Other than that it's a great small edc.
lol I'm not sure what the uncle Phil revelation is so I hope you fill me in.  She likes anime along with regular toddler shows. She is also a fan of Gravity Falls. Her other favorite non Gundam ones include Wolf Children and Ponyo. As well as other Miyazaki films. As far as her age. There are plenty of worse shows she could see. I don't usually let her see any deaths of people. But I have no problem with her seeing something blow up if she's watching it with me. Besides too much of anything is a bad thing so her watching a bit of Gundam among a lot of Doc McStuffins and Strawberry Marshmallow lol I'm ok with that too.

Alright that definitely piqued my interest. I found that Tor.com did [a nice piece about *Wood Wife*](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/07/the-language-of-stones-terry-windlings-the-wood-wife) (tagging /u/lrich1024). And it looks like my library has a copy :)Also, while you're here, I have a rec request re. Patricia McKillip. I loved *In the Forests of Serre*, but for my next McKillip I'd like something more quiet and tranquil, if that's possible. 
Maybe I'm just assuming this is the same as the days they talked about cutting where it was cutting increases in spending off the budget. Maybe I'm wrong in this example but they've done it before.
**At least** 181 donors essentially rented influence US foreign policies and the State Dept by giving large, poorly recorded, donations to the Clinton Foundation.
I bought all of them because I think 590 RP is a great deal for 3 recolors. I don't know what everyone's problem is about these Chroma Packs. Go get a job you le fat reddit nerds.
Have things changed that much in the last 10 years?   I used to work at a PC shop building and repairing them, I've probably updated 1000 or more BIOS, a working OS was never required to do so.
I could just feel his blood boiling. and although I don't condone his aggressive behavior, ie throwing those punches, I think he was being assaulted at that very moment and how you react to an assault is just instinct and self defense. She picked up the papers, she moved toward him, he simply put up his hands and ended up grabbing a big chunk or hair then went with it. She started swinging, and he swung back(his biggest mistake). 
That's true but I think as a libertarian one must consider what stances they feel most strongly for/against.  If you are a libertarian and more concerned about ending foreign entanglements than say continuing the Bush tax cuts, well, Bernie might just be more of your guy than Rand, who seems to be all for the war and the drone strikes, much like Obama. 
At least in the US, a big thing that I'm getting used to is this concept that a lot more places are able to serve beer and alcohol outside of bars. There's the obvious ones like restaurants, but where I live now coffee shops also serve beer as well. Shit, I just discovered last week that there's a coffee shop/bar that's also a laundromat, so I now choose to get drunk there while I'm doing my laundry. Coupled this with me living in the Midwest for a couple years has built up my tolerance higher than it should be, I have no problem nursing a beer and just relaxing for a tad. That being said, I don't think I'd go to a bar necessarily. Those places for me still have the weird stigma that if you go and sit at the bar alone that you've got nothing better to do (which is sort of confirmed in my area ). I know this is not always the case, but it's a hard stereotype to crack. 
&gt;The capacity to be led into a cult is does not necessarily imply a weak will.I've spent the majority of my adult-life in an incredibly powerful organization that actively suppresses independent thought and encourages unquestioning obedience. Perhaps I am holding people to too high of a standard, but I disagree with this statement.You can be respected, feared, and successful without being strong-willed. Those three attributes accurately describe most politicians, yet they tow the party line as hard as anyone. In my opinion, you can't join a cult and kill yourself at the cult-leader's command and still be considered strong-willed.
I wouldn't use it even if it was popular. My height was, is, and always will be a debilitating factor in meeting women. But it will never ever become a problem in a real relationship again. I don't know how tall my soulmate is, so I'm gonna go ahead and not limit myself to women my just height.
Ok so is this the thread where I say how awesome the NFL Now app for XBOX One is? Because it is.I still have to keep ESPN on another TV though because of delay.
The "middle" AR tier fared the best. The middle tier are the ones with 8 impact and 88 rate of fire (the others have 2 impact, 100 rof or 28 impact, 68 rof).The faster the AR fires the less the damage reduction hurt it, but the 100/2 versions have always sucked, so the ones like Up For Anything and For The People are the best around...though still, not much reason to use them in my opinion.
I mean. She isn't dealing with those feelings that well, yeah, but she's finding a second surrogate mother figure. Thats healthy and good. Plus, do you think Garnet is a shitty mom...?Also, this title of this arguably is a spoiler.
It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good.  I imagine many stories fail the test when there is a male protagonist, especially in truncated media like movies, because you don't have enough time to develop every background element to the same detail.  That would be an active hindrance in surreal works.Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead.Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.  Most romantic comedies for example are all about sex relations so it may strain a very fair screenplay to change in order to "pass", unless it was done in a very trivial way that would seem to undermine the point of the test.
Remember when comic artists got to work in newspapers and got paid and treated like semi-important people? And got books of their work published?Thank you internet.
Wait - so youre telling me that public servants cannot or will not live in a city with an incredibly high cost of living relative to the socioeconomic atmosphere?STOP THE PRESSES

No coaching staff would have mattered. He does not even do simple things high school coaches drill into their players. There is a reason every single team passed on him when we released him, The fact that he can't even stay on a practice squad with his speed and size is fucking mind blowing and shows how inept he really is.
Here's a couple of pics I have of my settingshttp://i.imgur.com/PWTM3fA.pnghttp://i.imgur.com/i3Ov6pf.pngI'm not sure what my fps is exactly, because I haven't bothered trying to maximize my performance since I'm forced to run at 1440p for now, so I haven't checked. But I can tell you that even at 1440p, at those settings the game is perfectly playable, and it looks great for the most part. The only thing that really sticks out to me as looking really bad is the pop-in, especially when driving and the anti-aliasing.
As valid as your points are, none of those things mean 'blowing it' in this context. Unless there's reason to think otherwise, one would interpret 'blowing it' to spoil one's chances of getting something, which kids normally achieve by misbehaving.More to the point, kids aren't mentally developped until mid-teens at best, so having attachment issues or being easily frustrated really isn't something a child should be punished for.
Yeah, MDJ pushed him around the possession before.https://twitter.com/ZachLowe_NBA/status/593930507508920320 edit: Well it's not a good reason, but it's not like Giannis randomly did it. 
&gt;Not sure if A/C was an option when new, but maybe finding used OEM parts and refurbishing when necessary may get you A/C in that price range.    A/C was an option when new; My factory stock TR7 has AC.
STOTTS doesnt develop players!!! at the beginning of the season our roster was so loaded with talent and stotts continued to use his starters more than anyone in the league (or close to the most). If we played more CJ, and Meyers off the bench we might not have seen so many injuries to our starters too. And then at the all star break what do we do?...f**ing trade away our two biggest sparks off the deep bench (thrill&amp;Trob)to get a 6th man in afflalo that CJ was better than all along!!! im serious CJ&gt;afflalo even before afflalo got hurt. But stotts never new that because he didnt play CJ. IF WE PLAYED OUR BENCH MORE WE LIKELY WOULDNT HAVE HALF THE INJURIES WE HAD. IMAGINE OUR TEAM IN THE POST SEASON IF WE PLAYED AN EVEN MORE DEVELOPED CJ AND MEYERS OFF THE BENCH AS 6TH AND 7TH MEN! AND IMAGINE IF WE STILL HAD T-ROB TO BANG AROUND WITH THOSE MEM BIG MEN FOR A FEW MINUTES A GAME!
As someone who has done the JD plan on lower mileage, I'd really recommend focusing more on basebuilding.  The entirety of Phase 1 is base-building for a reason, and he wrote that for experienced athletes, not for you and me.Honestly, I did two cycles of JD and while I saw improvements, I felt I would have made more if the majority of my miles weren't workouts/long run.  You're training for a marathon and you are currently at 25mpw.  You don't need speedwork.
I am 28, and there are lots of people my age who are doing "stupid things that will leave consequences on their life."  Age and maturity are very different things.

It's simple, really. [Out of all the strings ordered primarily by length and secondarily lexicographically, print the first one with 12 chars that's lexicographically larger than "Hello World "](http://slexy.org/view/s20GFu6lh5).

Is that what really happened?If so, yeah I think it's obviously hypocritical. Double standard and things. No need for you to get your panties in a twist for that though.Edit: I mean, it's useless to waste energy in that, it won't achieve very much. Just get on with your life. 
It always used to piss me right off, you would be out witnessing, and after you've been around the block you meet up with the others, and stand on the corner of the street while you have a discussion, some people stand halfway out on the road oblivious to any traffic driving past.. Or with their kids halfway out on the road... No fucks given.
&gt;Most meals 40-80.&gt;In order to help control my sugars, I watch my carbs.You may be watching them, but if you were a diet controlled T2 I would consider that level very high.

I assume the dog would be wearing it... A coller is less intrusive then a dog needing to be muzzled in its own back yard.We had an issue with a husky that lived two doors up jumping on their shead and getting into everyone elses gardens, she was adorable and did no damage but its a little shocking to look in your garden and see a massive dog. They moved the shead away from the wall and the dog managed to find a way over the small area of the fence (the back gardens are on a slope) and so they use an electric fence to keep the dog on their property and the dog only needed to wear it for about a month before she got the message and was moved back to her normal collar. 
Thanks. I built it years ago when I was ignorant in the ways of panel lining and weathering. I guess at some point I'll have to do something about that. 
This. Due to a bunch of different reasons I have found myself to be "running on fumes" today. I haven't been home other than to grab clothes or sleep for six days and all six days have been filled with social interaction. I woke up completely miserable today and have remained miserable. Even had morning sex and hated it. I forgot my own phone number twice and have asked people at work to repeat themselves because I either zone out before they finish their sentence or I straight up don't even hear them.Got home today and I thought I was going to throttle my SO when he said that he wanted us to go to the bar to watch the NFL draft. He is the complete opposite of me in this area. I can literally tell him 15 times that I NEED a day at home and he just does not get it.
There is a building with a "pyramid" style top (with a red light on), could this be the closest there is to the Aztech temple? it's right near the penis building.man, things are getting so exciting around here lately.
I've done this once when half my team (in classic) was AKF. It really pissed me off, but then, while battling another enemy bot (i'm plasma), the medic next to me was moving about, pointing his guns around, and sat there watching me die. That is NOT cool people
I'm not saying if a sub gives permission for their dom to be dominant, then it's their obligation to be dominant. I'm saying that it's important for the sub to feel like their in control, to be able to shut it down at a moment's notice. That's what BDSM is all about. 
The comedown at the festival is sketchy and uncomfortable too. Trying to buy a burger and fries was the worst experience and I just wanted to roll up into bed.
Poor fashion sense and they usually talk too much and seem eager to force their opinions on others.Go on downvote me because you don't agree with my 'opinion'. Oh the irony..
I think it'd be more accurate to ask, can you give your opponent the opportunity to yield?  Think of the fight between Brienne of Tarth and Ser Loras Tyrell.  She could have finished him off but she let him yield.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArHAQzH10GUIf one champion had the other champion on his back, pinned down with a knife to his throat it'd probably be acceptable to give him the opportunity to yield.Probably not a good idea if your opponent is The Mountain, though.
I just watched Granderson's RBI since I'm going back and forth from the thread to other reddit stuff and had a thought. Doesn't Granderson seem much happier with the Mets than the Yankees? I watched the Yanks for a couple years when I was living with my dad and I got to know the regular lineups by the time I moved back to the city and started listening to Howie. (I've been a Met fan all my life, but I didn't watch regularly until last year because LOLMets)

When you smoke salvia you need to use a high heat like a butane lighter with a blue flame to release the active chemicals in the drug.  The best way is to do a large hit out of a bong or a pipe and hold it for 3 seconds.  Once you release, especially if you're using something as high as 32x you should start to have the full experience.  
Yeah, do me a favor and delete.If you really want to submit it.  Make a text post and explain what it is.Also, I put that spam link up there because reddit has been a real bitch lately and your breaking its 10% spam rule.  I see account after account getting shadowbanned right and left for breaking this rule.  cheers
Only because he has to if he wants to get anything done. If there were another dominant party who voted and platformed in a leftist way, you can be sure Bernie would vote with them. 
I think Tennessee would be better off with a proven guy at the QB than another young guy leading the offense. If they can get more picks out of it for position players, all the better
It means an officer should use appropriate force that other officers of similar size, training and experience would use. The ladder method was singular for all cops, which doesn't work. A 110 pound female cop will probably draw her weapon if a 175 pound gangster was preparing to fight her, whereas a 175 pound male cop might be more inclined to use a baton on that same gangster. It just means that officers are allowed to use any force option available to them, so long as other similar officers would also use that force option. Its from Graham V. Connor.
Thank you. Everyone has been wonderfully supportive so far, and I feel very accepted and comfortable here. It is very refreshing to find people who really get it. I really appreciate everyone's words. 
Hmmm.  Sorry I got a little lost in what you were saying, but using your TL;DR, what If I sent 24 phones on the same day?  Most likely none of the phones are in the "right" box but somehow they get them.  Not disputing you, just not understanding.
I have regular sized hands but using ctrl to mod keys is unnatural to me.  I hold alt with my thumb and turn my hand with my fingers on 1-4.  That gives me easy access to 1-5, r, a, d, alt+ 1-5, and alt+ q-t, a-g, and z-v and two extra side mouse buttons.  26 keybinds in all have been plenty.  
Maybe I should answer with a throw-away, but what the hell...1. passing each other out. 2. swallowing long pieces of dental floss then pulling them back out- We called it Bodyflossing.3. Sewing thread into our skin. 4. Playing doctor only amounted to swallowing gravel for pills.

Fine. Account for every penny you earn. What are you spending it on- did you **need** to spend it?  You can live off a beans and rice frugal diet and spend less than $25/mo on food. Are you living somewhere you can't afford?  Do you need the car? Where else is your money going?You say you take home $1200/mo and your bills are $1100. If that's accurate that's $100/mo in discretionary (wants) spending. If you don't have a cushion where you're not getting overdraft fees, then you don't have money to buy a thing you want. Your credit card debt is around a third of your yearly income, that's high.How about your car note, and your student loans, how much is left on them? 
Yeah, let me tell you something. I'm from Los Angeles. I go to school in northern Indiana. I go home for the summer in 8 days, 15 hours, 45 minutes, and about 30 seconds.But, you've peaked my interest! What job are you looking for? And where would you be moving to and from?
I'd recommend the ipv mini 2, though you'd have to get an 18650 battery for it. I ordered mine from myvaporstore and they let me select the batteries I wanted for it. Or you can buy the batteries on Amazon for cheaper. You don't even need a charger for it, USB charging!

Amiibo: PitIn Box or Out Of Box: Doesn't matter since I take my amiibos out of the box anyway.Packaging: Any is fine! I'm not picky.Reason: Pit's been my favorite Smash character since I first played Brawl years ago, and I'd love to get his amiibo. KI is such an underrated series (if you haven't played Uprising, go play it; you won't regret it), and if not for Pit being in Brawl, I would have probably never played it at all. Sadly, I missed my chance to grab a Pit amiibo when they were first released, not knowing the full extent of the amiibo craze at the time. I don't think I'll ever find one for a reasonable price, and I can't afford to pay the price people want for him now. I'm a poor high school student lol.Thank you so much for holding this contest. I might not be as active in the amiibo community as most of the people here, but I love seeing people like you spread the generosity. Best of luck to everyone entering =)
I currently have 0 saves, and am thinking about punting the category altogether if I can't swing a trade for at least a couple in the next week or so.  Why do I have 0 saves?  Auction league, internet cut-out after the 10th round or so, and I didn't select _any_ of my own pitchers save for Scherzer.  Good news is, I'm actually in 3rd place overall despite being in last place in both saves and ERA.  Never punted a category before though, and I'm hesitant to do so.Other SPs I have:  (Keuchel), Scherzer, Anibel Sanchez, Pineda, Salazar &amp; Cosart
My father's side of the family will often use the word, "learn" instead of teach. For example:  " Don't worry I will learn ya to drive."   Most of the family drives using both feet on the pedals as well. ENRAGES ME!
They're gonna need a tech-savvy green bureaucrat to hack into the NSA spy-satellite network and scan the bottom of the oceans for Gem signatures.They're going to need *Peridot*.
Perhaps you will. Making sense of subconcious urges after the fact is a pretty human thing to do.  Many are mindful and more are regretful. Most importantly - they *vary.* A lot. Still worth more than any silly generalization based on the latest fad in pop-psychology. Please note that you aren't going to get all that many competent psychs writing artilces like this; this is deep in Dr. Phil territory.
Something Jay said made me think this as well, maybe in the Intercept interview like he made it seem like the worst thing was that he couldn't do anything which I felt was him sort of saying the worst thing is that he didn't do anything.
I read an account by a family member, and he said that she was running down the stairs laughing, chasing after somebody and bumped the old lady. Old lady fell down the stairs, hit her head and died. 
So where was Winston, I gather he didn't show up, but there's not even some video of him putting on a Bucs hat? That's kind of fucking lame, I've never seen that happen before.

I actually have a missing signature on my signed wall art, and reading this post just inspired me to call and square it all away. Well actually it was a birthday present from my fiancee and she called for me. Alex helped her out, now we are just taking care of details!

Riven becomes straight up scary right now late game with Cleaver.  She can build tabi or mercs now more easily, giving her an off-tank sort of build with her shield and HP from cleaver and MR from Maw, and also shred tanks late game even harder than she did before.  
Who said anything about the world? You asked a condescending question and got a truthful answer. It's not *hard* to say hi, but people like me don't feel the need to talk to someone just because they're right there. My roommate seems to think me walking past her room to go to the bathroom is cause to start a conversation. I can see someone walk past me and not have any urge to interrupt their solitude.
Funny how I would consider myself a good size muscular wise and probably in the top 10-20% concerning general fitness at most gyms I go to. You don't have to be intimidated by douchebags who drop/slam their weights down every set or attempt to impersonate a woman giving birth to hate them. None of that shit is needed. 
I have a bunch of mods and RDAs but I just bought an eGo One last week and it's now my go to device.  I wish these were out when I started vaping.  The flavor and throat hits are amazing.  It's very small and compact as well but chucks something fierce.  It comes with a 1 ohm (mouth to lung) and 0.5 ohm (straight lung inhale) atomizers and has all she'll need in the box.  The airflow is amazing and can be restricted for cigarette smokers coming into vaping.  Hope this helps.  They also have a mini version and a mega version (coming out soon).  I would highly suggest it as a starter kit.
I've been building my city - Providence, RI - but there aren't any assets of any buildings from the city. I have the highways, most roads, and waterways accurate, but not any buildings D:

Sorry if this comes off as rude, but... you learned relativistic quantum mechanics as an undergraduate? What kind of topics did you cover?Beyond the history there (the Dirac equation was only written down around 1930), I'm partly surprised because the only undergrad QM textbook I know of that does cover relativistic QM is Shankar's book, which is fairly new and is sophisticated enough that many schools use it for grad QM.EDIT: I just reread your comment and have a similar confusion: You learned GR as an undergrad too?Again, sorry if this comes across as rude or if I'm just misunderstanding you.

Yeah, I get that sometimes "You must not like food."Of course I like food. I didn't get to be over 300 because I dislike food. I cook from scratch very often. I just can't eat much. It sucks that loving food = eating a ton of it. 
Mmm, baby. I'd love to milk your boyclit with my slutty little lips while Daddy fucks you from behind! &lt;3 I gotta warn you, I'm a little greedy with Daddy's yummy gooey cum :P But maybe yours will taste just as delicious :D
The bands can't get wider or thinner without being uncomfortable. The watch can get thinner and keep the same attachments for the bands. The question is if the magnetic puck will last five years. 
Yes it was indeed not hit by the nerf that hard.It was 20 damage to the head before, now its 19, against anything more than 200 health it required an extra shot, but you don't often end up getting all headshots anyway.Probably the most viable AR out there right now.
I'm pretty sure the gun went off accidentally when he was getting it into place, IE before it was aimed purely at his brain. I think it was an accident before he could do it on purpose, is what I'm saiyng
well, now you summoned me.i actually recently filled in a few holes in my collection, including the biggest one, the perfect drug set. i think i now have at least one release for every halo that exists on vinyl. so i have to re-photograph. maybe this weekend.
Yeah... It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't that bad surely? (And I don't think it was particularly better or worse than her Trixie one)Is it really just that? :)

Amiibo: ShulkIn Box or Out of Box: doesn't matterPackaging: doesn't matterReason: xenoblade chronicles is my favorite wii game of all time. I've beaten it several times on my wii and am working through on my 3ds at the moment. So of course I wanted to main shulk in Sm4sh. Basically, I tried to get him but couldn't find him and refused to pay more than retail value. So my reason isn't unique in any way, it happened to a lot of people. Regardless of the winner, props to you OP. You're a cool dude/dudette. 
Hey now, the Bucks were counted out of the season in preseason, week 1, all star week, and even the start of the playoffs. This whole season was nothing but a success. 
Noticed he deleted all of his posts, even the one where he accuses the guy posting of being a scammer because he has "no flair". LOLTrue colors gon' shine
I watched this episode with my family last night, who usually doesn't 'do' absurdist comedy.  My dad watched the whole first season and thought it was trash.  It had them all in stitches.This is by far one of my favorite episodes of the whole show.  Even their one-off sketches were great.  The bonfire sequence, the Knot Store, and the Allergy Pride Parade were all amazing, but the Battlestar sketch had me in tears watching it.
Wow that's quite a difference in price... That foundation is sold for ￥6,000 which is like $50 atm. Yet the Amazon price is over $100. Talk about price gouging. 
I think it would be more akin to "selling out" if we were to write and record music in a style we feel we've outgrown just to appease people who preferred our first album. We're really proud of the new stuff we've worked on. We stuck with the same independent label who released our first record and funded all of our recording expenses with money we earned touring. I'm not exactly sure how that means we've gone too far with the mainstream promotion. We've been playing music a long time; more publications are aware of this time around because we literally spent the last 2 years packing all of our shit into a cramped van and sleeping on people's floors so we could drive all around the country and play our songs. We've turned down lots of high-paying shows and endorsements with companies we disagree with ethically. If that equates to "selling out" then I guess that we are HUGE FUCKING SELL OUTS
&gt; You can't prove a negative.Perhaps. But there is no reason for me to believe your claims might actually be true if you do not prove them to be true. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence#Proving_a_negative
I get the "lolcutler" view on it, but it's not just because he's Cutler. 6 years remaining on a $125m contract for a 32 year player is not something you rebuild with. Thankfully for us, Jay is untradeable.
My sister and I just had this conversation a few weeks ago.  She's on the west coast, so I'm not spoilering for her, but I texted her that Ben and Bailey will make her think of us.

Motors that are "29%" more efficient would be a huge engineering breakthrough.  This isn't a gasoline engine we're talking about where you're getting less than 50% efficiency to begin with, and all kinds of environmental controls limit your efficiency.

Last two times I got one, that sticker covered the numbers on the back I needed to activate.  So I just wrote "VOID" on the old one then took the sticker off.
they removed their lurker for semphis and then hiko comes in and is a better lurker than semphis so now they have to decide what role they want semphis to play and they decided professor_chaos's role. professor_chaos showed some great play recently and will be picked up by a decent org again i think.
Nice review. My main gripe with the Sig150w other than the bland/boring UI is the finish. It's so slippery, and I don't like the way the silicone sleeve looks.
He must not be the kind of police officer who wants to see improvement in law enforcement.  But the other kind.  The cover up our shooting dogs kind.  What a wanker of a mod. 
We also have a lot of people clocking in to jobs and surfing Reddit. If those jobs could be cut to parttime and paired with parttime jobs elsewhere, we have more than enough people. I could be wrong, of course, but it seems like most people with jobs are struggling to find things to do.I look at even places like Google. They redesign their gmail experience every few months, never improving, just shifting things around. It's almost like they have too many engineers and not enough work for them. Again, I could be wrong, but I doubt it and it is interesting to think about.What I am firmly against are backroom deals like the TPP done in smokey rooms where nary an American can influence the rules of the day. Smells **sniff** unAmerican.I would like to see a possible US where the imigration flood gates can be opened. Let those Mexicans nobody wants make GM cars, let them make Fords, but pay them well for it. Rekindle the American dream.
Well, Battlefield 4 is actually a game that does make very good use of the AMD multicore processors, but it's true that overall it is probably better to go Intel.
Why in the fuck do you insist on dating guys like me? I love to go out, crowded bars make me feel like I am in a people snuggy. But noooooo you wait until I'm emotionally invested in you before you start giving me shit about going out so much. so I give you your alone time, and go out by myself but MEOW IM NOT SPENDING ENOUGH TIME WITH YOU??!?!?!?1!!? So I can't got out anymore. But heeeyyy we're in loooooovvveee, right? 
&gt;The only thing they say not to do is: don't cause pain, physical or mental, in your pursuit of enlightenment and knowing.what do you think of the kinda antics zen masters are known for?like mazu kicking that guy in the chest or yunmen breaking that guys leg in the gate?
Jagex reminds me of EA. IE: Lets release BF3 and BF4 with a shit ton of bugs and then take approximately one to two years to fix 3/4 of them, leaving the remaining bugs just for the lols
You're not; there's a reason they get called bravangelists. I'm a total convert and even I'm at the point where I feel if they're a woman on reddit browsing women-centric subs they've probably already heard about it. 
That looks interesting. It looks like it is made from shell tempered pottery. What part of Georgia?  Near any of the bigger mounds (Etowah, etc.).? I spend a lot of time walking and finding Indian artifacts in Georgia.  I know some pretty cool stuff has been found. Don't assume it is modern. I would be very careful with that thing. Or, it could be mass produced junk from some 2 bit stand in Mexico.
About friggin time. I've been wanting something like this for years. I hope it comes to my area along with a male strip club because honestly, everyone wants something nice to look at sometimes, why should guys and lesbians have all the fun?
My only blind buy is 24 Gold by Scentstory. Bought it online after hearing all the hype around it. I get mixed feeling about it. On one side, it lasts a hell of a long time on skin and is pretty unique. On the other, sometimes it can be sickly sweet smelling. I don't regret it at all though. It's great if I do one spray around the abdomen and use it during the colder seasons.
nah, my FL license blows. The laminate is crooked, the picture is way over saturated by the flash and the picture quality sucks too. honestly FL does a shitty job of making licenses.

We finally get to see badass resistance leader John Connor in action, he's even played by a good actor, and they make him the villain or something? great
This struck me too, because I have declined those things in the past, and you are right. It's always weird and awkward. From now on I am going to make sure that I take this into consideration. 
&gt;Sure. Good point. But there's a big difference between the big, important coming out conversations with close friends and the casual "do you have a boyfriend" "no I date women" "cool" conversations... Definitely! They're completely different tones. One is life changing since you're saying it outloud to someone who cares about you, and the other is casual/in passing.&gt;I'm just saying, you don't have to tell every single gay person you meet that it's okay they're gay...I get you man, I'm just trying to view from the perspective of someone who would say it in the way you mentioned in the scenario you presented. They probably don't know how to respond, and so they just want to let you know that it doesn't impact your friendship. Again, I normally just say "nice dude" or "ya man", but apparently I'm weird haha. I really couldn't give two shakes and a zip who my friends fuck, as long as I don't have to deal with drama or pick sides if I'm friends with both of the people.
[Laravel supports this out of the box](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/bcdaf02a0285d6cdfde3c72d23b075388ce64cd0/src/Illuminate/Session/Store.php#L371-L379), so your example should work:    Session::put([        'user' =&gt; 'Bob',        'colour' =&gt; 'red'    ]);
I love that you are the way you are.  It speaks of your gentle soul.  And I am so sorry that these things happened to you.  It's tragic.  I really wish you had reported that guy and were tested.  Regardless, I think that you may need to hold off on being so caring and nurturing until you know more about the guy you're with.  I don't know for sure of course, but it seems like these guys get what *they* "need" and move on.Hopefully someone will come in here with actual advice.  Being a guy, a hetero guy, I really can't tell you anything that I would feel confident about.  I know that you should think more highly of yourself.  Of course you can have a relationship with a 'normal' guy.  That's not out of the question.But please don't take anyone else home that you don't know.  =/
It's a bit obscure to be sure... but there is a way to get it without.My previous ones have all been solved within 5 mins so I thought I'd trust the skills of my fellow subredditors and make it hard. But if people are really stuck I'll put up some extra bits in 15 mins.
There is hope for us yet lol.Different strokes and all. Just because we disagree does not mean we can't respect each others opinions. Self entitlement in gaming is getting out of control. When I played Super Mario Bros 2 in high school (yes I am that old) we used to get to class each day and we would tell each other how far we got in the game. One day my friend came in and told us he beat it. We were bummed but happy for him. He was the first to beat it in our group of friends.Today they would have just given everyone an unlock all levels code you could buy just so everyone could feel like they won. 
I answered the first one a few days ago, but here it is again. Sorry about the repeat. I had a friend that I had been fairly open with. I resolved to never lie to him. No matter how much I want to. My family really wasn't in a position to help, they have their own stuff. It is one of the things that put me over the top. 
So. Let's take a look.Top: A player that hasn't played competitively for over 1.5 years. Jungle: A slightly above average NA LCS jungler. Had his best split 2 years ago in EU with the at the time best offensiv mid-laner in the LCS as well as sidelanes that never lost lane by themselfs. Mid: A SoloQ God that has never played on stage and has an unclear character/team-spirit.ADC: You misspelled Forg1ven.Support: A player that wasn't even Top 2 at any time of bis career. Also washed up.If that is the EU Superteam EU is fucked and should be switched out for Japan at Worlds. 
OSU did, they had a "Fastest Buckeye" where students race and then are invited to race the players during the Spring Game. Ezekiel Elliot smoked the competition, Braxton came in second.
Missing needs to give feedback. sound or animation. you could speed up the first part of the animation and slow down the end, so it appears like the character was striking hastily and needs additional time to keep the balance ( working against the momentum of their own weapon). this would work as a system on top of existing animations.a sound would probably be better though. in the past i was very often not sure if i missed or was desynced and that won't go away entirely for those who need the old system.A lot of people also have a pretty bad idea of the importance of accuracy. the fact that you essentially have to understand the crit/accuracy formula and the implications is a pity.
I doubt that they would be willing to give away exotics that easily, other than the "chance" that you get from doing end game activities. I would like more cosmetic stuff though.E.G. Solo the nightfall, the flame around your head is white rather than blue.
I think the scariest part of my experience is having been in your position and mindset when I picked up the first drink.  It was cough syrup belonging to my girlfriend on the bedside table.  I had no intention or desire to drink.  I was 17 months sober and life was good.  All of a sudden I was chugging half a bottle of cough syrup.  I immediately had that itch for more that no amount of alcohol or drugs can satisfy.  I was back to drinking within 24 hours.
Dear /u/RumpleAndBelle,I am SO sorry I forgot about this! &gt;.&lt; I'm not sure if you just resent it or Amazon automatically did.

If changing that doesn't fix it do you have any other ideas. I upgraded to Windows 10 to see if it fixed it and still no luck. It really wrecks my head
Paladin and Priest can use some of the cards pretty well, but i do have to say that most of the cards only work if you build a deck around them (see grim patron warrior).
The one in five statistic has a very broad definition of rape including forced kissing: http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/10/24/statistics-dont-back-up-claims-about-rape-cultureAccording to the DOJ, rape is down 60% from 1994-2010. That is nothing to sneeze at. In 2010 rape was a little above 1%:http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf
It's like this with all battlecry creatures that have different attack/health values. I just tried it with Ironbeak Owl, Murloc Tidehunter and Injured Blademaster. The latter one pretty much kills himself because it becomes a 7/4 and dies to its own battlecry. My guess is because Maloriaks hero power is a passive one that it activates before the battlecry resolves so it's not a particular case with your Vol'Jin scenario. 
That would be my base assumption... but the fact that they have a living organism of every time period living inside a Dyson sphere the size of a small solar system and the main protagonists are running around space inside a battle moon... all my base assumptions went out the window :)
High school :))And thank you! Honestly I still do have a lot of feelings for my ex. We actually held hands yesterday because we sat close to each other on this bench at school and it was sort of a gradual thing, but I mean holding hands has gotta mean something right?And is your username a reference to hands like houses album unimagine? If so, you just became my best friend
I used to get ingrown toenails all the time. The best way I found to deal with them is right after you get out of the shower, clean under the nail really well, then clip it so that there are no sharp edges left. I used a tiny pair of nail scissors that came in a four piece nail set, clippers, metal Emory board, scissors and tweezers. Then if there's still a little edge file it smooth. And then just keep an eye on it. Clean under your toenail regularly to make sure nothing's getting gross. It may sound weird, but you can also sort of clip the skin around the nail bed, like they do in manicures. I don't know what its actually called, but just kind of remove the dead skin and that helps too. 
I haven't played the game so I don't know, but like, are the zombies supposed to just be total jerks? I mean giving you a few seconds to catch your breath before trying to gnaw your face off just seems like common courtesy to me.
I was sitting on a bench at dismissal time with a coworker. She looked at a 1st grader and said, "Do you know that girl? She's very pretty. She's definitely an oreo." I didn't know what she meant so she explained it was a cute thing her and her assistant liked to call mixed race students... Yea, real adorable...
For people who don't know, the trick to getting max height jumps on titan is just to double tap the jump button. No pause, no delay. Mash that jump button twice as fast as possible. It's counterintuitive, because you'd think you want to wait until your unboosted jump is at its high point, but give it a shot and you'll see the double-tap results in the greatest final height.
There are plenty of other players good enough to take over Mariota. He's only become extremely popular because of all these rumors but there are plenty of more valuable players other than QB and they need to revamp most of their roster.
Absolutely not. I haven't been that high on him ever. But as a second round that's a value, since he is rated as a first round talent. Highly doubt that he lasts that long though
It was this exact Westminster catechism question which led to my atheism.  I was disgusted by the idea that an all powerful and perfect God would so need to be glorified by the humans that he had created for that sole purpose.  Pretty pathetic, particularly when most of those humans he created would be tortured for eternity by him for failing to sufficiently stroke his ego.  So thanks to my study in preparation for baptism, I realized that Christianity was nonsense, got sprinkled, left, and never looked back.  
We all breath the same air and we are all born of blood and tears. I know people who come from war torn lands and places so poor that parents sell their children, and they make the most of every opportunity that crosses their path, and they thrive. And then I know lazy able bodied people who put no effort into life and who are only interested in an easy buck, then blame everyone else for the life that they choose.
Please confirm that we have a deal so I have your word as a man that you won't reply to me. I won't reply to you. You won't bother me. I won't bother you. And let me know your alt accounts so I know to avoid them as well.
I'm adding current deadlines, but these can and most definitely will change (a few states already have).  But i'm going to keep this as up-to-date as possible for people to reference.
I'd say you should if you are sexually active, especially if he's not your first partner. I'm speaking as someone in the US, I know other countries have different pap smear guidelines. I wouldn't say it is a bad thing, I guess you could consider yourself lucky you haven't had an infection or anything warranting a vaginal exam before as they aren't the most pleasant experience to go through. But it's a necessary thing a sexually active woman must do, IMO. 
You already have the 3d view of the ship to the right of the radar showing damage, that could also be used to show select area shield strength, as an idea.
Yeah when I was young teachers would tell my mom, "wow he's really brilliant" and "you're sons mind is a gift and he is going to do big wonderful things for society." Turns out I'm pretty fucking dumb. Don't listen to these people, OP. They know nothing. 
You still dont get it? They did recieve the money, how can you prove them wrong? Without a transaction ID which you should at least have in your mail or similar, or in your online banking. How can you dispute their claim that they did not recieve money?Thats why it is a "cheaper source". They are all frauds.
You bet!  http://imgur.com/nEZeoKAThis one has been used for a while, so it's starting to get a bit "fuzzy".  It still works well though.  I used a size G hook, and made a chain long enough to wrap around my finger.  Then I just connected it, and SC'd around and around until it was the length I wanted.  Super easy, and very helpful!  (And a great way to use up some extra yarn!)
Yeah, I mean the way the IRS would probably look at it is you should be saving to pay your taxes every year that you expect to take advantage of the loan forgiveness program.  That's why I bring it up, because the worst thing would be to expect that after X years you will be debt free and end up with a huge tax lien.  Still a great deal, even if you do pay taxes on the forgiveness.Regardless, good luck to you!
Pretty sure that means that students will be able to see what school assigned apps are available for school pre-payment and download. They still have to go through the steps to download it themselves.Another blog though mentions installation via SCCM or Intune, so I'll have to watch that and how it unfolds.

Which tree from Ferngully? The one at the end that grew around The Leveler? If it was that one, I'd have liked to see that tree near your house. I wonder if it's still there. Your story also makes me wonder about the land your house was on. What the history is of the whole place and stuff.
As long as they don't do anything to the student, I fail to see the problem. If someone is hot, they're hot. As the old adage goes, "Age is just a number."But seriously, don't try to enter into a relationship with someone that age because that's fucked up and illegal.
No, they're pieces of a bigger pie. Just like coreutils, gcc, glibc, etc. Are also part of a bigger pie. No one's been able to explain to me what the threshold is for including “+“ in the title. Why shouldn't we include "+systemd," for instance? 
Novelty is endlessly pursued, and I think that in itself is a fantasy in dire need of deconstruction.  It's the one thing I dislike about the game, Chalice Dungeons.  Thematically there are things there, but the method of delivery... patterns give way eventually.  Novelty requires perspective, rather than literal interpretation.  "It's new to us" should mean as much as "it's new at all."
Shotgun is as effective as anything else, people just aim it wrong. When they put it under their chin, they tilt their head back, putting the brain out of the direct line of fire.

Ah yes, the old 'the cops wanted Adnan' theory. Cops are always looking to frame the teenage honour student over the poor black man who sells weed.Classic.

I'm betting the dead guy was the prisoner, because it's always the prisoner in the obligatory end-of-Prison-Break fatality. My mandatory prisoner died at the end story involved him landing in the damn chopper blades. [I recorded it.](http://gfycat.com/SorrowfulGrayBullmastiff) It was funny and infuriating. 
I read this article, did it bother anyone that it seemed more like a whisper campaign with no verified sources for their information, than a well investigated story?Edit: I just read the Channel 4 story linked to by the AU article, it it goes into a little more depth. They Photo matched locations in the Twitter handle to seattle, but don't quite say how they initially started investigating this person. There is a lot more secondary evidence, but I don't see a direct link in either article. Better wait on those pitchforks?
This happened to me.  Was banging wife, slipped and it broke.  It's a serious injury and REQUIRES emergency surgery or else you'll have an L-shaped cock that may never work again.  Here's how they REALLY fix it:The cut around the head skin deep and deglove the penis of skin then suture the corpus cavernosum (spelling?).  Then they stick drainage tubes in you cock for a few days, complete with a foley catheter for at least 2 weeks while the urethra heals.  It was the most miserable month of my life.  HOWEVER, it still works like a champ.  There is little to no noticable scarring, no pain, etc.  My urologist told me horror stories about people that were too embarrassed and ended up with a limp pecker.

The Large Marge scene from Peewee's Big Adventure scared me. And so did the devil scene in that claymation version of Tom Sawyer (Huck Finn???) Anyway, I used to think claymation was freaky at that age, except for the California Raisins. Eventually, I got some clay, and got over all of that though, and to this day occasionally think how cool it would be to instill that sort of feeling in a person with awkward and jagged stop motion and clay. I think it would be fucking great.
**What about the cat!!!**  Did you not see the cat litter??  I'm sure the cat box was hideous.Also side note.  Did anyone see the "Kitchen Rescue?"  There is no way that is saving their kitchen. 
I'm glad I'm not alone on this. I wouldn't say it was "shitty" or anything like that because different people have different tastes but this just seems like a slightly better Kid Rock to me. Kinda sad because there's some mixtape Yela I fuck with but Rap and Country is never a good look for me. But hey, if other people can get enjoyment out of it, cool. 
So yeah beautiful car and stuff. But why not put all the plastic wiring and plastic wiring enclosures where you don't see them? Or maybe get the proper fabric insulated wiring and steel enclosures that were likely stock? Just my first impression.
Well, mental strength can make a big difference, and also, if you're only training 5s you're not really used to high weight singles and it's no surprise you can't push your max. Put those 2 together and it's not a complete shock.
Uhh, I got really paranoid after I lost my virginity, even though we used condoms. Because what if one broke?! And neither of us noticed? (so dumb)So about two days later I made my friend buy me a pregnancy test and took it.Shockingly, not pregnant.

The wrench will still be worth using in as many cases.At 60 Prayer, you get 22 Prayer points per dose of Prayer potion.  With the RotG having a Holy Wrench effect, we'll get 24; each potion (4) is worth 96 Prayer points.(96 Prayer Points / dose)/(2 Prayer points) is 48 doses; this is 12 Prayer potions.  That's a lot of potions you need to break even!  This is a small buff, honestly; it's probably less than the buff produced by the +3 Prayer bonus in the first place, unless you're at Barrows.

Doggy style is always an option...having her wear a freaking mask...hell like you said close your eyes! It'll still feel good because her body is nice and fit and not distorted by mountains of fat. 
Thank you for the reply. It's tough since, with timezones, we don't get to talk as much as we normally do. 10 days ago, she went into the hospital. Got the message about palliative care last night. I talked with my department chair today a little. He said there's no installed policy. That he thought I could do 1.5 weeks away (unfortunately, I teach 4 days/week instead of two), and that I might not be paid because with their policy, they might need a substitute. I don't think I'd be able to get 2 weeks. If he had a smartphone, I'd ask him if something happened to message me immediately so I could try to get out there immediately. I felt awful the other day because usually he's on in the morning and I was joking on his FB with a post asking where he was... then he says (hours later) that he was at the hospital. I feel like I'm saying/doing everything wrong right now...  :(

Have you measured yourself according to the fit calculator to ensure you are in the correct size?Cacique is a US brand, while Curvy Kate, Elomi, etc are UK sized and use a different system. For reference, I wear Panache/ Cleo the most (UK) and wear a 34JJ or a 36J. For US cup sizes that would make me a 36M or 34N.Prior to coming to this awesome sub, my best fitting bras were actually Cacique...but I was wearing the wrong size. If you haven't already, do check out the sidebar for taking your measurements as that will help guide your selections and any recommendations people make.Edit: Here is a link from the sidebar about US and UK sizing (and more!)http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/buying_guide#wiki_sizing_systems_.28in_progress.29
Yes. At 18 I started dating a 21/22 year old. We dated for about 18 months. I still believe (23 now) she may well be the one but the relationship fell apart because I was trying to find who I am. I was entering the phase she was leaving. Bad timing is bad.
We honeymooned up at Estes Park, and I know that the place we stayed at has elopement packages (The Wildwood Inn, http://www.esteswildwoodinn.com). They really helped make our honeymoon special, so I am sure they would do a good job on an elopement.

The idea of googling all my jokes before I perform them or post them is exhausting. That's one good thing about standupshots though. People give you real painfully honest feedback they would never give you to your face. If a bunch of people commented "this has been done" then a fair piece of an actual audience would think the same thing, they'd just never tell you. 
Did I say that? I was generally curious on where OP got the information. If someone has information that doesn't align with what I've learned I ask where they get their info so I can read up on it or to see if they are relying on bullshit sources.There's a lot of bullshit claims made on this site. I'm not inclined to believe it just because popular opinion agrees.
Fucking isn't an issue for me, I know what to do with my dick and how to treat the the pussy. But you are definately right though about the "auditions". Its a new scene to me but I think its a good fit for me and I intend to break into it soon.
Weed is a piss poor anti androgen. That is why. Anyway just like look at the prevalence of trans people in countries where weed is used freely. I doubt you will see any difference.
Hmm. I should mention she isn't humping the pillow or anything. I found her asleep on top of a body pillow with 2 legs on either side. She woke up when I grabbed my camera. 
The Bechdel test is a feminist litmus test. Given that i would characterize the MRA stance that the balance of inequality is against men over that of women, they would have to refute the idea that the Bechdel test is a litmus test that demonstrates inequality against women.
What is the next step? Set up camp and try again in a few hours? Hoof it to the next stop? Maybe fate is telling you not to go that way (that's all I would be thinking, anyways) do you reroute?

I don't really get the point you're trying to make. We're paying for the final product, and it should be valued due to the quality of this.There's no reason think different of the chromas if it takes 10 minutes or 5 hours to make.
Metal carnage Fenrir. I think it's a cool skin, and I love fenrir, so I bought it as soon as it came out.... But then Lord slashington came out... and I got his christmas skin in a chest trying to get Nuwa's skin. So now I have all these skins for a god I like to play, but only sometimes. I so wish I could get gems back for that skin D: 
I am honestly shocked at how harshly people are treating you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting your husband to be attracted to you, and not once did you say that was more important to you than your future child or that you thought he'd leave you over it. Having not yet been pregnant myself, my best suggestion would be to bring it up with the mindset of once you are pregnant. That is obviously a very emotional time, and I think you should just say you need to get this off your chest now before those emotions confuse the issue further. Stress that you know he is in it for the long haul, as are you, but that you may need extra affection and support should this event arise, rather than just a quick surgery.
I misread that as 'skirt', and was like "You know, that kinda sounds reasonable, if you lift your skirt to show your stomach to people there's an ulterior motive there". On rereading it this made more sense.
It's not a matter of technicalities, it's a matter of fairness.You can't just say that a certain group of people can do something, while another can't. It's why the push for marriage equality is so strong.And on that note, if you tell a same-sex couple they can bypass the law just on a technicality, it would create inequality and be unfair(albeit still wrong by nature) to the conventional couple.
I've been addicted to this sub the last few days and didnt see it in the top posts of all time or anything. Didnt see the sidebar either because im on my phone. Sorry
The easy way is to open both sheets you're linking, put a "=" in the cell you want to pull the data into, then click on the cell in the sheet with the data. Once you've done it once you can copy/paste that and adjust the cell addresses as needed. It eliminates spelling errors and typos, I always seem to leave out a bracket or something.

Actually, Windows does some very smart things with the swap.  It keeps track of how often pages of memory are accessed, and it will start filling the swap with those pages during idle time long before you hit memory pressure.  Then when you do actually need the memory, Windows can just clear the page in memory without worrying about writing it to disk, resulting in a much more responsive system.  This is just one of the myriad tricks that pretty much any modern OS will do.Windows will also keep track of what files are frequently accessed and try to keep those in memory.  It may even trade off that by swapping infrequently used memory pages to swap.  The results of these tricks will show that Windows is using just about all of your memory(which is a good thing.. unused memory is just a waste of money) and a fairly high swap usage(again, unless you're constantly waiting on disk I/O, then there really isn't a huge problem)
Be careful! You know what they say about edibles (don't keep going back for more if you don't feel it) and that applies to avb too. Last time I ate 1 tbsp at 8pm, barely felt anything at midnight. Went to bed, woke up at 7am for work and I was so blazed I almost called out. Didn't sober up til around 1pm. Good luck and keep us updated!
Great point. A good example of this is the LCS. We don't pay to watch it, but it brings in money indirectly through increased exposure and other avenues.

So lets say this happens and the Patriot Act gets the boot... We will know the NSA stops how? Because they say? All the Patriot Act did was give a legal face to something they have, and will, continue to do. And when they get caught, they will again wrap it up in the flag and "national security" and get off Scott free. 
Thank you so much for responding! I suppose I'm a bit fearful of being relaxed &amp; hopeful. I'm worried I'll just get disappointed &amp; heartbroken! After surgery my RE (and second opinion Doc) made it sound like conceiving was possible but not without a great deal of help! I'm worried that we won't be able to do it on our own...and I'm honestly not sure why that matters to me so much.I will continue trying to relax and calm down about the whole thing, though. At the very least, it can't hurt and will help me feel better emotionally! 
BTW, just so you don't get confused, "trickle-down economics" usually refers to the practice of politicians giving tax cuts to the wealthy and to large businesses with the justification that they will be able to hire more workers."Top-down economics", on the other hand, is the practice of wealthy individuals managing the less wealthy individuals and deciding what they're worth.
&gt; A Prairie Home CompanionThat sounds like a company that does in home care to the elderly that I hear advertised on the radio out here.  Is it a book or something?
I have driven both (GT versions).  Both cars drove like a dream.  The 2016 is a little quieter, but not by much.  The engine seems a bit louder in the 2016 when pushed.  I liked that about the new car.The interior is better in the 2016.  The screen is clearer and bigger, and is set higher so the driver can see it.  The interior felt more upscale as well - a bit more aesthetically pleasing than the older model.  I would say it's leagues better than the competition (Accord, Fusion, Camry)  Are those items worth the 3-5K on a touring?  I'd say its worth maybe 3, but no more.  That's just my subjective opinion because I greatly value the tech and interior in a new car.  
Yea it is expensive. My next suggestion is actually from a BroScienceLife video. Since Dom can find a way to do curls on anything anywhere he once used the lying leg curl to do bicep curls Ladies.

I'd say to give The Office and Parks &amp; Rec a chance. They're pretty similar in style of show but when you start both shows, watch past season 1 and give the show more of a chance. It'll be kind of stupid in their first seasons but it gets to be better as the show goes on. They both wrapped up recently so the whole series is available on Netflix or Hulu. Also, How I Met Your Mother, although that show kind of bored me after a while :/If you're asking about shows that are on air now, I'd say Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is pretty good, Black-ish is doing really well, a lot of people say Fresh Off The Boat is good. New Girl and Portlandia are two of my favorites right now.If you're looking for animated comedy, I'd say Bojack Horseman or Bob's Burgers. They're both really great for two completely different reasons.
So the knot is just a figure 8, poorly dressed. Is that enough (assuming its fully dressed) or will I need a water knot too? Also thank you for the in depth anchor, I'm going outside for the first time soon so I'm trying to be as careful as I can. Also, yes it is a sewn sling! I'm not sure if that eliminates the need for a water knot
With a small sample size and a biased response group. If you take Stats 101 the first thing you learn is to decide how a certain type of poll may present non-representative answers. For example, if you do a landline survey, you're not going to get many young respondents. Same for physical mail.If you give out a survey, the people that answer are likely ones that are more involved in the game and scene. It's not unreasonable to assume that a large portion of people don't care to answer polls, especially for things that may never become part of the game, but they also care enough about things once they become reality. 
Well being as you don't know me, you couldn't possibly know my vetting process.

Why is this dumb? Smoking a cigarette or two a week with friends isn't the same as smoking a pack a day - it's the same reason why someone who drinks some wine on the weekends isn't considered a raging alcoholic. 
If we had a sense of perspective, than we would all stop playing TPP. As Douglas Adams once wrote: "if life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion."
Okay dude whatever. Just remember, there are tonnes of teams that have done this. H2K, Fnatic come to mind. You have to start somewhere and you have to take chances. Even if there's a chance to fail, you can say you tried. You just didn't sit around too scared to fail and claim CLG can never get better than this without even trying something different. But clearly, if its not 100% guaranteed its not worth it, right? I hope HSGG doesn't have your mindset. 
I have no doubt it sucked to watch knowing that you're not allowed to intervene, but if the BPD let every out of town cop with a hard-on to crack skulls have their way, the city would still be on fire.

Is he an option!?!?  Omg. Pirlo sending amazing Pirlo passes up to Villa!?  A midfield of Pirlo, Lampard, and Mix supplying Shelton and Mullins. Or just scoring on their own. I'll take that too, I guess. Except we'd have a shitty goal differential. But as long as we win by 1 every match, who cares!! 
Exactly, the pitcher WANTS the hitter to pull and is making it close to impossible to go oppo by busting the hitter inside. But these guys think they can go oppo on a fastball inside at 90 MPH.

I meant your interest in things. It changes. The more you're interested in something, the faster you will do it. Now you're not so interested in putting time into it, because there are a lot of other things going on. Leave it, and let the interest come back itself. Forcing myself to do things I'm not very interested in at that moment doesn't work. If I wait a bit until I feel eager to continue, it goes a lot easier.And with feeling interested I don't mean 'I want to do that'. It means wanting to do something, and making time for it.But if it takes you a while to fall asleep, you can do the things then. And stay a bit longer in bed on Saturday. I love self searching in the morning.
The biggest problem in my view is quite simple to explain -  introducing money will cause modders to compete with each other rather than cooperating, potentially causing numerous problems but the main result would likely be a decrease in the quality and scale of mods. 
If you're incapable of having a respectful discussion, I just won't have it. Quit being an ass who gets their panties in a not and their ego hurt when someone points out that you're responding out of context to the OP.  You also never addressed my point about measure. 
Really good.  As entirely constructive criticism I will note your faces are a little weak but show promise.  I used to draw and sucked at faces and hands.  The bodies, however, you have spot on.  Nicely done.
@PFTCommenter 66 seconds ago With there second pick, the Buccaneers should protect Winstons blind side by selecting the entire Talahassee police department
As state transport minister almost every press release from Gladys had something in there about how the liberals were "getting on with the job" and blaming Labor for something. It wasn't necessarily false, it just got tiresome after a while particularly as it got towards the end of the term. 
First you need all the layers. So the actor, and all the little sparklies and warped bits of light. To move through the different parts in circles you'll want to be applying a lot of overlapping masks. An After Effects guru could probably give you more details.
Yeah it does say 'HAYDENS HUGS is set up to help the family with **daily expenses** while they go through this devasting process. 'This money will help out as her Mother won't be able to work during this time so she can look after her daughter. It's not for medical costs directly.
 USS Voyager was commissioned in 2371 and it was the first ship to test the class 9 warp drive in deep space. Warp 9.975 is its maximum sustainable cruise velocity.
Yeah, but still, very unprofessional to drop hime the day before roster lock. Now he's is done for X-Games, maybe Gfinity and Cali. That's basically the three main LANs over the next two months.
When Mass Effect 2 came out it massively outsold the previous. ME2 was MASSIVELY ACCLAIMED by critics and fans alike and remains today as EA's highest rated game of all time and the first contender for GOTY in 2010 as well as it being on more platforms than ME1 (was xbox only when it launched). I believe ME3 is the best selling ME as of right now.
It's a pride thing. Imagine spending several thousand to get schooling only to look like an idiot to kids who are trying to learn from you. It would make you feel like you've wasted 2-6 years of your life and that the degree you worked so hard for means next to nothing. 
As someone that actually plays characters of both genders in mmorpgs, I can point to a couple of my own reasons that aren't autogynepillial. People are way nicer to female avatars even when they know the person behind it is male. And nobody bats an eye when you play dress up with a female avatar instead of min-maxing.
That's the flag of Northern Rhodesia, the Gold Coast had no flag in the code but if you look they were pretty [similar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_%28British_colony%29#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Gold_Coast.svg)

I hear you have Susan this semester. I'm sorry. When you look at her though, somethings missing, right? Like she is un-evolved.He was unfortunately correct.
&gt; remember what Olenna said to her: "I was good. I was very, very good. But you are even better"I *think* Olenna was specifically referring to seduction in that case.
My poop can be light brown to dark brown or even green. Maybe even a little blood if I have a hemorrhoid. It's what you eat that makes it all sorts of fun shades and textures lol no worries! Also, anxiety can cause super soft stools/diarrhea.
I really like the concept of any small error causing a warning (i.e fine) and only becomes a bounty once it reaches a certain threshold, perhaps 1000 credits. That gives you only two "free passes" before you have to leave and pay it off or risk a bounty. Seems fair to me, and certainly wouldn't detract from the game in any way. If you kill someone or hit multiple times, you get the bounty.
I don't know what any given age is supposed to feel like. At my age, my mom was married twice with 4, 6, and 8 year old kids. But I don't feel any younger because I chose not to go that route. I feel older than some friends my age, because I'm stable and happy and successful. But then I have a lot of toys and love the Disney parks, so I don't feel *old*. 
There really isn't, and its pretty sad. Economics is pretty fucking complex, but for example 1 dollar given to a poor person generates far more GDP then 1 dollar spent to blow up a terrorist, but the GOP is only fiscally conservative when it'll cost more money to be spiteful then to help someone.
"people  seem to forget that congeniality does not mean fan favorite" That's exactly why katya will win. She doesn't deserve it IMO because she lets other people(ginger, kennedy, etc.) talk bad about other queens. Jaidynn is more congenial than her.
Oh that's awesome about ethanol raiding. But when I was playing even De Soto was no better than PV.Also I KoSed less then most people I know in game, but I played on PvP servers for PvP.  I like that the zombies are a threat in any case but aggro manipulation/exploitation and whack spawn/respawn makes it a joke to pvp or even pve in most cases. The novelty of their numbers wears thins fast. Also I don't know that much about cheats but I know enough to be sure there will always be ESP/Aimbotters. I don't blame the game I blame ya'll.
need to emphasize this.    you have no rights in other countries.your right to free speech, freedom of religion,  right of representation, right of due process.  they do not exist outside of the US.    if you are arrested in China for example of speaking against the government, you have no recourse.   you WILL go to jail.  your status as an american citizen does not make you immune to China's laws.   
Very funny.  Everyone always wants to pick on the car.I have bought all my cars new, never had a car older than 8 years or 100K miles.  Nearing $1M net worth this year.  It is not about what you choose to drive, but about accumulating wealth.  You have to figure out how to accumulate somehow, and for most people that means saving money from your paycheck to invest.  Once the investments get large enough then simply not touching them is all that matters (i.e. they grow faster than you contribute).  Finally, you reach the point where that growth is large enough you can draw a nice amount from the total and it still grows.I personally like cars so this is something I spend money on.  For others that just need A to B transportation this is an area where they can save money.  
From reading their page on their [website](http://www.playtonicgames.com/), they have stated they want to put this game on many platform as much as possible. Linux should definitely be a possibility (more likely it will be a stretch goal). I would totally like a Linux version of the game as well.I hope the Vulkan API comes out soon so it would be a lot easier for developers to port or make their games to Linux
I tried Googling, clicked images, browsed through the awful photos. Then I realized I should have Googled in Portuguese. No way am I looking at more photo search results! So nasty!
It depends on who you ask in terms of ordering. Many users of this subreddit including myself have Kareem @ 2 due to his prime/longetivity/played in diff eras. But go over to ESPN they may have Bird/magic,Bill over Kareem.
Well nobody should bash someone for seeking advice. Anyone here that does that is a thundercunt and does not represent our community. And your instincts were dead on: Not 100% comfortable carrying? Hold off on carrying. It's better to look before you leap, as they say.
That's what I said - I am actually agreeing with you and upvoted your comment man.My other comment about hate crimes as a proportion of overall crimes per-capita should also have been addressed to you too I guess, but I'm not trying to push an agenda either way (though I don't think you are either), but I'm just joining in the discussion here...
So do we have a place she can stay? Her Kickstarter raised the $800 but I'm sure that could go to lawyer's fees and such. It would be nice if she didn't have to pay for a hotel room for that long. 
They waited too long --he should have blurbed something about it there and here at the beginning of the week. Today is just too late for too many people to either find out about it or plan for it.
There tends to be alot of dueling over shrines in the form of 1v1 or 2v2's , an abathur who can instantly jump between shrines by symbioting people who duel and take the DK with his burrow ability would seem like He'd do decent on Dragon Shire. I'd actually say it's one of his stronger maps.
Men aren't afraid of yoga.  The way yoga is marketed offers men very little.  And the truth is, the women that now own "Women's Yoga" don't care whether men are there anyway.  Any guy who shows up is half-suspected of being a predator.  Most men seem to be doing cross-fit now.  Vive la difference!
Really don't mean any offense to the mods, but this seems like some Kendrick fanboyism. Yes people loved his album, yes it's highly rated, but I don't know if it's worth making an exception to the rules just because an artist worked on TPAB. Are all the up votes really because these people listened to and enjoyed the music? Or is it because they saw Kendrick in the title?
Just warn people you're trying something new in the lobby. If they care that much they'll dodge. I personally like having an off-the-wall pick on my team so I can blame someone else if I'm losing. 
For real though, people actually use the whole "racism ended a long time ago" argument, as that is some kind of evidence that systemic racism is not real. Also, why do anti-black people make racist comment in videos relating to American History X? The movie is anti-racist..   
I don't know, I never understood why people did that. Every hero's base DPS is based on their cost, but with a penalty based on their "slot", so every hero has lower base DPS per cost than the previous one due to that penalty.Following that logic, you'd be better off using whichever hero will get the closest to 4100 by the time you ascend, with the higher base DPS and higher amount of x4 (and x10) multipliers.Now obviously if you're going for a super deep run to 4K+ you're gonna want to use Astraea, but... well, I don't know. I just don't know the math behind it. I'd say regild Astraea if you're going for a very deep run (several days), but if you just want to increase your current highest by a couple hundred, which hero you use probably won't make much of a difference.
Hoy en mi ciudad una mujer me pregunto que planta le servia para tratar la inflamación instestinal, y luego, ella y su marido, nos saludaron a todos dentro del comercio deseandonos feliz dia por mañana.Ponele que no todo es lo que vos pensas.Mañana organizamos un festival para recaudar fondos para una biblioteca vecinal y somos muchas personas trabajando ad honorem, varios comercios y el municipio donaron desinteresadamente cebollas, carne, huevos, etc.y asi... suceden miles y millones de microhistorias positivas de las cuales nunca nos enteramos... mejor invertir la energia en esas que en las negativas
Its not sustainable in pvp at all. Once people have around 300 it will start to collapse because new players will be too disadvantaged.  Then the solution will be a campaign with no cp effects which will be popular probably more so than a cp effected campaign.  Hopefully I am wrong.
I agree that Aatrox could use some love, but Zed does not splitpush as fast as an Aatrox. When AA gets both his offensive items, he can shred a turret in around 4-8 seconds depending on if his ult is up. Zed needs to have full build to even contend with that speed.If I have my tiamat and any attack speed on Aatrox, you could die under my tower and I'd still take yours before you can TP back.
I dont keep up, why should he be so low in the draft? I thought he did well over  in Waco. I wasnt sure if they had specified which position they might get him, but yeah
It's sort of sad.  This dude's probably really into Magic and now he's banned from it because somebody posted his ass-crack.  I feel badly for him, it seems unjust and harsh. 
Yep. I have found some people have fixed the issue by testing live connection in network settings. When it gets to the Live portion of the test it tries to download to update again. For some it works when they click yes there.For others they said go to xbox.com and download the update to your computer. Put the update on a USB then update the xbox via USB but my empty 32GB USB doesnt seem to be large enough for the update. 
Sorry :( . But be glad it isn't a real baby shark, because it would mean that shark is mistreated. It just can't live outside of water for several seconds.

I may gt circlejerked for this, but Jazz III's all the way. Literally all other picks feel wrong. Plus I tend to switch to fingers a lot, like John Mayer and Jazz III's make it easy to put it in my hand. All hail that little, red pointy piece of plastic.
**No it would kill the game.** One time pay games see the bare minimum in content updates (that's for a sequel to have you pay again)Worse still this isn't a game that lends itself to playing without timers...its too grindy and would lead to player burnout (imagine nonstop aerith event like burnout)
Considering that there are at least four members two of which are MP's originating from the Netherlands I would like the speaker to add this option in the next survey!
Good point, but it's pretty much along the same lines of the old way of thinking that you had to eat right after a workout. It does have some basis in fact, but the significance of it, to the average person, is little to none. 
Not as long lasting as other foundations i have used, i get compliments wearing it for some reason and its pretty affordable thats why i use it! If you're looking for a foundation with lasting power i recommend Estee Lauder Double wear (awesome in summer), or even Revlon Colorstay as someone mentioned below
My 4yr old gave me a buttercup the other day.  For those not familiar it's when you fart into your cupped hand and then waft it to someones nose.  I'm not sure if i should be super proud or horrified by her ha.
I always thought it was odd that you generally could only hold one citizenship. It is a country deeming you acceptable to enter and leave! It should be accumulative.

I think we've had a nice discussion too, so thank you. One shouldn't expect to agree on everything, as long as one find common ground.The debate about who to judge as unconstructive is a hard one. I don't think everyone at pegida was a neo nazi, I just think they were being used by neo nazis. I saw them in my own town and I personally would never visit a demo with such a far right presence. It's important to remember that it was middle class "concerned citizens" who actually voted the Nazis to power. Not everyone was Waffen SS.I mainly find that I'd like to have a forum for discussion on Europe here on Reddit for actual normal European, we don't need these crazy types. I don't want to have to argue that the holocaust was an actual thing. It's a big platform and I don't think we should give them the opportunity to spread their hate. They never add anything to the convo anyway.
I assume both of your and your roommates names are on a lease. I also assume that $50 charge for late payments is document on a lease that both of you signed.  In this case you are not in a good situation. Legally both of you are equally responsible for the lease.Your best bet is to talk to your landlord and try to work out some sort of settlement. Offer him to write a note for $200, that you will pay off when you start your job. 
A Desktop USB mic, like a Blue Snowball is the next best thing. Sadly, it doesnt seem there are any other good clip ons from my searching. I've been waiting for the Modmic to restock as well
Damn was not expecting it to be that big. Before this project yela was kinda off the map. Good for him tho, I've heard good things from this project aside from Famtano. I need to peep this soon 
Antonio is now temporarily at my place in Pasadena chilling in my home office :) Petsmart was out of Advantage but I'm going to try other places. I have 4 other cats so he's currently isolated. If you still want to adopt him, let me know
I have the last respect for people who blame the world for their problems. You choose where you go, nobody does that for you.The people I have the most respect for is the hard workers of the world. The ones that go above and beyond without hesitation and do their job.Edit: Fixed a sentence.
Here are some interesting birth defects and disorders caused by environmental factors. ["Unprecedented" birth defects in Fallujah and Basra attributed to America's use of depleted uranium shells and white phosphorus in the bombardment](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/20/iraq-war-anniversary-birth-defects-cancer_n_2917701.html)[There's of course Agent Orange in Vietnam.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange#Health_effects)[And one interesting one I've read suggests a correlation between air pollution  and autism spectrum disorders.](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/autism-risk-linked-to-particulate-air-pollution/)Pollution is bad.
The only point I want to argue is that Mark is incredibly oppressive because of the low cooldown. The damage is strong too and I'll complain about it but the low cooldown is the biggest offender. It has the shortest cooldown of all summoner spells. It closes the largest gaps of all summoner spells.I think it's easily justifiable to want a longer cooldown on this summoner spell. It fits in ARAM and I think it's good that melee champions are given more power with it. It's incredible strong as it is though.
Teacher at my school told a half black student to get his "cotton pickin hands" away from whatever he was messing with. The principal made her apologize to the student and cried the whole time. 
&gt; ince I'm now living in a place without any air conditioning in city that gets wickedly hot during the summerThis is one of the few times that the 212 Evo probably won't cut it. People who live in extremely hot places with no AC will need something more powerful. Whether that's a high-end air cooler or a CLC is up to you. (My preference is CLC because I'm uncomfortable with 2LB+ weights hanging off my mobo.)
The game scares me when I'm wearing headphones and can hear every little thing, especially if it's somewhere I haven't been before or know nothing about.The monsters aren't really too terrifying though and aside from the blood, the game isn't full of gore. I'm easily disturbed by gore and overly detailed violent things. For example I can't handle the fatalities from Mortal Kombat, but there's nothing like that in Bloodborne :)
Thank you very much. I knew she was being disrespectful, but I have a large fear of being too rough throughout my experience, as I watched a few people take the 'rough' approach and it didn't go down well.
A lot of the negativism towards home buying seems to be people trying to justify their opinion/situation without realizing that their opinion/situation doesn't necessarily  apply to everyone. The point I wanted to get across though was that if one has the financial means to make it work, it is possible to buy a home in DC and be happy with it. That doesn't mean that everyone should just that its not as impossible as some people make it out to be. 
Freeze might actually fit quite well, didn't think of him when i wrote that post, but with Candypanda rejoining they would rely on fredy and fox too much I think. While fredy is definitely one of the best western tops I think Fox can not stand toe to toe with many other midlaners (yet).
Thank you for bringing reason and logic into this.  Too many people jump to conclusions because they're simply so passionate about the story.edit: Oooo, your downvote was done with such passion!
I have a lot of parents who worry that their kids spend too much time on the computer or playing games and that it gets in the way of their social skills. I feel like that often these are the things that help them build relationships with peers because there's often shared interest, plus it's just cool to be good at something and for a lot of kids on the spectrum their things they are good at are related to tech.Do you feel like it helped you socially too to have a teacher who encouraged you this way. Sounds like an awesome teacher!
Well hey, if you remember the old "get good at mid" advice everyone used to recieve about raising MMR.. the posts often said "get your own ward if you have to" but everyone tended to ignore that part
Not in regards to a person taking a position that an entire company should cater to his needs/wants.  With a statement to all future kickstarter campaigns. 
Business isn't placing a skin pack that obviously anyone would buy considering they do it with anything they produce.  Business is marketing a skin that not only will constantly provide a cash flow but be renowned by the community.
Hmm never thought of that. I have read that the AIO watercooling pumps from the factory have a temperature threshold of 75c before throttling the card down. 
I'm not sure if it is now but the version I watched on Netflix was really edited down. I won't give spoilers away but I tell you there's probably another 45 minutes of the movie that isn't in the Netflix version.
I'd suggest everyone go leave a 1 star rating and negative review on the app that's probably the only way to maybe have some sort of impact on this issue.
I would say most Jedi could only gauge feelings and emotions from other people but more adept Jedi could go further than that.Considering there is a fair amount of EU dedicated to various Force users and their abilities to read and wipe minds, I don't think seeing a picture in someone's mind is that far out of it's ability.  
I remember that it was said the spring drive movement could work by itself without the quartz regulator, but the time keeping would become less accurate. Hopefully, someone who know what they're talking about can correct me if I'm wrong. 
I think you're giving Mojang too much credit, for every one thing they've given us there are several other things that people have wanted in the game for the longest time. And I'm not sure I'd call them productive, sure they do a lot, but at this point it seems modders get things done much faster.
I love avocado pasta. Here's a [recipe](http://www.budgetsavvydiva.com/2013/04/creamy-avocado-pasta-recipe/). I've made it differently a couple of times but it always turns out good. 
hey guys. funshine just msged us saying he may or may not be on tonight. at the moment we are looking for another ringer to play for us incase funshine can not play tonight
I'm really good at saying dumb comments to get laughs. I'm almost certain some people without my sense of humor have thought I was an idiot. I wonder if some of these posts are because of that kind of humor.
That's a good question. Other nations provided $1 bi a piece and sent engineering help to speed it up by .5but the cost of development has been paid for and any extra money I assume would speed it up.I'll throw in an extra billion to put it to 4.5, then you could pay another billion to put it down to 4.And that's likely the lowest it's gunna get without invalidation
Can confirm. Had three wisdom teeth out at once. Applesauce was a lifesaver.And yeah, no soup with chunks. Tomato is good, chicken noodle is bad. "Chunky" anything is Right Out.
They actually have MTG nights at a few bars around me.  I bet if you looked, you'd probably find one... or it would be relatively easy to organize one.  Just remember your card protectors because... beer and drunk people playing card games.
Thank you for giving us this chance!I'd like Yoshi's New Island. I've heard not so good things about it, but I watched a friend playing and fell in love. I want to play it myself, but this friend moved away and I can no longer ask them to play on their console... I was pretty sad when I saw it was a Platinum reward and I couldn't have it.
I would if I were you. But I would advise against doing it "intervention" style. You should probably say things to him one on one, rather than as a group, as he will most likely feel attacked that way. But I'm sure he'd appreciate hearing how feel. Maybe he really doesn't know how much you've all noticed.
Some inside story on this - we had originally planned to ship all (devices + accessories) at the same time in May, but when our initial run of PAX 2's were ready earlier, we had to make the call on selling the devices a month ahead of accessories being ready. We decided to do it, in part to get ahead of the 4/20 weekend. But now we've got a short wait for accessories. We do have a small amount of accessories on hand here - Ojan is your man for those if you are in a pinch. Otherwise the accessories should be up shortly on our web site. Thanks for your patience!Clever you guys figured out the Ploom logo'd stuff. We are allowed to sell those for a while yet, thank goodness.  So it shouldn't be too long. 
Yeah its a fantastic game, well worth the $20 price tag. They nailed the atmosphere and now that I have gotten far enough in where the puzzles are getting challenging I am really loving it. Fantastic game! One of the better uses of the gamepad that i've seen for a while as well. One of my fave eShop games, up there with Shovel Knight and Scram Kitty.
They never list the values of what was tuned, just that 'x' flight model was tuned to historical values.Knowing WHAT it was tuned TO would help explain why some aircraft turn into complete turds when they get tuned and others shine.
I always thought it was "zero sum gain" but alas I was wrong. My brother is such a dick about it. This one struck a nerve after an hour of sitting in traffic. Excuse my condescending tone from before sir and/or ma'am, I hope you have a lovely evening and/or morning.
Sounds interesting for sure! There's a group I frequent on Goodreads that has the same kind of set-up for their book of the month (with discussion questions and stuff) and it seems to work really well for them and the discussions are always good! :)
I can't think of a single time in my life that I had nothing better to do than go out and break other people's stuff for fun.All the people rioting really have so little responsibility? That's just sad.

Its exactly like the pep incident. I don't really see what the big deal is? He kicked a ball into the net. Forgive my ignorance, but isn't that pretty common? I've definitely seen players do that and not get called out on it.
&gt;failed to falsifyI think you mean "disprove".(I'm assuming you're not a native english speaker, so sorry if that's not the case and I offend, that's not my intention. It's easy to get "falsify" from a translator as the opposite of "prove", but "falsify" actually means to knowingly create false or fake data, generally with the intention to mislead. "Disprove" means to prove something false.)All that being said, you're not wrong. They definitely haven't ruled out some kind of instrument or measurement failure or quirk, although they've almost certainly tried to account for that being the case, with typical NASA-levels of scrutiny.
it's new. the Pitch is lower, the brass sound is cleaner and more open, its played a little less legato, the pause in the melody at 23 sec is slightly longer. the second part is big and epic like Gustav Holst, and dark as igor Stravinsky. I can't wait to hear all the new music John Williams is working on. 
Most likely someone screwed up something, but I put an order in for the hell of it. Besides, the description says Cheeto dust blends in with the home row. That's awesome. 
Prediction time: Cris Carter was right - something's going to happen to AP. In an NFL first peterson traded for Robert Smith and Cris Carter in exchange for 15 car dealerships. 
It'd be pretty hard to do worse than 1.5%.  You also only pay taxes on the earnings so if you are paying the 15% long term capital gains tax or getting qualified dividends you only need to have made 1.725% before selling out to hit 1.5% return after taxes.  Buy some [10 Year US Federal bonds](http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/), they have a yield of 2.03%(4/30/15) which gives you a yield of 1.726% after taxes.1.5% is literally free money, any bond fund will beat that handily.
I usually throw in a 1/4 cup of vinegar in the washing machine when I wash my gear. I usually wash my gear every fortnight. I sweat pretty bad so I need to stay on top of it.
I'd use it.  Ignoring the cloak and uber drains, it actually does solid ranged damage while still doing decent at point blank.  Being able to spam at range is fantastic on a squishy class like engie.If it was unbanned in HL right now, I'd definitely use it since you can run Pistol.  If there were no whitelists it'd probably be relatively less good since you can't justify running Pistol.  But It'd still be good.  
I more so believe that pretending there is another reality is worse. He never blamed her. She wasn't charged with any crime. Unfortunately we live in as society that shows how horrible people are. Her, and me, and you, and anybody should walk with somebody, regardless of gender or race, or etc. He isn't sending that message. People are twisting his words to create that dialogue. 
Well, wish it didn't end like this, but I can't say this season hasn't been a blast. To the future, I guess. Let's all just collectively forget this game existed as Bucks fans 
I really enjoy some poetry but this stuff I just don't get.  I honestly dont understand how making each line just a few words changes anything.  Why does "saving" get its own line?
When someone says "based off the bible" the earth is 12,000 years old. They find this by using the book of genesis and the lineage of christ. Using an average for the lifespan of each generation. They arrive at the number 12,000. What the bible means when it says 1 day is 1000 years and 1000 years is 1 day means that god has no concept of time. It is a human idea to explain the way we perceive events.
Ditch him. I have no time for flaky guys.I sometimes call them out on it. "dude, you said you wanted to catch up Saturday? Whats the go? At least sms me if you need to postpone."Honestly. too inconsiderate to spend 15 seconds replying to a message is a red flag.
It'll be a sad war when the U.S. invades a country and is like "....Where's the Aussies?....What do you mean they aren't coming? Those crazy guys LOVE a good fight..."
I spent a lot of time searching for the best deals, motor with turbo and everything but ac compressor was $400, transmission was $200, timing belt kit and gaskets was another $300ish, the biggest expenses by far were the miscellaneous new parts. Maybe 1300 was a bit conservative, but when it was all said and done and all the old parts sold I was down less than $1k for sure.VR6 is nice, especially coupled with a turbo, but no way in hell are you gonna fit one to a B5 chassis without a ton of fab work.
Oh god these look so soft. The M brush was already on my wish list, I definitely need the rest. I would just sit there and brush my cheeks all day with these.
Revenue went from under $1Mil to over $7Mil. Road toll isn't correlated with the change in teh law. Reduction in road toll is probably just better quality cars.
CM is actually so fun to play with the new glimmer cape. I think it's a bit too easy to get as a support. Maybe include a recipe to increase cost a little?
You tell 'em! Oh you vape too eh? :) www.overclock.net/t/1345672/official-ocns-vaper-club/And I assume you already sent me my remaining $2? ;)  Good luck in surgery.
It feels rushed in that everything happens really quickly at the end. They were able to keep the same story but it was condensed. Pairing the spares didn't help that too much either but it still made sense kind of. But yeah it would have been nice to have that extra time to expand on a lot of the relationships. I still love the series as a whole though. Its probably the most underrated of the franchise. 
Speaking only for myself, I'm finding myself more and more underwhelmed and annoyed by her. Perhaps it's the exposure, with a touch of the constant stanning here, but for as far as she's gotten in the competition, it's not been the best. Nor does it feel warranted or earnt. Whilst I don’t love Ginger or Kennedy, I can follow the logic of their wins - mostly. Pearl? Less so. 
I've got two "zippers" as my family calls them on my right shoulder from my rotator cuff and labrum reconstruction surgery. One on the front, one on the back. While they're both really small, (maybe 2 inches long) they are a significantly different color than my skin. Sometimes they look red if my blood is really pumping, and other times they're whiter than my already super pale skin. 
I am almost ashamed to admit how many Wilford Brimley videos your link helped me to discover.  They are all so bad....but yet so good.  [Rock Me Diabeetus.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOFw59gXe2I)
Just from a presentation perspective, you may be better off introducing **exactly** what the product(s) is(are) sooner in the video. I was left guessing what the video was about for much too long. It distracted me from listening to the people that were talking.Cool product though, good luck.
Stefan is talking on the phone with Damon about possibly locking up Lily... and she's sitting across the room from him.  Did Stefan forget about vampire hearing?
behance allows a simple straight forward website and they even host it with your creative cloud membership. I was apprehensive about geting a site too, but it really couldn't get easier than that.
All religions are jokes that way too many people took too seriously.  But that's the point.  If we are going to take jokes seriously, we need to take *all* of the jokes seriously.
Something that may make camera control easier to rebind the key to go to your hero (F1 by default) to say SPACE BAR. Just makes it easier as it's easy to lose your hero when you start out.

What's your background in?  What else does Thaler work on? I think academia has a lot to contribute to sports in general and the NFL in particular.  I'm a psych doctorate student and I'm virtually certain that clinical interviews and assessment instruments are underutilized by teams.  
Man I am the same way. I spend hours just planning out connecting tampers and such. I look forward to the day we have many different styles to choose from.
lolI just imagine some hoarder who tripped and fell in their pigsty and found a flyer from a year and half ago."Oh look, the Derp'n Herp had a special. Guess while I'm waiting for LifeAlert to send emergency services out here to dig me out of the pile of trash, I'll give them a call to get it"
I thought their faux lesbian skit was very tacky, I don't care at all for the top 100 so I'm not coming from that angle at all, plus they were top 3...I think, in my country about 13 years ago. Don't know what they've been up to since, and I don't care much :)
It's sad that the(that's right, one study) study that statement is based on was done on people that were fed so little they were practically on the verge of starving to death. That's right, starvation mode only happens when you're near death.Funny enough, the myth that egg yolk is bad for you kinda had the same history. Being that despite multiple studies refuting that claim and explaining why egg yolks are actually good for you, everyone decides to believe that one study done by some quack doctor.
Be VERY careful with this glitch if you have a buffalo S. If you're just moving cars around, do NOT do anything involving a Buffalo S. The vehicle you're moving WILL duplicate over it.And no, using the Buffalo S will not bypass the 48 minute timer. Believe me, I tried. :(
Part of me does want Mariota, I love his work ethic and it's something I think this organization needs.  I know we aren't trading up. But regardless, I just want a good draft. 
I grew up in Indianapolis in a time where the Pacers were a legitimate danger to your safety. Before and after the Malice in the Palace they were still getting arrested for random bar fights and crap like that. *And it took the Pacers FOREVER to get rid of the players from the Pacer Fight!* Meanwhile Peyton Manning was building children's hospitals and winning the Super Bowl. I'll always love the NFL and hate the NBA from growing up in that era. I only got into college sports when I went to college, so CBB is my entry to watching basketball.
Why do you have to buy a chroma PACK? Why not just one Chroma? For instance, I don't want blue and red lucian, I only want the yellow one. I'll only use the yellow one. Why do I have to spend 600rp on all 3 and have 2 that i'll rarely/never use instead of 200rp on one and then i'll have 400rp free to spend on other ones? As it stands I don't think i'll be backing it.
Hey Azoh, I've been following your stream and Zed school for quite a while, and I'd really appreciate it if you could answer a few questions I have :3* Will the new black cleaver affect Zed and Talon? In what ways?* If you were to give 1 buff to Zed and Yasuo, what would it be, and why?* Will you ever make a juking guide for Zed?* How can you carry lower elo with Zed? (Splitpushing obviously doesn't work)* Which Zed skin do you think is the best? For Talon? For Yasuo?
I was sort of annoyed at just how few options I picked for 2 and DA:I.  I wasn't super shocked I didn't want to pick too many in DA2, but it was kind of surprising to realize I really only wanted to select two from Inquisition.  I'd have been perfectly happy clicking almost all the little tickboxes in Origins (I restrained myself to less than half the cast lol).  
Shit man. I'm an animator, and some of the older dudes can be like that unfortunately - some of the younger ones too, but I think the 'old boys club' mentality is fading a bit nowadays as more women break into the industry.
That's horrible :( I drive through that intersection every day. Instead of trying to help the guy who he just smashed into. . . he just runs away. . . 
so like. you're still together, right? its endearing shit like this that makes me love my boyfriend. granted he's never made me an abortion of a DIY kinder egg. but. I'm sure if you two got together you'd lovingly destroy my kitchen and then I'd bake you cookies.

&gt;Since I am not a citizen I cannot vote or donate.You actually can donate if you are a "citizen **or lawfully admitted permanent resident**." One of the major issues with a catchall post is that each state has its own rules.  I think there was a thread earlier listing each state's primary system.
Webserver. There's a lot of network infrastructure that works best with HTTP/HTTPS, such as various types of proxies, caches, load balancers, scanners, intrusion detection systems, and so on. A product I'm working on was originally designed to use a custom protocol over TCP, and it's caused problems regularly.
There's no chance that this happens. There's a talent drop off from Towns/Okafor to Mudiay/Russell/Winslow to WCS and so on. There's way better options with that pick
Idk if this counts but I'm in BC that causes me to only get my period every few months and it's spotty at best. I take a pregnancy test every few months, "just to make sure", usually if I'm feeling bloated or cranky. 
It's probably easier to only collect payment once all the spots have filled to save you having to refund any/all spots in case the raffle doesn't fill. That's how most of the raffles on here so far have done it. 
The Lutari Aviator Tail Belt is one of my favorite wearables. It's just exactly the kind of completely useless but stylish accessory that I like. Really like the custom! Reminds me of [the 4th doctor](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2a/Fourth_Doctor.jpg) for some reason.
I have hearsay that the rail network cannot support more trains - there just isn't enough electricity in the grid for more services, apparently, because its a billion years old and the company that runs it won't/can't invest in upgrades/renewing of infrastructure. Metro is in a hard place of being merely the *operators* of the network without control over the tracks and trains itself. Bit of a hodge podge solution to privatisation, really. 
I actually was just showed tøp about a month ago by someone I met on reddit. twenty one pilots is do great. Normally I listen to a lot of music because I love the music itself, sometimes the lyrics, sometimes both. Pretty much all twenty one pilots falls under both. They're all I've been listening to lately (and I have a Google play All access subscription, and about 3,500 songs in my library). I actually checked today, and I've listened to each song an average of 16 times, in only like the past month (all albums, including regional at best). I want to see them live, and meet them so bad, but I don't really have extra money for concerts, nor do my parents really let me go to concerts, but I could probably convince therm. So yeah
I was thinking of Boston College which is neither in Boston and is a University (Has a bunch of colleges) and Colgate University which is a liberal arts college.

There may be similarities, but they seem more different to me. Hero quiet has a fixed board with quests to shake it up. Plus IIRC you need a DM for it. But Drzzt has a random board. I kinda prefer Drzzt actually.
And it doesn't help that going out to a restaurant, witht he huge American portions, means that you are either overeating, wasting money, or looking like a dweeb in front of your friends or date waiting for them to finish eating and then taking food home.
&gt; “We have to do a better job of governing our league and putting principles in place where there are strict consequences.&gt; I’m sure today’s incident will come with much criticism which is well deserved, but I’m hoping it serves as a wake up call that we the owners must do a better job.I am no rocket surgeon, but I think not playing in a game 7 for the league title is a pretty shitty consequence.Also, sounds more like he needs better administration / coordination as it relates to who has access to what and when.Not excusing what happened, just saying that if security / admin staff where in place along with proper procedures with regards to practice time and who can use what when, this whole mess would have been avoided.If you run a bush league program, you will get bush league results.
Using a DSLR would probably work decently if used through a telescope, though it would be a slightly different process since you would need to incorporate the filters into the optical train somehow.

&gt; You can't have your menstrual period while you're pregnant. Some women do have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. *Some even report intermittent bleeding that seems like a regular period to them.* But vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is not the same thing as menstruation.So, yes.  You are correct.  But a few rare women progress pretty far into pregnancy even while experiencing what they perceive to be fairly normal bleeding.
Even while specifically selecting the walking option. Given you (I dont think) are allowed to walk up the motorways, it's actually the best option anyway.
I get YELLED at for not watching certain things. Game of Thrones. House of Cards. Breaking Bad. Sons of Anarchy. The Wire. Sopranos. Every goddamn sci-fi show ever. Star Wars. I haven't watched a single one.I just started watching Parks and Recreation. It's pretty good. Next I'll move on to Daredevil. 
Heh.  Voting out GO Prick Santorum (ever see that bumper sticker? Friend of mine made those) was one of the last things I got to do in PA before moving out of state.  I'm actually a native Pennyslavian - PSU alum and all that. FWIW I moved from PA to deep blue Oregon and only recently moved to Texas, a return to the state I previously lived in about thirty five years ago.  Some things never change, I can confirm.  Texas is amazingly chock-full of fucking redneck Tealibangicals.  Five, ten years maybe some statewide offices - Gov., Senator, _could_ go Dem but the Texas state house will forever be a den of mouth breathing morons. 
Creative and artistic people are often weird. I can confirm as I have a bachelor in illustration. If you can't handle the weird, don't look at the art.But yeah, this is indeed fucked up!
Fuck that guy,  I thought it was funny. That /u/almighty_so got a little too butthurt. Glad he's not a mod because 5 new posts a day is incredibly dumb. When I have a sub I enjoy,  I love hitting refresh and seeing new content. I'd be pretty upset if I seen 5 new things a day.

lol from that post:  "The SCOTUS took great care to uphold the laws that limit campaign contributions and direct advocacy."why that post has a ton of positive upvotes is completely insane.  but there are plenty of crazies out there I guess who are simply impressed by a big wall of text
I started off with IIFYM yes, but since I had to cut down some kgs to make weight and qualify for nationals, I switched to a flexible dieting/ketogenic eating. 
That's precisely why Democrats don't want to fix it.  They know that it essentially gives them de facto amnesty.  They expand the government and expand their voter rolls.  Win-win.  
I wasn't going to comment, but you asked for criticism.I don't "hate it," but I just don't think it's for me.  I honestly don't get the humor and it seems kinda middle-schoolish.  If you really want to make this work I would try to work dialogue into intense fights that are exciting to watch instead of this.  You aren't really utilizing the medium.
I think the real issue is that no solution is presented other than "free market". Notice how you said you are against pollution but offered no alternative that can work as quickly to solve the aggression.
She may very well be upset and that's ok she's allowed to be upset just as you are. I hope that she showed up tonight and if she didn't text her. And say I know your mad and that's fine but if you could please meet me somewhere I really need to talk to about something and I really need a friend I can talk to about this. 1st of she's a girl and we love soaking in a good story granted that's not what it' is but grabbing her attention is 1 st then telling her what's going on and how you feel if she is a true friend she is going to want to be there for you. It's hard to put your feeling on the line but if it's killing you, you need to know.

You can either deliver the highest quality with the finest control with lossless RAW files with an automated workflow (deleting all bad photos), or you can save space. It all depends on who you are. RAW files are then probably not for you, though 2TB drives now costing ~$50-60 makes me see that argument as a diminishing one.
I know nothing about statistics, but could [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_coefficient) be it? (I googled "statistics phi"). If not, you might want to provide some more context for what you're doing so some stats person can help more.
Also I'm on mobile and I don't know how to use it very well, could you do me a favour and let the mods know this is answered? That'd be wonderful. If not I can do it in a few hours
Lol, burgers and occasionally pizza are pretty much the only food I won't eat with a fork and knife, and only when I cut the burger in half. I've been known to eat hot dogs with a fork and knife. I just hate getting messy with food, sometimes I feel borderline autistic when my friend make fun of me for it.
This isn't made by most of the original team as well, that team has been disbanded for years now working for different companies. The point is if the sequels flopped, then so too can a spiritual successor. 
I highly recommend Bayonetta2.I didn't play the first game when it came out, but when they announced Bayonetta 2 I decided to give it a try playing the demo, and ended up liking it more than I would imagine.Later, I get to bought the game and well... now It's one of my favorite games on Wii U, I really liked the cinematics animation and the funny dialogues we get from time to time, also, the different styles of combat you get to use.
Do you still want to marry him and spend the rest of your life with him assuming he will continue to not trust you and think you are cheating whenever you have contact with any other men for the rest of your life? If yes, go for it, but I am sorry for you if you think you don't deserve to be trusted.Everything points to this continuing forever. I wouldn't even begin to think he had changed unless he was seeking counseling and trusted you for more than a year.
-Romantic here- "Love Song" by Taylor Swift. It encompasses the Romeo and Juliet story theme. I find that the orchestral aspect in the song has a great build up. The song becomes climactic as the song nears to the end as she sings about defiance and hope for love. Yes, I get chills and goosebumps from Taylor Swift
I follow a lot of the same people, but I realize that while I like a lot of the elements of these knives and similar ones, I don't like any of them entirely enough to ever want them. That was a pretty album to look through, though. 
It's not about living up to the hype though, the question's about potential. I really think he had potential to be even better, you would probably say Ronaldo is a tier above Rooney but he didn't used to be. Rooney's world class but he's not one of the top few players in the world and arguably that's what he had the potential to become.
I understand the abrasive quality. The same article specifies it was that exact quality of diatoms that was utilized first. As an abrasive. That's a far cry from "microscopic razor blades that will shred the beetles carapace and make them bleed to death very, very quickly."
If the test was easy to fail because it requires a film to have a lot of characters and a lot of dialog, then the inverse of the Bechdel test (there must be two named male characters, they must have a dialog, it must not be about a woman) would fail as frequently as the Bechdel test does. This is not the case.Instead, far more films pass the inverse Bechdel test than the Bechdel test. This illustrates the point of the Bechdel test quite clearly: representation of gendered characters in films is heavily unbalanced.
Rekkles left because the old Fnatic was tired and many of them had plans outside of Fnatic. He wanted a motivated team and Alliance was the team "created to win worlds", whats more ambitious than that? He even said it in vlogs that he wanted a team with the same mentality as him. The mentality of practicing all day. That was why Tabzz left, he was burnt out and stressed from the strict practices. Rekkles and Alliance's attitude was a perfect fit, its just that the management sucks and their collective playstyle doesnt fit. 
More delusions of control from the FBI. I am glad Congresspeople openly chastised them, but the laws of math are immutable in this case. &gt; [MA District Attorney] Conley then proposed that **a backdoor be implemented on personal devices but corporate networks be allowed to keep strong encryption with no "golden keys."**This reeks of PR bubble testing. I fear this idea will gain traction in other committees or among the leadership (who love the spying while pretending to be shocked! shocked!). The FBI is playing the PR game. If you got nothing to hide and all that troublesome blather.
Thank you. I had  good success with regular not even feminized seed. Just thought I would give these a try. Plenty of sun and I am able to bring in water. 
Considering 75% of rape victims already know their rapists, there is definitely a problem with the way a lot of men see women. I'm on my phone so I don't have the statistics here (google is a magical tool!), but a lot of rapists act out of a) entitlement, and b) completely fucked up ideas around what rape and consent *actually are*.
Their products are full of fatlogic (Dr Oz worthy scam products).  I know in the UK false advertising isn't allowed (unlike the US) which is probably what happened.
My goal down the road... I've been thinking about it, and I think it's because I'm starting to like what I see in the mirror and it makes me feel like it's less pressing, maybe. 
Lol that is true! But If I can't even dance good in a video game I don't want to live on this planet any more... I'm hoping they where just doing a worm up exercise. ;)
Athena's shield wall and tauntI usually rush in, throw a shield wall on top of them then taunt so they can't escape the second tick.feels bad just wasting your shield wall and missing your taunt just because you weren't quick enough on the draw against gods with escapes. instant cast really cuts back on that.
Meh, sometimes it is. Have you ever had to take a prereq that was below your level? I have, and sometimes you aren't able to get it waived. In the college I attend, even in-person classes have everything online, so skipping class on non-test/presentation days (and the 45 minute drive) and just doing the work on my own is my preferred method of taking those types of classes. It has yet to inversely impact my grades.Granted, I did skip too much of a class in high school because I had some pretty bad anxiety/self-esteem issues that the teacher made horribly worse. I failed that class. Somehow, though I still managed to completely avoid the food service (and customer service) industry.
They are looking a bit leggy are they far from the light?? I'm not a fan of misting plants just my 2 cents.I wouldn't worry much about the round leaves curling. 
Literally all I was talking about was the just dodge it mentality. and I've been playing pvp since day one, had an early copy about a week before servers went up and was about where I thought I wanted to be. No my argument wasn't even about nerfing anything, it was more geared towards mitigating damage and learning how to do that over just saying to dodge everything.Looking back I was very salty at the time, probably had a bad day or something *shrug* Happens
yeah I listened to [his audiobook](http://www.amazon.com/Dispatches-Edge-Memoir-Disasters-Survival/dp/0061136689) it was pretty interesting... he was addicted to covering the most dangerous stuff before he switched over
People always say things would have been better if Stannis got Storm's End, but he would've been mad at Robert for giving Renly the traditional seat of the heir to the throne. I mean, I really like Stannis and all, but sometimes he can be unreasonable.e: Although things definitely would've run smoother if Stannis was higher up in Robert's court and became hand or something.
Haha I'm not that high but I jut couldn't stop thinking about how messed up the mind of the person who conceived of this. I just kept thinking that's a scary brain
The M3s were not historically accurate, people have complained about this since forever. The 20mm is just as good if not better, and it actually fights jets wel
There is only so many ways the commentators can say the same things about the hundreds of prospects without it sounding super racist/like a slave market.  Pedigree is one of those words that has a good connotation so they can use it.  
Thanks! There are a few females in our family with traditionally male names (Taylor and Morgan for example). I think people are getting a lot more open minded about names, but even though I love it, I don't want to traumatize my child. I appreciate your comment. :) 
That's still not "Playing God". It might be wrong, it might violate God's Laws, but a human cannot play God, which is the attempt to be like God. There is nothing that a human can do that even comes close to God-like, therefore it is a logical impossibility for a human to play at God or pretend to be God. Otherwise, you have an extremely low view of the power of God that man could be like him.
When you become the kind of person who goes and complains, you become the kind of person who could be responsible for someone already having a bad day to have an even worse day--and possibly become homeless and starving. I couldn't live with that on my conscience, and since I know working CS sucks, I let it go when someone is "rude" (that word is highly subjective) I have never been outright rude to any customer (indeed, I would no longer have a job if I had), yet customers complain about me far too often.
Man, I'm all for physical basketball, but when you pull some kind of shit that's reckless and could get someone injured, fuck you.Fuck Nene.Fuck Zaza.Fuck Anta… Aten… Antate… Nevermind. Just fuck Nene and Zaza.
I knew a girl that was very interested in bringing her son to church so he could grow up as a good decent human being. But here is the conversation that I had with her (I shit you not):Her: I really want to bring Jamal to church soon.Me: what kind of church?Her: a Christian church.Me: I know that but what kind of Christian church?Her: you mean there's different kinds?And that was the sentence that made me question her IQ.  Believe it or not she's doing pretty well for herself nowadays.
Amiibo: Captain FalconIn Box or Out of Box: Either. I guess I'd prefer in, because that means it's new.Packaging: Doesn't matter!Reason: Ever since they announced amiibo, he's the one I had my eyes set on. I'm a casual collector, but I haven't seen him anywhere. I don't have the money to spend on new amiibos anymore, after getting into a bad financial situation. Amiibos are so difficult to hunt that I've basically given up... I just still want that Captain Falcon. My girlfriend has both Yoshi's and the Kirby, so she's happy, otherwise I'd ask for one of those for her.Site note: This is awesome of you. :)
It truly depends on the device. One of my friends has a HTC (not exactly sure), and his resolution is 1920x1080 (the image is that size, so the image is based on the senders res). When saving, the file is minimum 1mb. Snapchat does do compression, of course, but I doubt *every* photo, using *just* Snapchat (i.e. no tweaks), would be 30kb-50kb.
So back to Bill Gates, he's donating almost his entire fortune to help people around the world and because he is an atheist his actions are inherently bad?  That's a revolting premise to me.  Nothing he's doing is for fame or fortune, he has more of both of those than his charity could ever add to, his actions are concrete examples of trying to provide for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden and somehow you want me to think he is not capable of good actions?  
Maybe you should actually go do your research before making dimbass statements like that. Hiko specifically said that the Cloud9 org didn't give a shit if their team won and that's part of the reason why he left and wouldn't come back.
They could have just used the A3 engine, modders are already catching up with SA in terms of content, it will obsolete before it's finished.A2 engine was the reason the mod was such a pain to develop, you'd think they would have learned.
I kind of dig the first 3, But the upper and lower matching in color would look a-lot better. The 4th one should be a pistol and no buffer tube.If you want a real "unique" type selling point, Design a built-in "b.a.d." type bolt catch/release w/o all the extra sticking out. And honestly, I don't ever use my FA ... why would I want 2? Make me the 4th one with a slick hand guard (No mounts), NO FA, No buffer tube, A non-reciprocating Side charging handle, A Chrome "skelitonized" trigger, A clear silicone grip. And you got the newest "Bling with a big bang" IE: Desert Eagle in town. 
Just another variation of "colorblind" theory wherein people believe that racism is perpetuated by talking about racism. It's like an ostrich ducking its head in the ground and [thinking it's hidden](http://www.greenlights.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ostrich.jpg).
I dunno man, Europeans can be pretty racist too. I mean, look at all those European soccer fans throwing bananas at black soccer players. America gets called out for racism a lot, but Europe is NOT much better, if at all. 
Do you think any of the Red posters have any power over this? Let's be real for a second. Let's follow the line up to who controls Riot: Tencent, a huge Chinese corporation.For Tencent, Riot is just a piece of the business it does. A meaningful and growing piece, surely, but do you know how huuuge Tencent is?So you guys can bitch at the Riot employees on here as much as you want, maybe they'll float the idea up until it hits the CFO, but when whatever Controller at Tencent hears the idea, especially after the money starts rolling in, they'll have a good laugh.People are going to buy these.
Part of the cultural problems arise because it's illegal. It's taboo and making something taboo is very closely related to making it more desirable. We've created this culture of underage drinking by making you into a "badass" if you do it
Soul Taker and BoR will be indirectly buffed in 2.0. BoR will be buffed because melee in general gets buffed (fortify, maraketh weapons, armor rework, etc.) and Soul Taker will greatly benefit from the new support gem "20-39% MORE damage vs. chilled enemies.

Obviously, your first target should be a helm. With the Zuni set, you can run a good build with MoJ, Carnevil, or Tiklandian Visage.Your next target should be the Zuni Mojo, to get the 6-piece bonus.You obviously also want a better weapon (DoD or SMK), but those aren't good to gamble for, so you should probably just wait for one to drop. Last Breath is a decent option to use with a Tiklandian Visage build.
Can't see the book working well as a movie. There's only one character that is throughout the whole book. There's too many secondary characters who die or get lost in time. It's too long for a 2 hour movie.They'll have to either majority rewrite it or greatly condense it. So they might as well just name it something else and save on the disappointment.
I'd just like to point out that working hard and using steroids are not mutually exclusive. For your average gym rat, you can use, and still work out but not so hard, and get decent results. But to be a top level athlete you have to push yourself consistently, regardless of what you're on.
Putting her in the side bar was inexcusable -- the whole thing is inexcusable. Did you see her post on /r/sewing? Her smile was so genuine. The cowardice of hiding behind your computer screen and making fun of someone who seemed genuinely excited about joining a community was pretty disgusting, even if HAES is pretty retarded.Fuck 'em. People who do shit like that can't have happy lives, right? It's not like they kiss their kids and loving spouse good night before vomiting targeted bile about fat people on Reddit.
The federation is trying to push into this system, They're not fighting the Imperial forces just a local independent group. However the federation doesn't have any controlled stations in this system so I would assume as far as politics are concerned this can be considered an act of war similar to Volungu.[Here's the system faction names and current their current state] (http://imgur.com/gallery/uHIFmxG/new)
My suggestion would be to take a piece of like white or black melamine board and put it behind the computer and everything to make a little trough for the wires. You could even cut out holes in the bottom of it for wires that need to come out like for the keyboard and stuff.
I consider demeaning women as a whole significantly different than making a stupid bacon joke. Maybe I'm just jaded to them at this point, but I cannot put a "le bacon" on par with sexism. 
Trust me, if the lord of Sunlight had to fight a Balrog it would have been as easy as turning around and whipping god damn lightning bolts at his face. Enough to bring down an entire legion of dragons. Humans didn't do shit it was Gwyn
I came across a similar sentence  in a  graphic novel once and was totally confused (I'm from the US).  Google wasn't much help.  Luckily I met some nice people from Québec on Chatroulette who explained it to me.  
Good on you for finally getting to understand that it's not really your place to try to tell someone how to live. Unsolicited health advice from coworkers generally is unwanted. She's dealing with her life, and when she's ready (or not) she'll do what she needs to do to be healthy. Nagging won't help.
Stop even giving credit to the fact that it's rape.  It's fake video game characters making motions towards other fake video game characters.  It's pathetic we are even talking about this. 
When that is determined by an arbitrary person/body, I think it is meaningless as a title.  I would address someone as Senator out of respect for the office.  I would call someone Doctor in respect to their very tangible, quantifiable position.  But referring to someone as "Sir" because of arbitrary honor?  No thanks. 
Or maybe the SPD supporting a war that killed millions of workers and then proceeding to have the leaders of the left murdered is what split the movement? 
So how would you even begin to treat someone like that? Are they too far gone for maggot therapy, how do you even start to deal with a full skin necrosis anyway. Like what is this poor guys chances of survival? I just find these things incredibly interesting, cause if I was in the position to treat this patient I would just have no idea what to do, and to fulfil my morbid interest, what would/could you do in this case?
This is true - I remember the hype about Ronaldo pre-1994 USA. And then he basically didn't get a kick because of Romario and Bebeto being such a great partnership, and a lot of people thought "well, he can't be THAT good then, right?". And then for the next few years he was absolutely fucking unbelievable.
Like that new godaweful tinder/youtube celebrity ad? At that last second when that tool goes "Hashtag!" like it's some 90s fun-ducational rap bullshit.
"Let's head to Facility L. Cable's engaging Reapers there with the MP Naval Forces. Apparently the entirety of Cerberus leadership is there. We can end this here."
In America, **male genital mutilation** is pretty much routine *and* people mock it as an issue.Besides religious reasons and bad parenting, not cleaning your child, there is no reason to do it.I'd post flood of links but this will probably be donated to help and I'm on mobile.
Hey! That's awesome! My wife and I are watching the draft in NYC. She's from Oslo and I've successfully made her into an Eagles fan!We'll be in Oslo in September for two Eagles games, hope there's a place to watch 'em!Happy draft day dude, and faen ta Dallas!
About a month after Columbine, my middle school band teacher yelled at the flute section for not coming in at the right time--his phrase was something like," if I had a gun, I'd take every one of you out back and shoot you in the head."
You forget the egg would be the only one of those 3 icons on the mural to be grounded, therefore it may well still be a shadow. Jetpack is in flight, as is the UFO/saucer.
ridiculously so... They're a bit OP at the moment.... I was thinking something more like an interstage fairing that after payload seperation, you can blow the fairing and reveal some "drag heavy" parts.experiment and have fun. be sure to post pics to /r/kerbalspaceprogram :)
AV has to be one of the most fortunate companies in the history of gamedom.  I mean the fact that in this many years no one has taken their idea and actually made a decent game is ludacris.  No one that matters has actually realized how groundbreaking the pvp is in this game and moved on it.  BLOWS MY FU$@ING MIND!!!  
I think it is mostly just the homer Chicago fans. Darling hasn't produced for his team to the same degree as Hammond. Ottawa isn't in the playoffs without the Hamburglar.
Yep, raw is controversial.  I do raw meaty bones, but to minimize the risk of food born pathogens, I freeze them for 2 weeks, then feed while still thawing.  
I love this story.  It makes me love Ovi and the Caps organization even more than I already do.  Ann's mom also always seems so grateful for what Ovi and the Caps do for Ann.

Its easier to change the body to suit the mind than attempt to change the mind to suit the body.  We still know very little about the brain, but if one feels relief through hormones and surgery, how can you argue against that?
&gt;overpriced booze and crowded with "young professionals" who have more money than senseThat's all of the DC area. If you want cheap booze and genuine people you have to go to Baltimore.
I vote no, I went through two and didnt get any color changes and ended up regretting the idea that i would get a cool draik entirely.... I just stick with my grundos nowThe only time I think this is okay is if you have enough to constantly keep buying them, although they are at 400k now
I like that Winston and Mariota are skipping the draft room. I think more athletes (not just NFL) should spend the day with the people who care about you and helped get you there
&gt; imagine if socialists went hog wild into bitcoin without realizing they can't control it.It really seems like nobody in this sub knows what socialism actually is. For that matter, a lot of people here have some seriously weird ideas about how capitalism operates.I feel like you guys are the absolute last people who should be trying to inform people about alternative currencies.
I would second the recommendation for Señor Veggie in SA. Green is good for breakfast. In Austin, check out Counter Culture and Sweet Ritual (an all-vegan ice cream parlor).
it's even worst for me, i live in San Diego is everytime i see a Mexican name, badge, kit i quit, it's impossible to play and when i do win, they start sending me messages which i can never understand
You should change your mindset on renters, right now people renting out houses/condos in Toronto are been subsided by owners. If you are indeed old you should remember the crash of the late 80's early 90's, Toronto real estate wont go up for ever and most likely will come down in alot of areas once higher interest rates comes to bearing.  And blue collar people are buying houses in Toronto, its just there going into a black hole of debt. A friend of mine just purchased a "nice starter" home near the beaches for 750'000. He is a cop one year in and she is a Corrections officer, both blue collar jobs. You will not be able to seek your fortune else where, unless you go overseas.
I turned it on max performance the first day, and it used the 135MHz idle for quite a while with that setting on. I'm using both MSI Afterburner and GPU-Z to check clocks and have also used EVGA PrecisionX. It's intermittently going down to 135MHz now, but only sometimes. Weird but at least it's working a little better. 
Totally agreed. IMO the game doesn't stand on it's own merit without the "gotcha", and is not worth the time spent to get to it. Might as well just play any other shooter and have someone tell you how guilty you should feel about it.I'm not even against the message, it's a worthwhile thought. It's just the execution that makes it a tacked-on trollish "lol u thought this was the game" type of thing, when I'd really just like a game with solid mechanics. It's just kind of condescending when I think most well adjusted people think about this stuff anyway.
It must be fairly random, or maybe have something to do with the proximity of other stuff.  I logged in after the patch and backspace suicided and respawned at all of my faction's bases to buidl cryo-thingies and didn't get killed trying to spawn at their medbays even once.
Thicker is definitely better. The difference is most noticeable in the sound. With the thicker PBT, the clack sound you get when you bottom out is a lot deeper than with thinner PBT. It's very noticeable if you have blues; the same thing applies here. 
This is essentially it as well as some comments she has said regarding feminism and how to deal with modern society. As well as the fact that many attribute much (not all) of her success to the connection she has to Bill.      Sources: [Connections](http://www.cheatsheet.com/politics/hillary-clinton-shouldnt-be-president-a-feminist-perspective.html/?a=viewall) [Femisnism Quote that seems to tick off some people](http://clinton3.nara.gov/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1998/19981117.html)Just saying (for convenience) the quote mentioned is the one that states that Women are the primary victims of war because they lose their husbands, sons, etc. Many men interpret this to mean that mens' lives are worth less than any womans. Whether this was the intent I don't know.
I agree with kit_Kat. You should enjoy you time (and money) now. This early on you should buy a car for no more than $3000. But as he said it would need to be maintained and it doesn't sound like you plan for the next few years makes that investment worth the cost. I would recommend saving over the next two years or so and pay cash for a nicer car when you'll get more use out of it.
Where I come from,it's not uncommon for people to be named by various fruit at birth.So I was talking to a friend of mine..."I find people's names after fruit so stupid.For example,Raspberry.""That's my mom's name.""Yeah,okay...Bad example.Quince is way worse!""That's my sister's name.""Well,fuck."
You are without doubt better off breaking it up into lots for ebay/craigslist or try your hand over at /r/gamesale. Rem. if your off ebay then you need to give a good discount(people generally expect 15%-20%) and if you're selling in lots then you'll likely need to give another discount for people taking larger amounts. If you want to make the most then your going to have to spend the time and effort to make the most... Edit: Also, if your a member of NintendoAge or the like then they have forums for selling too where i'm sure you'll find plenty of interested parties. Take photos of everything and compile a list WITH the prices you want. It will make things much quicker and easier for you and the buyers.
It's great practice for docking though! You can try approaching slowly and see how close you can get and it won't be a failure as long as you're within EVA distance. 2 km is close to the upper limit, I'd say.I did a rescue mission a few hours ago and stopped within ten metres. Actual docking without RCS is almost impossible, but that kind of a rendezvous isn't much of a challenge even with normal engines.Docking isn't too bad after a while. It's actually quite relaxing to slowly tune your attitude and speed.Edit: fixed typo.
I don't disagree with any of that.  Someone above asked what the consent issue was, and I answered.  I did not mean to imply that the consent issue was controlling.
**Taboo** and any other word game. The part of my brain not required for the majority of games I consistently lose, dusts off the gloves and litters the canvas with broken gamers. (That said, I prefer the former type of game. I have fun despite my lack of skill and empty trophy cabinet.)
I had a post get over 800 upvotes fairly quickly on /r/videos showing extreme police brutality, it was deleted citing the rule that you cannot show police brutality videos.
To be fair, Al Gore had the charisma of a dead leafhopper on the campaign trail. Sen. Sanders is far more direct, and he's clearly more effective in hearings and on news shows.
I feel ya man.  My university is in Baltimore and my parents were texting me constantly.  A bunch of stores got looted 2 blocks from my house, which was exciting to say the least. 
I never had that much God crap. I'm atheist and it never bothered me. It totally depends on the culture in your troop. Some are run out of churches and are super God heavy .
For a lot of them I imagine it's a misplaced feeling of lust that comes from having no other females in their life to feel attachment for.It leads them to think 'Well these are some good natured characters, I bet they would like me for who I am!". This then eventually leads to feeling of love and eventually sexuality.I think they are self aware, I just think they have so little else going for them that they have to hide in these fantasies. They seem to think real life women won't be as kind as their ponies.
I suppose if you put your residence on AirBnb you have to come to terms with the fact that people are going to be boning in your house, probably in your bed, and it could even be the kind of boning that you're not cool with if you worry about that sort of thing.
I've watched every official match they played that tarik streamed and I don't see how ptr was any more emotional in game than hazed. I really think they just didn't like him, even before he got upset for them saying he was gonna be dropped for Skadoodle.
This is a very vague post.What do you actually want to do? It seems you already have a degree, but now you're considering getting a "business" degree. Are we talking an MBA here, or more like a bachelor's? And what do you want to do in finance?
It doesn't fit perfectly but it sort of sits on top of the nerf rail. When you screw it tight I think there's enough flex in the AFG plastic so that the 'picatinny grip' (don't know how to describe it) wraps around the nerf rail.
Daytona Beach or Miami are the obvious front runners. Though in Miami, you won't be able to tell the people competing for DUI champ and the people just driving like assholes. 
Yes. As far as I know, everyone is required to take Gen eds. There are three courses that are required for all majors: Analytical Reading and Writing and Intellectual Heritage I and II. Some majors allow you to bypass certain classes. For example, because I was a bio major, I didn't have to take Math or Science Gen ed, or language. 
CNN isn't the liberal counterpart to Fox News. CNN is mostly just an incredibly incompetent joke, which can't be taken seriously. It's barely even news. MSNBC is the liberal counterpart. However, Fox is a much larger news organization (most-watched in America), and the vast majority of its programming is opinion shows being passed off as news programs.The combination of Fox's popularity and extremely rightwing opinion shows results in it being attacked much more often. MSNBC has the same tendency to go off the rails on the liberal side of things, but fewer people see it.
It honestly depends heavily on the store. The first store I started going to FNM at was full of overly competitive, non-talkative dickheads. However, I somehow ended up at the store I play at now, and actually ended up running the events after the original judge had to move away. Everyone is there to have fun, and everyone is accommodating of new players.I recommend trying Meetup.com, searching your area, and looking for a place with relatively casual players. I've played for over 15 years and know the game inside and out, but even *I* hate playing with the ultra-competitive douches.
Actually if you look, the links posted by those "users" is the only thing (site) said user posts about.  I would say it's people running those sites trying to make a buck, through ads.
Then I'll tell it briefly: A group of early Christians got together and plotted how they might better market Christianity so that it could expand to the general population and not be restricted to Jews.
Posting decklists is more fruitful than askin for "general tips". If you just hear "play a good curve" or "Play card A, card B is also good", then there's lots of ways for a guy to misunderstand that advice and still keep playing in a suboptimal way. So much about this game is situational, that asking for help with a specific deck gives you just better results than trying to implement advice from a short-ish comment.I will say though, that copying decks with Naxx cards, and then replacing the naxx cards will probably result in shittier decks. Building decks from the ground up without Naxx cards, will result in better ones. Good archetype without any Naxx cards would be ramp Druid, which only plays the Loatheb, a very replaceable card in general.

we have to stay smart in the second half.  they will try to bait us to get in altercations and potentially get suspended.  we're going to the second round, they're not.  gotta stay smart.
Shipping was quick from being sent out the next day to getting to my door exactly on time. Packing was nice and product was in flawless condition. Would buy from again. :] 
I mean, shit, it is. I like the melody/tune of it. It's a good song. There shouldn't be anything controversial in saying that. [I also think Cavoglave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUbCp2WgkYw) was a pretty good song. They're both fascinating examples of musical propaganda. They're good songs too.
Dude, you're bitching about your Cadillac not being a convertible.  It's not like it's just a cupholder that you're talking about adding.  How can you bring the word 'arrogant' into this conversation?  The only arrogance that I see are all the whiners that are making it seem like Bungie doesn't care about the community.  How many things have they fixed in LESS THEN A YEAR since the game's been out?  Raids would be nightmares with matchmaking.  For every one of your complaints, you would have double the amount about the raids being broken and terrible experiences because of the randoms.
Cool video man, keep at it!  Easiest and most inexpensive way to make the greatest difference in quality would be to invest in a professional microphone.Can't wait to see your collection video.

Strawmen. Look at what what was filmed and how people there on the spot behaved instead of reaching out and tying in other topics. What was happening here does not class as public abuse. Its hardly even public. It does class as a beat up though.
Okay, here's as gentle as it gets; as a random stranger on the internet telling you instead of having a possible relationship ruined somewhere down the line, a dick pic will never get you anywhere and isn't what anyone wants to see. 
that was thier intention i think. they want to have swag on the team if/when he is unbanned and this is a way to test the waters with the comunity and the leagues. there is no saying that if/when valve unbans him that other leagues will.
Not really from what I hear, but from what I read. When someone writes emphasis for a word where the letter emphasized shouldn't be, i.e. "Fire Boltttttttttttttttttttttttttttt!"
Even if it was only one (fairly certain there was more than one) one is too many. It needs to be flawless or else you're giving a human something not true to nature, and many people can't adapt their sense of direction to it. This is why maps exist in games with so much detail, because in reality you can get a much stronger sense of where you are, where you came from, and where you're going. Games - especially Morrowind with its limited graphics - do not have you so in tune. Some adapt well but it's not exactly a hyper minority that doesn't.We shouldn't just say "Fuck you" to those who can't handle it. Hell, my mom can't handle real life directions, let alone games. I just think there should be both options in games, which leaves room for error in the directions and leaves room for gamers who don't want their hands held.
haha ya i watched the first bit of it last year for the first time and it can be fairly inclimatic at times expecialy if your a pats fan, just a fun thing to bulshit to and have a few... beers.
Ok, I think what my team member were trying to say is that whole avant is a very strong team and has placed 1st almost consistently, they are the almighty team that you make them out to be. In my opinion, the top four teams consist of avant in 1st, then 3 teams tied for a close second, and I have the proof you seem to demand. In our scrims against tkam, we +exhil) generally manage a close win. Tkam have the same situation against slap. As in tkam are beating slap. But when wexhil scrim slap, slap generally win. This weird 3 way tie is something that frustrates our team when people leave us out. All teams have worked hard for their placings. There have been multiple times where our team has been left out of top teams discussion, and as you can imagine its kinda annoying.
I would actually try this.  It plays the edgy card and people will come by and laugh and talk with you.Although I also told a criminal defense attorney to print his business cards on condoms saying "don't get fucked by the hard dick of the law without using me for protection."  So maybe I'm not the best person to ask.
Hmm maybe  theres an external procedure running in the background that changes around the files. Open up task manager go into processes and close any that you don't recognise installing. Hopefully it'll stop the problem. :( after that I don't know.
Alright to give some more information, a while back when I was young I played quite a bit of Runescape. I myself really enjoy the mmo genre. I have very few doubts that I will dislike the game. But I want to make sure it is worth the dollar amount I will pay to play it. In comparison to some other mmos that are free to play, how does it stack up content wise?
I was born in Zambia and went to school in Zim, so crossed Beit Bridge which goes over the Zambesi right next to the falls ( just out the picture) 6 times a year.
If you want to use a late 2nd for Elliot than why not Talbot? I feel that Elliot is at his peak already and always injured while Talbot did ridiculously well when he replaced Lundqvist.
Here's hoping you didn't waste your free silvers on cost reduction, or else it is a bit dire from first glance as you now lack the units to CC your healers. To do Ryujin King which is a big hurdle you need at least 1, if not 2 CC healers to provide safe clear. It is not just because of how much heal you get but also for the necessary range to make it work so your range damage units don't get blown up by their AOE. You have a Princess so that could settle your tank problem but I would put the bet that the biggest reason you are struggling now is on your healing department and a generally low damage output.At this point if you lack healers to CC your only hope is to go with tank swaps period. Because there is literally no way to tank 2 mages effectively without a healer to come by you can try splitting by tanking both on 2 separate lanes. 
The visual I have from reading the first line of your reply is absolutely magnificent. I saw the OP screaming "YOU. ARE DISGUSTING! " as the powerful blast from the Shitlord made contact with the fat asses head. 
Marvel changed the rules though, they set out to create a comic book universe on the big screen, something that's never happened before.  So it's a new style of Movie, as a result I would think that the rules change.

Re the genders being reversed, it's not a parallel scenario unless he's also unable to get off anyway but orally. He very likely can get off via PiV, manually, etc., but this is it for her. She's been doing this for *two years* without having an orgasm during sex. I bet he's had one every time. 
As anywhere else, you do not need to tip if you would prefer not to. If you received your food from a different part of the store, like the Deli or Chinese Express, you are expected NOT to tip.

Basically, as you pushed off, you imparted the same amount of force onto the desk. Your desk just has more mass than you, or if not, more resistance via friction against the floor than you in a wheeled office chair do.Thus it laughs at your attempts to give it motion and gives you motion instead.If your chair were rooted to the floor and you did the same thing with all your force, you'd probably move the desk instead. Unless it's one of those big solid wood desks or a steelcase or something. Then you'd need Arnold Schwarzenegger arms and a competition to see whether your chair legs snap or the desk moves first would ensue among a lot of grunting.
If they had this kind of info why wait to release it?  We all know if the police had been killed every detail of the incident, true or not, would be released to the media instantly.   In this case, and so many others, oh, you have to wait while they complete the investigation...
I followed someone's suggestion on here to add a table to a laundry room when I had the same/a similar problem. I don't understand why, but it instantly fixed the problem and workers started to actually work and bring uniforms around again.
Haha is there some kind of background to this? Did he just not play very well for you guys?Edit: I can't stop watching the goal at the end and laughing.
Oh My.... your book is soooooo cooooollll seriously.... nice work.... and the cursive on the knife is nice too.... I'll send you the next "initiation" 
Congratulations. College will be quite an adventure. It was for me.I'm currently set to graduate in two weeks so I'm busy living it up with my friends before I move across the country next month.
I honestly don't remember learning any cellular bio in EMT. That's all in medic school. Know all of the major functions of all of the systems, organs, etc., know the location of just about everything, know your topical anatomy. You'll be fine. Any cardiac output question you may see will likely just be CO=HRxSV. Any question on gas exchange would (most likely) just have to do with knowing it happens at the capillary beds near the alveoli, O2 moves into RBCs and CO2 comes off. But like others have said, know I your shit to be a good provider, not just to pass. 
I'd just like to echo the last sentence. If you're looking to do an EE flavored path but also have a coding scratch you want to itch definitely look into CE. 
The rest of the criminal justice system. The decision to charge and try police officers is totally external from the union. They can be very influential in terms of internal departmental matters, but they have ZERO influence on prosecutors and judges.Sources:https://www.aclu.org/blog/speakeasy/how-does-federal-government-handle-prosecutions-police-officershttp://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings/
A lot of people feel that he falls flat in t3/4, but in t4 mainly. He doesn't scale that well and most of the people that play him are bad players modding for iron skin to use as a crutch. It really does depend how you play it though, he makes for some decent CC (nothing compared to disarm loki or a nova) and is a good buffer. 
"I do hope you are right, my lord," Lord Grafton said with a furrow of his brow. "Might you have any idea the allegiance of these Red Priests? I know the Children of Fire have been known to burn septs and murder septons in the Stormlands, yet they never seemed to be the type to kidnap and murder a random Lord without reason. I only wish that I had time to ask Isaac what he knew of those men.."
I don't have one. I used one in an AZ motel. Stand in front of the flushing toilet with your pants rolled up and your socks rolled down. The spray is very fine.
Relevant story. A guy who until just recently worked under me was allegedly (I say allegedly because this situation cannot be confirmed either way, however he is a really good guy and I personally feel that it is mostly likely to be true in terms of the actual events, if not the specifics) assaulted by his wife.He was holding his 4 month old son and ended up getting into an argument with his wife over money (he is the sole provider of the household). It got heated, and she started hitting and biting him while he was holding his child. He, in his words, "just snapped," and elbowed her in the face. He set his child down and left the house to cool down. Called me directly afterwards and told me what (allegedly) happened. I told him to file a police report for assault, even if he decided not to press charges. He did so, but when he got back to his house he found his wife had called the cops first, and he was arrested.He now has pending domestic abuse charges.
Thanks for that feedback, Sosh looks good, though am a little concerned about not having enough data on itAm I right in thinking the Sosh plans are month-by-month, i.e. don't lock you into a 12/24m contract?
I'm pretty sure it matters, I mean aside from the way you represent yourself it plays a huge role, like other labels looking at the hard dance artist who post anime porn scenes on his twitter account, the only other thing they can keep you off the label once you already released is if your stuff sounds exactly the same (unless your Puppet).
I say that hundreds of different cultures give a religious account for the sun and the stars and life, and the Hebrews weren't any exception.Doesn't mean it's not theologically informed. For example "God created the heavens and the earth" is a pretty central belief. It also relates to the Sabbath and the significance of man (being separated from the plants and animals and created on the last day in God's image).
I guess I didn't think of it that way. I thought of it as a windfall rather than illicit gains. Although, I do like being called a "mob boss". I think I will have to reconsider this transaction and just stick to my original position of not taking any form of payment for the consults. Sorry for wasting the Chatrealmes time on this one..

It looks like they're on a pretty open schedule, and that tickets are available for pretty much every time. I browsed through a few possible visiting dates and it was all available. The only problem now is that the wife and kids aren't fully available this weekend, so I suppose it'll have to be another day.
Awesome. Thanks a lot for the answer.  I guess I'd just be worried that somehow some thc would sneak through in the extracting process or whatever it is. I really have no idea how it's done though or if that's even a possibility. Also, do you have any experience using CBD? I've tried different over the counter products for stress/anxiety and none of them do anything for me.

They're looters, not fanatical soldiers defending their emporer. If you have a gun they'll probably be scared enough by that, but even if you have to start shooting a few of them, the rest of them aren't going to give up their lives so the looters behind them can steal some pepperoni. Suddenly it's every man for himself and they run the fuck away.
According to an engineer I talked to recently, this sounds similar to what happened with foundation coverage. The foundation company would come out and find a small problem in one area of the foundation, tell the homeowner, "Well, we could just fix that one area or we could go ahead and secure the whole foundation, you know, just in case." Insurance companies got tired of paying huge claims on work that didn't actually need to be done. Now you can pretty much count on paying out of pocket for foundation work. 
Giannis should have been sure to punch Dunleavy in the face as well. Eye for an eye, right? Will the NBA do the right thing and suspend Dunleavy for the next game too?
I was not a fan of the singing, I dont really like any rappers when they sing besides phonte. The worst part was def the country rap crossover shit, lets just say I sure hope yela did not start a trend. Actually im pretty sure Florida Georgia line started it.
*Dear Nosy Nelly,**Hi. I'm sorry to inform you that I'm no longer comfortable with having you around us anymore. I'd also like it if you could please keep me informed if you are going to be in our neighborhood or attend any of our events. I don't feel you are a good influence to have around.*But seriously, fuck her. Annie is a woman. Don't tell her about this because it can only hurt her. Just conveniently forget you have a relationship with Nosy Nelly and, if you ever see her again, chew her out for being a bigot. Ask her when she'll learn how to respect people and have an apology for your fiancee. 
Americans misunderstanding or not adhering to cultural norms = ignorant, rude tourists. Europeans misunderstanding or not adhering to cultural norms = honest mistake, not their fault. Math checks outs!  Edit: not a criticism of you, just a general sentiment I see from time to time. 
This week was okay. I got a Math quiz yesterday and a small Biology test today. I keep forgetting that Avengers 2 comes out this week and not next week. I want to watch it on Saturday, but there's definitely gonna be a lot of people and I'd probably have to line up really early for it. It sucks that I don't have a credit card and can't buy the tickets online. 
Notable halftime shit:Dunleavy leads all scorers with 19 points. GOD DAMN.I SHOULDN'T SNUB POOH. 7 assists! Giannis ejected.Oh, guess what is neat...assists! Bulls have assisted on 80% of their baskets so far.Another cool thing...rebounding. We've out-rebounded Milwaukee 26 to 17, including 6 offensive boards.
lol at a straight edge band being anywhere close to main stream. brah, [visit his website.](http://www.straightedgeworldwide.com/) he knows every straightedge band out there. 
Wow seriously? 12 years ago and you are still bragging about it and still have links to the post? Is this your proudest fucking achievement in life or something?
This is simply untrue. To remain grey you can never press. Pressing isn't an option. Just as not pressing wasn't an option for me if I was to become red.The difference between us is that my flair is rare and beautiful and it required decisive action while yours is common and cowardly and required you to sit back and do nothing.
Tywin's always wanted a Valyrian sword, and the fact that the sword belonged to the Reynes, the House he's famous for hating and destroying- would even sweeten the deal.
I don't disagree that most of the negative reactions to those patterns fail to meet the requirements of a phobia. But I don't think everyone feels an aversion to the pattern, and I think some have an unusually strong reaction to it worthy of further investigation.. as with phobias, there are gradients to how severely a person is affected, but it's dismissive to say it's just a universal thing.
llGrantyll  (those are L's btw)I need more adds, barely played a weekly aside from on my own and getting obliterated, got a fair way into some though if only for the challenge and the odd bounty   
I really like the roaming potential of glimmer cape, but if CM uses it to ult, I feel like people will just dust into a stun. BKB will still be necessary.
I'm not surprised. I've tried other keyboards, and they have so many useless features that I'm never going to use. Plus, I just love the stock dark material theme. I guess I'm just a stock fanboy.
the aoe is very small and as it is now he lacks any sort of teamfight presence. he doesn't have damage, he doesn't have CC for peel or co-ordination besides his 3 which is one of the more mediocre CC's in the game. Sure the recent buffs means he can clear wave but after that he can't do anything at all to anyone. All he's good at now is tanking phoenixes and running away.
Yes, it does.  I share your contempt for that misleading narrative for a variety of reasons.  It ignores the compensation multiplier they get from choosing stock/LTI grants over salary compensation along with the tax benefits derived from that practice.
I agree, i have nothing against giving modders money for their efforts, especially those that go through the process of total conversions. The only reason i think it had to go was it was flawed from the out set. if devs had &gt;%50 cut and the market was curated properly i would have been fine with it.
My guess:"Dog" = "sexually voracious male"."No end of" = intensifier.It seems to have started [in the 1950s](https://books.google.com/books?id=15ZTAAAAYAAJ&amp;amp;amp;q=%22no+end+of+a+dog%22&amp;amp;amp;dq=%22no+end+of+a+dog%22&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;ei=Y8FCVefjOoa5oQSl-4FY&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg), but its most notable sighting must be in a [letter from Pope John Paul I to Pinocchio](https://books.google.com/books?id=Yex2o7Ta48UC&amp;amp;amp;lpg=PA99&amp;amp;amp;dq=%22no%20end%20of%20a%20dog%22&amp;amp;amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;amp;amp;q=%22no%20end%20of%20a%20dog%22&amp;amp;amp;f=false).  The phrase was used to translate the [original Italian](http://www.papaluciani.com/ita/insegnamenti/lettere/illustrissimi/pinocchio.htm) *credendo di essere "brillanti" per le loro avventure donnesche* (thinking [themselves] "brilliant" on account of their adventures with the ladies).
I just want to say that it sounds so adorable how you refer to things :3, like "putting a bootloader on a phone". Any computational device with an OS has a bootloader, as it needs to know what to boot into when you press the "on" button, also counts for computers, consoles and whatnot. What you do is **unlock** the bootloader, as in saying; "Yes, I'm a responsible human being that needs no handholding and know my way around this". Also root is nothing more than giving you "admin rights" on the system, so ye, obviously any version can get root. It's no "hack", because (largely) it needs nothing to be hacked for like jailbreaking an iOS device. (Someone needs to find an exploit to actually be able to, which is actually hacking it, and apple tries to prevent that at all cost at every new iteration, whereas Nexus devices are developers devices which grant you this freedom from the manufacturer).
I actually like the new version a lot better. :) The reason I posted to this subreddit in the first place was to get some input on the look, which you provided me with.And yes, it still looks great with the weapons.
3M makes a great product that is generally sold at craft stores. It's an adhesive tape... without the tape. Just a thin roll of adhesive.Looks like this:https://www.tedpella.com/semmisc_html/16081-11.jpgMuch thinner than traditional double-coated tape.
Sweet! I was awarded with a talisman for Hurricane /late. 4 kills, 10k RP ^^ With premium too. I was researching the first Sea Hurricane at the time, so it was a lot of RP for sure. But look at that premium reward though. Do you only get the SL if you buy premium om the same day as that happened, or do you get the RP too?
An AMA would be quite informative. I lived in Brasil for a few years, saw some...stuff. But never something quite like this.    Does Brasil offer any kind of mental therapy for a patient in this kind of situatuation?
I have a full time job as well, where I cannot play, and I also have a family, so I don't have much time to play. But I find time and enjoy it. It's a game. So you can't AFK farm. Big deal. You actually have to play the game? OH NOES!@!!!@!21121@!!!People are making this into a much bigger deal than it is.
1. I say no. Unless you have a history of destroying or losing phones, cell phone insurance is a rip off. And yes, there is a deductible. It's $150-175 for the high-end phones, such as your G3.2. Only [music apps](http://www.t-mobile.com/offer/music-freedom-list.html). The Speedtest.net app is also whitelisted, but I'm assuming you're not going to spend your entire day running speed tests. Yes, Play Music is included. You should note that only streaming is whitelisted. Downloading music for offline playback, the artist and album artwork, playlist listings, etc. are not included.
no one is suggesting we send this person to jail. But to think that you are safe is dumb. You are never safe. you will never be safe. You must be on guard at all times. The world is a scary place. It is filled with monsters and criminals and people who want to do you harm. You might feel safe, because you are raised in a world were other people have been keeping you safe without you taking notice, but in the end, the only person who is responsible for your safety is yourself.
I have the same watch (but 38mm) and it's absolutely gorgeous. Don't fret man! You made a great choice!My tip for the Milanese Loop is if it feels weird just put the loop end on the other side of the watch face. (Rotate the band)

Nope didn't work out. I had previously left him and mistakenly thought he changed. He was emotionally abusive so I feel like he had some type of hold on me. Almost like brain washing. I can't think of a better word. He's very manipulative but then again most alcoholics are. Now we're in the middle of a divorce and custody. It sucks. He blames me for everything he can never take responsibility for his actions. He says I ripped the family apart and how much he misses our daughter but her barely ever makes time for her. Also found out his ex was at our wedding!! And I had no clue!! He never even told me they were dating!! Who does that? And he's been seeing someone else less then a month after I left. He didn't even know I wasn't going back this time. What a fuckin dick. Sorry for the rant.

holy shit I loved these guys back in the old days!saw them live so many timesi still remember when they played mosh and roll/losin it/bury your fucking dead. whatever you wanna call it. everyone piled up on top of the mic. and i mean a pile all the way to the ceiling of the venue. One of my most favorite bands to have watched live.
How the fuck do these people think *any* word in the lexicon gets interpeted to be offensive? It's almost as if there's a progression of circumstances that establish these baselines! You know, like when a black guy is called a thug for not actually doing anything that's actually "thuggish" or doing something a white guy would do who isn't typically called the same word.And of course they know this; I don't believe they're so stupid that the basics of context escape them. That some white guy with a swastika tattoo shouting "Sieg heil" isn't actually doing anything wrong because neither of those actions are "naturally offensive" and "you could make anything seem offensive". They just play stupid, like a child, because that's the easy, safe route. 
Silvino Bracho. That guys stats are crazy and he's doing it very very quietly.Wilmer Difo is good though he might be taken. Same with Jorge Mateo.Jorge Polanco is a good one.

In today's ATV they mentioned all ships that you have the ability to use in AC or in the holotable have to be loaded way off screen when you load your hanger.

I personally think the only thing dying out is the original model 3DS/XL. I hope it means we'll probably have more New 3DS exclusive games that will take advantage of the extra power, C Stick and extra shoulder buttons. 4 years is still a respectable lifespan and with no real immediate news on a new Nintendo handheld (E3 probably might surprise us) it looks like the 3DS brand might have a year or two left.

I'm not misunderstanding the statistics I'm questioning if its valid. Reported rape cases are taken from all over the country, the CDC took phone calls from 12000 people. Even when you double the reported rapes its .1%. 
Des que l'on voit un squat il faut faire une main courante a la Police ou a la Gendarmerie. La règle des 48 heures repose sur, d'un cote: les preuves de date d'entree en domicile que les squatteurs ont, de l'autre: la date a laquelle on fait sa declaration, et éventuellement des témoignages indiquant la dernière date a laquelle on a constate que le logement était libre.Attention, il ne faut pas mentir a la police, mais si un voisin dit qu'il n'avait pas vu de lumière a telle date et n'avait pas fait attention avant cela, alors cette date peut être presentée de bonne foi.

I sub in elementary school. There is no one designated teachers lounge. There are lounges for each grade level (k-5). Depending on what grade I am subbing, I eat with those teachers. I sub in an amazing district and all the teachers are very welcoming and they are generally curious about my career plans. Other than that, conversations are usually stories about the kids and funny things they do or the fact that even teachers like to pull April fools pranks on one another. 
I constructed a deck similiar to Forsens and it is the most fun i have had playing hearthstone.Im f2p so its great to have constructed a well rounded deck that is not a bastardised version of another design.

Sometimes when I see a deleted post I wonder what that idiot said but I don't miss it much.Wouldn't it be awesome if we had a /blackladies mod awesomeness version of the whole internet?

Claim it on insurance, it's not your fault, and if you report it the same day, often times insurance will forgive the deductible due to you being on the ball
Dude, tattooing and sculpting aren't even in the same universe. If you want to tattoo, and ever have anyone take you seriously, you need to apprentice. Don't buy a "starter kit". As an amateur, no reputable supplier will even sell to you, so you will end up with sub standard equipment, that you don't even know how to use and you're going to fucking scar your friends up. Do you even know the first thing about BBP prevention? What's your infection prevention control plan? Tattooing isn't some fucking hobby you pick up because you think you'll be good at it, it is a way of life.
Absolutely not. If I had a Guilmon as my partner, I'd keep him completely out of the public eye for his own sake. No need for us to get snatched away and experimented on or exploited simply for power's sake. Plus, paparazzi would be quite bothersome.
Abbot is a politician who is playing to the fringe supporters who elected him.  This is all about keeping the nutters happy so they keep voting GOP tickets.  Nothing more.
Honestly, not much. I was just pointing out that the place may not be that nice all the time. As another commenter put it, it's one good drop in a bucket of trust.
So define a #1 WR.  Anyone who follows football knows they don't actually need a #1 WR.  The Patriots have averaged 500 points a season the last 5 seasons.  That's more than any team over 5 years ever.  And we've done it without a "true" #1 WR.
Generally, I hate it when the ending of a movie is intentionally left open to interpretation and people try really hard to decode it. If they wanted you to know for sure what happened, they would have shown it. The film works both ways, so just accept that the uncertainty you feel at the end is probably what they intended. Specifically, I hate about 90% of 'Inception' fan theories. The top spins for an improbably (but not impossibly) long time before it wobbles, then cut to black. He doesn't find out for sure if he's actually awake, and neither does the audience, and that's the point. 
I have driven under the influence of marijuana basically every day for the past 8 years.  I have never been in an accident while high, nor have I been pulled over.Both, however, have happened over the same time period while entirely sober.  I rear ended a woman while it was raining, caused no damage, while sober.  Was speeding when I didn't know the speed limit(of 15MPH...) and got snagged by the fuzz, while sober.
Unless you plan to do video editing as well, since both of those produce variable frame rate videos which causes issues with certain editors like Adobe Premiere.
this behavior is based on population density of the area people are accustomed to. Put a man from West Texas in a room with a man from Tokyo and have them talk about something they both care deeply about. Then watch the Tokyo guy unconsciously chase the Texan around the room as the Texan keeps trying to make more space.
But if the majority of their viewers are against the riots, then portraying the police negatively for controlling the rioters with non-lethal means would surely alienate the viewers who want to see the riots end.

Yeah, and BP knew what it was doing with the pipeline in the Gulf coast? Just because a company is massive and successful doesn't mean they don't fuck up and can't make mistakes. It's such a fallacious argument to continually go back to "I think they know what they're doing." Sometimes, they miss the mark. This is called feedback. 
25% is an acceptable amount for the amount of piggybacking a modder does. I would say it's 99% easier to make a mod for a game than to make a distribution platform and an entirely new game.

I teach first and second grade music. Since I'm an enrichment teacher, I teach about four hundred kids. The worst is when we predict what the students will be like as adults. There's one kid we're all certain is a sociopath, another we're fairly certain will turn to drugs when he's older. I worry so much about the boys who have no father figure. Their attitudes already show they have zero respect for authority and will get into trouble with the law.  
"If there's people who are saying somebody saw something different, we're looking for that person. And we don't have them yet," he said. "I don't believe these people exist, quite frankly, but we're going to attempt to do it."I wonder how much they'll bully and threaten them with some form of bogus charge over that when they find them. Fucking thugs.
i've always been a huge admirer of noisy/gritty production done well (i.e., on purpose as part of the sound, rather than "i'll just make everything the same volume for no raisin"). that's the same reason i dug sleigh bells' first album (treats) so much - at times it sounds downright *ugly*, lots of deliberate clipping and over-the-top compression, which was a very gutsy move for a pop album. i'm also really into big contrasts between high and low pass filters. in his early days SebastiAn loved to abuse all these screechy filters and have build-ups/breakdowns where the entire song would dissolve into this high-pass mush, which is what got me into his music.
I had to learn to identify every European country on an unmarked map for a high school class. It didn't improve my understanding of history, but its a really lame party trick. 
He may be retired but I'm still a massive Stephano fan, and I'm really happy that he hasn't totally given up competing even though he's not doing it full time.
surprisingly enough, nobody's bothering.  i have no issues with the 2nd amendment, i just wish people would read it correctly.  just because you're allowed to own guns doesn't mean you have a NEED for certain types of guns.
I just read this after installing the Metro skin.. But I know I've had it before and now I had it again. Uninstalled metro and still had it. Killed the cpu hungry process.. Restarted Steam and it was gone. Reinstalled Metro and there it was again, but I killed the process again and now it doesn't show up on it's own.It's really annoying, for some reason it takes up 25% of my cpu power, which heavily cripples my gaming.. I wish it would get fixed..
You will be fine with a bottom in and out route for The Narrows. That is a day hike and does not require a permit. It is just like subway bottom route. Check out this site: http://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.cfmIt had really good information on various hikes in the area. Don't be too bummed out. There's plenty of gorgeous things to still do in the area. 
It too was much different than the others, bloom took a long time to get used to. It wasn't received well by the competitive community either, but it had something else that still had me coming back to play it. In terms of a video game, 7/10, in terms of a halo, 4/10.To be honest with you though, about half way through Halo 3 I realized I hated it and have been skeptical about every halo since. I'm a Halo 1 and Halo 2 supremacist.Edit: sure guys, an opinion you don't agree with? Just downvote it. Because that's what the downvote button was invented for, as a way to show disagreement.
Well, my identity ain't hurting anyone nor violating people's personal boundaries, so I wouldn't classify it as "creepy". :P Weird, sure, but not creepy.As for which part, half.
Actually I just did a few days ago, which is why I mentioned it, I had forgotten how defensive Saitama gets about being bald. Also, concerning that thread, Dorohedoro is fucking awesome. I heard it finished finally? I definitely need to get into that again. 
[There's a 2% performance difference between the i5-2500k and the i5-4670k.](http://www.ocaholic.ch/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1158&amp;page=13) You're not going to experience much, if any, performance increase with upgrading your 2600 to the 4790k, seeing how the i5 variants get little performance increase.TL:DR : no
I don't have a home anymore. My mom sold our house and is now traveling. I live in a rented room. However the only real home I know is my local bar. It's like Cheers. I can go there any time and sit by the fire and read a book. That is my real home and it has not changed in 30 years. If it goes, I will no longer have any ties to my home town and I will move wherever the wind blows me. 
&gt; The control suites weren't even close to parity back thenWhich is very understandable since winforms is a much older technology, and they've probably been working on all that way before WPF was a thing.None of that makes winforms less useless, given the state of affairs today, in 2015, when Microsoft is emphasizing Universal Windows apps (XAML + DataBinding + platform agnostic ViewModels) and winforms is seen the same way VB6 is seen, as legacy. I really really like to see how you're running your winforms stuff, on Windows Phone, or Android.
Ok this isn't related to CLG but I really hope they do a meetup and come to Honolulu so I can ~~punch Xpecial for beating CLG~~ actually meet a pro player. Sorry this just got me excited. I wish CLG would win so Hotshotgg would take them to my home... :( LET THE HAWAIIAN MANA COURSE THROUGH YOUR VEINS CLG
I'll check! Never considered that.. only because the course isn't run by UTM, it just takes place at UTM.EDIT: it exists.. but has very little activity. 
Thanks for the good reply. I was just curious of everyone's thoughts on it overall. I am actually coming in as the senior consultant and will be leading a team of consultants on our engagements (experienced hire). Defining the requirements, nailing down scope, creating the project plan, managing change, etc.  I know IT consulting in general sometimes gets a bad rep. 
Then you should read about some of the stupid sick shit these assholes do in the name of "family woop woop".  Murder, rape, torture, the fucking worst of the worst. 
Yes, it's best to treat all guns as loaded until confirmed that they are not. Even still, do not aim at that which you do not intend to shoot. I don't use safeties on firearms. I always leave them disengaged, but I always leave the action held open so the gun may be quickly made ready to fire
A lot of it was really well done, but the creature is really cheesy looking (horrible sounding, though D:) and the ending is pretty absurd. The movie is great besides these things, though, and had some really creepy parts. 
I heard it was for a role, pretty sad that they want him to be a fat guy instead of making the most of the new and probably much more able healthy him.I haven't seen many of his movies but it seems that he is just a fat daft clumsy guy in everything.
Haha this is crazy, I just finished watching the season of Better Call Saul and started going through Breaking Bad again when I see this AMA. I have two questions. 1) What challenges did you face making a side character like Saul into the main character? For a majority of the first season he is trying to be moral but after the realization in the season finale, it seems that he will be more like the side character we saw in Breaking Bad during season 2. 2) Are you enjoying making Mike a protagonist in Better Call Saul versus somebody working against the interests of the main character in Breaking Bad? 
I'm not too sure if these are the ones he's referring to, but there's two volumes on sale at Hot Topic [here](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/ShopByPopCulture/License/BreakingBad/Breaking+Bad+Volume+1+Vinyl+LP+Hot+Topic+Exclusive-10223181.jsp) and [here](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/PopCulture/ShopByPopCulture/License/BreakingBad/Breaking+Bad+Volume+2+Vinyl+LP+Hot+Topic+Exclusive-10160729.jsp). Hope that helps!
Your notes about the Beer Barrel Bourbon are really close to what I remember, it's definitely a tricky one because of the buttery ocean spray. It's great stuff for the price, but the OGD is a notch above.
I've submitted 5 tapes under 9 different drag names. I've auditioned for every season (including All Stars) at least 3 times. There's no way I can't be on season 8, mawma *death drops* 
Never said I have or haven't tried it, you're just making assumptions. And yes it has been shown in trials to be effective in treating PTSD symptoms. That doesn't speak to the safety of it though. Bleach has been shown to effectively kill the AIDS virus. That doesn't mean that it's *safe*. 
I think they just want to make art out of lunch, and Mystery Inc doesn't provide free meals, so they just steal it from the kitchen of where ever they are, or bring their own lunch.Yes, I try to make art out of sandwiches.
How did you move to women using abortion as their ONLY form of birth control, the primary function of sexual intercourse is reproduction if you aren't willing or able to take on that responsibility you shouldn't have sex because you aren't a responsible adult. Being an adult means taking responsibility for your actions, pretending the consequences were unforeseeable or unexpected is just bullshit. But I guess none of that matters the only thing that's important is self gratification right? Guess I'll go out and do some smack and then pretend I didn't know addiction was a consequence.
No it's not. If you design your communication protocol properly, you can communicate securely with someone even if you know that attackers can read some subset of your messages.
Last Update: Thursday, April 30th, 2015 (33 image update, 33 new images)My Current Game Date: Year 2, Winter 2nd.Working on upgrading to + products, and stockpiling the normal ones in the meantime.
I have a very similar saw, and am quite happy with it since I tuned it up and replaced the fence with a homemade beisemeyer clone (in my experience the align-a-rip wasn't particularly good).
Everything I've heard about the RWD cars from people who have actually driven rally at some level and have played this has been nothing but positive.  Pretty much everyone has been saying they are spot on.
But he's not JaMarcus. You're just comparing them because you see two big bodied QBs. They're completely different. Winston can actually throw with touch. JaMarcus was a much better athlete in terms of speed and agility. JaMarcus was a lazy bastard that didn't give a fuck about playing football. Jameis wants to play football. He loves it, he's smart, he's an insanely passionate player with some dumbass incidents from college.Jameis compares to JaMarcus like Ryan Leaf compares to Andrew Luck.
Oh no way! Big fan of kava kava! Wow defiantly gonna try to order some of that. It's awesome you guys are experimenting with other chemicals given we are no longer confined to the tobacco leaf! Awesome thank you so much for the link!
* Schiavone: And the Outsiders are beating the hell...WAIT! It's Hulk Hogan!* Heenan: But whose side is he on?Literally the worst possible thing Heenan could have said at the time.
They're down 30 in the second quarter. More than half the game left. I get the odds of winning are slim, but he just gave up on his season for a cheap shot.
I'm not a lawyer, but I swear I remember reading recently that it was ruled somewhere IP address isn't enough to identify someone. So why would it be OK for a search warrant to be enforced based on that alone? Literally anyone could have been using his network. I understand that wasn't the case, but it is definitely true. Would a warrant be OK'd if they found this was happening out of a McDonald's? Does the level of security on the network have any play in the decision?
his team had no chance. that was a man showing another he wasnt gonna let him make him his bitch.If you actually watched this series you would know that dunleavy has been getting away with dirty sneaky cheapshots all series.
They could have sold more if they released it at the same time as consoles.  Think of all the people who bought it on a console because they didn't want to wait.  Or all the people who didn't want to buy it a second time.
To be honest, I probably received a worst one which I got from fasttech for around 4 dollars.. It actually screwed together, like while wrapping a coil the two main pieces would not separate. I tried to alter it but it simply wasn't worth the effort or time.
&gt; Frederica QuartetSuppose I like her in general (especially her short stories), but found the first book of this kind of boring, would you recommend the others?
Giannis got the right punishment. But keep in mind Dunleavy straight up hit MCW in the mouth and sent him to locker room and a foul  let alone anything else wasnt called. The Bulls came out hard and you can tell our players are pissed 
French fries / hamburgers / pancakes / pork belly1per week / 1 per week / 1 per week / 2 per monthSometimes I have cheat weeks and eat fries more than once.  Joking aside, I enjoy eating food, not macros.  I live to eat, not eat to live.  
The British tech tree finally got some more aircraft and the new interface is sleek, definite improvement on the last patch. Flight model improvements are always a good thing too!
&gt;It went up to over $200 then fell again, and didn't bubble again until that November/December.It actually hit AUD$280 in April 2013, since the $AUD/$USD exchange rate was an insane $1.25 (vs $0.78 presently). The lesson here is that the filthy fiat AUD$ has lost ~33% of its value. Of course I'm choosing the time frame, but that's totes ok to do with fiat. Conversely, it is totes not ok when talking about Bitcoin price to compare arbitrary time scales (arbitrary meaning... month, day, year; also looking at time as only moving forward is cherry picking physics)
We are actually thankful for any hep we get, of course. And I'm glad we had this conversation, it made me see foreign support from a bit more personal side. I've been sitting here for the past 20 minutes trying to formulate my view on the difference between the people and the individual and it's just not working out. I'll just say that in my opinion the people is not the same thing as every single individual within the people, and I reserve the right to dislike the people while being ok with the individual. Anyway, its 3 am, my brain is going all sorts of directions that I dont particularly enjoy and I really need to get some sleep. Have a safe 1st of May, if that's celebrated in any way over there.
Being British and seeing tea wasted like that makes one die inside, although it wasn't real tea since it was in a bottle so i'll die a little bit instead.
Yea that's super rough : /. I'm guessing you are in at least a somewhat good neighborhood at least then. Not Johns Hopkins in Charles Village are you? Like the one good neighborhood through and through.
Working on a tracklist, but as it's always the case with AM, it's a fucking pain!!303 to the max in this episodeEDIT: [Tracklist is available] (http://1001tracklists.com/tracklist/75516_angry-man-absolute-darkness-015-2015-04-12.html)
rainbowmon is an event not everyone can participate in.It is like a giant fucking middle finger to the entire community who isnt sitting on monsters to evolve.
It's especially bad because Brie was picking Nikki up off the floor when Naomi kicked her. She was interfering in the match and no one called her out on it.Why did they make the Bellas faces? They're worse at being faces than Sheamus.
SO we force them to get a degree so they cause disruptions for students who actually want to be there and learn?SO we just give everyone a big governemnt check for existing each month because people are unwilling to earn a living?SO the billions if not trillions already spend in low income areas are not enough?Look what the Role modles did they got an education which lead to money which allowed them to move out of the ghetto.  Prehaps these thugs should look up to those people and not the local drug dealer.
Lol, what the fuck?I never said who should decide what someone puts in their body, nor did I say I am "the authority on everything." I don't know how it is the least bit controversial to say crack, heroin, meth, etc. are more destructive to one's body than caffeine. It is objective truth. And to be clear: I don't give a flying fuck who puts what in their body--be it coffee or meth. But don't try to pretend like a morning coffee is the same as smoking meth. 
Whoops, thought this was a different thread. Why does it matter who I am? How do you know that I am a CIS white male? If I am, why does that make my opinion worth less than the opinion of others? Don't we live in a society where everyone is treated equally? 
You can move to a higher level if they think you'll be able to handle it. My younger cousin went from lowest schooltype to highest schooltype in two years. She's going to uni in a year.
Yeah I've played around with the width of my grip. I have bad shoulders in general so it's possibly because of that but I do find it puts more stress than normal bench. 
My old team was Alex Mew Archon + anut and I managed 99% with it. and it was hard work, need to understand each matchup and play accordingly.it is slow to take off but there's no comp it can't beat. ( against AI of course )
I don't think ruining their name is that big a deal.  If worse comes to worse, they just change their name and start a new line.I mean, I still see shops selling eLeaf products, people are still buying them.  How much has their name been ruined?  I kind of think it's only within the realm of this sub.I don't think they would even bother until they notice shops aren't ordering their stuff any more, and I haven't heard of that happening yet.
The base is surprisingly solid while the razor itself is quite light. Definitely the lightest razor I've used - the weight feels similar to holding your average stainless steel fork.
i used to dislike wild stars because those hold notes at the beginning gave me a headache, now i dont know why but a song i cannot FC for the love of me is loveless world ~~(see what i did there)~~
This is on reddit now, here's how the rest of the day is going to go:Customer: "Hello, yes I'd like you to check my account because I believe I was a victim of bogus charges that I didn't purchase"AT&amp;T operator: "Sir, it doesn't look like you even have an account with us."Suctomer: "Oh ok, thank you."
Rookie in frustration. Shitty shitty move but after the last 2 games, all pumped and then this? A young guy like that cannot handle that. No excuse for a possibly injuring move but I get the frustration.
Why on earth is this guy downvoted? Because he hasn't used his PS4? Who cares? I actually spent a good 5 months not using it mostly due to massive depression. Come downvote me! 
I agree with you.  People are focusing on a single word rather than the message.  Perhaps he shouldn't have used the word 'invite' but it's minor semantics.  In the perfect world we wouldn't have to worry about shit like this happening - it's not a perfect world.  Women walking alone at night are putting themselves in a vulnerable position.  So are men who walk alone at night.   Scumbags prey on the vulnerable.  The witch hunt is unbelievable, he isn't blaming the victim whatsoever..   He's an ex cop, he has a family... He shouldn't have said 'invite' but fair dinkum this is a total over reaction to a guy who's heart is in the right place and is offering his thoughts to the media.   Walking alone at night is dangerous.  What he said wasn't directed at the poor girl who was raped.  Yes it happened at 6:15pm or whatever, but the fact is it's dangerous to walk alone at night. It certainly wasn't her fault at all what happened.  
That's so weird! I got side tracks yesterday and heard this song for the first time. And even weirder? First time I saw Dylan, my morning jacket was opening for him
So lets set the scene; you are in a foreign country, possibly only a few speak your native language, you may not be used to female attention or perhaps cant pick up on these signals, then out of nowhere this 7-9 asks you if you live alone, I feel there is only one response to that.  "Are you going to steal my kidneys?"  Still I cant argue with the details of the article, "assume attraction", better to try and fail then regret no trying at all.
Under every comment made in reddit there is the word, "report", which is a hyperlink and will summon a window that will begin the report process. You need look no further then the bottom of every comment.
&gt;&gt;  If someone is wired in such a way that they can only achieve sexual satisfaction by transitioning&gt;This is why it's so controversial.  It disputes that they are wired that way, instead they have developed a fixation/fetish.  Indulging fetishes with reconstructive surgery seems a bit extreme.  I could see the same argument for furries and bronies and that might be science gone too far.It does seem extreme, but if it ends with positive results (higher amount of overall happiness for the patient), it's absolutely valid despite it seeming extreme to outsiders. When furries and bronies undergo rigorous therapy and psych evaluation before doing something permanent, and those who get something done (whatever it would be for them) overwhelmingly report an increased happiness and overall satisfaction with life, I'm fine with them doing what they need to do too. I doubt that will ever be the case, but I'm open to bring proven wrong. 
Ok. Amane's was to much and I couldn't live through another one so easily in such short amount of time. As long as it isn't as intense I should be OK. lol
When you find something to post, and not many people like it... the fake internet points that do absolutely nothingfor me in real life have gotten a grip on me like a vice.
I always assumed that the character of Hannibal didn't come from any actual person, it originated from the basic idea of a psychiatrist being completely insane, it's an oddly pleasing little paradox. And then Harris compounded that by making Hannibal a perfectly cultured gentleman that turns the base act of cannibalism into something elegant.
Perfectly said. Feel the same way all the time, and it makes me super anxious when talking to girls. So much so that i can't even think of what to say at all and just freeze up and become awkward. Gah i hate it
Hey what model Porsche do you have?  It looked like a TipTronic, which tells me &lt; 997.2, but the screen in the middle of the gauges looks more 991ish...
You can't really "play around" Naxxramas cards with only basic and Classic cards because of the indirect power creep. Sorry Fen Creeper, but Sludge Belcher is really just better than you in every way ever. This might sound disappointing, but that's just how card games work. Some cards are better than others, and at a certain point, you need to upgrade.That being said, although playing with limited cards is a disadvantage, by finding ways to play better, you can always improve your chances of winning.
How are you defining 'less logical'? How can you be sure their emotions are not attributable to stress or excitement or something? If you can't be sure of that, how is that observation relevant? I can definitely tell when people close to me are emotional, male or female, but there's pretty much always an external factor. 
It's mainly so that there aren't compatibility issues for MP or COOP play. In Arma 2, they had "lite" versions which were basically just horrible textures, but that made people think their game was shit... So they made the content playable by anyone, with "encouragement" to buy the DLC.I bought the supporter edition from the outset, so I dunno how prevalent the ads are.Honestly, if you get the game on sale, and buy the DLC bundle pack on sale, it's a steal... I'm not going to go into whether X DLC is worth X dollars... but it's a cool, unique, PC focused gaming franchise that I have no problem supporting for the amount of fun I get out of their platforms.
Yes. I think they should shoot rioters. Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'm of the belief that not every human deserves to live. This world would be much better off without people that think it's OK to take from others just because you want it, kill others because you don't like them or because they're different, and destroy because they have nothing and would rather it be gone than work for it. 
Thanks. I have another question. If essentials does not support animated. Gif, why pokemon z/o can use it? . I tried copying animated script of add-on gen6 to above main script But it did not work. How can i use it.  It so hard
Igor loved that dog so much. It's really a tragedy. He posted this on Facebook about 3 hours ago:"I can't believe the amount of people on here giving their sympathies, strangers, friends, close friends, barely friends, you are all my friends now. I just want to thank all of you with all my heart and i know otto thanks you all too. and the random people coming to my house bringing flowers and cookies i am amazed by the compassion you have showed me and my family. i am forever grateful for all you. thank you so much."
They're going a bit overkill on the gold aren't they? I know its the 50th anniversary of the Super Bowl but you don't have to paint everything in the building gold. I also had someone on my Facebook wonder when Hayne would get selected in the draft - I would like to find the rock he's been under. 
Have any of you ever worked with union guys? I spend a lot of time on construction sites in the Boston area, and it seems like Union guys are always covering shit in graffiti, saying things along the line of '***** ******* is the rat! Bitch eat shit'. Seriously though, who/what do these guys think they are?
Most respect: Firefighters. I'll always have respect for what those guys need to deal with.Least respect: People who believe these "warning from a police officer" obvious hoaxes on social media.
Dark magic is overall bad in FE6, your options are super limited and the mages even moreso. Though Apocalypse is pretty nuts.Ray is... not impressive at all, but compared to Sophia he might as well be freaking Pent, and Niime... well I'll get back to you once I've acquired the 3 or so Angelic Robes to make her usable.Anyway Ray is just underwhelming, pretty much any trained mage at this point will dance circles around him and his growth is not enough to catch up IMHO. If I didn't feel compelled to use every legendary weapon, I wouldn't even use dark mages in FE6, too much hassle.Oh well.
*Jason moves to sit beside her, and wraps his arms protectively around her while drawing her close to his chest.* "Tay, help is coming, I promise. Please, just hold out a little longer..." *He doesn't hear Laura over the sound of his own thoughts, and he keeps murmuring comforting words to Tay. A few tears gather at the corner of his eyes before tracing lines downwards, as he can't bear to see her in this much pain.* "Laura, how far away is the closest hospital?" *He takes a quick break from consoling Tay to ask her mother.*
I mean, the initla cost for upgrades at 6* is 3200, if you burn a few upgrade on 5* and get it upt to like 5000, is the cost at 6* going to cost like 15000 or will it reset back to 3200?Thats my question
Twistie is definitely a her." She is famous around here for her cavalier attitude toward the Type II diabetes that has her morbidly obese husband in a scooter. She's an internet warrior.
Sure sure and what about the real reason just to overcharge users on bigger internal storage?EDIT: i see lot of dumb fanboys downvoting who prefer to have no options instead of more options
You don't want this.One tried to get me.   Outside Penn Station when there was going to be a Rangers game happening.  It looked like they were mobilizing for a riot.  And here he comes, with one of those rifles strapped to his back.  Not good first date attire.And he was kind of cute, too, which was a shame.  Just ... way. too. aggressive.Be careful what you ask for.
It would certainly be *possible*.  However, it would be hard to implement because the people that run the app stores aren't necessarily the same people that bill you for data usage.Another issue I see is that what might be a "Premium" app with one carrier might not be with another carrier.  If you switch, the app you paid for and developed a habit of using is suddenly eating your data.Since mobile phone companies already have you over a barrel I don't see why they would suddenly start doing things that only serve to reduce their profit.  There is no incentive for the mobile carriers to go through with a suggestion like this because they don't get any of the money you spent to buy the app.  A parallel to your idea is that my ISP doesn't throttle my bandwidth when playing a particular online game.  Why would my ISP do that, when the subscription fee to the game goes to the people that run the game, not the ISP?  It wouldn't be a sound business decision.
There are abilities that generate guard but there's a crafting material called Fade-Touched Obsidian that, when added to your crafted weapon, will give you (I believe) +3 guard on each hit.
Yea, but in the meantime you have no idea how things will pan out, you just assume life sucks I guess. **EDIT** also, I wish there was a way to worn the greatest generations that their kids would turn out to be selfish shits that end up ruining pretty much everything. 
For a while, if two players approved of wanting to trade skins, they could message a LoL employee (Riot) and commence a swap. Before legacy skins were introduced, accounts with limited edition skins were much more valuable. Now with legacy, not so much.However, this trading was stopped I believe during 2013 Winter.
Yes, but it has an unintended consequence.  It wasn't designed to block transgender people from using facebook without using a dead name (at least I would assume) and it is doing that, so it should be changed to avoid that.
Checking in from Baton Rouge.  It is a breath of fresh air to know there's another M's fan in Louisiana. Usually I'll get confused looks when I tell people my preference in teams, and I'm sure you know the feeling. Enjoy the games this weekend! (I'm going to Houston in June to see the series against the Astros) 
Rule rule fruit. Every rule u make must be followed by the ppl around u distance matters upon strength a virtual board appears that where the rules are projected. Downside every three rules 1 gets broken theres a maximum number of rules per day pending strength) breaking board breaks all rules for the day. Rules can not affect health. Ex good rule. Swords way a ton or no gravity. Zoro cant use onigini Bad rule: raining fire or dease or limb removal (binding limbs is OK)
Still friends with my ex wife. I left her and she paid for the divorce (guilt can be expensive)... We share custody of an awesome long haired daschund.   Most women I've dated since, don't groove on us being friends. 
It's mainly to get him running around the backyard and working on Sit, Down, Leave it, Drop it and Take it. The toy is pretty soft compared to some of the others he gnaws on but I'll keep an eye on his teeth. Thanks for the heads up. 
Likely because the claims made by the founders sound pretty outlandish to anyone with a physics background. Its hard to get funding when no one believes you.
I'm recently just got 50 for all crafts.  I already have all accesories max melded.  I'm aware of the traditional route to Supras.  However, I'd like to know what the "least wastage" route is.  (Not melding unless I have to - for that reason I have avoided melds on my left side AFs)Initially I was thinking of just getting a friend to craft Artisan and max meld it.  People seem to have different thoughts on what the optimal meld on Apron and Off hand is and with the expansion coming, I'm not sure if I should go for crafted Artisan only to replace it after levelling to 60.I was thinking of getting Artisan BSM crafted, using BSM to get to Supra (Is this even possible). Then using BSM to craft CRP tool, and crafting all offhand artisan tools.My questions is - Is turn in Artisan gear + max meld belt and right side + some meld of OH tool + food enough to get Supra/craft 4*?How would I meld that OH?If not. what is the minimal set of crafted/melded Artisan thats worth investing in?
I can't hear even the slightest of differences. :(They're Fractal's GP-14 140mm fans, so they're already really quiet to begin with (I think 1000 rpm max?). Maybe I should try plugging them into my mobo and making sure they're going at top speed to see if the noise is more noticeable?
Heh, none of the art classes I've taken have ever taught me anything useful. Most of what I know is self-taught. You can learn more on your own too! And you're quite welcome! :D
Well are the snacktivists happy? They've successfully silenced a private company from using a popular advertisement. They would rather just get offended and cry like a bunch of children than work to make themselves better. This is a perfect representation of how they got so fat. They would be told they can work towards losing weight but instead of following the warnings of others they complain about them until they give up and go away. 
The pseudo intellectual know it all users. They aren't the majority, but they are the most vocal. Nothing I hate more then sheltered twenty year olds telling me how the world works and explaining foreign policy and economics to us...This is most noticeable I  the defaults. 
&gt; 2) Put in place a time limit of 3 years, after which bans may expire, either automatically or by the introduction of an appeals process that may be requested after the time has expired.Why? If you hacked in a game I don't see why you should be unbanned.
Your statement implies that it'd be between MJ and LeBron for #1 and #2.  Given the career Kareem had, ranking LeBron over him just on titles alone is a huge slight to Kareem
&gt; Terpers are incapable of love in any sense that society understands love.At face value that just cant be true.  With that logic all blacks are criminals, and same with cops.
*He's not mad.* Urrigon realized as he relaxed just a bit while Benjen went on giving him the typical life lessons that he always gave out. The lad nodded as he took in what he was saying, he does try to better himself even when he acts out of line. In a way he did learn far more in Riverrun than he did elsewhere."I understand," he spoke. 
Up until now all ground-outs for Jays hitters and tons of walks for Norris (who escaped bases loaded and 2 RISP the next inning) and now the bats came alive and we got 4!
Loki gets about 2k effective HP with that combo, Ash bladestorm does  2000 base damage + 4900 damage bleed if he attacks you once with bladestorm without strenght mods.   Not only that, if you are the only target, ash can attack you up to 17 times if you don't die before that.    If you don't die before he reaches 17 hits, that is 117300 damage, which is finisher+ bleed, so both ignore armor.    
a) CS has a shitload of cheating going onb) Some CS curricula teach functional prog first, which if done purely functionally has no mutable state i.e. no variablesc) You sometimes get paradigm-shifts in intro prog, i.e. the first two semesters might be an OO language like Java or a hybrid language like Python where the notions of declaring variables are a bit different than something like C. Also the terminologies vary between these languages.I'm not saying it's excusable to be in a third-semester course not knowing how to declare variables, but these are some ways that it can happen.
What? How do you even make it through school without the risk of financial ruin right behind you? If you don't have to worry about 7% interest on repayments, how are you even motivated to work? 
&gt; The question is really what's the feminist argument for the Bechdel Test? Does it really illustrate anything useful about an individual movie or movies in general?It's just a litmus test that highlights cultural inequality against women.All things being equal, it would seem just as likely to have two women discussing something in a film other than a man, as two men in a film discussing something other than a woman.
Some people are intellectually honest but don't realise they're making some mistakes. This person says they were eating thousands of calories but no carbs, and lost weight but clearly it's likely they were eating far less than they believed. 
Social Club name? I added "SmokeVapor"And yes, also I'm not sure which rare cars are storable or not, but there might be a way to bypass the "You cannot store this vehicle."
Your sister hired me to place a remote webcam in your house. She works as a camgirl and had me set up other things, so she traded some nudies in exchange for it. Don't judge.If you check the living room you'll find a webcam plugged in to the printer, and that uses a wireless gateway through the router to enable remote login. Check port 45633.Don't take her chair.
We did Shakespeare all through high school and it was sometimes torture and sometimes fabulous. What really made a difference for me was acting out the scenes. I don't mean reader's theatre with everyone sitting at their desks and (WORST OF ALL) having someone read out the stage directions, but rather allocating parts (for a scene or for the whole play) and acting out what was gong on. We did the Balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet with one person standing on a desk and it was really memorable.
Completely forgot tonight was draft night until I saw a Facebook post about Winston. Currently watching Grey's Anatomy...My girly side beat out my sports side lol. Edit: Grey's on the TV, draft on my iPad! I love technology. 
The dremel gets hot and doesn't have a long life span - just boiled the grease out of the main bearing in mine a couple of weeks ago. Never tried the better ones. Does anyone make one with a variable swing degree setting?
I think what happens with Turtle currently is some people underrated him (remembering him from last season) and TSM fans overrate him (remembering him more from Season 3) when in reality is is sorta in the middle of those two sides. Turtle does what TSM needs him to do. Will he be the first person TSM looks to replace? Probably not because odds are Dyrus will retire (a day that will rival The General's step down in sadness) before TSM replace Turtle. 
No I wasn't sure if they were necessary so I left them out originally. Can't seem to get it to work with or without them though, when I add them I start getting this error:    error: invalid operands of types 'void*' and 'float' to binary 'operator&lt;'
I completely disagree. It is IMMENSELY good to know that i wont move in next door to a fucking rapist or child molester. Having been raped on two separate occassions, i need to know these list for my area to feel safe, and i think it is incredibly justified.
I am rather amused at his poll cherry picking.    A tactic prevalent amongst the denialism crowd.   Then there is the desperate rush to cry fallacy when presented with evidence showing the blogger has lied about his credentials
Hasn't changed.The only answers people ever give to this question are that I'm afraid of the unknown or that eventual meaninglessness doesn't imply total meaninglessness, both of which I view as incorrect.Sorry that I can't help, good luck to you.
Punk/heavy rock is what I'd be going for, I honestly don't know what I'd definitively call it yet (I've only been able to play the songs on bass and imagine the rest in my head so far), but I can definitely say within arms reach of punk.
He also suggested that Walter's clothes should blend with his surroundings, representing a man who has given up and just wants to fade into the background of life.
Agreed. Judging by how long the clock is ticking they're listening to a lot of offers right now. before the pick is in, im gonna say they trade down and pick up either gordon or gurley with their later pick.
Well lollipop on 2014 is a hot mess. The amount of lag induced by the update is staggering. I can't get the ambient light sensor to work properly either. Constant app crashes. This thing really is a mess. 
Why is red to be valued above yellow? Or any color, lack or absence thereof for that matter?The universe is a briefest soap bubble in which all colors and none dance in mesmerizing spirals.
It's easy to say this when you know people are totally going to eat it up and buy them all anyway. Just like they bought the 1350 RP "tests" and look where we are now.
Man this drama sure is heavy, took a lot out of my time. Have fun though with SPQR, Seems like Vallera's newly built areas that are built on predating construction will end up lost, though without Kaiserin's help it would mean Volterra is even less safe then it was.Same with SPQR, their inactivity is going to increase much more after this unless something is worked out in Kaiserin's favor for once.
I believe in equality. Zero shits given regardless of gender because CEO pay is determined differently from other positions. 24 females vs 476 males will very easily create skewed results.
SLEDGING MELBOURNE FOR BEING BAD AT FOOTBALL IS AS EASY AS SLEDGING MITCH CLARK FOR HAVING DEPRESSION.  ITS A CHEAP SHOT, NO ONES PROUD, BUT FUCK, WE'LL DO IT ANYWAY. 
About the time Naxx came out, he got over his dislike of mage.   He didn't play it on the pretense of it being "too easy", because mage does have very powerful cards and also the best hero power in arena.  Up until recently his policy on hunter has been "it's shit because you need the right cards", even well into the release of GvG.  Now he seems to attribute it to hunter being too inconsistent - no matter your draw you can usually rush your opponent down for an easy 7 wins, but getting 12 wins isn't too common for hunter.
I always am! I love pleasing him; I think the only times when I'm home and not willing to have sex are when I'm sick or asleep (and even then, if he wakes me up the right away, I'm down). Thank you for your input! I just didn't know if that was controlling of me to tell him how he should masturbate. 
There is an easier way: www.vacstat.us. You just login, create a list and add people into the list. You should get an E-Mail notification once someone gets banned and you've setted it up.
Neat move on BSG was to kill the throttle, flip 180° in the pitch axis, fire at the enemy inverted in reverse of the momentum vector, another 180 pitch and then throttle up. Would be good choice against an enemy on your 6 o'clock if their acceleration won't close the gap during the duration of the maneuver. Probably good for high speeds since a tight powered turn would result in higher g-forces.
I was gaining respect for this Bucks team... the way they played game 5 was impressive.  Their length, athleticism, hustle and defense were all admirable.  But seeing the way they handle themselves tonight seems really classless.  Maybe they're just young and need to grow up some, but I don't hold much respect anymore.
well he played ta after maxed pcy blades and lost because i was spamming during laning phase while smoking my spam wasnt because of rage it was to make him lose his next game.
Honestly this is what I am most excited about but don't buy boxes for the U.A. Cards they are rares so easy to obtain but you can buy them off amazon when they are released for most likely 50 cents a card I have bought about 12 play sets of each U.A. Card so far lol
I mean, since 2010, if you look at every season combined, the top 5 corsi teams are those winners. Here: https://twitter.com/mirtle/status/592350689562505216
Is anyone having issues applying the coupon? When I load the checkout page, what I think are the coupons show up briefly but disappear when the page fully loads. They disappear before I can read what they say. 
This looks similar to the responses some of the so called politicians(male) and other high profile men gave during all the rape awareness programs in India. Looks like same kind of idiots exist everywhere in the world. 
This is very helpful. I get how broad of a question that was, but I also really don't know anything so I couldn't get very specific. I've been watching tutorials and what not, just haven't seen anything on this yet. Thanks though. 
I am in aww. I had no idea it was that expensive. I got mine for 13 bucks lol, I remember it because of how cheap it was. Sorry about that. I'll look at what I have
Typically the employer will withhold a certain percentage of your pay check depending on how much you make, how many dependents you have, and if you have any relevant tax credits. At the end of the year you'll get a form (W2) that sums your total earnings and total withheld for taxes. Then, you compare that value to how much you should've paid for the year and either pay the difference to the IRS if your employer didn't withhold enough, or get a refund for the difference if your employer withheld too much.Normally you can ask them to change the withholding amount up or down. Just keep in mind that at the end of the year you're responsible for paying the amount required. So if you drop your withholdings down then you'll take home more per paycheck but you'll have to come up with a lump sum to pay the difference by the tax deadline April 15th.10% sounds about right for a part time job and no children or other accrued tax breaks.
The Bucks are playing absolutely horrible. Chicago is hitting shots, but they've had so many open looks right at the rim and late close outs its just coming easy for them. After seeing Chicago this series I really don't think they can match up with us, even without Love.

It's different than X-wing. In X-wing initiative automatically goes to the player with fewer points, doesn't it? In Armada, the player with fewer points gets to choose who has initiative. 
I don't see the relevance, especially for current ownership. The decision to move the Expos to DC made his investment worth billions of dollars less, over a period of time. If you don't think that's a reasonable reason to dislike something... Well, I guess you've the right to your opinion, but I think that's fucking nuts, if I'm being honest (I think I am?). 
I will allow it this one time, since you were very close to the clock (and honestly, my watch has had the time be off by more minutes). In the future though, get the event in at least 15-30 minutes before the deadline.
I enjoy horrible martial arts films like Dragonwolf or Kiltro. I highly recommend watching Dragonwolf with your friends if you enjoy poorly made movies with decent fight scenes
Yeah I'm gonna have to agree with these guys on Bloodborne. It's brought back this feeling of discovery in games where I can't really predict what's coming next. Amazing game!
Long zoom lenses don't make objects 'undulate'. Long zooms compress a scene. So due to the low angle between the ground and the photographer what you are seeing is a compressed version of the undulating runway. Its that simple. The runway does in fact have those rises and falls.To clarify a little bit....A wide angle lens will stretch a scene. If you have a subject in the foreground and some objects off in the distance in the background, it will appear to increase the distance between the subject and the background and make the background look a lot farther away from the subject than it really is.A long zoom lens will compress a scene. So if you have the same exact scene with a subject in the foreground and an object in the background, the zoom brings the object in the background "closer" to the subject and makes it appear to be much closer than it really is.
*American Gods* is awesome. In fact anything by Neil Gaiman is more precious than gold. *Sandman* was the best reading experience I've had in my 20s. And I've read **alot**.
Another one you'll notice a lot is on the ground floor under a set of stairs. There will always be some kind of cane guard, from a metal guard to a short wall or even a planter that prevents someone from accidentally walking under the stairs and smacking their head on the stair stringer.

They mention that the new transmitter uses bluetooth and draws more power thus lowering the lifespan on the G5 transmitter.  They also mention possibly a slightly higher price point.  I'm curios to see how that impacts insurance costs. 
Its anecdotal, but the police unions appear pretty tight with the district and state level judges in Houston. They all seem to rub elbows together at the Petroleum Club.
I'm pretty sure every community has crime.He was using that as an example of what people explode about without actually taking into account the context of the discussion - exactly what you did. You saw "black community crime" and ignored everything else because fuck context, whitey does crime too so anything he just said is racist and his point, whatever it was, is moot!
My S2R 1000 is about to be on its third tank. It's not so bad (yet) that I can't raise or lower the tank anymore, but there are visible ripples in the knee area. Some people swear by coating them, but my second tank is coated and it swelled anyway (pinholes in the coating maybe). Avoid ethanol as much as possible for the best lifespan.Not that it matters, but Acerbis makes those tanks, and the problem wasn't limited to Ducati.
&gt; There are numerous sourcesNot really there is only Tacitus as a source. He is basically the only source we have for anything about Boudica. Archaeologically we only have a few coins with her husbands name on them and evidence that Colchester was burnt to the ground at the time Boudica's rebellion. Also the tribes under her command mainly the Icini, but also the Trinovantes were not a migratory people. They were mostly subsistence farmers who worked the land were they lived. The people she lead were essentially a very large angry mob, not some migratory host. 
I guess :(. I actually have a Baofeng and I'm not licensed (I'm lazy). Though I don't use it either.I get why people take the "who cares" approach. Chances are that you'll be fine using one. But if it were me, I'd like to know this. As I mentioned above, FCC actions against violators is pretty rare, but it does happen (and then you get a nice big fine), but it's one of those things that on the stupid low chance you *do* get caught, it could be live changing (as in, the amount of the fine isn't trivial).

It is a really good photo, I can't tell you what your favorites should be! However, Compositionally it's really quite pleasing of a shot. I would however adjust the lighting. I'm not sure what you used to light, if you had more than one flash tube, but maybe try to get a split lighting effect where the half of the face (lets say his left) is lit nicely while his right side has a touch if fill light so it falls off a bit on the darker side.Perhaps I may be getting picky, but I'm just giving some small critiques to make your awesome photo even a smidgen better!Great job! Awesome end result.

I'm pretty sure he intended "supporters" to mean voters, as in those who voted for the politician, and not donors. A politician should be swayed by the desires of the majority of voters, a judge should not.

Black people like this are their own worst enemies. And like anyone who is their own worst enemy they'll blame whatever is most convenient rather work to improve their situation.
I get what what you're saying, but they haven't really ever been in "contention" before. Do you think this added pressure might force their hand a little?
You will have ups and downs in your performance every so often, i had a huuuuuge down a few weeks ago and i just kept playing and didnt give up, and eventually my down just disappeared again. More general tips for high minerals would be, that you get a macro hatch (you dont necessarily need a queen for that), or try to improve your injects. By the way dont make yourself sooo much of the border the player has. At the start of the season, playing alot was rewarded heavily, so players of your MMR and caliber might just have a diamond border.
You are missing my/the point....the point is he must have used it online otherwise this wouldn't be an issue now would it? Either he left it running and forgot like someone said above or he's lying... You pick! :)
A few years back in Maryland there was a similar situation but the dog owner sued the police and won their claim for $620,000 in damages, including compensation for their emotional distress. This was immediately appealed by various groups but was again upheld in appellate court."The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Cat Fanciers’ Association (CFA), and other industry groups have urged the Maryland Court of Special Appeals to throw out the jury award for emotional distress. These groups make enormous profits off of the emotional bond between humans and animal companions. Yet these same groups hypocritically seek to limit damages solely to an animal’s “economic” or “market” value in the courts."http://aldf.org/blog/barking-up-the-wrong-tree-vet-pet-industry-groups-betray-animals/
BFBFC2 was a wonderful game during its time, but I would say currently BF4 is the best true battlefield game you could play. I love BFH for what it is, and I appreciate it for that, but I don't really see it as a "battlefield type" game. Coming from BFBC2/BF3/BF4, BFH feels like a spin off, or a CQC expansion. I would agree that BF4 would be hard to jump right into if your only BF experience has been hardline, especially since most of the player base is veterans now. If you enjoy CQC and low TTK, constant action combat, I would stick with BFH. If you enjoy vehicle warfare and large maps, tactical warfare, and slower/skill-based TTK, I would give BF4 a go. Personally I think theyre both great games, but they're not as similar as their names suggest.
RDJ's accent is too posh, even for Sherlock Holmes, IMO. It's not natural. But maybe I'm just biased because I hate it when Americans play British people and only ever do the Queen's English or a poor imitation of Cockney.
&gt; A sampling of owners: The Koch brothers hold a half-dozen grazing permits on public land in Montana to go with its 300,000-acre Matador Ranch there. Why are these brothers found at the root of almost every sleazy way to make loads of money?
You get a sunburn because the UV radiation from the sun damaged the DNA of skin cells. These skin cells then commit cellular suicide in a process called apoptosis.Your skin gets red because of inflammation. Blood vessels expand, and the immune system comes in to clean up the dead cells.Sun poisoning happens when more cells die at once than your body can process safely.
Dude, Google hulk mjolnir  and there are dozens of comics with that happening as plot point. It's a running theme.and who's to say hulk not at least a little worthy in some universes.
O look, a smart person with critical thinking skill, downvote this person with a spine immediatly. /sI feel like Reddit is full of moronic nationalist marines and patsys. Your explanation is much more factual then the propaganda spewed around here. Thanks for having a spine!!We can't save the spineless, but we can save ourselves!! Never give up, speak out every chance you can and I will join ya!Fascism is spreading, my fuck it meter is allmost in the danger zone. These corporate asshats need some rope and a tall tree. 
Labels are confusing, and people pervert the meanings to serve their own ends. East Germany or any of the other Soviet bloc countries were socialist, only in the strict economic sense that all assets were owned by the people, the "community". Those countries were in fact totalitarian authoritarian dictatorships, with complete control in the hands of a few. That is exactly what the religious right that essentially controls much of the Republican Party intends for our country. Private property would disappear for most people, they'd become renters. If you don't believe that, just google Altemeyer authoritarians. 
It will never be perfect, and you would be surprised just how often every other candidate has a flaw or two in their package.  You don't have to be perfect to win, you just have to be a little bit better than the other(s).  I've won plenty of awards during periods where I told my supervisor that I didn't think I would be competitive, but it turned out that it was still enough.  Good luck!  
&gt; Denna looked down and took hold of my hand, turning it over. “Your hands&gt; are soft,” she said, then touched my fingertips lightly. “I thought the calluses&gt; would be rough, but they’re not. They’re smooth.”I don't think Denna would say this if her hands were callused. 
Depends on the cooler on your gpu really, a good cooler makes it run cool and quiet not the actual card. It might even be you need to re-apply the thermal paste.My gtx 750 ti was the loudest component because the stock cooler + single fan was shitty, the cooler had no heatpipes and the fan made noise even at 35% speed.I ended up taking out the stock fan+mount and strapping a 120mm fan to the cooler, 10mins work and it provides better cooling + much quieter.

Oh yeah, you're right. Thanks for correcting me!  But my point is still valid, the three snowiest cities in the world are located in Japan.  1. Aomori, Japan - 7.92m (avg yearly snowfall)  2. Sapporo, Japan - 4.85m  3. Toyama, Japan - 3.63m
Yeah that mom was doing the right thing. Not great to teach your kid that she gets what she wants by screaming! Plus if the mom had bought everything the girl wanted she'd be broke!
If you don't build dcap, you're going a build that doesn't have a lot of AP. Mpen "increases" your base damage (by just letting you ignore the defensive stats they built). Some kennens don't go dcap for a few items (something like zhonyas -&gt; guise -&gt; abyssal -&gt; rylais). depends.I don't think you really focus on mpen on kennen anymore than other mages though. If there were any champ that I would say you really focus on mpen for it would be rumble, not kennen.
More than likely, Saban is being too controlling with the brand, stifling the creativity of the studios. In other words, Saban brands doesn't want a true movie adaptation of the series, but rather, an extension of the TV show much like the 1995 movie. There is so much potential for Power Rangers to be more than a campy TV show. Don't get me wrong. I like the camp. But I'd also like to see something new with the concept.

Quote from article: “We also began inventory on all of our frozen food items to make sure. We’re not only going to be incorporating the package date, but also the delivery date on our inventory items to make sure we know exactly when those items came in,” said Starnes.They were not performing inventory.  They cannot possible prove that the meat was frozen for 6 years straight.  Serving it was a health risk.
I hated kids. i thought they were screaming poo factories that looked like winston churchill and wrecked your life. like I keep saying, it's so easy to articulate the bad stuff and so hard to articulate the good. But the good FAR outweighs the bad.Now I'm that guy that'll show you pictures of his kids at the drop of a hat. I have more than most, and some of them are harder work than most (special needs). But they are just so. much. fun.
Well, you could but you'd need "calculus" to make the numbers stick together. Calculus is a sticky colorless substance that holds the numbers in place. It is banned in America.
I definitely have a number of books I've purchased over the past few years (Be Our Guest is one of them). While they are great, they still take a broad outside-looking-in approach to discussing things. While that's not terrible, I wanted more of a candid internal feel between cast members rather than the structured customer-facing side of the conversation.I guess I was looking for something that updated more frequently, like a LinkedIn group or newsletter feed. Something so I could observe the actual culture of the corporation, rather than just the user experience we all recognize and love.
Don't try to change it. Instead hand out info and instructions to men on how to avoid becoming a rapist.*Instructions could include:*1. only have sex if you are videotaping the act and so proving consent2. don't have sex with other students3. don't have sex on campus4. don't have sex with anybody who has drank any alcohol4. prefer abstinence  
20141220 has been PMing me occasionally mentioning the shower thoughts post, yet when I asked Spycrabs to tell me something about me, he didn't know what to say. Even when I brought the post up, he said his top comment was in that post, not mentioning that I made the post.
If you don't get to a post while it is still newish, you might as well not comment because it's probably not going to be seen...  That's also unavoidable.

The picture had a lot of 1/3's though. Since the cast majority of those crimes are associated with poverty (except fraud, IDK what's going on there) and 1/3 of the impoverished population is black, it's reasonably proportional.

&gt; a learned trait that can **just as** easily be unlearnedThe plasticity of the mind goes both ways. Forgive the anecdote but my parents are of the typical southern breed: sexist, racist and homophobic. When I discovered fully what racism entailed, I began to consider my actions in the context of race before I said them, and pretty soon thereafter it wasn't hard. If you know something is racist then it's easy not to do that thing. Inaction requires less effort than action. Knowing something is racist only requires understanding racism, and if you were genuinely "trying" then the definition is easily within reach.
Si esa es la razón de la vaguedad del Consejo Ciudadano de Podemos y su ejecutiva, ¡Estamos perdidos!Es peor que la traición de los socialistas de 1914, que decidió cada uno apoyar a su país y votar a favor de la guerra, en vez de unirse contra la clase imperialista.

I've been following hockey for the majority of my life and can't recall this level of hype surrounding a coach potentially leaving to sign with another team. I've heard everything from Edmonton/St. Louis, to the University of Michigan, to staying where he's at. Had Babcock said or done anything to indicate a desire to leave? Or is it just speculation
I'm in my early forties. I was raised conservative. When I started thinking for myself, I shifted libertarian. When I broadened my world view, I became a Democrat. I voted for Obama both times, but I was never politically active.After living through the emergence Fox News and right wing radio punditry, the conflagration of Christian fundamentalism and evangelicalism, and the rise of the TEA Party, I realize that the country has really begun to split apart.The thing with Bernie Sanders is, his positions are diametrically opposed to all of that, and they all make a hell of a lot of sense.

I think most Americans are acclimated to the constant use of air conditioners. Personally, I'd rather be a bit cold and have to put on another layer of clothing than be hot and sweaty without the option of stripping down to underwear in public. 
mechanicalkeyboards.com has a bunch listed as being available on 5/15, as well.http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/search.php?keyword=pok3rSorry if you already know all this... just giving a heads up.
"If you close your eyes, you will see a pool of lovely, pale colors. If you squeeze them tighter, the pool will take on different shapes, and the colors will become brighter - so bright, that in a moment they'll go on fire. And in that moment, just before they do, you will see Neverland, a magic island on whose shores children are forever at play."This made me think of my favorite passage from *Peter Pan.*
[RealVinceGilligan]: Actually, about an hour ago a weird guy thought his life goal was met when I replied to him in an AMA. That was probably the most funny/weird fan encounter I've ever had.  
Girl in my grade 11 class some years ago said, "how can we go to space if we're inside the planet" she didn't believe us when we told her we live on the outside of the planet. Not inside it. 
&gt; But the thing is, when the host removes all the other cards but the correct one, you know with 100% certainty that one of the two remaining cards is the correct one. The odds of the card you picked at first being correct are 1/52.Because its fixed at 1/52 even when you remove the other cards.But the other card (that you didn't choose and remains) has its odds changed when you remove the other cards.Why fix the odds of the one you choose and change the odds of the card (or set) that you didn't choose due to the same event (removing cards)?  I'm really trying to follow along but I don't see the logic of fixing one card odds and not the other card.
No matter how much overtime I do for free or work hard, no-one is really going to give a shit. There's no reward you worked for as a kid. Kinda sucks. 
My response is if you're a socially inept neckbeard who does poorly with the opposite sex now, chances are you would have been one in whatever era you're romanticizing.
Baby momma 1 is a special kind of trashy... She lost her first child to what looks like FAS and posted pictures of him all over her facebook. The whole thing is kind of heartbreaking, really.
For most characters in PVE I use health/att/acc. Stamina is never an issue that a gracious a-iso or an item can't fix, so that's the stat I care about least.

Nope, no stream this week:  http://www.reddit.com/r/h1z1/comments/34gh1d/view/cquffy1?context=3Just super excited to see what the marketplace is like :)
I remember entering that abandoned school as soon as you get out of the vault. All those bandits, in the dark. I never really healed from that as a kid. 
Probably, but an F18 Hornet has no cargo space. A HMMVW/Hummer H1 has a version with a mounted turret as well as a civilian version with higher cargo space than average.
Krav maga strike. Extend the digits on one hand and keep the other one as a fist. Strike an eye with the extended digits and strike between the jaw and neck of the person. This usualy leads to them being on the ground or incapacitated and in serious pain. DO NOT, use this lightly, it can cause blindness and I don't think you want a law suit. Aside from this hit light deadlifts and bench press, say 200lbs bench and 300lbs deadlift every night for a year. This lets you hit harder and stengthen your core allowing you to take more abuse.
Yeah....beating a team 1 year out of the lottery without their newest draft pick.  A sweep was expected, the Bulls should be embarrassed they didn't get this done in 4 
I figured.  I drive so little that it's not worth it, though.  If I'm spending $50/mo, then even a 50% increase in mileage to 32 mpg would only yield about $17/mo savings.Plus, my real plan is to move to a city where I can ditch the car and bike to most places, sometime this year.
I mean.... he was pretty good in that barrel challenge. In pure balance though, my money would be on Sierra. Let's just hope the balance challenge shows up before his idol expires.
Never heard of such a thing. A couple thoughts: you could just put lime on it, or you could just bury it in compost or dirt. Lime will suppress the smell and it isn't bad for gardens. A couple pounds of lime is stupid cheap. Cut a bag open, spread liberally, most of the smell will be gone within a week. Do you ever see this plot owner there? 
Yes, but they are similar in effect if not function. Both produce very small acceleration that builds up over time. EmDrive produces less thrust currently but runs on electricity as fuel which can be 'refilled' via solar panels or extremely efficient and compact via nuclear reactor. This means it can be run longer (years/decades even) which is pretty cool.
Well other events I've noticed seem to be decided in the week before.Like I've had autosaves where I die like 3 days after. And even after doing my usual savescum thing of End Processing the game and reloading the save, I still died. Same date every time.
I'm not a fan of it.I enjoyed saving up a weeks worth of loot to sell over the course of a few hours once a week. It was fun and relaxing.G.E. stresses me out cause I get very impatient waiting for a system to trade my goods for whatever reason. I tend to always sell for market or just below, and buy for market or just above. When I was selling to actual people, for whatever reason I was more patient and I tended to sell high and buy low.
I've always liked Valve as a company. Even though some of the decisions they make aren't received well and they have shitty support, I feel like for the most part they have their users or creators in mind. 
Yes that is exactly what they are, but the setting is full of obfuscation for safety purposes. The naive belief that they are prophecy stones is useful and helps insulate the nature of the universe from those that interact with them directly.
Since you registered your 1.0 CE your account should already be authorized for PC. To check that it is, log on to the Mog Station, and look at your account status next to the meteor icon.

Are you joking? Visa free travel for Russia? They should be completely banned from entering Europe considering the shit they're pulling in Ukraine. That's not okay.
So they're just rushing through months of time without showing the reactions of the characters to Derek's death? WTF.The only way this shitfest can be redeemed is if Sandra Oh makes an appearance.

So... do they all want her sword, or what?I mean, at a funeral everybody gets a chance to see the body, right? To need armed guards to keep the crowd away seems a little strange. It can't be that poorly organized, like if they were shouting, "You'll all get a chance to see her, back off and wait your turn!" would be weird. So what's going on?
That's what happens every time when black people try to "protest" something. They just set shit on fire. I watch those fires and think "Yea, maybe black lives really are more important."
What are you removing, an inch of barrel? Save the money and time and just leave it. If your little heart won't be content until you have a shorter barrel, cut it down a bit and pin &amp; weld your flash hider. Seriously, I never get the "SBR my bullpup" crowd.To be a little more helpful, if you end up going the SBR route and are worried about constructive possession, then limit yourself to only 1 AUG. If that's all you have, then nobody could construct the argument that you have your SBR AUG to justify buying extra sub-16" QC barrels in order to skirt the law with AUG #2, which is not an SBR. If you're an AUG fanatic, though, and simply must have more than one, see the first paragraph.
&gt; Germany and France were each other's largest trading partner before WWI.Europe before WWI isn't comparable to Japan and China today. They're not going to go to war over some islands.&gt; Maybe they don't want part of their land to become "already part of China, that's the reality of it"Clarify who you mean with "they".
Think about it logically. There are two main ways to physically damage a voice box.Some sort of cutting or slicing of the neck or some form of blunt trauma that would crush it. That's it. There are no other options for physical trauma.
My thoughts:  if that was indeed the case and the idea (as I thought all that was just speculation, and not actually from FROMsoft), it was probably too ambitious, and they had to simplify it quite a bit :/
i definatly agree i had a few go to ships  that i always use mostly small so my big problem was trying to shoehorn in a oxygen tank. but the 3 large ships were a pain even my servers main base was 3 days of messing room by room.
I'm going to look you up in two years and ask you how those invincible sky-high returns are doing for you....  "Don't know what I'm talking about..."    We'll see.    But you are right.  Don't pay someone else to manage your money unless you have a LOT.

A lot of people swear by that watch, I think it's ugly as bloody he'll lol! Than again a lot of people think the Seiko Monster is super ugly, and I'm pulled toward it for that very reason. Is the Amphibia as tough as everyone says it is ?
Maybe it's just me, but if anything, I've learned to respect *greatly* people who are talented in other skills besides the hard sciences and math. I naturally lean towards math and science, so I guess seeing other people excel in it impresses me less; what I find truly impressive is people who excel at writing and other, more creative skills- the concepts of which are completely beyond my understanding.

I'm still learning some things, I'm currently still at school. Working on some projects, trying to build a watch using a premade movement. Working on some articles for wornandwound.com and I have a few customers, currently working on 2 clocks (westminsters). I still work at a convenience store.

Congrats, now start saving for the 281 :)  I would have never thought I would even come close to filling it but I am almost at 400 and I can't really add much more.
Yes, I am aware she was supposedly the first girl that trainer had ever seen lift 8 pounds. But the only thing impressive about that is that a trainer would have never seen a girl pick up something heavier than a textbook.
The goal is to avoid that feeling! There are a lot of avenues to explore in getting this started and it's a labor of love for a handful of people. We're trying to connect the community and capture data to see which direction we should move toward. For now, we want to establish a club so incoming students have a direct source to try to connect in to. You may find friends during orientation, but we want to provide a guaranteed spot for students to join in. The cool thing is those of us involved now are shaping something that will hopefully last in to the future. Would you PM me an e-mail address that I can add to our list of contacts? I'm also trying to gain more interest in a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/816908774999881/) group that will let folks interact. If there's a better social media platform to do that, I would love to know. This subreddit has actually been more successful than anything. 
Eh, I think you could definitely recreate it. The "character" of analog gear is caused by things like dust, mechanical noise, etc, and there are ways to recreate those things digitally. We have the technology. 
Probably a shot in the dark, but have you tried going into Nvidia X Server Settings (nvidida-settings) and setting the resolution in the drop-down menu in X Server Display Configuration? I can't seem to get my system to output at 144 Hz without specifying that in nvidia-settings. I understand this is resolution we're talking about, but hopefully this'll point you in the right direction.Also, this command may be worth a shot.    xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --mode 2560x1080 --rate 60.0The DVI-I-1 bit should be changed depending on what kind of output you're using, whether it be DisplayPort (DP-0), HDMI (HDMI-0), and so forth. Type    xrandr -q for more info that's explicitly relevant to your display that's outputting Ubuntu. After all, it could be "DP-4" for some reason, like it is for my DisplayPort setup.
Giannas tackled Dunleavy while he was shooting a 3. We ended up with the last laugh because Dunleavy made that three and it was a flagrant 2 causing Giannas to get ejected. 
First: when someone posts the exact same theory someone did a day or two ago without looking; seriously, the amount of repetitiveness is ridiculous.Second: "fans" who are disrespectful to Scott - harassing him and insulting him because he isn't doing what they want how fast they want him to, etc. (also includes the recent 87 incident)
As far as I'm concerned, that yeast is magic special secret sauce for a delicious beer. I've only made IPAs with it so far, but they all turn out beautifully -- nice fruity esters that mix with hops but don't get in the way, good attenuation, and a beautifully soft mouthfeel that belies the beer's dryness. I imagine it would be great in just about any American or English style, to be honest.It can get a tiny bit hot/fusel-y if you ramp the temperature up too quickly -- it seems like leaving it no higher than 68°F until it's nearly done fermenting is the right move, followed by bumping it up a few degrees at the end.

Bull. I've been a RACK player for over a decade and my negotiations are still really involved as I have to know that the bottom knows and understands what they are consenting to. RACK isn't an excuse to skip negotiation. To imply differently is irresponsible. DS
I think Cruz is great and we should give him a bigger microphone.  The louder his fans cheer the more repulsed the rest of America will become.  I have some rabid right winger friends but none of them are crazy enough to play the Cruz card.  He is destroying the GOP.
no it is not, btw using a single example to disprove a discussion about the general consensus does no justice to your point.On Average, there is certainly quite a lot less challenger eastcoast players than west coast, this is related to latency issues.
Knew I should have thrown the /s on there.I agree with you 100%, there was a big shitstorm of a thread on here a few days ago where Bomani Jones thought people only made that comparison because of their race.
My mate here in Norway got to play with Ipswich and had a contract signed(this was when Roy Keane was there) and he had to come home because his Mom was missing him and bothering him every day.

What's your provider?I'm in Toronto occasionally, and I pay about $30-40 over the summer for about 180kbps. I'm literally four blocks from the 401 too, it's not like it's in bumfuck nowhere. Fuck Rogers.
But they do have several other things located near the trigger that need to be changed. Safeties, reloading the magazine etc.  When handling a weapon you always keep your finger over the trigger guard, pointing down the barrel basically.  You can do the same with your mouse.What I do in this game is always switch back to my scanner weapon loadout after getting a kill.  That way when I fire group two it's always my KWS until I have all their bounty goodness.
That was the worst I've had it... I did ~2 hours of muay thai, the first hour was in a small 84 degree F room where I probably sweat off a gallon (seriously), then I probably lost almost that much water during the second hour of class in the cooler room... needless to say, I'm not made for the heat!
Yes!! What a fabulous idea, I love it! I totally hear ya about the heels. I have almost 100% flat feet, so heels are my enemy. I'll be wearing them for my 1 hour ceremony and pictures and then slipping on wedges or TOMs!

Let me know how it turns out!Mine needed a week of steep time. I might have been able to give it a hot bath, but I did the initial mix in plastic, and I really don't like the idea of heating plastic. If you're subbing cheesecake graham crust for straight graham crust, maybe bump the vanilla custard up to 2%.
My town was built as what is known as a "bedroom community" which means it was intended as housing for something next to town. In our case, the Army base. There's no town square or plaza, city offices are sort of spread out around town, and most of the shopping runs along two main roads, but none of it is centralized. I actually live on the far eastern edge of town, two miles from any of the shops.

That's as the ball is coming out of his hand though, earlier in his motion you can see that his pinkie is definitely on the ball. It's just a circle change from a guy with big hands.
This tells me 2 things. You have no idea how knights fought, and you weren't aware that Samurai/Kendo were the original inspiration for the Jedi fighting style.
Titans shouldn't take a QB here unless they're 100% convinced they want Mariota. I think Mett is fine until they can find someone they really, really want.I'd honestly trade down if I were them.
This should be the norm with all grad schools, though. If you don't *actively* want to be a lawyer, or doctor, or academic, then you're a step behind. Doing it because you don't know what do after college is a *terrible* idea and that should be apparent.The best argument for not doing law school is the job market. Everything else (it's hard, stressful, etc) kinda comes with the territory: you're spending 3 years of your adult life in school, do you expect to go through the motions like you did in undergrad?

At my high school MTG was not unpopular among the normal kids.  I once went to a kick back, smoked a bit and was ready to chill when I found out all that they were going to do was play MTG.  These guys were normal if not popular people, it was a little surreal
Not likely.  My understanding of crossfitters is that they make it known within 1-2 minutes max.  That said, internet faux-deities may operate on a different plane and reserve disclosing their crossfit status until the afterlife.

Personally I'd recommend using [glass mohr pipettes](https://www.pelletlab.com/files/snXNpg1iEqU8zUJS/daagxiwK8t3kNFzi/image_640/mohr_pipette.jpg), ones that have a lot more measurements. Easy to clean and reuse, not to mention more accurate than those cheap plastic ones.
I dreamed I woke up in a windowless primarily filled with iron,  everything was damp from rain, the walls were high and the sky was grey, I was taking my daughter (I don't have one whilst awake)  to the hospital as she was crippled from some horrible event,  the whole way there people were throwing things down toward me and screaming "she's not worth jt"  then she died and I went into seclusion on a separate Island bordering the sea.  Then it gets fuzzy. Common theme,  first time for this particular story though.
Because WW2 was nessisary to set up Israel. At the start of the nazi take over many jews fled to palestine, who they eventually went to war with over the land.As the nazi regime grew "israel" while still at war with palestine was one of the few places the jews could flee too. This gave them the man power they needed to win the war.The holocaust also allowed for the idea that a jewish state was a nessisity so britan and other countrys approved it and gave them the money they needed to survive.
That's what happened to Chris Farley. Jonah needs to go have a long talk with David Spade about how fucking meaningless it is to make money by throwing away your health.
Event vehicles will be 50b, E5 and 140/62a (can't remember which one). Stats won't be tracked like any of the other special events, and there will be various misisons for crew exp and credits as the actual game will give 0 exp or credits.

Just watched Montage of Heck last night and holy shit that was creepy! And good. I think his suicide made him forever 27 and forever a legend but I don't think that extends as much to their albums.  This was their white album, living or dead.
Absolutely. Look at their rates of DUI and things like arson, and fraud. All crimes aren't committed equally. There's nothing inherently wrong with per capita stats. There's no reason not to use them just because you dont like the results.
It's crazy. I paid $5 for two great games over last year's summer sale. To think that I would post $20 for a Call of Duty title is nuts - let alone $200 for the whole franchise.
Well all of the last litter (like 11 babies) died because they got sick. :cOne of the first litter had seizures, and she eventually died in my hands. The rest all survived. We gave a few to my friends. The rest we just kind of kept in pairs or trios in 5 different cages.
No idea, I can't imagine how they even found an article from two years ago, much less mistook it for a recent one. Terrible reporting. This is the problem with internet media. Accuracy matters far less than clicks. 
Well let's see, the National Socialist German Workers party, they were a good example of socialism. The former Soviet Union, that's another great example of socialism. It didn't work then, it isn't working now.
When your name is on a lease, whether alone or with other people, you are fully responsible for all amounts owed. Always.What you can do is sue the horrible subletters in small slaims court to recoup the costs your landlord charged you for the burnt carpet. But you will still be responsible for the charges to your landlord, whether you are successful in small claims court or not.
Yeah, no kidding. I had no idea it had gotten *this* bad. Do you know a better sub for discussing women's experiences that are more feminist friendly? 
The 1911 is so great because it's a great design.  It's a great design that was intended to shoot .45ACP, but it translates to other calibers as well.I want to pickup a commander length 1911 in the next few months, and I'm seriously considering a 9mm version.  The down side is that you don't get more capacity by coming down in caliber.  But it's still a great shooter.There's something to be said for consolidating calibers as well.You can't go wrong either way.  The 1911 design is great no matter what you're shooting.
Surely there has to be some other possible place to watch. One of these screams African American dbag, the other screams tourist who couldn't be bothered to do research.. 
A piece of string stretched out, (like a clothesline), works too. You just hang your plant/bud by a branch near the bottom. (However, your gadget does look cool). Oh, and nice looking crop, btw!
For Story missions, I don't mind what I use, but I don't use an Exotic Heavy Weapon because reasons. I juggle around most weapons to try and get used to every one of them.Crucible, I LOVE any Exotic Hand Cannon or Plan C. Until I get Truth, that's all I'll be using.Raids, I use Gjallarhorn exclusively for Crota's End. Vault of Glass, I may use Gjallarhorn at Templar, but I like using Bad Juju for Confluxes/Oracles, Ice Breaker, or Plan C. Thunderlord will probably take the VoG Exotic Slot if I get it.
Not to mention they make it seem like they're doing you a favor with the bundle. "Recolors used to be 390 for one, now we're giving you THREE for only 590!!!"Nevermind that most people only want one.
&gt;  It doesn't get you highIt does in fact get you high. If you've been doing IV heroin, it might be a poor excuse for an opioid high, but an opioid naive person will definitely get their nod on if said person would do around 1mg up the nose. I'm from Sweden, and both here and in Finland there are tons of people doing Suboxone with no prior history of opioid use. I have some friends who have become severely addicted to it, and it has ruined their lives in much the same way as if they had been doing some other opioid. It's basically Scandinavia's hillbilly heroin.Unless it's too much of a trigger for you, I highly recommend the documentary Reindeerspotting. It was filmed and produced by a Suboxone addict in northern Finland, following his friends as they go about their lives. Really good, and really dark.
Wait. Doesn't the Nostalgia critic have the anniversary for his site soon? They usually do a huge collaborative video. And Jon was with Doug right? And James is with Doug. And Jon was with James. And Brent is on a 'secret project' and he has been witht hem all recently.
Yes, i would like the piano part only. Thank you so much for offering to do this task. I've tried to transcribe this before with the aid of a music-fluent family member but I can't get it right. 
You have way too much faith in the longevity of reddit.Slashdot used to be the dominant power in posting stories and commenting on them.Reddit's fine, but in a couple of years, we'll all on another site, and there will be like 5 angry people on reddit yelling at each other about how Hillary isn't far enough to the left in an otherwise-silent room.
Like he said, Stephen Hill was a prospect solely for his size and speed. White highpoints and has great hands and speed, the only reason why White is a 'project' is because he isn't a great route runner. 
Shows like that were a dime a dozen and essentially identical to each other. A slightly better show (which is also on netflix) of that genre is Amazing Stories produced by Steven Spielberg. Alfred Hitchcock Presents and The Twilight Zone are, of course, also on netflix.
Yeah, I was specifically referring to B&amp;M headshops because I have been pricing them for about a month while looking for the perfect piece and it went from $50 - $250 range to $175 - $1200 (smallest/simplest to largest). It's unreal.Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check them out. Who the hell cares about a name brand on a bong FFS? I guess I won't be able to physically examine a piece before I buy it any more.
So sad thats the best you can do. Thought you would put up a better fight than that. I guess I cant expect much from a kid who calls himself an androids vagina. Its quite fitting tho. 
It's possible, although I'm not sure that's the problem. If it was you could probably notice his percentage deteriorating over the course of a game and I think it'd be mentioned.   
The only reason France is hard to kill is that it is the only nation that you have to use your head to beat. Most other nations you can just steamroll with minimal thought but France takes effort.I've had to remove Baguette 3 times and I'm on my fourth go round, it's not that difficult.

I don't think anyone disagrees with this but the fact that we can't have a discussion about why Sanders isn't Socialist and what his presidency will/won't achieve is just silly.  
It seems like the commenters here haven't gotten much traction with you as far as changing your view. Can I ask what concerns or doubts you have about this view that led you to post it as a change my view?
It's great that you've set yourself boundaries for safety! I googled it a bit and I found some contradicting information. I would assume that it varies state by state also. If you are committed to a mental institution, you will lose your guns. But if you are just getting some medication / therapy, according to some you should be fine while others say that it's not a clear-cut issue. I would recommend posting to some pro-gun subreddits as they know much more. Try /r/progun for starters.It's also good to remember that hobbies are just hobbies. Your mental health is much more important than any hobby could ever be. Trust me, getting over depression and losing a hobby is much better than keeping your hobby but losing your mental health. Try to get some help, if not from a doctor, at least from an online support group. There are lots of those even here on Reddit and many outside of it. 
I am not sure if anyone has made the connection between the face and the ancient astronaut theory before however - That is why I made this post because I had seen this before too and never thought of the ancient astronaut theory as a source for the image. I was thinking it was just a weird mayan aztec face but then I noticed the little mouthpiece shaped bit which I hadnt noticed before
8.5 sec is an estimate. Its a value greater than 8.2 sec and less than 8.8 sec. I just went with 8.5. During the 3.5 sec, the buff wears off but you can still activate a block and proc her super passive. So activating her super passive requires a block within the 5 sec buff window, or 3.5 s after the buff. Hence 8.5 sec after initial block. 
Haha, put me in my place? People can respond with their insults and defensiveness as much as they want. The fun thing about having conviction is that other people's opinions don't make me insecure in my own.And yes, if you don't like the Godfather, you watched it wrong. :)
I see nothing that would have us go outside and take a walk over green fields.But i figure somewhere along the line we will have figured out how to perpetually recycle things in some sort of habitat being powered by fusion power or something we'll just search for such a planet elsewhere.Or maybe we won't do that and just stay in our spaceships; that would be when scientific progress moved beyond our modern day science fiction.Even the most advanced scifi set in the most advanced age tells us that replicated food somehow doesn't taste very well and that recycled air is somehow stale.Planetary life seems to be quite a bit better. But what if it wasn't?Until the sun starts to go red we'll either go extinct or go visit other stars. And then have Children who travel through the void, who then have Children who do the same and so on.How many generations and how much progress would it take until the humans do no longer feel the need to bother with planets?
I'm not a teacher - my sister was.She was working for a private school and as a maths teacher and got some reportcards sent back to be re-written, one in particular stood out. She was told she could not describe a students results as catastrophic and had to find something nice to say. She asked them "the student got 4% - what can you say nice about that?"
Yeah it's pretty good, if you're allowed to farm it or get people to gank with you so you can afford it. Which hasn't been the case in any of the 5 games I've played since the patch went live.
Quick question, I'm in the navy so I get a lot of firefighting training, and I'm interesting in becoming a firefighter in my spare time, how much training is required to become one? And if it takes a lot, could some be waived because of the training I already have?
Hi,Ok, you've actually given the correct answer; repentance unto salvation. I'll have to go deeper to respond to this now; My next post will address it.
Other economies that get on board the renewables bandwagon will have the huge advantage of free power once the setup costs are paid. Abbott is so focused on disbelieving global warming that he doesn't consider anything else.
You aren't limited by that in anything below college level, and everyone agrees we need to reduce the cost of college. Don't try dragging up a completely different debate.
Im on vyvanse, too. Actually, my month is up next monday, when i have my follow up appointment.I will ask my doctor this because i, too, am concerned about the tolerance factor.
Right, you think if a cop steals something, don't call them on it. Cops should stick together and watch out for one another even if they don't always follow the law.

Because they lived in a time of great spiritual wealth. Many tzadikkim lived during that time, and it says that the Torah is the blueprint of the world. Therefore, if you know Torah the way a tzadik does, you know all the answers to your questions. I would reccomend asking this to a rabbi whose knowledgeable in the Talmud and what not.  
That's what start-ups with little traction and too much money do, they fight dirty.

You make a good point. I agree that the theists claim to a higher than human authority for their morality.  It's terrible what this man and other religious people get up to. But recently in the UK we have seen teachers, doctors, politicians, celebrities caught out in this kind of thing. They have all, presumably, used their own variations of the script. They each abused power. It looks like the inquiry will show abuse all over the place. And I have no reason to believe similar levels of abuse do not occur elsewhere.  I find it unimportant what reasons they use and what morality they claim, it's my morality that's offended.  Maybe I am wrong, I just don't know anymore.
I'm guessing since there's a daily safety speech, he works in construction. So probably. I'm one of the few English-only speakers at my job too. Gotta learn Spanish. 
It's nothing personal, I like the girls, I like the song. It's more of a... feel I guess. My choice doesn't have to make sense but that debut and ITNW are very similar. The song feels similar, the dance to show under their skirts, the whole innocent vibe you get from these young girls making it into the kpop world. Also you quoted me saying they worked hard, [yet your argument is  about them being copies not their work ethic](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/010/692/19789999.jpg)
I had that happen with my at 2035 at max gain. I'm used to using 1 mic with two people so I ended up doing this even after we have 1 mic per person. I lowered the gain and spoke closer to the mic to fix the problem. Might not be your issue but hope it helps.
Out of two boxes, if one is more tightly packed with more material it's going to be the heavier box. Consequently if you can fit a lot of stuff into your freq spectrum without overflowing (peaking) you can have a loud mix.**EDIT:** However, after looking at the Tiesto project file that was posted today there is fuck load of peaking so I have no clue what that's about.
Yet another post about the same issues we all know, check back tomorrow for more!But srsly, the lack of official statements about those issues, and how the support are just copy-pasting answers are really pissing me off.
Baby boomers seem particularly sensitive to short term and selfish thinking though.  It could be the lingering effects of lead poisoning hat were rampant in their formative years.  I think millenials are far more global and empathetic and forward thinking, but like you mention they may change as they age.
The parents of one of my ex's  are from South America.  When he drives up after work and blows his car horn,  she rushes to put his food on the table and opens the front door for him.  When he walks in, she's right there to greet him.I'd love to find one like that.
Your Honor /u/jajolt,I would like to pass a motion to postpone the trial to May 3rd (Sunday). The reason of this is that I will be away from the computer from tomorrow Friday until Saturday night. I'm overwhelmed by schoolwork, exams, and cats running all over the place.
You want to play pure co-op, no Imperial player?  Check the Files section on Board Game Geek - there have been a couple posted.  I'd recommend RedJak's Automated Emperor Variant, but I haven't tried the others.  https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/164153/star-wars-imperial-assault#files
Due to SU's artstyle, ears are often omitted (most notable cases being Onion, who has a really weirdly shaped head in general, and Lars, who has earlobes but no ears)There was a fantheory going around for a while that gems don't have ears at all, but it's seriousness has always been just a little tongue-in-cheek
Look up dodge ram D50's. I think they were the same truck in those years. They weren't that great, but whatever, a cheap truck is a cheap truck. Have a proper inspection done if you don't know what you are doing with cars, it's cheap and can save you a lot of money.
Assuming you're going to Florida?If so Harry Potter World is a must, but you could honestly probably do all of Universal in a day and a half.  There's honestly not too many rides - when I was there last summer I spent most of my time there at HPW.Disney is awesome because it has so many parks in it.  Definitely spend some time exploring Epcot because the international feel of the place is just awesome, but most of the rides are going to be in MGM and Magic Kingdom.I would definitely only do maybe a day and a half at Universal at most.  Disney has much more cool stuff.
&gt; Basically I'm just wondering if the price will go down after today before it goes up again.Only if we knew (and if it were that easy), then anybody could just be able to buy cheaper if they just "knew" if it would go down instead of up.In my opinion, for a November departure, you're still looking quite early. Keep your eye on deals and the price for the next 2-3 months. You'll probably buy some time then.
At least two posts above this one are complete lies, one states it with "should have used a serious tag", and the other is just lying for karma, which is obvious after looking through his post history.

Wallace drops the rock, hefting a pick axe and handing you an ice pick. He also starts tossing some MRE's in his pack, tossing some to you and some to Rakt.Clay pokes his head outside, before immediately reacting with an expression that reads *nope* before shutting the door with a button and applying a sturdy manual lock.Rakt and Wallace both raise an eyebrow and ready defensive stances as Clay backs away from the door. "What'd you see out there?" Wallace asks, hefting his pick agitatedly. Suddenly, you hear a scrabbling pounding at the door. It'll hold, but whatever's out there doesn't sound pleasant.After a few moments, the scrabbling stops. Wallace peers upstairs, muttering with only a mild tone of fear in his voice "On second thought, let's check the rest of this place. Might be more useful stuff.""Agreed." Rakt nods, taking point and heading towards the stairs.
Since you've already posted a megathread for power rankings - and thank you for that - could you combine this with that going forward?We're trying to consolidate power rankings postings going forward. (There'll be a further announcement on this soon.)
I do think you're right. My father and stepmom (who's been in my life for 25 years) were also at the wedding and I also think there's an element of her playing games because I have a decent relationship with my father and stepmother as well.

Why should the US care how the left-right divide compares to the Europe? Europeans don't elect the US government, Americans do. This would only be relevant if we were discussing the election of a world government.
ctrl+v my reply to another comment.I have driven under the influence of marijuana basically every day for the past 8 years.  I have never been in an accident while high, nor have I been pulled over.Both, however, have happened over the same time period while entirely sober.  I rear ended a woman while it was raining, caused no damage, while sober.  Was speeding when I didn't know the speed limit(of 15MPH...) and got snagged by the fuzz, while sober.
I think OP is saying that the homosexuality is an older custom than worshiping christ. This puts homosexuality closer to eating shit and twigs on a timeline, making it more "natural."
if a person consented to taking a low concentration of a date rape drug but instead was given a high dose, does that make it no longer a date rape drug? a lot of people use rohypnol recreationally.

Our chemistry teacher was taking a class on balancing chemical reactions. There is this couple talking, giggling and disturbing the class. Our teacher looks at them and says "You guys have a nice chemistry going. Just don't turn these reactants into products."
And he got his well deserved yellow, so not much to be angry about here. I'd even say it wasted less time than the majority of players rolling around on the ground for well 2 or 3 times as long.
There was. About 6 months after Halo 4's launch, when they started rolling out the "hardcore" playlists, they retired Dominion, for whatever fucking reason
I can see why this might be valuable in PvP, but why would you use this in Survival? Spamclicking kills mobs just as easily, and if you want to use a bow, Power V will kill almost everything in one shot that doesn't have resistance to arrows in some way, shape, or form (i.e. everything except guardians, endermen, and witches to my knowledge) thus removing the need to use Knockback in conjunction with it.
Holy cow that was hard to watch. He cut her so brutally, too. I believe the law is that a doctor can only go against a patient's requests when the patient has been  determined to be mentally unfit to make their own. And *fuck* that mom for not standing up for her daughter. I sincerely hope she wins. 
Well, I know plenty of people that believe living fifty miles from where they work is rational because they have a car and it's cheap. Maybe they haven't even considered the alternatives or are simply afraid of moving. Maybe the poor rationalize their living situation based on proximity to family, or friends, or other things they deem valuable. Maybe some pay more for rent for the same reason. Your rationale, and what perceive to be rational means nothing.  My original point was that the "rational actor" theorem only stands on it's own feet when we consider that the actors will pay for their actions and not get bailed out or subsidized for them. 
&gt; she would have learned a valuable life lessonOr she'd learn to drink through a straw for the rest of her life. Or she'd be killed by the blow. Or she'd be raped later by the teacher because that's invariably where legitimised male-female violence ends up. Additionally everyone in the class watching would learn that it's ok to punch someone in the face if they say something you don't like.There's a REASON it's a no-no to hit kids these days. It's not just liberal political correctness gone mad, it's because instead of students abusing teachers, it was teachers abusing students - and the teachers had more power, hence more damage and developmental problems to the kids than vice versa
Give someone enough diphenhydramine and they will hallucinate. I saw a very severe anticholinergic delirium when I was still in training (tagged along with the toxicologist to a few bedside exams) and the patient was tracking objects we couldn't see and was grabbing at things in midair. This was midafternoon with all the lights on in a noisy ICU.

Part of that problem is how high the ability modifiers go these days. Back in the day when everyone used Method 1, stat mods grew slower and capped out much lower. The modifiers have been inflating ever since they introduced percentile strength in AD&amp;D. Before that, even using 3d6-in-order, most character didn't even *have* any modifiers bigger than +/- 1 (Average high score: 14. Average low score: 7.)Honestly, I think the relative unimportance of your stats is the main thing I miss about the early editions.

I had this problem once or twice before the patch. I think it has to do with having almost enough unreliable gold for the buyback, and having barely any reliable gold, meaning you either need 200 more unreliable gold to afford buyback or you need like 1k(arbitrary number) more reliable gold because of the death cost.
There might be a surprising way it could fail to be forever. If you keep on accelerating it could be that your rate of time dilation increase is more than time ticks forward to stationary observers. That is the all of stationary time coordinate eternity could correspond to only a finite time interval to you. That is there is a clock tick on your clock that the outside universe can never observe. Do know that by spesifying that it uses no fuel you are breaking conservation of energy as you are effectively spelling up free kinetic energy from nothing.

Basically there's one guy she loves and knows she could marry him and settle down and have kids. Then there's another guy she loves that provides a dangerous thrill, but isn't the settling down type. So she can't decide what she wants out of life and she bounces back and forth from living with guy A, to then she's "oh hold" with him and sleeping with guy B, to single and getting flirty with someone else, etc. But the two guys know each other and each are (humorously) jealous of the other, etc. For 22 books.
Either way, repeatedly getting bills voted down is a very easy way to earn yourself an explicit MONC.

After seeing /r/circlejerk milk the FUCK out of these phrases and make fun of them, I cannot take these phrases seriously AT ALL anymore. Of course, even before I saw the satires and parodies, I thought people who said shit like that were crazy, but now, as soon as I hear something like any of your phrases, I can't stop laughing.
I bought the Keysmart and immediately returned it. It's a great idea in concept, but it just didn't work how I liked it to, and a few other things kept me away. A simple key ring is the best way, IMO. Have keys you don't use a lot? Put 'em on a separate ring and throw in your car somewhere. I always have all my stuff in the same pocket, no matter what. Phone in front right, knife clipped on front right, keys and pencil (student) in front left, and wallet in back right. I can tell just by feel what I do and don't have in my pockets.
Alright guys, book of the week. It's probably **Resident Alien** for me... or **Pisces**... fuck. Either of those would probably be fine... but I'm going to go with... **JUSTICE LEAGUE #40**! That's right! Just when you think I can't do anymore DC event bullshit! (Is Darkseid War an event?)*I want a war with Darkseid. Darkseid's death is the key to it all. You will bear witness, Metron. The age of the New Gods is about to end. And the age of the Anti-God will begin.*
Well that's an easy winnable lawsuit. In fact this guy should not settle out of court. They will settle for less than what court costs, so don't accept anything less than what you are owed. 
Do you have a static or dynamic IP? Often with dynamic IPs you'll see apparently-junk data/connection attempts that were meant for the "last guy" who was using your IP... In particular, P2P file-sharing software does this a lot--many (hundreds+) of connections to different hosts from different versions of different and sometimes totally craptastic softwares, all of which need to 'figure out' that your IP no longer leads to Joe Pirate's plunderboxen.
The shame is, on its own, I really like the new Eldar codex. Some of the rules are silly and even overpowered but the rules and formations are fluffier than ever before. More units are viable than ever before. More interesting combinations exist than ever before. I don't see the new Eldar codex as broken I see it as what the other codexes should be. 
This is very detailed, thank you. I will definitely look up that video. We don't have very large yards where I live, and truth be told, it's very 'do it yourself and pray to God'. It doesn't work for some people to be frank. I will definitely follow this!
They don't have terrible matchups generally, but swordies struggle vs dedede and dk, and  marth specifically (not sure about the rest) has trouble vs yoshi. In melee jiggs also beats marth so he probably loses that here too
I'll take your doubled non answer as a sign that he is free to go about /r/conservative converting more users into white supremacists if he remembers to visit. 
Ha. They would, but they closed down a few weeks ago.Maybe I'll check out the place on ESPN radio that calls itself the only sports bar in the tri-cities.
It's no big deal and you don't have to be sorry, but I just don't see how you could possibly miss what position he's being played at if you've followed football even loosely for the past 2 years
I feel ya. I used to have a really severe speech impediment but 7 years of speech therapy fixed it. Mostly. Every so often, I stumble over words and 99% of the time, it's something I notice that no one else does.Except for this one mother fucking teacher I had in high school. It was pre-calc and the teacher was a general asshole anyway. But one time I was asking a question and I stumbled quite a bit. Instead of waiting a second for me to continue and fix the words I stumbled over, the teacher proceeded to fucking imitate me while laughing.I stopped talking in that class for the rest of the year.
&gt; Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.Basically sums up why introverts are usually thought to be "smart". Stupid introverts aren't so loud/social and that makes it much less obvious that they're stupid than the stereotypical frat bro or whatever other "stupid extrovert" stereotype you want to think of.
Why isn't the CF shading to right?   If they're so sure he's hitting that way they are oddly still exposed to a double between the right and center fielders.

You are 100% correct. Although in my personal experience, Osho's concepts tend to be very simple and poetic. They may not be the best but they can help any beginner get closer to the doors of zen.

Reserving a campsite at Big Sur is a notoriously challenging undertaking. Some make you reserve a full year in advance, some the month of. It depends on the state park and who runs the campsites, but it's best to do your research. I've heard many people try to log in and reserve at the specified time, only to see the reservations have already been sold out -- you have to be quick! When we drove down Highway 1 last Christmas (easily the most beautiful drive I've ever driven) we ended up booking an Airbnb rental in Carmel, CA and exploring Point Lobos for a weekend. I highly recommend it! [THIS](https://instagram.com/p/xIitWaEQ5f/) is one of my favorite photos from that weekend -- every curve looks like this for miles and miles. Unbelievable. If you ever need recommendations, I'm happy to help! I live in the Bay Area, so we frequent Highway 1 quite a bit. Thanks again for your help!
Yea, I really love it. Your patio is so cuted I've considered moving out of a city for the first time in 10 yrs... just because your patio is so cute and now, I want to be able to make a cute patio in my yard someday!
The day it was final, I walked out of the courthouse euphoric. I  miss the kids, although we have 50/50.  I don't miss him or the relationship at all. I'm about to finish the very last part, buying my own home. It will be a place that I can make my home. No compromises. No control issues. I'll do whatever I want. It is awesome. So, yes, I am happier now. 
Sure. I mean, there are definitely a whole host of things that could have happened, and it's impossible to know in this case. [All I know is that several studies have found a higher incidence in ACL injuries on turf.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25164575)
No classes on Thursdays is the nicest thing in the world! I slept in until noon today and then was actually productive (did some laundry, organized/put away shoes, cleaned my room a bit, got some homework done, did dishes, and paid rent) so I'm feeling like it was an all together amazing day! I haven't felt stressed or anxious at all today (for the first time in months), so I am really, really happy right now! :) 
That's really inconvenient, but it doesn't really change my response. If you don't want to keep paying out the nose just go to the pharmacy once to request an extra bottle, and then just refill it with the mail order prescriptions as need be. When the prescription on the bottle reaches it use before date, go back to the pharmacy for the prescription and request a new bottle. That's almost definitely no more legal than simply keeping the drugs in a different unmarked container, but in a practical way nobody would ever know. That's assuming that you get the same brand from your insurance as you would the pharmacy. Otherwise you could probably just find a way to request your mail order pharmacy send you an extra bottle. That's probably better. 
We want sheerif suriname! sherif suriname gib many banana, cocoa and sugar! Is wonderland! We can export that shit to Germany! +10% chance of Anschluss!
Best wishes for you and your future. Life can be very challenging, throw you lemons, but what's important to remember, is how you got to where you are today. I have a feeling you will be awesome on Grad Day. I'm sitting here waiting for my flight home. 
not sure if bug or not, but for one of my friends i'm unable to see how long they've been in game for. they are the only one that i've been unable to see too.
No, I speak as though this poster and the prospective they offer is not entirely aware of the situation at hand. I tried to be as narrow and clear as possible in addressing this. 
Tony gave them something to fight for. Better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. This is a dichotomy seen with Tony and Reed. Tony presumed that they would ultimately fail, but continued to fight anyway. Reed hoped they would succeed, and thus continued to fight for this small sliver of hope. But unlike Reed, Cap's hope blinds him to everything else going.As it is, they all fought for their lives. They stood against the might of the various galactic empires and the all-powerful Beyonders. Had Tony never pushed them to try, they'd simply have waited for an end they didn't even know was coming, just like the heroes of Earth 1610.Steve would have looked for an out. Some all-saving option that just wasn't possible. Steve wanted to save everything. But Tony and the others (including Valeria and Doom) were well aware that death was inevitable. They fought for the hope of survival.Valeria was right. It wasn't about winning. It was about trying not to lose.
I don't think there is a shred of evidence that something called BROGA is taking off nationally.  It's another entrepreneur trying to create another niche -- ganja yoga, hip hop yoga, circus yoga, naked yoga....etc.  Yoga is filled with wacky hucksters of every shade and hue
/u/JohnnynapalmSC  My friends and I had an epic time watching the MotoGP race at Laguna Seca a few years ago, and are planning to go the IOM race soon, hopefully by 2017.  Any tips or pointers you could recommend to us? 
So recently I've been coming to the view that we've had our prejudices all backwards.It's easy to see these conservative, insular immigrant communities and believes that the radicalization happens there. But I am now basically of the view that the recruitment method of ISIS in the West is more akin to attracting lone wolves - internet radicalization, they turn you against the community and family, teach you to hide your motives etc.Because you know what is a trademark of conservative insular communities? They are *very* risk averse. They want to see their sons and daughters lead safe, boring, happy and prosperous lives. Yeah they might have some antagonistic ideas about the West and some shady views on gender roles, but they are certainly risk-averse. It's a completely different and even counter-vailing force that is convincing these young men and women to go on such a dangerous journey.
&gt; I hope they take a few ideas from Peaky Blinders. Why? Because the times they are set in are 30-40 years apart with a world war separating either time period?.... oh, and not to mention one is set in Birmingham and the other is in London?  Other than organised crime they really have fuck'all to do with each other.
Racism. Not racist humor, but just overt racism. I was specific last time this topic came up, but that got me banned, which made me thing the mods were fucking retards. 
I don't know what to say. The only good social media is the kind where NO ONE CAN TELL someone else is doing it for them. I can't even fathom that you're *in social media* as a job and yet you inexplicably think *using social media to promote your own stuff* is WRONG. Dude. Not a single one of this band's fans wants some stranger to be running the social media. They want it to be the BAND. So I hope you at least *pretend* it's actually them posting, because there is *nothing in all of social media more out of touch than posting in the third person.*I'm sorry if I'm being harsh, but with 10 years of experience in marketing, the last 5 being solely social media, I *promise* you your opinion on social media is literally detrimental to any of the clients you might have. 
I saw your comment, and I was like "ooooh", but then I rewatched the video, and does the other team not have only 8 for some reason?EDIT: Nvm, I see that bastard.
It's all about choosing the wave you want to work with (Square, Triangle etc) and then tweaking the envelope to get the type of sound. Other plugins like effects can go a long way too. And bit distortion is a must.

BlueAnt is right the timelines have been merging this is because if you believe it or not.  A lot has been happening in the background that what the corrupt few individuals that wanted this shit to go down has been stopped, by good people from the Universe.

I've ordered from this vendor and talked with him on the phone he's a good guy best place to get kanger products from. glad to see he's making headway with eleaf
Once I got a disc stuck in a tree like that so I threw my water bottle at it.  It got stuck.  Then I tried to throw my extendable pole.  It got stuck.  I found a piece of tree branch, and hit the disc with that and it fell out, but I couldn't get the pole or bottle.  So, I went home, and got a much longer pole and rescued my original pole, but my water bottle was gone.  The bottle was on the lost and found pile at a tournament at that course the next day.  Now I carry a baseball.  
Hey, don't know if you still care, but here's a great example of the sort of shit that I was referring to: http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-30/images-of-men-released-after-teen-raped-at-knifepoint-in-albury/6434346&gt;"I always have encouraged women not to walk alone, to have someone with them at all times, because that in itself is an invitation for someone to take advantage of you," Or, in drunk driving terms:&gt;"I have always encouraged people not to drive small cars, and always have a passenger to help them look out for other cars, because being out on the road is an invitation for a drunk driver to hit you."  
Oh god I hate when they have strategically placed dirt smudges and *perfectly fluffy hair after not showering for a month*.I'm looking at you Kate from Lost.
Why does everyone keep forgetting how Hai destroyed Bjergsen in Spring playoffs solokilling him and not dying once in the series. That was Hai in his prime and unfortunately his lung collapsed soon after. Hai didn't just perform against "bad" NA mids.
Sounds fun! We don't have school for 4 days for now! It's 3 AM right now and I'm currently watching Watamote (watched 4 episodes in a row right now - I like it!).Planning to watch any anime in particular?
Yes! Not finished with gen 5 yet but I should be able to finish that one soon. Just tell me when you're free and we can start trading the couple hundred I have ready for you! 
Sounds to me like he was feeling genuine guilt about lying. Maybe he didn't realize the relationship was going to get serious or maybe he got flustered and told a little white lie and is now seriously regretting it. Either way, the fact that he decided to tell you is a good sign. I'd let him know that while you forgive him that lying is unacceptable in the relationship. Be clear that you value honesty. He sounds like a good guy that got caught up in what he probably felt was a harmless exaggeration. 
That's nothing compared to my hs bio teacher. She was hilarious if you're not easily offended, but a lot of people are. She would throw tennis balls at you across the room if you got especially annoying, and at one point screamed "SHUT THE FUCK UP EVERYONE". We spent most of that class watching Marvel movies and listening to her stories. 
Severity classes may help distinguish the crimes, too. I admit that I feel we defined all the crimes so far and severity classes of crimes is getting into some subjective parts of the law that I'm not too familiar with. In my experience, criminals have been held until either the vault owner accepted the plea for release, or when the subreddit got pissed off enough.Heck, with Libertas around, it's possible we would not be allowed to hold criminals if they pay reparations. Thus that cuts down how much punishment we could give.
More often than not, the ROI is better when you're trading provens for prospects (and that sort of goes both ways). The team getting the MLB ready player is likely in the playoff hunt, so they're willing to give up more of their better prospects to do so. Both teams "win" in a way, because the team giving up the prospects is in a better position to win it all, and the team getting the prospects is in a better position to win in coming years.
You definitely did. I'll be out as often as I can, maybe I'll catch something worth posting about! I've got a lot to learn about fishing in high pressure waters, and how to fish for a whole batch of different fish, but I've got nothing better to do on my days off!I encourage you to drop some of that native knowledge on me! I've literally never caught a trout or walleye. I'm so out of my element I don't even know what questions I should be bombarding you with right now. haha
This a very strong argument as to why 2-89 shouldn't be passed. Genetic modification is a versatile tool that can be applied in many ways. A blanket ban is extremely detrimental to progress.
At the point where you realized the other veteran wasn't smart enough to realize you couldn't be one, you should have revealed that he must be lying because there can only be one veteran. Then obviously the other guy will know you're lying and will lead a charge against you thinking that you're serial killer or mafia. Obviously he's not smart enough to figure out you were lying so I wouldn't expect him to think you are Jester.
Having trouble finding concrete information however:&gt;The legislation would let cities with populations over 35,000 residents create one entertainment district, or outdoor refreshment area, where people could legally walk outside with open containers of alcohol. Cities with more than 50,000 residents could create two areas. A Senate amendment also would permit cities with populations of 35,000 or less to create one district if certain conditions are met.&gt;In larger cities, the districts could not be larger than half a square mile.Source: http://www.wcpo.com/news/political/ohio-state-government-news/ohio-legislature-passes-bill-allowing-cities-to-establish-open-container-entertainment-districts

I was wondering why he would charge all of this to his business account until the mention at the end that his WIFE had FROZEN all of his personal accounts for the duration of their divorce proceedings. Now it makes sense though I have no idea if the guys claims that the company was out to get him because he reported a financial misdeed is true.Anyways just another reason to not get married or at least have accounts that can't be touched during a divorce. Divorces can take over a year to be finalized, freezing all of your money is no joke. The amounts seem large to us but I imagine a CTO probably makes enough that it's not so completely outrageous. 
If she's simply burned out about the fact that she never ever gets a night off ever, one thing you might try is having sister#1 take two kids, brother#1 take two kids, and you take three kids for a night.  You won't be taking all 7 kids and she finally finally gets to have a date.But still, she's out of line and unappreciative.  After you've talked to her and expressed everything, this is a backup favor you might consider.
0-o...Someone got a response that doesn't redirect them to email Nintendo of Canada (which humoursly leads you back to Nintendo of America which supposedly should include Canada)?Well now we just wait till the 29th and see if Jigglypuff will be seen in store.
I don't really agree with that, it's a little harsh I Think...However, the post made me think about something - I've read about a man who was claiming to be an alien and went to court over something (I think discrimination issues?) and the court rejected him because aliens have no right to sue on earth. Would that happen to otherkin too, if they claimed being discriminated? 
I don't care about tipping either as i come from a country where we only tip if service is very good. That doesn't mean that i don't tip 20% when going to the US as i know that's how things work over there. It's just common sense to read up on your destination before you go.
The difference between a 1st in the 25-30 range and Dylan Strome at #5 is enormous.I'm a bit confused reading this forum because on the one hand I had heard for so long how Strome will for sure be that big number one center every team needs, who we can build the franchise around for the next 15 years.  You'd think a 28 year old one-dimensional winger who's got maybe half as many years left would be a fair price to pay.If we want a player like a Strome, or a Provorov, it's going to cost us.  A lot.
The super easy way of getting to the mun without maneuver nodes is orbit, point and shoot once it appears above the horizon until your apoapsis is just past the mun's orbit.

Libertarian ... with some exceptions perhaps? But then again, it's hard to find anyone that agrees with every plank of a party's platform. It's all about choosing what you value most and what you can put up with (hey, not unlike a marriage).
actually in his last streams hiko has said that he would consider C9 again if he got to take out a few unfair things from the player agreement and the team listened to the changes he wanted to make. he was impressed with how n0thing and shroud are doing lately.

I see the misconceptions. I really hate click bait sites the do controversial articles on certain topics or groups of people to start a conversation, or argument. Basically just trying to get more views/ratings/comments/etc. Whatever makes more money. It shines a shitty light on actually introverted people thatDon't judge a people by an article, judge a people by the people they are, everyone is different. As an introvert I could care fucking less about being proud of being an introvert. I don't see it as a strength or weakness, It's just who I am and vise versa. 
Got out early, smart defense, Bucks inability to convert on anything. Plus, Bucks started getting dirty; Giannis tossed for clear tackle on Dunleavy way after a foul from beyond the arc-and 1. 
As a Korean-American who has heard this sentiment expressed before by black people during the L.A. riots, let me tell you this: When they say that Asians just "take, take, take," I believe they are referring to the idea that Asians open up businesses in black neighborhoods and only hire their own family members rather than hiring people of the community. Therefore, we are taking black money without giving anything back (i.e. jobs).I have to say that I do understand their point of view when it comes to this. After the L.A. riots, a lot of Korean business owners actually realized this and started making changes. They started hiring more people of the community they were opening up shop in.I just wanted to mention this because there seems to be a lot of hate and casual racism in this thread. I do think black people have a reason to be mad when it comes to this.

http://m.mixedmartialarts.com/mma-news/440343/Ronda-Rousey-debuts-on-UFC-top-10-P4P-list/&gt; The inclusion of a woman on the list would seem to indicate that a further qualification has been added - if the fighters were the same sex, who would would win?&gt; If sex is taken out of the picture, Rousey is arguably the best fighter in the world, as no one has so dominated the competition. Countering that, some would say that the talent pool Rousey faces is not as deep as say the men's light heavyweight division.It seems that the title of the ranking should now be P4P/GenderFactored, where when comparing women to men, you apply some subjective ".90" factor on strength when comparing women to men.If this is the case, Roundy def deserves to be there. Or, even if you take Rousy's delta from the average woman, it is FAR great than the delta between TJ and the average man. She is the most dominant person within their gender, hands down.
They cut the trailers better than they cut the movie.  Ultron could have been a lot creepier. I didn't get the sense he was creepy at all in the movie.
I hope it gets improved. Combat is fun in FFXIV, so I'd like to knock some heads in. Especially dueling; it wouldn't be balanced, of course (it isn't in *any* MMO), but it's fun and a good way to waste time.
Yeah that's what I've heard but I am a little concerned about drilling a hole in the roof haha. I know it probably wouldn't be a big deal but it just seems wrong for some reason.
If your friends don't end up throwing you one, would you consider throwing one for yourself ? Just a suggestion because that's what I did :). It was so much fun planning my own baby shower, and gave me a chance to invite who I wanted. It also kinda served as a goodbye party because I'm planning on moving to a different city once my little one arrives (my fiancée is currently working on the other side of the country)Otherwise I'd try what the others mentioned, maybe bring up that you're planning on going on a big baby shopping spree and maybe they'll tell you if they've actually organised anything. It could just be a big surprise :)
I seem to remember pro-Ron Paul posts used to get removed fairly frequently when his challenge for the Republican nomination started making making headway in 2011/12. Any candidate who challenges the duopoly must not be allowed to gain traction.
At my base (US military) a woman left her dog in her car all day while she worked in the summer. It died. She was booked (non-judicial punishment) and in addition to her punishment, was not allowed to own an animal for ten years.Aaaaaaand she works at PetCo as a groomer during her off-duty time.Edit: I should note here, Uniform Code of Military Justice does not offer protection from Double Jeopardy (in the sense that since it is a separate system, you can be charged by the state as well). If the district attorney wanted to file charges, they could.
Did you try Alpha Sapphire already? I liked XY, but ORAS is the first Pokemon game I just completely dropped after awhile, even as a longtime Pokemon game player. I don't think we can tell whether you will like XY or not.What else are you interested in? Combat? Strategy? Puzzles? Lighthearted relaxing games? There's a lot of great titles out in the recent year. Try playing few demos of popular games out, such as Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, Bravely Default, Phoenix Wright Dual Destinies (though I would recommend the Trilogy first if you end up wanting DD). Those are only a few, but search/look around the threads and you'll see other great games mentioned that might have demos.

I don't think she should expect you to go down on her because she does to you, but she's communicated with you about how she likes it and wants you to and you haven't done anything about it. You're saying maybe one day you'll come around to it but I think you should actually do that instead of putting it off. I know some won't agree but I feel like if you really care about someone, you'll do things even if it doesn't do anything for you. 
I agree with this. I am so tired of attrition. Hardpoint is way more fun and provides a nice attacker vs defender game. Although to be MVP you gotta attack

Well, a common sub is to wear a lightweight coat like a Harrington jacket to work; it saves you from having a blazer to wear all day while you're fiddling with cables and whatnot. I'd recommend a tie bar as well. 
I gave my girlfriend a big jar filled with 365 little notes of little messages/songs/memories for her to be able to open every day. You could start compiling your list now and then make it next February 
Si he escuchado del CFA pero no sabía que se aplicaba también en México. ¿Cuáles son los requerimientos para tomar el CFA?

The two judges in the scandal will be released at ages 85 and 74.  They'll have plenty of remaining years if they watch their health.  The guy who owned the detention facility in question spent 18 months in a minimum security facility.These guys played with the lives of teenagers for a payday and they may live long enough to see freedom.  Disgusting.
Well, pretty much everything done artistically then was some kind of "revolt" against soviet regime. Except for the artists who went with the socrealism. It was very much "you are either with us, or with them".
Yeah, that was stupid, dirty, and unnecessary. Not a good way to go out. I only hope that he learns from this and it doesn't become a problem in the future.

For a very limited time you *may* be able to prepurchase Project Cars for US$37.49 (this is the price I paid but it can vary).In my region the Playstation Store version of Project Cars is priced over US$90. Steam store version is priced over US$65.I feel very fortunate to be able to experience the game at release. I was going to wait for a 50% discount on one of the platforms. Thanks Green Man Gaming!Note: Green Man Gaming is 100% legit and in this case provides a Steam key for Project Cars. Prices will jump at any time when a publisher remembers to equalise their price with a regionally inflated Steam store price.
Maybe I'm the only one that likes to play a straight ass and give them the license and registration routine, and let them sweat it out for a few while I listen to Katy Perry and pretend to write them a ticket. And I come back with a polite warning and an explanation why I stopped them. It builds good will, and I seem to get a more genuine response/apology. Win-win.
I was just curious if that was actually true or you were just bullshitting to be ironic or something? Given this response I assume it's true. That's interesting. Ya learn somethin new everyday. 
i would be testing out armor/evasion as these to have changed, i will try to make melee chars to tests both, and in a combo to see how it have changed. i always want to play melee and lkately i have been pushed away from it on live servers, but if i got the chance, thats what i whould do.i also want to try out a build with high life/regen/fast leech rate and more, to see if i can make Blood magic keystone more viable in the beta :) i am also an Game Designer/programmer by profession, so this will learn me more, and i can understand the game out of a design perspective

*With a medium-sized bundle of posters under her arm, Momoko saunters down the sidewalk. The posters she'd been posting advertise for an event at the Okina gym.

I found out about those fairly early in my collecting frenzy, but I didn't get one until a few days ago. My hope is that one day I'll have a good, stable job and we'll get an intern, and then that intern can use that keyboard.It's in the very distant future, if it happens at all, but it's what I want to do.
That happens, sure. But by "get sick," I mean in the digestive tract. From eating things that have sat outside safe temperatures for too long. That happens almost everywhere, more often than you want to think.Source: Worked in various restaurants for about a decade.
You've basically proven my point. 20 years ago you could get a decent entry level job without a degree. but NOW you can't. There's a 40% unemployment rate for people between the ages of 18-25. Many many more are unemployed? Times have changed. The economy is a very different place than it was when you were starting out, the 90s tech boom was in full upswing, and there weren't enough CS grads in the world to fill all the positions that being opened. Now 1 in 4 people coming out of college have a CS degree. Transpose your 19 year old self to today's modern economy? Do you actually think you could hack it? That's a serious question too. Please, take a moment to actually think about what I'm getting at here. I know it's an easy defense mechanism to say "I earned everything I have!" Because you have earned everything you have, but things aren't the same as when you were young. Things have changed. The world is a very different place now. 
Shonda is literally skipping the grief process isn't she? Why did we just jump ahead? Also, don't fuss if I'm missing something since I did miss the first few minutes. I'm genuinely shocked if I'm right though, wow.
I constantly have dreams about huge, impossibly curved rivers that end in massive waterfalls. Think waterslides on a bigger scale. Either I'm jumping in them or I fall in them, but it always ends with me going off the waterfall into a massive amount of water at least a hundred feet below. Edit:I also very frequently have dreams where it's closing in on finals week and I realize there's a class I've been scheduled for all semester but I forgot about it. Sometimes it's college, other time it's high school. The most recent one I remember was I was sent BACK to middle school for a class that I missed years ago. Horrible feelings man. 
This, got mine done a month and a half ago. The clinic I had it done at requires someone to pick you up, and recommends no driving for at least 24 hours.
It looks more like the HP section more than anything. I thought about printing or writing a character sheet with most of the stuff that stays the same until you level. Then laminating the whole sheet, while perhaps leaving blank spaces here and there. Practical? Not really. That's why I am curious as to what they are using. 
Only got to play a few hours before work. I love the new spitfire and hurricane fm's. Would very much love to use this generous gift for a prem or some talismans :D.
It would be cool if there were alerts that could pop up in the simulator to tell you if things going on the PU nearby needed your urgent attention. Like if the SimPod had an emergency immediate kill switch and your pilot could make a sprint for his nearest ship to get out into the fray to support some org-mates who had hailed because they were getting fleeced by pirates.
There's actually lots of teachers like that. When I was having a really hard time (I was around 15, maybe 16 at that time), teacher told me I'd never do anything with my life anyways, because I didn't like his class. First person I went to see when I got my diploma tho. 
I think something like wows lfg tool would work. But you'd have to put in a ranking system. That way people that afk or leave could get ranked lower and less would pick them up.Not that I really have much of an issue with the current lfg crap floating around. It's just something that should be in-game.All the arguments against it are that random teams are going to be bad. I haven't had a regular raid group since a month before the dark below and I've only been doing it with randoms. So....my guess is this argument is flawed.
I had this same thought when they announced this feature for Win10 several weeks ago.Given how delicate it is to get true VR right for games, I think I'm going to get a ton of use of using VR HMDs as virtual theaters with massive and/or curved screens playing Xbox and steam games.The customizable Virtual Desktop environments is just icing on the cake.
Fortuna is one of the least useful gold ancients, but a 1.9x gold increase when maxed on average is nothing to scoff at. Fortuna'd chests particularly are a gamechanger with both maxed Dora and Fortuna.
Now **THIS** is a horrible LPT.  I just misspelled two words while typing this,   THIS - I put an extra S, so I took ti off.  Sme with typing just (I typed k after the j and I just removed the k, why would I remove the j as well?
Okay, let me just copy/paste this.&gt;Yes, paying money to buy gold or something like that is pay to win. That said, you can get things that you could pay for without paying for them, this is not paying to win.&gt;You can pay to get ~~97 herblore~~ shark outfit, you can buy TH keys like crazy to get ~~EXP lamps~~ shark outfit and get it wholly from just playing TH.&gt;That said, you can also not pay to win and achieve the same ends, you can ~~achieve 97 herblore~~ obtain the shark outfit without paying Jagex any money. In the event that you do pay them money for an advantage, say by ~~getting a ton of XP lamps from TH or buying bonds to have the money to train herblore~~ buying a bunch of TH keys from Jagex, you've paid to win.Simple. Shit. Holy fuck.97 herblore is obtainable via pay to win means. This does not inherently make 97 herblore pay to win, so why are you arguing that shark outfit is inherently pay to win?
It's going to be banned. http://www.empr.com/14-warning-letters-issued-over-dmba-presence-in-supplements/article/411858/2/Powder City got a letter from the FDA to remove the ingredient.
It's not clear! My favorite argument that there's nothing wrong or sinful about being trans is [this one](https://catholictrans.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/what-does-the-catholic-church-actually-say-about-transgenderism/) from Anna Magdalena at The Catholic Transgender (read the rest of the blog), and my favorite argument that it's not comes from [Catholic philosopher Alex Pruss](http://alexanderpruss.blogspot.com/search/label/transgender) (check the rest of his stuff out too).
I mixed up some 5.5 pH water to soak my rockwool cubes and then a few days later **stupidly** thought, "Oh, I can use this already lowered pH water to fill my mister and save myself two minutes!!"   I did add a little super thrive as well.  Do you think that is what caused the leaf curl and yellowish color?
I used to work with a friend of the owners daughter (Yeah, que up Lone Star and Dark Helmet here). She had us go there once, and it was pretty good. My personal preference is Nicki's West. But I love it for the good food and that delightful "We ain't changed shit since 1967", feel it has. Since I usually just pass through Birmingham, it is real easy to get to off the interstate.

Hey, sort-of related question, is there any way to make gimp not look like it is from windows xp? Like make it look more like "Krita" as a person commented further down the thread. I should probably google it but I already typed this comment...
Yeah I'm never going to buy these, and I currently have more than 2k RP. It's not worth it. I have spend hundreds and hundreds, pushing a thousand dollars on my account in the last 4 years, never will I ever buy Chromas. They should unlocked other ways, through champion mastery, or with IP. Perhaps remove the bundles entirely, and sell them at like, 40 RP a piece. Then I would buy a few.
I know it's human to think of "using" your RNG, but that's just not the case. Your chances to drop something in standard aren't lower by having dropped a shavs in the beta. Yes, it still sucks to have something valuable wiped, but it probably helps you sleep at night to know you aren't technically losing any more than the time spent playing the beta.
Though that does raise the question of how they do it to those who arrive by shuttle.  Maybe the germs are scared off by the sheer power of Riker's beard.

The only examples that I can think of are in Serbia and in Occupied Belgium and France.In Serbia, bands of civilians and soldiers, called 'komitadjis', fought against the failed Austro-Hungarian invasion in 1914, and against the Central Powers occupation from Sept. 1915 onwards. Fighting bands like these had already formed in previous years, during the Balkan Wars, and some even earlier in the Bosnia Crisis.In Belgium and Occupied France, there were underground resistance groups that spied on the Germans and passed information to the British and French. They also helped to get Allied POWs back to friendly territory, either across the lines or via neutral Netherlands. 
Odd pharmaceutical companies would send her samples then, since she isn't writing scrips for their products? Why would the reps send her all of this stuff if she is working in the lab? (Curious, my mom has a similar position)
maybe post what you have here on your Facebook?  I only suggest this as my parents have their neighbours on FB so sometimes things happening in the neighbourhood pop up online before the media catches wind.  Maybe have some sort of block or street party &amp; "get to know the neighbours" and have a raffle or donation jar or bake sale or something?  Just to let her know that her neighbours care and want to help her?   Grocery gift cards, fuel cards for her car.  Get the local insurance company to comp her policies for the year.  See if the bank can help with her mortgage/home payments (if applicable)    I can't really think of anything besides rally-ing the locals with their pitchforks so to speak ;-)  Good Luck, you sound like a good soul 
That's the important thing - I think for a lot of Americans imitating British accents, the first step to getting it right is realising there ARE actually different accents within the UK. Kind of like British people imitating Americans stepping away from fake Texan accents.
Yeah, I'm sure if science found out how to prevent or cause Gender Idenitity Disorder in babies, some fucker would go around injecting women with the right mix with the intent to bring about more transgender people so they would gain greater acceptance. (Which would make people think that person was insane and probably have the opposite effect.)
knowing how to leave means you have the means (hopefully the fuel) to return.   it also means you know where home is.   so you aim at the trajectory that would take you back to our solar system and accelerate
Flashed Chroma ROM a couple days ago for the same reason. I was running completely stock and unrooted before. But the LED and franco.Kernel are super nice. Otherwise, my phone is basically stock since I don't use any other Chrome features.
I think it was a classic case of people not checking the source. The title said that Cooper referred to us as cheaters, and in usual reddit fashion people posted without making sure that really happened. A similar thing happened today with Babcock's comments following the loss. Go check it out on the front page of r/hockey, there's tons of comments based on the title alone and a bunch of people pointing out that he actually worded himself differently.
The question is if any of them can come close to being at D and Z's level. Larkin and Mantha have a shot to be, but that's far from certain.  Another thing that irks me is we're seeing Val and Hudler have great success elsewhere. These were two players I thought we'd regret letting go, even at their asking prices.
Well I did recall that I was powerlevelling back then.  I distinctly recall felling a dragon in like 3 turns.I'll give it a chance at a friend's house.  He's even more of a BG geek than I and he tells me that his only gripe is that the game is short.  He's at level 10 and the game just ends.  No doubt this'll be supplemented with DLCs and episodes.
Plus, with btc, war would be the decision of business interests, not of the people.and you just see shark tank to see if they're not going fap happy every time an ''iraqi veteran'' comes in asking for their money...
On the Mac, the maximize button used to just make the window big enough to show what was in the window. I actually preferred that, and always thought that Windows wasted space by filling the areas around the edges of the window with white instead of just letting you see the windows behind the front one.With Yosemite(10.10), however, they changed the behavior, so now the maximize button does make the window go full-screen, as most Windows users would prefer, and the old behavior is available if you hold the option key while clicking the maximize button.
I would just prefer to buy a separate card.  It could bring a ton of new costumers who want truly unlimited data but don't want to be tied down by a contract.Edit: Small error

I had both professors, and they're both great. I'd pick White for 367 since it's her area of expertise. 367 covers a lot of material so be prepared for that. Good luck
This looks alright. In case you aren't aware of this, with 234GRC, you're staking with a capital of *less than 20 cents*. The frustration exhibited above would be incurred in *any* PoS system - you're not standing much chance to stake with such amounts and are making life unnecessarily painful for yourself. Back in the good old GPU mining days, starting from scratch, you'd be spending at least $500 to give BTC/LTC/GRC a try.I just synced up with the network and staked my first block 30 seconds later, the second following nine minutes later. Skip one coffee before work for the sake of an "investment", and you've already reduced your frustration by a factor of at least 20. If you don't like it, you can always sell your coins again.
Thanks!  It's a little surreal. The first one I opened had 4 silvers in it.  They just keep coming after that.  I thought they were done at the 9th roll until the really dirty mercury came out. Never actually have seen one of those in circulation. 
Yeah true forgot it slopes negative as you approach no load speed. So all the torque is available at a standstill and would still be quite substantial at sub highway speeds. 
I think it's a total myth. I've known women that only wanted something casual and guys that only want sex when it's serious. It takes all kinds. I don't have the numbers to back this opinion up but based on personal experience I'd say it's a myth. 
I took this years ago and I was pretty much central, up where the SDLP and Plaid Cymru are on the general election dots. 5 years later apparently I've become more libertarian apparently. I don't agree. 
I work from home, so I do it all the time. I'm going on a business trip for work in two weeks and we are all staying in a house together (very weird IMO), and I'm sharing a bathroom with two of my coworkers (both who are ladies as well, and are actually friends of mine outside of work). I'm glad I'm done ovulating by then because I'd be taking my OPKs with me otherwise. 
I see both of your sides. After all, the reasons why it's okay with you to masturbate are the reasons why he wouldn't want to ask you for sex, so why not let him use his aid?But I don't really see your view as contradictory or anything. I get it.You can ask him to stop, but I'd ask you to consider if this really is a line you want to draw.
Oh that is good. Being alone in a different country can be intimidating. When traveling always over estimate how much money you think you will need. It has saved my behind on a few occasions. If you have any questions about anything at all until you leave feel free to PM me. Best of luck to you! :) 
The newsletter that came out today featured a video on general how to play stuff.  I went through the creator's history and found the below vid on the frigate.  Good stuff.https://youtu.be/I56YkyNwSkE
Looks like the bird is intentionally fucking with the cat. Going for the eye peck, then pulling back. He/she must pull this crap all the time, because the cat is just straight up not impressed. "Oh, he's doing this again. Great."
Wow that's a crazy exaggeration. Keep being mad about getting embarrassed this game. Dunleavy got his hand up by Giannis throat and he flopped away looking for a foul and didn't get it. Then ran the length of the floor and shoulder checked dunleavy. That's a child making a child's play. 
&gt; He told me outright that he doesn't trust other men to not make a move on a woman, even if he's married, and called me a liar when I told him I'd never even considered cheating on him because "Everyone thinks about it."He's not ready to be in a committed partnership.  I'm sure he has a lot of wonderful qualities, and I'm certainly not saying it's permanent, but **right now** he is not emotionally healthy enough for this.&gt;I think about leaving, but that means rebuilding my life, and losing a lot of money for my parents-they bought me my wedding dress.It's a hell of a lot cheaper and easier to lose out on some deposits and find another mate when you're 23 than it is to extricate yourself from a miserable marriage. &gt;Part of me is still convinced that I need to cut ties with my master teacher, or wait for my practicum to end, and he will be back to normal.**You** are not in the right place emotionally, and probably maturity-wise, to make this make this commitment.  
&gt; I think you mean Mental Break, not Magic Break.Omgggg, translation mistakes everywhereeee! Thanks for telling! Changed.I totally get your point but, as I said:&gt; All of them are pretty good characters, but everyone is meant to be used in a determined situationAnd about:&gt; Also, how potent is Garnet's all-Attack buff?I think it is 20 or 25%, if I do not recall wrong.
You can but then you only have 35% cdr delays cdr to later stages of the game, even further delays power spike which is something midreal usually can't afford and most of the time isn't really needed since you already have god-tier self peel if you go full 40% cdr. I could potentially see it in high AP burst/cc teams but only in incredibly specific situations. Mid lane ezreal doesn't have problems late game generally with survivability etc... the whole weakness is especially in this tank meta takes a LONG time to scale up and just generally can't deal with tanks very well (as a result is the lowest win rate mid laner atm at ~42%).
Ctrl+V Submit I should do that one day anyway, maybe tomorrow I don't have to work,  I write some obnoxiously long thing to try and post early on :)
The best answer I can give you is that you feel less pressured to do well. I was stuck in gold 3 last season and got a smurf to 30. I just filled and won 68% of my games until I hit gold 2 above my main which I found was out however when I played on the smurf I felt calm is every match I played 
The fact is, that doesn't hold much weight around here. You could have 50 lawyers look at the case, say something isn't right, and it wouldn't phase some people. 
The thing is girls can be hypercritical about things where guys just won't notice.  I don't know if this is nature or nurture but girls critique other girls a lot more than guys, guys just won't even notice.   I can be watching a movie with my girlfriend and she will ask if I think a guy is attractive, or a girl.  For the girl generally I will say yeah or no because I pay attention.  For the guy I will be like "I don't know", not because I'm afraid of her thinking I'm gay, but because I really don't know.  We also don't go around critiquing other dudes unless they really stand out for some reason.  Otherwise we probably wouldn't even notice other than "there's another dude".  
And it's not fair to assume all men are sexual deviants by kicking them out of women-only train cabs.  Japan usually defers to collectivist solutions though, opting to put the anxieties of commuting women over a few mildly inconvenienced men.
As a student, I heard a coach say someone was as smart as a bucket of cum. Actually a good coach and fairly good teacher. Dude just wasn't that smart. 
somebody once ordered all of my inventory (150+ units) and was issued a refund for all of them about 2 weeks later and returned them all and it cost me a ton of money in fees.. it was obviously a competitor i messaged amazon about it but nothing was ever done.. i suspect the same thing has happen to you 
I simply request that someone does this. I cannot afford to do so.Imagine Mailbag, Mike pulls out this beast while exclaiming a "What in the fuck is this?"A letter sits atop the package.

Printed onto each ingot is the word: Ingot.He then proceeds to STRAP the overalls onto him and fits the Cast Iron horse Cock onto himself.The tip of the Cock should have a small caulking gun fitted inside for baseboard sealing action!Please, send them this.Lol.
Still, y'all can downvote all you want but everyone knows that 125 is as light as combat sports should ever go. &amp; they're having trouble selling that. They should only make a 115 lb division if they love losing money. 
Don't know enough about this company to comment on the grandfather issue, but it reminds me of the stories about the "12-year old who launched a company that's making $5m in its first year". And then you find out there's an experienced businessman parent pulling the strings and using the kid for publicity. 
Such different bikes.Are you travelling on freeways much or just riding in the city?For city riding stuff the 390 has power to spare.Have you considered other motards?
The first thing I'd do is get an alignment and have the ride height checked honestly. Really I wouldn't go any further than this...I'd imagine they'd goodwill the labor and warranty the part, so when that is happening ask them to measure the ride height and check the alignment specifically, or ask if they have a master tech that can look at it which is code for "don't let the youngin's touch it".
Zidane suffers from the fact that he was not "flashy" he was an incredibly smart player with incredible talent, but not flashy. His talent was less tangible I guess. 
I still think a bit of common sense should've prevailed here. Unless the kid has some mental issues of some kind, I don't get what could deny the child the concert other than misbehaving.
Okay, these cops were way too trigger happy. I mean it's hard to know exactly who is telling the truth, but if he had the gun by his side, he obviously wasn't attempting to kill the officers. If, however, he had the gun pointed at the officer(s), then the cop probably thought he was going to get shot. But still, you are always supposed to identify yourself when you're law enforcement, so that is pretty stupid on their account.
If you are a good lissandra player riven is kinda useless against her the first 15-20 minutes. Liss Q hurts and slows her so she is too slow to get in aa range and if she dashes just W and she is rooted in place. If she ults you do as well and E away or fight back depending on your damage on her.To turn it into a victory your teamfights are most important an you have to make sure she doesnt get fed from your teammates ;)
Oooook.  When the title said "performance artist" I was thinking of the usual yuppy type performance art... very conceptual and usually very cringeworthy and annoying (imo... though there are good ones out there, but for the most part...).  This is a circus performer, not a performance artist.  Much better.  Haha!
The people who think human connections somehow matter more than animal connections can't be reasoned with. They are narrow minded, and I feel sorry for them. Their brains must be small. 
We shipped 16 goals in 3 games against Villa, Palace and Southampton. First team to get beat at home by QPR, only scored 26 goals and have a very, very real chance of going down. I can remember the 15 and 19 point seasons and this is much worse than those
Jedi appear on the boards once they become visible. It's still an early stage system, so it's restricted to taking on/off robes/sabers a bunch of times or using obvious force powers from the power tree around non-creatures. This will be expanded later, no doubt. The penalty for jedi death is 400k XP, which is considerable for jedi that don't yet have reasonable progress into the lightsaber tree, since getting started is hellish. They're an advanced class and not easy to play.250k reward, although slaying your own jedi will be detected and cost you more than you made once it gets flagged up. I've personally tracked and attacked Toxic's jedi for testing (vidyas: http://03c167c.netsolhost.com/smf1/index.php/topic,195.0.html ) and even found a few ways to reasonably defeat them on my BH, though of course we're all minimally taped at this stage - servers been up around a month so even the most dedicated are lucky to have a stash of more than a couple &gt;10 tapes.
OK you have to explain more about the controls your talking about, because I don't know what you mean by how Swtor controls feel different then wow.I came from Swtor and at first wow felt really bad and janky to me. But after like a day, and some new keybinds (default mmo keybinds are all bad) it was exactly the same. It sounds like you didn't turn camera rotation or cursor speed up or something.

The Soviet Union was more a totalitarian dictatorship than a socialist republic.  The closest examples of true socialism are the contemporary Scandinavian nations.  Socialism is populist and non-authoritarian by nature.  The quasi-socialism of Lenin and Mao was doomed to fail from the beginning because rather than arising naturally out of a post-industrial, post scarcity economies, it was being imposed on impoverished feudal economies.

I get that a lot of people use reddit on their phone but do you **always** browse on mobile? That would really suck to be honest. Whenever I'm away from home and browsing reddit it's better than nothing to do but if I have to do anything more complex than flicking pictures to the left I get annoyed and wish I was on a computer.
Yeah I'm never going to buy these, and I currently have more than 2k RP. It's not worth it. I have spend hundreds and hundreds, pushing a thousand dollars on my account in the last 4 years, never will I ever buy Chromas. They should unlocked other ways, through champion mastery, or with IP. Perhaps remove the bundles entirely, and sell them at like, 40 RP a piece. Then I would buy a few.
There's entire business lines that are just rife with fraud.Car service centers and telecom especially. Sure AT&amp;T, I'm sure there's a reason I never get the same bill amount on a contract. Yeah Verizon, it's totally believable the wiring that was supporting 10/3 DSL for a year is now only capable of 3/1. 
&gt; They should assume they are being recorded at all times. I certainly wouldn't risk my job, yet alone, criminal charges laid against me for something I have no control over in this day and age.They don't care anymore.  They fucking shoot people in the back for christ's sake. 
Oh, I figured there was some sort of ~~monkey~~ memory leak going on. Every time I was on there, I'd have constant rubber-banding, and the server reset every ten minutes or so to make sure the memory leak wouldn't get out of hand.So, in short, **HOORAY, I CAN FINALLY ACTUALLY DO THINGS ON THE GRUMPSERVER**
Yeah, he could have just magically died on his own. Happens all the time. I don't see why people are so easily convinced that the people who put their lives on the line to protect and serve would just kill someone in cold blood. That's just insanity.

Hm, there was another post [yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/34c0et/whos_that_little_guy_3_sr_terrain/) about some previously unmentioned additions to Summoner's Rift, and I've heard somebody tell me that they've been hearing strange noises in one of their games while wandering around near Baron. Ultimately, who the hell knows. There will probably be a new champion within the next two cycles either way.
Because right now is a ripe time to do such things. And before you ask "why", yet again, note that I'm not interested in explaining every facet of my point. You can figure it out.
Right?? That's exactly how I feel. It's getting close though so at least we find out soon. Do you think we definitely pick at 12 and 19 if we don't trade up here?
Thanks for answering. I don't seem to be getting anywhere. I don't see why the turns ratio is relevant as that can only be used in an ideal transformer, so the only equation I have left is the  power efficiency formula and I can't solve for 2 variables in one equation.
But but but all they had to do was port the established console multiplayer framework to PC. *Surely* that can be done by just a handful of skillful, experienced, competent online programmers?
I like this because this to me is what van living is about, utilizing your environment that can get lost when we live in a house. It also helped to me to really think about what I am aiming for by choosing to live in my van instead of renting an apartment. I like the creativity that comes with making this work and watching the process. 
Typically when I see something confusing.. I'm more likely to google it, than just flat out downvote it. If I'm ignorant to something, I either don't vote at all.. or I go learn about it. A downvote isnt to note your confusion.. its to disagree. 
Is this tied into the Queen Bee somehow? The singing was eerily similar and they kissed a bird. Bird and the bees... I dunno... Still waiting for them to reveal what that vision Finn had with PB and the sword was all about.
Well, you hit the damn nail on the head, let me tell you. I had flashbacks and everything.If you'd put Mrs. Jacobs instead of Mr. Johnson, I probably would've eaten the keyboard in a white-hot fury.
The CoD games never have good sales. I've been waiting for years, and have never seen them do a half decent sale. Skyrim was just 7.50, but Modern Warfare I never goes under $10.
Ma'am, I'm just going to be forward with you. You're a lovely woman. Very attractive. But it's not you- it's me. I'm a solitary man, there are no flocks of Domingos soaring around, partially because we're an endangered species and partially because we've got a sort of Highlander situation going on. But that's besides the point. How can I carve my way through hordes of enemies with someone trailing behind me? Can I really trust you to ride my wake skillfully enough not to fall off your board and drown? This boat doesn't turn back for those who fall, honey, there's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do to turn me around.
So buy AMD? Why is it bad for a company to strive to develop their own technology? I'll admit I'm not familiar with this topic, but wouldn't Nvidia have a lot less (financial, technical, and market-wise) freedom if they were to use another company's technology? I don't understand all the hate Nvidia is getting in this thread, but I don't follow either manufacturer closely.
That's the point. I used a random rant complaint generator, you complained about spam so I gave you spam.Lowest common denominator twitch chat style. I think responding to spam comments is also spam though, I mean how is any of this related to League of Legends?

Aww, thank you (⑉  ॢ• •  ॢ⑉)❤︎You're right on that, I also feel the same way; I much prefer talking to people who have experienced/are currently experiencing what I'm going through. For your smoothies, you can something like peanut butter, nut/seed butters, and unrefined virgin coconut oil. They'll add much needed calories and good taste! I think it's better if you added more fat than protein, because protein has a higher thermic effect and it's also more satiating (good for losing weight, not so good for gaining it).And, if you ever find yourself in need of someone to talk to, my inbox is *always* open.

Agreed. It's not gonna look good if the governing body now takes their firearms away. Obviously that shows they shouldn't have had them in the first place. So for that reason, I don't think think they will   take them away. 
Another thought occurred to me. If I went and bought the 970 Instead of the 980 I could add in a SSD at the same time. Or shortly there after. Which would give two benefits over one.
I agree with him that it's too much content to watch though. I don't know if I'm getting distracted by trig this quarter or what, but I watch two, maybe three lets plays a week now. It's too difficult to keep up
I will admit I don't personally agree with homosexuality, but I never discriminate a homosexual if I ever see one they have all the same rights as us straight people, and I know exactly how it feels to be hated for being born into a certain minority, I therefore never extend that hatred into anyone else.
Off the bat I would suggest poppin' the gearbox and resealing it. May give a boost to fps, and thus range. Other than that, a bucking like the G&amp;G greens and Prommy Purples are amazing.
It actually does more damage with Lexida - because Metal Mimic only attacks with normal attacks, and Lexida doubles their hit count and therefore damage ouput. It's even multiplicative with DEF buffs, unlike Lafdranya.Plus, you even get regen that maxes out his HP every turn.
Ahhhhhhh, that sounds more like it haha. Still, having two in a 24-hour period may not be bad idea if it's popular - lets those folks on the wrong side of the planet have a good time, too. 
Careful.  Read the reviews, apparently the packaging is misleading.  I think people's experience with the actual product is pretty positive though - I haven't had the chance to pick any up before a trip as of yet.

IIRC, he was in Europe at the time, and it was a case of forgetting which side of the road he was supposed to be on. Rather than drifting into the wrong lane. *[Confirmed, was in Northern Ireland at the time.](http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20096955,00.html) He was also apparently lost, and stuck in a storm. Not that I'm excusing his punishment, but, it really DOES sound like a freak accident. 
You can be conservative and still hold nuanced opinions.  I think I've been pretty clear as to why removing net neutrality benefits only a FEW companies while COSTING the vast majority of others with shallower pockets.I think a free and open Internet is in the best interests of innovation and growth, period.  How do we ensure the Internet stays free and open?  By making sure a couple of massive ISPs don't decide what content you can consume and what you'll have to pony up for. I almost feel like some people don't even look at what the regulation is. They just see the word "regulation" and immediately demonize it, not understanding the intent or simply choosing to ignore it. 
It's a solid start. It's not the most original start (see Owari no Seraph's beginning) but it provides a base for the story. I think a bit more emphasis on either exploring this Arcindia world or exploring the nature of the main character at the start will help form a strong backbone for your story. Also as I mentioned above, the premise is pretty generic so you could either change the setting to something more original or make the characters have something that makes them differentiate from other generic shounen characters.I hope this helps.

In addition to the already mentioned ladder glitch you also get decreased jump, roll distance and the game is less forgiving about whether or not you 'landed' a jump. There is also some rare bug that can happen if you sit down at a bonfire and you need to save quit out to leave the bonfire (not a big problem).You can toggle between 30 and 60fps using the backspace key so turn it off before any big jumps.

I've never really had an 'unbalanced' deck as such, but I can definitely say that after running with a deck of four PP SV cards and a PP L Diva card for a long while in exhibition, swapping in a recently-acquired PP SV Fusion card has resulted in me losing more games than I thought I would be winning.
I think hes just trying to avoid alarming citizens. There are terrorists everywhere, maybe Vern where you live. Theyre not all killers, i think many are recruiters. Obviously theyre being hunted and dealt with accordingly, government just doesnt want us to "worry" about it 
I'm lucky to get 10fps, I'll be playing fine then it's like it freezes on one frame for what feels like forever, then chugs forward a few more, eventually it clears up sort of.It's really odd, I can only assume there's a huge memory leak or something in the game.
The whole "but besides all that, he's great!" cliche. Right now I'd hesitate to call him a great guy, but he treated me well enough to make me want to marry him after I first put my foot down about the trust issues years ago, I thought we were over that problem.

These games save configuration files to your computer (or console) anyways. They should make it so that if the config file exists, you have already gone through the screen- so it should be skippable then.
Maybe so, but when you use animar they drop down to like 2 mana. And then with a temur ascendancy they become 2 mana cantrips. That are also dragons with haste. And then you cast dragonstorm and get Atarka, and swing with 15 5/5 haste doublestriking dragons.
Xbox appeals to white suburban people [Ahem, like me], The PS4 is for the hipster-elite and the asians. That's the difference.How do I know this? Cause I took a goddamn social Survey in my university for the game club. It was apparent where everyone's affiliation was. 
The argument would be "It's meaningless if they don't win in the playoffs" and then even if they won the first two games in the first round (like he did) likely people would then complain "These games are closer than they should be" or "How are they winning with these garbage plays?"
I'm with you on that one. I like the album format, and I still prefer tuning out by putting on a whole album to listen to by my favourite band. I often even like the stuff everyone thinks are "fillers". I don't go for the hits as much as the whole experience of what a particular band or artist envisioned.
But that just makes my point: they don't try to be creative anymore because, as you said, a large portion of the customers actually like these games and ask for them. If there's no financial incentive, you let your imagination flow, but when money come in the equation, first thought will be: "What sells?".
I've been running through all of them. I'm 8 months pregnant now &amp; running a 1/2 marathon on Saturday. My pace per mile is slower but other than that I feel great. I teach classes 5 days a week and run (or spin) 7 days a week (yes, you can workout with children in the home!!!!). If you take good care of yourself now, and it sounds like you do, you won't give into that very common pregnancy mentality of "eating for 2" or "exercise is too dangerous". Your Dr. will lead you down the right path for you. And, by the way, it's very important that I still feel sexy and attractive for my husband. I have certain expectations of him physically too. There's nothing better than knowing after 20 years of marriage my husband still has a raging hard on for me. 
You will.  It is a guided tour and the guides know exactly how to get you from one end to the other.Seriously don't worry about it.  Go have fun.  They keep you in shallow water 90% of the time.  You can stand up in most of it.  Even fat asses like me can do it!
I wanted to fit all the expansions into the one box, with premium sleeved cards, as well as be able to fit painted ships and speed up setup.Here is my solution: https://imgur.com/UBcOxLr&gt;Down the left is all the cards with dividers for the different types. At the top is the race specific tokens.  At the top right is the Alien Powers, in coloured tuckboxes to match the colour of the alien.  The Planets and Space Stations are in the next foamcore section (which can be lifted out).  Then the Space Ships and the Cosmic Tokens are in their own baggies in the section at the bottom right.

Oh, c'mon. Dunleavy got him in the face but nothing compares to what Giannis did. Sprinting towards him over 20 feet and lowered his shoulder into him? Jesus Christ.
I'm using a similar list but with no quartermasters. I've gotten some great value from Ysera while using her (chromaggus doesn't copy her cards :[ ) but quartermaster can serve an equally valuable role. I've mostly been trading recruits in left and right to activate cost reduction stuff. 
&gt; So this rocket needs to be fucking enormous, right?No, it needs to be *planned*.[Tsiolkovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) says that small payload = moderate launcher, large payload = insane behemoth, so the first and most important thing is to shrink the payload of every stage!What's the *tiniest* ship you can make, that has enough ΔV to launch from the Mun and return to Kerbin?hint: leave science behind, you can gather the results on EVA and store them in a command pod.Next, what's the *tiniest* stage that can land that ship on the Mun?Next, what's the *tiniest* stage that can propel the above from LKO to low Munar orbit?Next, what's the *tiniest* launcher that can lift the above to LKO?Now you have a *planned* ship that may only be a little larger than your current one, or possibly rather smaller if you use a seat instead of the command pod
[Every Frame a Painting](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFqcJQXGZ6T6sxyFB-5i6A) is an amazing channel, but it's still young and doesn't have an overwhelming amount of content. The stuff that's there is brilliant though.I don't listen to podcasts.
To be fair, with the war chest they are giving every single micro-transaction dlc away for free (but only with the bundle) Still not worth buying though. 
Sued a former employer who was stealing tips for 2800$. Got every penny he owed me. Then they investigated his other employees. That jerk ended up having to close his second restaurant because of settlments with his employees. 
I run into this issue a lot. I work on a brand new imac with maxed out settings. Are you also running into [this](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26959643/Screen%20Shot%202014-10-20%20at%2022.27.38.png) issue?Apparently its an issue with the way Nvidia is running Adobe products with its Cuda cores. Nvidia seems to be working on it, but this issue has been going on for probably 6-8 months now. People say it helps to turn off the Mercury Rendering, only run 1 adobe program at a time, and to not run Chrome simultaneously. I've tried all these and it does help, but I have several projects with 5k Epic footage and large stills that continue to have this issue. All we can do is wait until Nvidia updates the cuda drivers. I try to check for Nvidia updates once a week. 
I really appreciate it, my dad is the only one that is ok and raised me with guns the rest of my family is very anti gun(including my mom, how her and my dad have been together for 35 years is beyond me) and my wife is ok with guns but by no means pro gun. so i really just needed someone to talk to about how i feel and what i should do.
To further this point, how long have you guys been typing on a computer and how many of you have seen huge improvements in your typing speed in the last year? I don't think I'd ever be able to reach 150+ wpm even though I "practice" every day. I know typing speed doesn't matter that much in League, but I'm just trying to get my point across that there can be talent involved when controlling a mouse and keyboard.
Ok, you've sent me many links, thank you, however the number of jobs available don't begin to supply the demand. Furthermore, are you aware that many employers would prefer to hire someone from Towson rather than Park Heights, from Columbia rather than Woodbrook? Yes things like this happen, perceived behaviours or assumed criminal records, I'm not sure why. You also mentioned fast food and that's fine, however no one can survive on a fast food cheque, fast food employment i imagine was designed for students living with parents and not to sustain an acceptable standard of living. You still haven't mentioned what it is you do to sustain your standard of living which I'm going to assume is ok.
They are french scientists, playing with their body to look like aliens or something. Anyway they wrote awesome books explaining science to everyone, and are pretty popular. Obe of them has a fucking hot wife!!

Despite their constant issues as of late, they seem to be doing their best to work things out... why do people still use it? sell some vendors use it exclusively, the next largest market BB now i think, has half the listing... nucleus looks like a scam from the get go. and you just never know with DNM's what's going to happen. i won't forget almost shitting my pants when i realized sr1 was actually seized, or when sheep went down (although that was somewhat predictable), but then you have sites that get busted like cloud9 that were smooth like BB, and then you have seemingly popular/professional sites like Evo just pull a SheepMP amd walk off with $34 million.It's a crap shoot either way. Agora some times reminds me of BMR in that sevurity seems to be the number one concern, although Ag is defeinitely more user friendly. I just wish they were more clear about the problems they were having. is it their coding? a DDOS? a hacker?
Imagine that you have a rag (the draft) and there's a bucket full of water (money) and an empty bucket (their bank account). To get the most amount of water from the full bucket to the empty bucket you need to dip the rag in there as many times as you can and squeeze as much water out of it as possible. 
Nihilum has the greatest potential out of any of the other teams. The idea is to build into being a great team now. Sure right now c9 is better but in 6 months with a team of hungry players it will be a different story?
Actually, heavier NFL players suffer long term consequences from their weight and have a reduced life expectancy compared to players of a more normal weight.http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2313476
I would NOT place those beers under the seasonal moniker. However they are both limited by an allocation quantity so we only get a handful of each.   Oberon is a well known seasonal but its a tough sell. When there is hop slam and daisy cutter released so close to the same time frame. A few weeks to a month matter. Wake and bake is dope as hell. But greater then 50% only want us to get the corked and waxed variants. The pumpkin Terrapin is another allocation allotment. 
that was just one example, other examples may just be people playing around like when you know the game is like in the bag, and you fuck with each other a little (like trying to steal camps or something), little things like that are technically classified as trolling, but they are not meant to be harmful and negative
I like what you said at the end. I love Lilith. I think she is a great character (and class for that matter) and I don't want to kill her. If she was the antagonist and didn't die and become good again, that would be great! I really hope this happened now.
I hear you. Platitudes like that are generally stupid. But that one held true for me. I have no idea if it will for others. And fear seems fair. It's heavy shit. Hopefully you can just find someone to be scared about it with.
Larrys show tries to make me feel bad for being white I swear.  Like his question "a white man and a black man are running at you and one is a criminal,  you have one bullet who do you shoot?" well with my experience of the three times I've gotten  jumped,  Larry will think my answer is racist.  I hate his loaded questions like that.  
No, we don't. We want people to not need to understand anything. If being secure depends on understanding how encryption works, 99.99% of people (probably a low estimate) will never be secure.
Just checked out your guitar video too, just a tip, try to incorporate your pinky finger. The longer you play without using it, the harder it will be to start using it because it won't feel natural. Also, don't be afraid to add some vibrato in there and don't pick as hard, it'll make your playing seem more natural and flow a little better. Good video!

I don't agree. But each person is entitled to their own opinion. If not being able to not play the game is such a big deal that you think the game really deserves a 1 star rating, just stop playing all together. I mean, the title is Tap Titans. Not tap once every 5 minutes and forget about it.
Bargain, you get the black one cheaper... And? Also they didn't show if the pink one was just part of a range. Stationary items often come in a slightly more expensive decorative range as well as the standard plain version.
No idea why you're getting downvoted. Idiots just downvote if they don't like what you're saying, even if it holds a tidbit of information that they could have used as well to get "free" boxes.
As a pastor's son who grew up quite recently (I'm 20) on his single income of &lt;$25,000 a year for a family of 5, most people who become pastors of random local churches aren't interested in money.  They can't be, because there isn't a lot of money in it.
M97s are not mezgers and NOT the same block used in the GT1 cars. you're thinking of the air-cooled porsches/GT2/GT3/turbo blocks which share the heritage of the GT1 engines. M96/M97 was designed for the masses. although a bit tainted by IMS issues, the 06-08MY engines were relatively trouble free. Engine for engine, in my opinion they sound MUCH better than the 9A1, and also, no carbon buildup issues! :D

I think Allen brings more to the table in terms of talent as a receiver.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Allen dominate the snap count over Fleener.  But then again, I'm not sure how they compare when it comes to run blocking.
Sounds fun. I haven't really had time to do one in the past, so I'd love to try the game for a spin. Hopefully I won't miss out by not knowing any of the inside jokes :'(
It's so fucking kafkaesque how you so strongly believe that we're the same person. Meanwhile /u/20150501 and I are thousands of miles away from each other.Any person who has spent a substantial amount of time on this subreddit can tell you that we're different people. You just barely arrived.
I don't say "Debian" becuase "Debian GNU/Linux" is too wordy, I say "Debian" because that tells the listener everything they need to know, far more so than saying "GNU/Linux". I might even specify that I use KDE, which, again, provides more information about what my home computer 'looks and feels' like than anything GNU.
So could you OP. You realize it was MUCH more effort to stop what you were doing, pretend to be annoyed, and take a picture for karma than it would have been to just fix the top basket, right?

Ok, let me break this down for you, Every Single Person who has ever mentioned the forums, was me.it started as a joke from a novelty account, later i started doing it from other accounts, trying to see how far i could take this until you noticed, but you didn't. i have learned some things about you, and honestly i couldn't have randomly picked a more interesting person.

Your characters are so strong that each spinoff could spawn its own spinoff, creating the AMC Cinematic Universe. Walking Dead takes place after, Mad Men and Halt &amp; Catch Fire take place before. 
Interesting...to feel a connection with God but not Christ.  Usually when someone leaves Christianity, I would think most simply become atheist/agnostic.  Or maybe something of differing faith, like Hinduism or Paganism. How would you believe the Messiah, as Hebrew prophecy explains Him, act while here?  Just in comparison of that excerpt from John you posted.I'm sure you're not the only person to leave a Christian faith for Judaism...were you able to find out any rough numbers of Christian-to-Jew conversions?

Hmm I disagree with this post. I will start by saying it matters how bad his foot is sprained.

&gt; I got a student, female under 20,&gt; If nothing else, you might get some interest by explaining the literal meaning of expressions like 'Osaka sucks balls'.Another classy English teacher here ladies and gentlemen.
The point is she isn't necessarily half assing it, that is just how her style looks to you. Could she be a better lip syncer? For sure. But I don't think she isn't trying. Edit: This sounds shadier than I meant it. I personally like Pearl and her style, but I see where improvement could be made.
Straight up I think scars are sexy. I think your scars are ultra sexy. They show that you have been through hardships that you have overcome which is extremely sexy to me. It seems to me that you are already embracing them somewhat and that is awesome. Don't ever be self conscious about them. Don't ever let people make you feel like shit because of them, they are a part of you. You should wear them with pride. You are sexier than anyone could ever hope to be because of your courage and strength.
I actually managed to string these guys along over the course of three days. I think I managed to waste at least two hours of their time in total before they hung up on me and didn't call back.
&gt;I think that men are capable of choosing for themselves whether or not they want to enter this lifestyle, same as women.But these women are "forced" into such things because of reasons!&gt;maybe this will open up some less gender-biased discussion of body image and commodification in our societyI highly doubt it.  As it stands now bring up the male side of this is often gets talked down and turn into about the female side or it gets totally disregarded when it comes to discussion, despite the fact body image for males has become a growing issue among them and something those that deal with this have very much taken note off (there's quite a few articles and only a handful of studies on male body image issues, and there are zero solid numbers of yet).

I dont think anyone's reputation is on the line. Lawyers are wrong and lose cases all the time. If you listen to the couple of extended podcast type things they have released, it sounds like an extended commercial of how great UVa law is. But, if it means more money for IP, I have no problem with it.
&gt; Oh hey these mortgage bankers are fucking over a shit ton of people, making a ton of money while doing it, hurting the country more than blacks, doing coke on the job, smoking weed when they get home in their extravagant condo/mansion/whatever.Those bankers got off scot free under the Obama administration's criminal justice department. Why aren't you pissed off at them for enabling the crime instead of throwing the book at the bankers?Barney Frank and Chris Dodd were two of the loudest voices *demanding* low income families be given loans to buy houses ... before the financial crisis. They pushed for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lower their lending standards to loan money to people who couldn't possibly pay the loans back. *Then* they turned around and claimed to be "reforming Wallstreet" (which they didn't do) after the crisis *they created* fucked the U.S. economy up. Why aren't you mad at them along with the bankers?
Yes, exactly. You ask as though that is not within the realm of possibilities, and when you do a little research on this department, you will discover that this wouldn't be the least bit surprising. 
I don't know anything about mini itx so I hoping some one will answer. I am itching to throw an old GPU in one to make a portable lan machine. Just adding this comment so this post gets noticed.
But my whole point is that she bought that food before she decided to make a positive lifestyle change.  The only way you can assume she is eating that crap while also working out is if she posted the food after she started working out.... That's all I'm saying...the post is misleading and pointless."Hey this women used to eat like crap and is fat and now she goes to the gym."  That's all you can get out of it. It has no reason being here.

Dunno, I watch all my TV through Netflix and Amazon Prime. Yahoo just feels out of place for good TV, particularly when they don't have any other good services. Feels like 2 steps down from Hulu. Maybe I'm wrong. 
Aye. I live in Denmark where it's possible to get a small RFID tracker (I think that's the one) for your bike. Postmens vehicles then has a detector on them, and that way you can find your bike, assuming the tracker is still on it ofc

Some women enjoy it....also....no pregnancy risk?  Also, tightness. This isn't bragging, but anal is something bigger dicked guys have less interest in, and partners less inclined to the idea. 
I mentioned this up top but I'm going to copy/paste it here too because I think it's relevant:As a Korean-American who has heard this sentiment expressed before by black people during the L.A. riots, let me tell you this: When they say that Asians just "take, take, take," I believe they are referring to the idea that Asians open up businesses in black neighborhoods and only hire their own family members rather than hiring people of the community. Therefore, we are taking black money without giving anything back (i.e. jobs).I have to say that I do understand their point of view when it comes to this. After the L.A. riots, a lot of Korean business owners actually realized this and started making changes. They started hiring more people of the community they were opening up shop in.I just wanted to mention this because there seems to be a lot of hate and casual racism in this thread. I do think black people have a reason to be mad when it comes to this.

I cannot tell you how many times I've found a semi-interesting article that I then find out is on Statesman.comI then ignore that article.  And that's because there's a paper edition delivered to my office.  Paywalling is stupid for a newspaper that size.
As a manager of a middle school cafeteria in a school district that takes safety, sanitation and nutrition very seriously, this shit really grinds my gears. We have so many standards and HACCP protocols in place that this shit never happens. There are some districts out there that seriously don't give a shit about the health and well being of their students. Every picture that a disgruntled kid puts on instagram of his mystery meat makes us all seem like we're retarded. 
Humans evolved in an environment where children would have witnessed sexual behavior by adults on a daily basis. Not saying we should return to that but the fetishization of "innocence" needs to be considered in that context.

Not everyone who dies is "executed", some people, especially long term drug abusers live their lives one foot in the grave and it doesn't take much to tip them in. There was this friend of my wife's family who was arrested years ago. He fought and was restrained laying flat on his gut. Years of drinking and smoking exotic weeds had left his lungs far less than totally efficient and he suffered fairly catastrophic brain damage as a result. The cops fault? I don't think so. Seems like I heard that he recently died. Not because of the actions of the police, it was a result of his own actions combined with his chosen lifestyle. 
Really enjoyed that. Thank you for sharing. I can never get enough quality FF music covers... I still geek out every time I go to my local sushi place and they play "To Zanarkand" while I'm eating.
Obviously he got hit at the other end and was frustrated, but goddamn, especially given the recent injuries in the playoffs, you'd think dudes would be more careful about this sort of thing. Dude's gotta learn. Glad Dunleavy didn't sustain any sort of injuries. 
Selv tak. Umiddelbart forstod jeg det som om der var en måned til at du var færdig med dem - det beklager jeg. Jeg vil dog alligevel stå fast i min holdning, tror jeg.

It'd be just as stupid, how is walking alone "inviting" someone to do anything to you?It'd be a general safety tip if he said, walking alone at night is dangerous because A. B. C. inviting implies she was somehow complicit. 
No by having the title in your name, legally makes it yours, in every state. Because the Title is an official document showing ownership.Driving it off the lot has nothing to do with it.

Personally, I'd go with the Sheraton, if it's made in Korea. The Artcores are amazing, no doubt, but the Sherry already has Classic '57's. Also, Nick Valensi of the Strokes' main guitar is a Korean Epi, so I bet he can vouch for the quality.
Ads for Nepal? Wut?Regardless, they should release the budget,, put out a press release and let the press have at 'er. Which kinda happens, but the ad cycle is 8-12 weeks. The news cycle is 8-12 hours. And the bulk of our press is lazy and over-distracted by shiny, new things.
I would take everything /r/relationships says with a grain of salt. As another poster said, many of these harsh comments may deal more with other people and THEIR body insecurities that compared to yours are much much greater. You are not selfish or vain. You are in a happy, loving marriage based on mutual attraction, and that is a great place to be (and want to remain).
The next team can then make a pick, and so on, but the original team that fucked up can put in their pick whenever. But the longer they wait the more people may be off the board. It's happened before.
so funny to see these guys talk about mariotas future so nonchanlantly. like, titans can pick him and then trade him, and he can end up here, or here or whatever. Mariotas like fuck, this is my life u guys are talking about.

False, there's no legal distinction in copyright for "residential" usage. The only protection you might get is under fair use, but internet piracy cases have shown that the non-commercial clause is insufficient by itself to grant fair use.

The thinking is that Ray will drop out of the first because of the pot arrest. Not sure I believe it but he is getting slammed just like Gregory. These were both guys being talked about as top 10 picks.
My partner dropped her iPhone a couple of weeks ago and I just had it fixed at the Apple store (in Bridgeport if that matters :)). Cost $129. They said it would take 45 min -- I had something else to do so I picked up a couple of hours later.
If done with that intent I agree it's completely fucked up but there are different levels of drunk. My only point is drunk does not automatically mean foul play, people often have consensual sex when one or both are drunk and have no regrets. Can you honestly say you haven't had sex when drunk (bac over .08).
I'm assuming that's just raw material cost...doesn't include the equipment to build the product, logistics, packaging, or quality.  I'm not sure if Apple rolls their ED&amp;D into the piece price of their products, but I'm assuming they do.
&gt;I'm playing these games for the enviroment and the storyThen you're not playing a game, just watching an interactive wallpaper or an unstructured video presentation.

Dude...I couldn't live life without our culture of fear....the thought of not being terrified all the time of Ebola, Terrorism, Global Warming, Economic Collapse and Race riots.....BLAH!, I shudder to think of what would happen if we got rid of those things....it's a terrifying thought. 
Because politics.The NRA "scores" all kinds of bullshit bills/votes to skew their numbers. Notice how almost all republicans have an A or a 90+ from the NRA, but even pro-gun democrats have C grades.
It may be surprising, but some people stay together and don't feel the need to betray each other, instead they both work hard with the comfort that someone has your back if something happens.
You shouldn't. Nintendo isn't good in spreading information to all its reps. Most Nintendo employees don't know much about Amiibo. The information he gave you seems to be based on him checking Nintendo Amiibo website. 
Yup, and that actually sounds pretty tame compared to the things I've seen and experienced.  A lot of pet owners are really irresponsible and unfortunately it ruins it for everyone.

Sorry, grammar nerd approaching. These are examples of why the Oxford comma is occasionally necessary. Usually it's a bad idea, for the exact reason that it is unnecessary. The "and" at the end of almost any list does the job that a final comma would do. The only exception is when you are listing three things that could be taken to be the same thing, which is extraordinarily rare.If I say "my favorite colors are purple, silver and green," no one thinks that silver and green are describing purple.
You can look at the webpages for the different state departments to try to find some documents on codes and regulations.For example [California Department of Education's codes and regulations](http://www.cde.ca.gov/ls/fa/sf/title5regs.asp).
Best thing about this is that it will give newer players a chance to play some of the end-game t10 tanks without having to grind up to them, hopefully teaching them how to play the game at tier 10 without them having to learn by screwing up in random battles.
I'd say it has a very mediocre dial.  The Y, Lambda and Hawk are all categorically worse.  The X is basically identical, The Tie Advance is pretty similar with a little more speed, and while I think the B dial was SUPPOSED to be worse, the simple fact you have that 1-turn, even at red, as a choice is huge.  Pretty much every other ship has  better dial

She said she pulled him from the riot because she didn't want him to be the next one shot. Let that sink in. She wasn't disciplining him for rioting and causing problems... It was because she feared for her son's safety. Let that sink in. She's a good mother. 
This is why I love peoples input. Thank you. I never truly thought past what others thought was the right way. You and others put a different mindset in me haha. 
I've seen it used on heroes like CM to amazing success. It's utility invis and you have to spend a bunch of money on detection. I think it's like a core CM item. 
Make a home for yourself that is so much fun that others decide to Press and join you. If you cannot find friends, make a good place where they can find you. 
Oh my god. I read your post and felt such sadness ~ then scrolled up to check who posted :( I wouldn't wish such a thing on anyone, but especially not you. Tears and hugs and thoughts for you. I'm so sorry, sweetness. I wish I could do something 
Yeah, that's one of the many things I'm not a fan of in that system. The only thing close to a critical hit mechanic, except it doesn't ensure success.
I'm driving a car on a super dangerous highway that is either incredibly narrow and curvy or ends in a HUGE ramp. I survive it and end up at an amusement park, but it's not fun or exciting. It just is.

Anyone else think Metternberger isn't that good, like at all? I've seen a lot in /r/nfl about how the Titans should stick with him for another year, but from the games I watched he sucked
I'm trying! I'm pretty small framed but I am WAY out of shape and just in general don't like myself. I quit drinking caffeine last week and gave myself a diet of 1800 calories so I'm working my way back down to 135 lbs or so - which hopefully will help me see myself in a better light.
Yeah, see, that stuff starts *out* as tongue and cheek, but then, internet, and some people are dead fucking serious when they say that Onion is likely going to be Yellow Diamond.

Well, I kinda have to agree.  Stannis always came off as the bitchy posh kid who grew up and gained a little perspective, but never grew out of the entitlement shit.
europe has a huge population of first generation african immigrants, many of whom may be refugees of countries which disapprove of their sexual orientation.
I have not conceded you have an argument. You have the myths of iron age goat herders who thought the Sun went around the Earth, bats were birds and whales were fish. In my first reply to your thread I said that I refuse to acknowledge that kind of nonsense as a guide to anything. 
&gt;why does this matter? It of course doesn't matter *to us*! XT cassettes have a more expensive and fancier finish on them that helps performance bikers shift under load, and it makes zero difference to us who usually trundle along in one or two gears for days on end. Lightweight carriers are only of interest to guys who spend time jumping around mountains, not riding up hills.Anyways, the best way to visualise the effect of different gears is to use an [online calculator](http://www.bikecalc.com/gear_inches) that'll tell you how many gear inches are developed for each combination.
&gt;pushing out printers to people using remote desktopThis is a poorly worded version of, "pushing out printers to people who also connect to a remote desktop and print through printer redirection"
Gender and sexuality have no link. Any gender can be any sexuality. Terminology is different due to everything being based of binary genders. Here goes better terminology that I think everyone should use.Androsexual: attracted to menGynosexual: attracted to womanSkoliosexual: attracted to us gender queer folkMultisexual: attracted to more than one genderBisexual: attracted to two or more undefined gendersPansexual: attracted to all of the genders (Me :D)There are many more terms but those are some of my favorites as they are not gender basedSide not - bisexual is generally interpreted as attracted to men and woman but it doesn't have to.
Yeah that was the point. The original comment was about hating anyone who said "I chose not to vaccinate because" and the comment before me gives a valid reason and then so did I. I know it's not a "choice" but it could still be worded like that in theory 
Wang was like, "sure is". I was like, "hey, you aren't OP". Noes interjected with "I am OP". I was like "bullshit/farts, stop telling lies". Then this guy came in with a Shanghai Noon joke. Low said, "how many farts do you want me to do?"I responded, "2. Thanks, brother/comrade".懂了吗？
Kuaui is a much older island and erosion has shaped it with more valleys and water ways where vegetation gathers.  There has also been a lot more time for dirt to collect as the Big Island's topsoil layers are much thinner (many places even in the lusher eastern side) measured in 1"-3" of soil.  These two combinations make Kauai more fertile for a wider variety of plants.
Hate how everyone is saying the didact is not returning and how there will be no new vehicles. He was composed in escalation, which would signal that he's going to be shown in a whole new body. Accourding to the officials behind the halo 5 mega bloks toys, they reveal plot details,  which includes a promethean vehicle known as the Phaethon that chief probably steals and what appears to be a blue armoured didact. 
Just because you don't understand it, doesn't make it BS.There is a difference between the price at which you can buy a stock and the price at which you can sell it. That's how a 'market maker' makes money, off this difference, or 'spread.' Historically, the difference between these two numbers could be 1% of the stock price, or more. Now, because of high frequency traders making it easier to execute trades for everyone, that spread has narrowed tenfold. That means it is much less costly for anyone that transacts in the markets to do business. They essentially made the system much more efficient and took a lot of money out of the pockets of Wall Street

You're not cheating taking the bus. When I started commuting, I'd ride as far as I could and then call my wife to pick me up. After a month or so I do the whole commute. You'll be able to do it too.
Oh god this is gonna be fun.Constantinople doesn't exist anymore, the city is named Istanbul. That one included, you named 15 cities, perfectly proving my point. And you say you're 'above average', I can't wait to see the average American geography knowledge.Ljubljana is the capital city of Slovenia, I'm not sure if you know, but Slovenia isn't Eastern bloc.I was taught every American, Canadian, Australian and Russian state in school. Just like pretty much everybody else here, not saying everyone can name all of them (I can't either) but most people here probably know atleast 20 states. Can you name 20 countries in Europe?
RIP tank meta...we're going back to the Lee Sin meta boyz...I knew it was only so long before Riot diverted from its "We want more stuff to be viable in the jungle, we're sorry for making things so hard on you!" mantra
Ok that's just a differing interpretation of aging.  I just meant that when I watched it as a kid,  that didn't seem odd,  and now that cell phones are everywhere,  the whole idea of needing a landline to stay in touch seems ancient. 
Thanks for posting that link, it made me rethink some of the conclusions I came to and the research I read on trolling, too - especially when the victim got the apology and explanation of the behaviour. What do you think? Is trolling behaviour something ingrained in people or do good people just get caught up in the moment? It's always nice to see signs that humanity still exists on the Internet!
It's one of their two most important crops, along with rice, although potatoes have become more important since the famine.  [This paper](http://fftc.agnet.org/htmlarea_file/library/20110726131553/eb475.pdf) has a chart on the last page showing rice and maize production from 1984-1998.Note that more maize was grown than rice up until 1996, at the height of the famine.
Be interested if the minor Luna changes bring her back into the meta a bit. Brew fell off pretty hard from a minor armour reduction, so will Luna's minor buff make her a more attractive safelaner? The Aghs upgrade though, seems... situational at best.

I'm really not sure exactly what this means from Dave, from a figurative/character development standpoint. Was his need to be "heroic" an allegory for one's need to be what society tells you is "masculine"? Honestly, I think I would be a bit disappointing if the reveal was that all of Dave's irony issues were because he was in the closet. 
Abusing camera perspective to your favor.In this case you can aim above the stairs in your POV, but your opponents only see your head and it's the only thing which they can hit to damage you.
Thanks, i did email them, but they said contact listickets for problems. i dont mind going to the stadium to get it at the office but i saw some time slots are sold out, i guess i can call when im there.
Blacks are only arrested for more crimes than whites in the US per capita, not over all. In fact, when you look at total crimes by each group, whites seem to commit **three times** more crimes per year than blacks.  [source](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/43tabledatadecoverviewpdf)  I would love to see where you get your info about white death by police. It is a static I haven’t heard anything about.  ETA: formatting
If you're in a hurry, you could read the short stories "A Question of Price" and "The Last Wish" in the first collection, and "The Sword of Destiny" in the second to introduce you to most of the important characters close to Geralt [Yennefer, Ciri, Dandelion].(#spoiler)Zoltan comes in much later in the books, and arguably plays a larger role as Geralt's friend in the games than he does in the books.Beyond that, you could read the first full novel, "Blood of Elves", which introduces you to the rest of the witchers as well as Triss, and [also gives you a glimpse into Ciri's powers as well].(#spoiler)
Eh... Don't eat chocolate, ration your meals appropriately, and you'll see results within a month or two. Coupled with exercise.. It really just takes 3-5 months of motivation, and the rest you will start to see and be stoked about, so you won't need motivating. The last few lbs are the hardest. People tend to forget that you can lose 100lbs fairly easily at 500lbs. But once you start getting skinny, 3-5lbs is tough. 
I would just delete my comments if that were the case because I'm going to get downvotes no matter what I say now xD but I don't actually care. Hopefully the guy I was originally talking to believes I'm being truthful and there's no harm done, but oh well. It's up to him to decide, not reddit detectives.
I used to have that second one ("and the best is yet to come").  I really appreciated their inclusion of Excalibur, the unappreciated x-title (which I loved).
I had a co-worker who was American Samoan that said many of the men prefer bigger women.  I've heard other theories that say people will mate with bigger people because a bigger person knows where to get food.  A larger woman is more likely to be able to birth and nourish a child.  Also, being large was considered a sign of wealth to some, because only rich people could afford enough food to get fat, so they would be more desirable matches.  
I'm having a pretty great birthday today. Gonna play Marvel and SF today, then spend tomorrow with the gf, then see Avengers 2 with some friends and play D&amp;D on Saturday. Nerdy as fuck. Get at me. 
Do you think they're trying to say that Meredith is in danger of repeating her mother's past and how time moves in a circle, much like a carousel? It's just **SO** subtle. *eyeroll*
I just discovered that I'm ambidextrous. I've contemplated just writing from the back to the front, or just turning the notebook upside down every time the spiral is on the wrong side.
Wrestling is fake. Wrestling is a TV show, it is not a sport.Yes, it's a TV show that I love. But it's just TV. They are actors who do their own stunts.
I do do high-bar squats, because my shoulder mobility sucks too much to do low-bar squats. I'm aware you can do less with those. It did feel comfortable on my back though.I wish I could take a video, but at the moment, I don't have a cell phone or any other recording device. So that sucks :(
Last I remember he was only taken down because Dr.Strange sent it to a empty universe to rot in. No one actually beat it, just swept it under the carpet and forgot about it
I really do weep at the lack of imagination of some users....  At high school all the windows games were uninstalled, so I would take a CD with a couple of emulators (nes, snes) and some games on it to play during computer class...
Mistweaver Monk, Holy Priest, Resto Shaman, Resto Druid, Holy Paladin, Disc Priest.Mistweavers are super interactive and their healing style is, imo, revolutionary. Holy priest is awesome because you can blanket everyone with your healing, but it's not all instant casts like a druid. So you have to weave in casts as well. Resto shamans are amazing at clump healing and emergency healing. It's easy to get a constant burst going. Resto druids are extremely mobile, because almost everything they do is instant cast. Holy paladin is an extremely stand still spec with amazing burst potential and it's always awesome to see all your shields everywhere. Disc priests are fun when you have the words of mending talent, but clarity of will kind of turns them into a CoW turret. But weaving archangel in your "rotation" makes it fun as well.
As it stands... Probably 6/10. I honestly think a bit more smiling would go a long way ^^;And would say I think you tend to look better without the eye make-up, but that might just be my opinion.you have a very attractive build, and are quite cute. If you really try for it, I could see you as a 7/10 maybe a bit above.
&gt; She ended up electing to have surgery, the one where they basically scorch your whole uterusI guess that's called [endometrial ablation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrial_ablation)?
Su dimisión me parece un error. Es como admitir que las acusaciones contra él eran ciertas, Que las noticias periodísticas de enfrentamientos en la dirección del Partido Político tienen fundamento. Y lamento que sea después de haberse visto obligado a dimitir de la beca que consistía en una de sus fuentes estables de ingresos. Ahora, en los tiempos que sufrimos, tendrá que buscar otro empleo. Y no creo que Venezuela esté en condiciones de encargarle ningún otro trabajo, teniendo en cuenta el golpe de su inmensa depreciación monetaria, que se cifra en un 93%.
Maybe I can talk you out of it?I have one I wore in Afghanistan, so it has war dirt and sentimental value for me,  but it can be uncomfortably warm. If I had to do it over again, I'd get one with mesh panels or a lighter material like ripstop cotton. Look at Tru-Spec or Voodoo Tactical.
Yes! Mine went from kind of half-way a little bit wavy to wavy all over. And it got darker with each pregnancy. I was a tow-head blonde baby and now my hair is medium ash brown.
I hear ya, but I guess I'm not so much ranting on offering advice when not asked, but those who offer shitty no-context advice.  *You* do not do the latter. You try to help and give an explanation behind the advice you're giving.
Are you all on the same lease?  If so you are all individually responsible for the entire rent amount. You are also responsible for any damage regardless of whether or not you personally caused it. your landlord isn't screwing you over. You are screwing your landlord by not abiding by the contract you signed and paying rent on time.Does your lease say you can sublet? If the lease says you're not allowed to sublet then your roommate could get you all evicted.
Yeah especially the first year and with the bucs the way they are now bringing in a rookie QB, no matter who he is, they're bound to struggle somewhat. Reminds me of us in 2011 coming off a 2-14 year. Our offense was great with Cam but still only managed 6 wins.
You should still be able to find some of the older make around the web.

Prestatyn Town were relegated. They've been absolute dogshit all season. A particular highlight was watching them lose 2-1 to Rhyl in icy wind and rain.
I personally use the Apple Airport Extreme, it works great (even with non-apple products) but it's rather pricey and you need an iOS/OSX device to set it up.
makes me wonder why we didnt use CJ more earlier. if we new CJ was this good we wouldnt have had to trade away my two favorite blazers for afflalo. IM SO BUTTHURT ABOUT THIS GUYS! our roster was incredible at the beginning of the season. WE NEED TO USE OUR BENCH MORE AND KEEP SOME LIFE IN OUR STARTERS SO THEY CAN F'ING PLAY IN THE POST SEASON
Yes to everything but these&gt; Acquire and charge rune gauntlets or a blue dhide coif, depending on your preferred combat style.Don't think this carries over at all to member's content&gt; Purchase a dungeoneering necklace of your preferred combat style.Probably not a great use of tokens, it may be better to save for chimp/bonecrusher/chaotics&gt; Purchase a set of rune god armorShould only be done if you like the cosmetic aspect of it&gt; Kill ghosts for GH armor and the cremation abilityEh, neither are really that useful
I'm just saying, you seem way more rational and cool in the video, the whole sex worker thing is weird to me and kind of superfluous and inappropriate.  I wasn't attacking your opinion of sex workers, nor did I care about it.

I think you're clever! Just wasn't sure if you were aware, since the way you used it has been appropriated as colloquialism despite its opposite meaning. After a good workout, I'd be so thirsty, that eating all that chopped fruit wouldn't take more than twenty minutes.

&gt; The chief said the officer fired his gun four times to get the dog to release his foot, and two of the bullets hit the dog. Ferreira was uninjured in the dog attack, the chief said.Yeah right chief, he shot at the dog 4 times and only hit the dog 2 times. Ya boy can't shoot.  
This video is several years old, its not like it happened yesterday. Why are people giving him shit about it? Its just people looking for an excuse to call him a cunt. Its so juvenile. 
Met this cool guy, mark, holding a sign downtown that says, "smile."  Caught my eye. Invited him over, we hit it off. Found out he blows glass and offered to let him set up shop at my place a bit. Go talk to him. He hangs out downtown everyday. Real nice guy. Rolling I'm a cigarette or buying him a cup of coffee will be a great investment considering the stories he's got to share. 
Yes it is 0% on balance transfers, I made sure of that. I haven't used the cards in almost a year since I started aggressively paying them off. I am not worried about my score I have a 765 right now, I was just always told to only have 1-3 cards open at any given time, so I figured might as well close this once I'm done taking advantage of the balance transfer.I appreciate your reply, really mean that. But my question wasn't answered. I have spoken to my financial planner/advisor. And my investor. I know this is a good option. I am wondering if anyone knows of a BETTER one is all.
oh yea conqueror haki. I totally forgot. Yeah, he could most likely knock a lot of people out. But then again, if they're not all gathered within the vicinity of Luffy, luffy might have trouble taking them all down because of the haki's limited range.
Pete mentions in the first or second episode of this season that he has to wait out his contract to get the lump of the sale, I'm assuming that was the same deal they all got, and it makes sense considering McCann wouldn't want to take all the risk.

Nah, i search for what i want by typing in the name of the app. If it's free and doesn't take up a butt load of storage, and i really need it's functionality, and has a decent rating and amount of previous downloads i'll get it. If i'm browsing something new that i don't know the name of, i'll search by category, and highest rating/downloads. I never buy apps unless i can test it and make sure it works the way i want first. So i wouldn't buy any mods unless it got really good recommendations from longtime users. That could be implemented very simply by having the time they have used the mod right next to their review, or time of subscription, in the case of paid mods in Skyrim.
They're not underpaid. They're paid exactly what they agreed to sell their labor for. The fact of the matter is that there are simply more people willing and able to do those jobs.If you feel that teachers should be paid more, awesome. Put your money where your mouth is. Start cutting some checks. 
yeah right now is a really good time for leveling at the crystal palace, spamming it so I can fit my 3rd 7 star on the squad, that place will be for Kikuri assuming she comes out before Ronel, and Ronel if she happens to come out first
The difference is implied, where the ASOIAF characters are evil to the core, Walter White was originally a good man trying to do the best he could for his family, and falls down into villainy while always carrying a glimmer of hope for redemption which never comes to fruition. The true monstrosity isn't just in the acts themselves, (rape, murder, torture, for the ASOIAF characters) but in the overall story arc from start to finish.
I'm talking about the Chandrian story. It's hard to keep track of who's who.The enemy poisoned seven others against the empire. One remembered the Lethani and did not betray their city. The names of the seven traitors are remembered. The names of the one and the six that follow him.Then it follows that the Enemy must be within those 7 names, right? But it says that these were the names of the 7 traitors. How can the Enemy be a traitor?
It's a remix of the Elton John song "Can You Feel The Love Tonight" probably a remix done by Kevin seeing as the Kit used sounds exactly like the one from his "Stranger In Moscow" cover. Although i could be wrong 
Wellll...if whites want to make the news, they should get off their lazy asses and go out in the street and break shit, get beaten, and tear-gassed and arrested like the blacks do. Otherwise, STFU with all this "#WHITELIVESDON'TMATTER" shite.
The Origin of Species"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally  breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and wonderful have been, and are being, evolved."
This has to be the most idiotic thing I've read all dayEdit: just to be clear (since there was actual information added after I posted this), I was referring to reducing everything a hedge fund manager does down to gambling.

I have an aerator, but I don't use it routinely. It's just on hand for wines that feel slightly too tannin heavy or slightly too green, and I'm feeling impatient. 
You would just need to ensure a lack of career politicians. Make some rules for the kind of person who's allowed to stand for election. That might seem to be a bit counter intuitive but just because everyone's entitled to vote, not everyone is entitled to be in charge. Maybe they just have to be educated to degree level in something and X amount of years in that field or by X amount of years in a certain industry.

Ah, I just checked, and my profile name is different than the name that appears whenever I play online, so I don't think it's that. Thanks for the answer though, turns out my profile name was something kinda dumb from a few years ago, got that fixed c:
Yeah, looks like it. I personally wouldn't mind their ass looking smaller if it was panty line free.  What's the point of wearing tight pants to show off your ass, if it's full of lines and seams. 
Wow.  Trying to make an NFL team is tough enough, but add on the intense media scrutiny that surrounds Tampa sports...that's going to be fucking TOUGH.It is very difficult to perform under that level of media scrutiny.
Deep down I kind of expected this. I have followed this team since they drafted Vin Baker and they've done this shit for years. Get your hopes up just to deflate them.
These are the kinds of things high school students would remember if shown, but can't be shown because of the inappropriate language.Kind of like how experimenting on babies is ethically wrong, but would grant the community a great deal of useful information.
Reigns thinking he's still in the Shield is bothering me now more than ever. Once the Shield triple threat story starts, he's gotta stop or I'm gonna lose my mind. LET HIM FIND HIS OWN IDENTITY.

what about fuck Dunleavy for elbowing dudes in the throat? the bulls have been getting away with some dirty shit under the basket. its not like the bucks players are lashing out from nowhere.
For 3DS definitely get Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Zelda: Majora's Mask, and Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. Also Super Smash Bros. and any of the available Pokemon games.For PS3/PS4 The Last of Us is a MUST. Borderlands 2 for PS3 or get Borderlands: The Handsome Collection for PS4. The Uncharted series for PS3 is also amazing.
yeah, I agree that it typically requires some real stretching to make it fit.  To be really convincing they would need to take a random sampling of the sermons of Joseph Smith's day with some kind of similar context and show that those kinds of themes aren't prevalent.

Mix of: data, design and mailing of the voting materials (nice, full colour with big enough pictures of the flags), collection, counting, admin...then rinse and repeat for the second round. Plus a healthy dose of public sector inefficiency.

you can upgrade in germany. Meaning if you decide against highest tier, you just finish your current and go to the next. Oh and it's not based on grades. They give you a recommendation but you can still do whatever you want. 
I want to add to this, since I pretty much agree with everything you said. The worst thing that can happen is carting and ending up with your health bar below the threshold for being one-shot. Either eat to get the Felyne Foodie skill or bring max/ancient potions and Adamant Seeds to keep your stats in an acceptable range.Best of luck, OP, and have fun with Dalamander. Ukanlos is gonna be your next challenge, and he's difficult to solo for a  whole 'nother reason.
"I want to put him in a cage at the bottom of the ocean" another teacher talking about a 7th grader who, in all fairness, was awful. When I first started this kid would raise his hand every day at the beginning of class, and when called on just say " fuck you" to me... He wanted to get sent out to the principal's office, and I was happy to oblige.

Also, it's mixed in fl studio and I have the project file and associated recordings. You can have that too if you want.

Recently got to dia after ~12 seasons or some shit in plat. The difference was I started hotkey one of my hatches to keep tabs on inject timing. Once I had to inject, I just fell into my routine: Inject, units, overlords, creep. The linchpin was remembering that I had to inject at all, the rest was automated. Constantly checking my inject timing has helped me a lot in my past ~100 games 
hmmm, well depends, the best cloths would probably be Mira Cloths or berrus cloths, but those cut down your health and Kai, If you don't want your health or ki to be lowered could always do a mixture of cloths that boost and un-boost different stats, like wear two pieces that +strike and strike supers by 4 and then lower ki supers and another attribute by 4, and then like, wear two pieces that boost Ki Supers and like Ki by 5 and then lower strike and strike supers by 5 so it kind of evens out in the end to all your Stats

The most useful keymapping I've yet discovered is mapping the [, ], and \ keys to the (loop start+clip start), (loop length) and (loop toggle) buttons in the clip edit view. That way you can record a long clip of yourself jamming on top of a loop and then listen back to it and then just grab a up a portion of it for later editing as you're listening.I also like having a locator markers every 8 bars in the arrangement view (I just save a template set with markers on it already). Then you can bind keys to the "next/prev" locator buttons and use them to scrub through your arrangement by section instead of using the mouse/playhead tool.

What about people who can't afford to hire people like you? They should just hope to get fans and exposure some other way? This is just how the world works now dude. 
I try to stick to about 2-3 games at a time. Usually, 2 "story based" and more intensive games, and a third is usually retro and simple, like a platformer. So...Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D - About to do the Water Temple (ugh.. Love the game, but the last two dungeons are a pain in the ass lol)Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360) - Been slow due to work. Just completed my first heist... Very FUN gameRandom Old School Games - I recently bought a Retron 5, and since it is very sensitive to dirty games (and my collection hasn't been thoroughly cleaned in a while) I've been just cleaning my games and testing various ones on the Retron without committing to any one in particular. Now that they're all clean... This weekend I begin playing DuckTales on NES!
I went with Nyx. Mana burned Naga out of the lane, popped a mango and assisted in first blood. Got an Aghanims, found out it is better than I expected as you can burrow and unburrow without mana cost or cooldown. So in fact you are still mobile. Carapace inside Vendetta is also the greatest thing ever. Now you can apply both Carapace and Vendetta Strike on elusive heroes like Storm and Puck.
They have to bring Galahad back. The first movie didn't take itself seriously so they don't even need *that* convincing a reason for him to still be alive.

You're an idiot and people like you are the reason they do this shit (they think everybody's racist and a bunch of shit like that). Before you selectively listen, I'm talking about the fact that you brought up the fact that blacks commit most of the violent crimes to support your claim that minorities are the root of Americas problems. Violent crime is not Americas #1 or even #20 issue. Does this look like a third world country?
Everybody has to work up to the potential pay of their career field (and have to prove themselves to do it, not just hit par). Everybody has to buy their own work clothes (and NYPD gets a uniform allowance, as that link shows). Most people in America who make that much don't get overtime, and most people period don't get as much paid vacation as the NYPD and don't have pension plans that are as generous. The point remains, NYPD officers are well compensated relative to their qualifications.
What is up with the stream on NFL.com? Where's Mayock? Why are they not in the theater itself? Why are they only showing two guys talking in some studio and only show the draft announcements by Goodell?

&gt; Downvoting should be used as "this comment doesn't contribute to the discussion".Ironically you're saying he should be downvoted for pointing out that the content of the article doesn't contribute anything new to the discussion.The site doesn't have less a right to be linked, but several threads containing the exact same info is redundant and "doesn't contribute to the discussion". Maybe if they were the first to be linked or if it contained something the others didn't, otherwise it's just flooding the subreddit with nearly identical news pieces and squashing other discussions.
Go see a doc. Do not pass Go, do not collect $200. That kind of thirst is almost always something. It's a symptom of a lot of things, the most common is diabetes. But in my case, it was the major symptom of a pituitary tumor (which sucks to get but is not nearly as bad as it sounded when the doc said, "um, you have a large tumor on your pituitary gland...") Definitely see your doc.
Plus, if you're single and you don't have the following attributes:1) Face valued as 8.5/102) Arms that don't look like tree trunks3) Penis at least 6.5 inches4) Don't smell like what some describe as "god"...whatever that meansThan you're single life is going to stay the same forever.

It's definitely not losing balance. The rider clearly lost grip, probably due to either braking or attempting to swerve. But losing balance isn't how one "falls" on a motorcycle. Losing balance would just mean swerving unpredictably, unless traction is also lost.
This is true but I feel playing against other master players and still holding that win rate means he is indeed better than lets say a d2 player with 200 games and a 70% win rate. Im sure his win rate will decrease but itll still be much higher than nost people. 
More a /r/videography question than an editing question, but what's happening is your shutter speed is too high. You're able to see the flash because of [persistence of vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) but modern CCD and CMOS cameras do *not* operate in that way. So if your camera is running at a shutter speed of say 1/2000 it's only taking in light for one two thousandth of a second, and that flash might be happening in the other 1999^(th)s of a second, and persisting for less than a frame.If you can knock it down to the 1/60 range you might be able to make it happen, but that'd require an extremely small aperture to make it happen. 1/30 would be better. The problem is then that you're losing a lot of crispness in your motion, and introducing more motion blur.
You know what I want? Daily heroic modifiers. Finish the mission under 20 minutes, solar weapons only, no double jumping, crits do more damage, maintain A K/d ratio, limit weapon changes. Just something to make the same missions we've run over and over  and over again more fun. Same could apply to strike playlists too. Start a ROC strike with random new heroic modifiers, with scaling rewards depending on how many you adhere to. 
&gt; Even as I started playing, I'm thinking "wait, who is this jersey shore bro?" I feel ya. That's what I thought too. And I'll admit most of the time I went down there to talk to him, I was like "This is it, this is where it goes downhill." But it never happened.Now whenever I play I go down there because he's an interesting character....Would James/Garrus/Shep be the ultimate broteam?
I argue that this isn't the fault of the writer it's just that these meme jokes require either strict context or, more commonly, strict lack of context to actually be funny. When you're expecting them they're not actually funny because they're barely punchlines without premises.
It is a lot harder than not being a minority. A lot of those things pain me very deeply as well, and I'm not saying that your feelings are any less valid than mine, but I try not to let it overcome me. Sometimes it does because of a mood swing or something bad happening, but most of the time I can choose to focus on the good.I know you're strong enough to get through this.
I feel like I have a million, but somehow don't know what to ask.  Uhh... are most of these patients homeless?  Will they even get that care you just described, or cursorily pushed back out onto the streets?
Murder. Usually taken more seriously, unless it's male on male murder in low income areas (which is a vast majority of murder). Child molestation is taken more seriously. Terrorism is taken more seriously. Other than that, I can't imagine what is taken more seriously. 
Lots of allies I don't really know, collect all their stuff every day. Also I try to do the missions based on which task I am working on. Further, if I am doing Spec Ops research, I don't play the Spec Ops missions until it's done. ISOs also drop from some fights. It's a slow strategy.
That makes the old testament conveniently irrelevant, although it does contradict what the Book of Matthew clearly states.  There are a lot of apologetics devoted to getting around Matthew, but the intent is clear in the context of the entire book.How do you rationalize not following rules set out in the New Testament?  Also, modern Christians don't seem overly concerned with the relaxed standard set of rules set out in Acts.  Eating meat from sacrifices is not a problem in modern society, but most modern Christians are not even aware of the blood and strangled meat restrictions.  They are widely ignored.  Modern Christians are hung up on  sexual issues, but only the homosexual forms of sex generate serious outrage. Other forms of sexual immorality may be verbally renounced, but infractions are commonly ignored in everyone except teenagers.

I haven't played for 6 months, I went through the process of lvling to 70 by myself plenty times and I just don't wanna do it anymore, when I start this game again at a new season, I just wanna get lvl 70 ASAP and farm my shit. You probably did this post because of my post earlier. Still bitching around huh? I asked for a powerlevel, yes. Oh and guess why I cannot give you a powerlevel in return? You are right, I simply CAN'T. My 70 crusader still walks around with yellow crap gear and I wanted my friend to farm with me at lvl 70 thus asking for someone to spare 30 minutes of his time. Then some retard people kept telling me that I could easily plevel him because I already have a 70 char, guess what after hitting lvl 50-60 it will take hours to lvl up. So stop your bullshit, because there are actually nice people out there who will help guys out who need some quick boost.
I'm willing to pay hundreds for shitty sticks in all my games. For me a game is never truly complete with out a huge shit in it. It's why the Digimon games are my favourite games of all time.
It's a lot easier in metric:1 tonne = 1000 kg1000 kg x 9.8 = 9800 newtonsHence 9800 watts at 1n/W (which I agree is very optimistic). I think your calculation was off by a factor of 10 somewhere.
Well that's a limitation the devs put on themselves. I would imagine that remaking a map takes significantly less time than designing an entirely new one and creating it, so I honestly don't see why they couldn't do both.

I married my first love at 20. 18yrs later we are still married, happy and very much in love. BUT, I would never recommend it to anyone else. Take your time, wait until you're older.
Oh God, so right.My SO is 25 and his ex girlfriend is 18. She was a fucking nightmare for months when him and I started dating. She would call him nonstop, send him selfies and threats, I had to delete all of my social media accounts because she would message me and threaten me, she was the typical High School bitch who was out to get me with all of her little girl friends...Seriously OP, I agree that "love doesn't age", but there's just a really, really big gap in life/responsibility between ages 19 and 25, much bigger than say, 30 and 40. It's obvious you're looking for something serious with someone who wants the same, and picking someone who already has their life settled and who knows what their goals are will be very benificial to your next relationship(s). You're obviously a very smart guy, and I know you've learned from your mistake. Keep going strong !
I have only dealt with iPledge 2 or 3 times, but I am pretty sure they totally fucked it up the first time.

I don't understand why you seem to find it difficult to believe that an average "hard working" individual could find being a vegetarian to be practical.  
I LOVE cameos.  I have a somewhat similar story from my brother's wedding this weekend. My eldest brother died of a heroin overdose in 2011. My family sees him in butterflies and so, my younger brother released a set of monarchs at the end of his ceremony. As both my parents sat there watching, one of them landed right in my palm. There were so many tears. 
Meditation is actually very smart to do while coming up. (I've never tried meditating before a come up, but from my meditation experience this is my thoughts) Dxm allows you to "leave" your body, while enhancing certain thoughts and enhancing sounds. If you are adept at meditation, you could start right after you dose (which could help combat nausea and "the rush" occasionally felt) and before you know it, your traditional method of meditation is interrupted by weird thoughts and swirling geometric space awesome dextroverse ships, ect. Whereas, if you're an amateur you could start roughly 40-20 minutes after your initial dose. At best, if you have a hard time keeping a full meditative state, start meditating as soon as you feel something. This is a smart idea and might be a link to starting doses off much higher than normal without the side effects. I will test this out next trip. Thank you. 
Yeah but usually to get in you have to have an ID or a fitness plan of some sort, and they have a person at the entrance who would stop you if you tried to make off with equipment.

I'm assuming it must be a case where it can't be injured any further, so they're letting him just have fun with it.  My main question/concern is about what kind of pain he's in to swing like that and how he's even capable of performing such an act with that type of injury.  I know very little about such things.
&gt; Nike was willing to exchange them. I just haven't gotten around to shipping them inI feel like I should note this takes a really long time. Usual amount is close to 6 months for Nike, a bit less for Adidas and Puma, but still not good. Edit: See comment chain below.

One of my favorite days in high school was during the WGI Finals, and I was grabbing lunch with my old, about-to-retire band director. I was in the drumline, but I had caught a helluva case of mono and was out of action for about a month, so I couldn't practice enough to perform well, so I had dropped out of the line, but I still wanted to cheer them on so I was at all of their performances, and I'd always go with/hang out with the band director who didn't really do anything besides have a few beers and chill out.I heard so many stories about acid and LSD and ecstasy in the 60's because him and his wife were massive hippies. It was fucking amazing. He definitely was the reason I gave LSD and molly a shot in college. Damn, I loved that old man. Looked just like Richard Attenborough.
With all due respect... Hell no! A professional smuggler will never take a job from a customer who asks for your information. Your employment is based off of the reputation of your pseudonym. The only smugglers the Cartel have under their thumb are those who owe them money. Either way, they're not going to touch an American citizen in America. Not worth their money or the risk.

I'm still confused about how the remaining part, downtown, is supposed to work. O'Connor is a one-way street so no matter where they put the lanes there are going to be cyclists going the wrong way. Confusing for pedestrians and also for drivers who are trying to turn onto a cross street. Seems like the other direction of the lane should be on Kent.
Am I the only one that is not sad that the Iron Island's plot has been pushed back? I really didn't care for their part in the books.

It got interesting (finally) toward's the end, but other than that, not sad. 
I can see the Titans hyping it up to get a decent amount of picks, but if they don't get that ridiculous number than they take their guy.  Chip has the trade in place with the Raiders already.  
Nope. Tywin already suspected them of playing their little plots and he, not Stannis, are the type of men that you can play easily. Stannis would also have Davos on the small council so he would have a faithful friend to watch over the two slimy manipulators. Tywin would have Kevan Lannister on the council who would do a similar job for him.

If you do play on it, at first you'll have no idea where your goalie is while you try and watch the other players.Just keep at er'.
So far, with /r/fireteams, every team I've been in has stuck with the group until the end unless we weren't able to make it past a certain CP in enough tries, or if they had to leave unexpectedly. Otherwise, no matter the rewards, the team has stayed until the end, and even if they were looking for a specific raid weapon and didn't get it, it has usually worked out for them in the end(for example, 1 person needed Praedyth's Timepiece and didn't get it, but ended up getting Thunderlord at the very end)
We may be upper class, but we worked very hard for it. My husband is an engineer (first generation college student, put himself through college, poor parents) and I work in biotech (put myself through college for undergrad and masters, lower middle class parents, currently working on phD). We don't need to worry about childcare costs nor insurance. I don't think we need to be punished for that. I never said I think looks are the most important thing. It is just the only thing I'm worried about, most of the other issues we have resolved.

Thanks for the clarification. I already have a 16" and a 20" DI AR-15. I built this one because it seemed interesting/fun/different.  I also don't mind pinning and welding muzzle breaks. I have a ton of pins and a drill press/welder/dremel/etc. in my garage.
Letty's is the West Side's best kept secret! I love being seated immediately after walking by all the people waiting in $40 brunch lines. Their artisanal heuvos divorciados breakfast is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in Providence! The chips and salsa are somehow perfect for breakfast and the delicious cookie provided with the coffee is a great touch.
Right, but the point was that the LEDs arent available in as narrow of bandwidths as he was requesting. So filters would allow him to narrow his spectrum.
I can understand it from both the casino's side and the guest's side, as to why it's beneficial to have both digital and actual.For the casinos, it's one less dealer to have to pay/train/keep an eye on.For the guests, not everyone is a people person. And not everyone should be allowed near dealers. Ever.
She feels great, especially with her Signature and it's chance for proc effects.Damage is awesome. Visuals are awesome. Her rotation feels more fluid now. For me, she safely feels top 15 (probably even top 10 -- more than likely) now for sure.
Always worth a visit to see what they say. If they can narrow it down, at least you will have an answer.MLB = Main Logic Board. Apple's terminology for the motherboard.
i mean when i pitched i was always told to back up 1st and 3rd on a throw to the base no matter the play and always crash home on a wild pitch and back up home on a throw but thats not gonna happen anymore with how mlb players play now 
* Some will say, the best routine is the one you stick to. But there's more to a routine than just consistency. A bodyweight-routine should have progression exercises in it.  So when you could do 3 sets of 8-12reps of an exercise, you move onto the next exercise.  So over the weeks and months, you'll be doing the "same" routine but the exercises change and increase in difficulty to match up to your strength increases.* Without further ~~adieu~~ ado, I present to you this subreddits routine which is perfect for beginners or even intermediates new to bodyweight fitness: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine* That same routine is also hosted on https://fitloop.co/routines/bwf-recommended-beginner-routine if you want maximum ease of use, but it's not run by the mods.* By the way, this is all addressed in the FAQ, read it next time you post or risk getting your thread removed. CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY. :-P
Many years ago I was in the same situation as you. I kept the extra money and bought a car or vodka or whatever. That money acquired interest and capitalized and what not and I eventually had to pay back way more money than what was loaned to me. My suggestion is to use it to pay off your highest interest student loans. That being said-- what interest rate are these loans? If they're stupidly low it may make sense to do something else with them.
Because somehow you think being a thug negates the idea that his life was a life of business.  Is Bernie Madoff any less of a businessman because he's a thieving piece of shit?  Nope.  Still a businessman.  Black and White doesn't exist.
It bothers me and I have finals this week and next week so I'm in a cycle of study then regret then study then regret and then ensure my parents that I'm not dead because I didn't reply to their texts and calls haaaaa
*Looking at the box that Kris found and inspects it. She also pulls out a .308 from a pocket in her dress to check if it can fit inside, just to make sure. Feeling comfortable with it, Amai started to look for another .303 caliber box.* "Is there another one here somewhere? Might be a good idea to get one more just in case if I get dust infused ones."
I just got a new TomTom gps for my car the other day and set the voice to an Australian guy. When I heard this my face lit up like a Christmas tree and I smile everytime I hear it.
Hmm.. I don't actually know, but don't a lot of people who buy non dairy milks want no dairy, typically for lactose intolerance? This product seems to miss the point a bit.
Thank you for your very thoughtful comment. It means a lot. Maybe I should be more upfront from the get-go and perhaps people would be understanding. You have a great attitude. And yes, I believe everyone ought to feel right in their own bodies and should do whatever is right for them. This was my path and I'm very happy I went through it but I know it's not for everyone so all I ask is for a little understanding. :) 
Oops! Yes D7200!. And thanks. According to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27ogei_LWJ0 I might enjoy the older lens as forests are often rather low light. 
Actually I'm pretty sure lanfear was manipulating him, at least by the end. Either her or moghedien. He's rather explicitly visited by the glowing floating "dragon reborn" at one point, who gives him the official order to kill perrin. 
Game of Thrones - Basically it's set in a place called Westeros (sp?) which has snow, dragons and mammoths. Sean Bean is in (Ned Stark?) but gets his head cut off, Daenarys is queen or something and can control dragons, married to someone (Kal Drogo?) who is part of a different species, there is this guy called Hodor who can only say his own name, there is this androgynous child/big hairy man partnership, there is something called the Red Wedding where Filch from Harry Potter stabs a pregnant woman, Tyrion is a dwarf who was apparently more disfigured in the books and likes blowjobs, George R.R. Martin takes about three years to write a single paragraph, the show is overtaking the books, which sounds really stupid and means I am very unlikely to ever watch the show.
Same here. I almost exclusively watch RT content on their site. There really isn't a need for me to watch it on youtube anymore, especially with all of the sponsor perks recently. 
It's still being signed because some users are having battery issues with 8.3 and the Apple Watch.  When we see another revision of 8.3 (if, I'm assuming we will) 8.2 will likely stop being signed quickly.
I find them fairly attractive, although I prefer more of an hourglass figure than most of these women have. It helps that they are painted very carefully and in a generally idealized way. One or two of them seem to have kinda small boobs for the chubbiness level, but I don't care so much about that. All of them look nice. 
Nosh was saying the issue is the forms **X is the name given to Y**. Taking your nutty track, Zen does not begin with so-called **chan-zong** (Zen lineage) texts. There is no Zen canon as you allege. The term **chan-zong** didn't become used until the 9th century, way after the character Bodhidharma. So you are lying again.Shakyamuni was not illiterate, either. Gautama learned to read at seven.  He went to a writing school (*lipishâlâ*) and studied under the teacher, *Vishvâmitra*. You're wrong again ewk.
Check out the wiki article: http://wabbitwiki.com/wiki/Relationships_with_rabbitsThere's sections for cats and dogs.I would keep your rabbit segregated in a room with the door closed if you're not home. The other animals can still injure it through the bars if they really wanted to.
HA, no. My dad is 65 and still goes on a run every morning and does muscle building every Tuesday/Friday/Sunday. Before I moved out, my family would go on runs and hikes together. Having a child is *not* excuse for women OR men to let themselves go.
The build you posted is a solid mid-range gaming build. Calling it "entry level" is misleading at best, and disingenuous at worst. A $450-$500 build is more accurately an entry level system.
Great ball movement and off-ball movement lead to open looks and Bulls knocked them down.  Dunleavy with 19 points.Gasol was lights out in the first.Bulls forced turnovers and limited their own.Giannis tackled Dunleavy.
That literally means nothing. They're two completely different projects from Riot, there is no reason they couldn't join the two in any way they decide. Launching the skin changes literally means nothing for how they might decide to use it with anything. 
I guess poor ethnic minorities is what I was looking for. But as for the rest of your points I have to sincerely ask if you understand the context in which I was talking about them. I was talking about the way reactionary people talk about a drug "culture", "culture of poverty", etc to talk about ethnic minorities. You can see how clumsy it gets without a short descriptors like "people of color" and "ethnic minorities." But like I said I'm not generally trying to group them together and blur any distinction, but in this case the one thing they DO have in common is the way they are talked about by reactionaries. Like I said, I understand and agree with your point in general, but in this instance I think you are reaching and either misunderstanding or trying to be offended. 
What a beautiful animal. I currently have a French Bulldog which is like having a clown with a flatulence problem making you laugh 24-7. I'd like to get a larger dog like yours as a friend how is the shedding and help on that breed? looks so happy you just have to love dogs
[Terry](http://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/30qb29/terry_black_son_of_dionysus/) was wandering around when he spotted the battered guy. He rushed over with a concerned look."Oh my gosh! Are you okay?!"
Ah. Any thoughts of the chances of us getting it tonight? Or at least a blog post?I don't understand why Matt insists on posting stuff like that and acting like he is a Valve employee/oracle when he gets the banners from stuff like store banners. 
Politics is a scam, your vote has no power just the illusion of power. I am forced between two choices; compliance or imprisonment, if I refuse to pay high taxes that are wasted on aristocratical government spending or on lazy dullards who sit on their asses all day. " Democracy is two wolves and one lamb deciding what to have for lunch"- Benjamin Franklin.
yea it was kinda funny, I got a battle trophy of 5 backup 163s on the game right before this one. Only problem is that the 163 is my only jet, so I only play RB with it haha.
Got my first one sub 100 hours and now 300 hours with playtime and I have three of them. Needless to say my clan hates me! Although I do have one friend that has had four drop and two of those we're both yesterday!
I am really bummed about this!! I wish I had some warning so I could have taken screenshots of my playlists I've built up over the years. I don't suppose Grooveshark will allow us to log in just to see our playlists even if there is no music service? Probably too much to hope for. :'(
I would say to just try them both, like 10 matches with thresh, then 10 matches with leona.Like everybody says, thresh is harder to play, so if you want to specialize with him, then you'll have to make room for plenty of practice.
Now that I think about it, the kind of contempt I used to have for Steam nine or ten years ago is basically the exact same sort of irritation I still have these days when games insist I install and play them through Origin or UPlay. 
You're at least starting off in a good place! But, seriously get a job. You're one minor accident away from having that paid off car be inoperable because you have no savings to fix it. Also, employers like hiring people who work, even if it is waiting tables, or being a garbage man. You have a degree, so keep looking for positions in your field, and use this time to show on your resume to future employers that you aren't afraid to work. There are always ways to spin what you do and relate it to what you hopefully will be doing one day in an interview. Get out there, YA BUM!!! :)

Yes, and the hugest so far. It's in Closed Beta at the moment, and will be live in a month or so. They are introducing new act, jewel system (there are jewel sockets here and there around the passive tree, which you can modify by jewels, which drop and can be affected by crafting as your average loot), the whole big rebalance and many new gems, divination cards that allow you to farm for specific items, lots of Quality of Life improvements such as Item Filter and, of course, they are fixing desync, which is the biggest deal for many people, myself included.Did I miss something? Probably, the expansion is really immense. Don't forget that the game is completely free, which makes it even more outstanding.
I guess it might have something to do with the fact that the Shield Tablet uses a 32-bit Tegra K1 while the Nexus 9 uses a 64-bit K1.But Google is so bad at communicating to its customers, I don't think we'll ever know the answer.
There once was a man from Peru,Who dreamed he was eating his shoe,he awoke with a fright,in the middle of the night,to find that his dream had come true!
But like, I've started: Naruto, Digimon, FMA:B, Yu-Gi-Oh, and One Piece. And maybe others, idk I'm pretty stoned. Point is, I feel bad and should feel bad for having seen Dragonball, DBZ twice, and reading the manga. All before I finished one other anime. FMA:B is only like 70 episodes!
I thought blood coagulated in the stomach making brown/black chunks as opposed to brown/black liquid.Looks to me like he just ate too much before his match and suffered the consequences. I've been there after thinking "Yeah, two cups of black coffee is a suitable breakfast before mountain biking!"]I could easily be wrong on both accounts though.
&gt; doesn't even grow in the US or CanadaAt the grocery store I go to, depending on the year a large portion of the stuff doesn't come from Canada/US. I see things from Chile, Argentina, Spain, Morocco, etc. pretty often. Though if you were going local you'd be pretty limited in the winter (Canada). 
That (quite literally) last minute goal in the United vs Chelsea game, didn't matter in the end but ffs we should have won that match.Obviously PSG at home, led twice, only to witness two of the best fucking headers I think I've ever seen. With hindsight, going out the CL actually saved us a lot of hassle by missing out:QPR -Barcelona -Man United -Barcelona -ArsenalImagine having to deal with that schedule all within 14 days, with Drogba as our only striker. 
I may represent a small percentage of the LoL community, but I can say firmly I am done with playing this game due to this change.I have played since season 1. Various accounts, all on free time and I never really cared about ranked. Just wanted to play with friends. In the limited amount of free time I have, mostly no more than an hour which forced me to quit other games in favor of this one, I am now reduced to playing ARAMs almost exclusively if i want to play more than 1 match.Giving everyone a true dmg poke combined with a follow up at lvl 1? That is just unbalancing. Some champions are nothing without their ability to poke and kite.
I think everything that you can get by gameplay is not pay to win. Yes you can get it faster, or all the way by paying reallife money, but thats completely optional and it's your choice to do so.I do not consider buying bonds with ingame money is paying to win, cause you earn the ingame wealth through gameplay.
I just came back from watching AoU. I wonder how 2x20 is going to be, there where not a lot of worldwide destructions. Or anything that could influence AoS. [Spoiler](/Except for the helicarrier)
Look, the game isn't even close to being finished. It's not beneficial for us to argue at this point. We're just wasting our time. We shall see who is right when the time comes.
Hello dietetics student! I'd recommend, in that case, that you start with Death by food pyramid, Rethink Food, Salt Sugar Fat, or Eat to Live. Then you can move on to the hundreds more fascinating books. I seriously read 2-3 new nutrition books per month (trying to sort the good ones from the bad ones) and am not even close to running out. I think the ones that use a critical thinking perspective towards research are the strongest. Perhaps I'd move on to Whole, Fat Chance, What to Eat, and Food Rules after those original ones. :) if you have Netflix, watch Fed Up and Forks Over Knives.But those are just my personal opinions -- read through the other suggestions in this thread too. Dietitians vary greatly.
As an LGBT Canadian who had to endure hordes of American baptists being bused in by Canadian churches to scream at me on Parliament Hill in 2005 about the immorality of my orientation while they enjoyed their interracial marriage without an *iota* of irony, and having lived in the country since marriage equality became law and the sky didn't fall I couldn't give 2 shits what Christians want or think.They're an obstacle to be crushed by the law with absolutely no mercy. Do not hesitate, do not give any quarter. Sue, protest, march or riot if you have to.Sweep them the fuck aside and consign them to the garbage can of history.

It would be the most dickish move *ever* for the Chargers to say that they told Philip's agent they weren't trading him and they working toward extension only for them to trade him. I.WILL.RIOT. I'm still nervous.
I beg to differ, while hard work is way more important, intelligence is still pretty important. For example, look at the American Mathematics Contest grade 12. These are the problems for this year: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2015_AMC_12A_Problems.According 55833 students took the 12A. The passing score to take the next round was a 99/150.(top 5%) Less than 1900 10th, 11th and 12th graders got a 99 or above, most of these people are advanced enough to even take this test, so most have taken Algebra 1, Geometry and Algebra 2, most are in Pre-Calculus or higher, they have the abilities to solve most of these problems besides the number theory ones. school math is not real math. real math requires intelligence, skill and some talent.
There's a very fine line for me between pleasantly light-headed and flat-out sick to my stomach when it comes to nicotine.  And I have to say there has only been one *brand* of cigars that has ever made me sick. Every time.  Room 101.  I'm not gonna say they are bad cigars, because I've heard people give them a lot of praise, but out of the 4 different varieties I've tried, I've been out for the rest of the evening every time.   Same thing has happened to a friend of mine, and both of us smoke cigars on a regular basis, so it's not like the nicotine is a new thing to us.
I have a huge respect for nurses or women in health related fields. I genuinely want to date (and hopefully marry) one. I have very little respect for people who don't learn or work hard.
There are no federal laws regarding mileage reimbursement.  The bottom line is that you need to make $9.00 an hour while on the road, after tips and reimbursements are added in.  
Yep this is starting to get ridiculous actually. Ordered for the first time in a couple months and the sites downtime over the last couple days ruined my order for the weekend.
Because I've tried to recreate as many dream teams as I can think of, but when I actually have those players and build the exact same team like for instance Ronaldo switching him as a ST with 7 chem even though it shows up as only 5 chem. You'll see what I mean when or if you do buy TOTY Ronaldo.Personally, I like Messi more than Ronaldo in real life and I had so much fun playing with his TOTY, but when I tried TOTY Ronaldo, he just surprised me how much of a monster he is to me. 
I had the fidelity amex previously, but now I use the capital one double cash card. Too many places I go don't take amex, so I switched as soon as I could. And the fidelity MM account is just one more additional thing to deal with. Just get the capital one card instead.
Thin market, you say? [Still, 42% is 42%. That's real savings](http://www.amazon.com/Matfer-Bourgeat-DUCK-CARCASS-PRESS/dp/B000KEJS22)    My favorite thing about tha is that they call it a duck *carcass* press to avoid any confusion.
Nintendo consoles, Platinum Games, arcade fightsticks, YouTube, the internet, the computer, Dennaton Games, MPB, TotalBiscuit, Terraria, osu!, the Doppler Effect, TWEWY, Persona 4 and cells.
IMO he's mostly right because "in the same house" is kind of an arbitrary place to draw the line; I think "in the conscious presence" is where the line of weirdness lies. You go to bed early, he stays up and watches porn on headphones in the other room while you're snoozing: No problem. You go to bed early, he watches porn in bed while you read a chapter of a book before going to sleep: Weird. You go to bed early, he stays up and watches porn in the other room but with the volume up so you can hear it: Weird. Edit: Also, he should be required to use private browsing/incognito mode for all porn because you're not the only one who might use that computer. The fact that he didn't is the weirdest part of your story. 
It is odd everytime they show it without it, its like they are self conscious lol but some say its the designer/photo editor.Watchface looks great on her! I removed it,haha
I would get involved with a guild, I know I'm starting one with 5-6 of my buddies, I myself a PC player (missed transfer but know a lot of game stuff). If you're interested in joining feel free to PM me. Otherwise, I would just go in blind, that's honestly the best play to play an elder scrolls game. I started playing around with my NB early on and found a pvp build I like. Turns out that maybe a week after that sypher came out with an almost identical 2h build for NB. You can naturally discover what abilities and passives work best for your playstyle, so just have fun with it. 
I read and studied constantly. I was the ward "scriptorian." I think I read the BoM 20 times or so. I loved the bible. TBMs don't actually study the scriptures in depth. They are spoon fed in their meetings. 
I may get down-voted like crazy for this, but imo the GVG map is probably the least exciting. Yeah, the rocket is big and flashy when you set it off, but then it's just gone forever, and the laser doesn't do much besides poke your opponent (catapult is somehow a bit more satisfying for this). The transmogrifier or whatever COULD be really cool, but it doesn't seem like you can interact much with the stuff it creates. The fireworks are ok... no complaints there really.My favorite maps are the ones where you can break or manipulate a shit ton of small things. Kripp called out the gems as being among the best, and he's definitely right there. Overall, I'd rank Stormwind the highest, even with the griffin nerf.But yeah.... I spend waaay more time thinking about this than I should.
First of all the NFL is not the most popular sport. Nor is it more popular than boxing. There's several other sports more popular than NFL. The fan base has a lot to do with the income of the atheletes. 
It's not like it's taking funding away from a charity. Who cares. It's just something people who don't really deserve it nominated themselves to in order to boost their egos anyway. 
I think one thing that really kicks you in the balls when you hear the story is that Senna had an Austrian flag in his car that he had planned to unveil at the finish line 
Maybe, but you don't want it to be too easy or it will be too op and unbalance the gameplay. What if the aiming schematics changed to that of the dmr or something similar? Without scope of course.

I think we should move just to take away any questions about it. And I love that damn name.Also: rwjehs, you're doing a stand up job. Said it before and I'll say it again. Keep it up!
there are many factories who sell this action camera. I myself buy from this one: http://top-tech.net.cn/ But the MOQ is around 500 pieces. PM me if you need a contact. cheers
If you buy this game do not go in expecting a serious story. The first half is great. It's intriguing and well written. Then I can only assume the writer died and was replaced with a 6 year old child 5 minutes before the deadline. The last few hours are hilarious, though I suspect not intentionally. It's certainly worth the money if you know what you're expecting.
And if I were to say something absurd like "I hate when anorexics don't eat." I guess we should get them professional help by taking pictures of them when they are walking in public and then humiliate them by trying to come up with the best jokes so we can get fake internet points without ever actually talking to the person.
Lol sadly  I was already out of HS by the time the show came out, but Im friends with him on facespace now and he'll put up pictures of him and he looks damn close to the guy from the show
Your diet is ultimately your decision but I know that more and more athletes are going low carb.  I know a few top basketball players have done very well on it.  Here in Australia, a number of cricketers have also gone low carb with great success.Before you make a decision, you might want to check out Phinney and Volek's Art and Science of Low Carb Performance.  It's specifically geared to athletes.  I also agree that the ketogains sub is a great source of information.Congrats and good luck with your career!
If anything, Bernie's VP choice will be an extremely hot topic. His age is constantly refereed as a weakness, so whoever he chooses as VP would have to be his spiritual successor and not just the next in line.
I'm putting this right now. I don't think James will pan out with the bucs. I think Marcus would benefit from a team like the Seahawks in Tennessee I don't see that happening. 
Thanks!  Yeah, I accidentally made a few misspelling's in that one. (I'm not a morning person.)  Will be uploading a corrected version to my Deviant Art
That's stupid. SF 5's art style looks fine the way it is. If Capcom developed the look of SF 5 in the same way ASW did for Xrd (and made it animate as well as SF 3, as you hinted), then SF 5 would end up looking just like Xrd, but with more frames. There would be no individuality.
&gt; It doesn't matter how many albums I've listened to. Tupac is no where near the role model Neil Degrasse Tyson is. Are you &gt; fucking kidding me?&gt; Historically Black Colleges and Universities doesn't mean shit.When humans have a preconceived notion about something we have a strong tendency to try to confirm our beliefs. When rather we should try our best to disprove something, to make it absolute. This is called confirmation bias, something Neil Degrasse Tyson (and the rest of the scientific community) would be very much against. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKA4w2O61Xo) offers a great example.Now you've given me a hypothesis but you refuse to try to disprove/test it. If you dismiss this then you are clearly not a fan of science, logic, or Neil Degrasse Tyson.
The Eagles come to Carolina next year (where i live). You guys don't. I want to watch Mariota play next year. Also, i don't have a favorite NFL team, i just like watching.

Superstore is great. Consistent prices. Often cheapest. 30% off day old veg, bread, meats. Mikes independent is like superstore, different sales at times, their day old stuff is 50% off. (Meats still 30%)If you want organic/local food boxes you can check out body fuel organics, you can pay a fee and get variety. Google them. There's also a program called good food box, similar to weekly boxes of food at body fuel, but they're at a cost and highly recommended by those who use it. The farmers market is in full swing now. Wednesday and Saturday mornings downtown. There's also Costco, and for a membership you can get deals at times. The real Canadian wholesale club on 4th and has decent deals too. Lots of options! Good luck!

My mother taught public school for 30 years and I never heard her talk trash about students. I've even had a few drinks with her and her co-workers and they hardly ever talked about work at all. I doubt the alleged information your teachers were giving was unsolicited. If my girlfriend (esl instructor) told me a kid was going to be a failure in life, I'd ask why she would even tell me that. 
Which one of those calls her stupid and says that it was her responsibility to avoid being attacked?I mean I'll admit they they are shitty comments, but most of them are either saying "The girl wanted it at the time, why is it the guys' fault" (which is probably because they didn't know/think she was actually unconscious). Since these kinds of comments are "on basically anything, ever", I'll give you another shot to link me to one though. Preferably an actual comment and not a partial, cropped screenshot with no context.
here are some of my favorite healthier munchies: * popcorn (although try to avoid the super buttery varieties). * roasted seaweed (this often comes in little snack packs so you don't overdo it. they're super salty tasting too so they're perfect for munchie attacks). * veggies with nut butter, greek yogurt, or homemade ranch dip (sour cream mixed with one of those hidden valley ranch spice packets). * frozen berries in the summertime are a great alternative to candy.* i dunno if you have a trader joe's nearby, but they have these plantain chips that are really good. sometimes i tend to go overboard on those though.. they're so good..anyway, hope that helps! congrats on your progress so far!
Just FYI, most credit cards offer a service similar to this.  It used to be something special to AmEx cards but these days it's much easier to find a card with similar perks.
I just wish there was more game to play than there is. I wonder if Sony hadn't published it if we would have more content, though with a later release date.
Thanks for the kind wishes it's my last time to vape before I have to take atleast a week beeak.... not happy about that. My goblin came in today so that was pretty cool. Still getting it broken in but I'm most upset because my new juice should be comming tommorrow :(%
Use some blue Loctite on the screws! If you know someone that likes cars or is mechanically inclined, they'll likely have a bottle, as it's not very cheap.
it doesnt even do sheet metal yet.  its good for the novice, fact is you want your IP Protected, and a commercial company doesn't want to be at the mercy of a server stability.
Hi peter, Don't really have a question. Simply wanted to say you tore my heart out. And I hope you do some core magic voodoo shit to solve it or I will not be happy 
If it's still happening in regular cycles, it's a result of the same things that cause a period, you just don't shed your entire uterine lining.There's been women in the clinic who were 5 months pregnant and still had regular periods. That's a *very common* thing in emergency rooms.Pretty much any woman comes into the ED between the ages of 10-50, always get a pregnancy test, just in case.
I have two pairs of Embers, and both have obvious differences in the shades of gray on the heel vs the rest of the shoe. It doesn't always show up well in pictures, and the lighting makes a difference. 
Awesome transmog!! Just out of curiosity, do you think that said would work for a Paladin? Or are the set pieces warrior-exclusive?Also, I'd love to see your Priest transmog!
I would dare say the best answer I can give to this question is simply that the physical world was made for us.  The spiritual world is one in which great, enrapturing pleasure, beyond the ken of physical sensation, can be felt, as well as a terrible emptiness that is equally unknowable.  But, in between those two places there is a lot of nothingness.  Using the Bible as an example, you hear of the glory of Heaven and the fires of Hades, but nothing else.  Here, in the physical world, there is a chance to experience a broad range of sensations, emotions, and situations that help to shape and mould who we are and what we become in this life, and in my belief, beyond.  In this world we are forced to learn, to cope, and to mature in one way or another.  I look at the physical world much like one would a finishing school.
Yes, it's very much worth it in my opinion to fix an original DMG. The best tutorials on this would be to watch youtube videos, as you can see exact handling. Usually it's best to divert to Ebay for replacement parts like that.
My panties are 30.00 for two days wear right now! This does not include extras (hair, cumming, photos, etc) and most extras are 10.00 each! I will also do 2 pairs for 45.00 WITH cum!!! I take giftrocket :)If you don't like stronger smells, don't go for me! The hair really seals it in! My smell and taste do vary a bit though, but usually I am little less sweet, more salty ;) I am also a very wet gal, and most pairs get soaked through in 2 days! PM me for any details!
Debatable, often times hes only allowed to continue his bluffing because the prosecution allows him to for whataver reason. And how many times has he had no response only to have someone burst in with the proper evidence. Honestly i think he'd be held in contempt of court.
OK, yes to enforcement, but keep in mind, it is not against Church teaching to be gay.  And really, you cannot be outright rejected by the Church for a private sinful sexual act (or any other sin.)   The problem is with *public* gay couples.  People out in the open proclaiming their sinfulness.
Alright, guess I'll post my video game comment:What have you guys been playing recently? :3I'm about 12 hours into Zero Escape after finally finishing 999 (got all the endings!) :D And I adore both of them, they're amazing games. I'm so hyped for Punchline to have crazy twists like they do.I've also been playing Demons Souls, although not as much recently. I'm not *that* far into the game, I've defeated almost all of the first bosses, and most of the second, in all worlds except 4.Annnd finally, I just started Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance. It's pretty cool so far, awesome to see the characters from TWEWY.
Alton Brown [recommends](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/dill-pickles-recipe.html) filling a zip-lock bag with leftover brine and using that to weigh the vegetables down. Actual weights are probably better, but if you don't have any the bag works just fine.
Meh.I personally think Fire Emblem 4, Tales of Phantasia, and Star Ocean deserve a spot.I also think Super Mario RPG and Chrono Tirgger should move down a bit as well.
My parents did this to me as a kid, maybe up until I was 8 ish? Wasn't weird at all, not sexual, it was more cute like *muwah* "love you mommy" and ran off to school. Never thought of it as a big deal, everyone does it where we live.
Reading up the story, it looks like the manuscript in question was not a scientific paper, but more  of an opinion piece. Which still requires facts to back up the claim, but things are slightly different. Even more so if the opinion piece is on sexism in academia. I would choose to hold back judgement until I get the full story too.As another has said, this might be more of a case of poorly worded/unnecessary criticism than sexism.
&gt;Maybe they aren't as starkly in contrast as I believe them to be, and I'm simply naive enough to think that it's that simple. I don't think that's the case, but I'd certainly be interested in an account of how the two concepts might properly integrate.My simple way of justifying that claim is just based on the fact thaaaat the things we mostly assume to be of a higher order of intelligence -- from elephants, dolphins and apes on up to humans, they all tend to have wider emotional pallets and ways of expression than the things we consider to have low intelligence, like roaches or bacterium.
How it works is that your body is still the sex it was born, and it will revert to it immediately upon cessation of artificial steroids.  A person born male still has a prostate, and a person born female can still get pregnant despite cutting her hair short and growing roid-whiskers, and a sane person will start vomiting at the entire concept.
Well, oil will still be very relevant for another thirty years at the minimum. Until we can mass-produce synthetic plastics and have the renewable energy grid to support the entire country in electric cars, oil will be relevant, and there's no changing that. There's a reason it's called short term, yes, but candles are a short term light/smell source, and people still buy those non-stop.
It's a roundabout. Traffic entering yields to traffic in the circle. The cop (and truck/boat) were not yielding. The cop especially came in fast and to an abrupt stop past the end of the lines marking his lane. You can see where he loads his front brakes and the nose dips a little. He's not gently braking, it looks like he was going to just follow the boat, until he did see the biker.
The exception to the rule is school or other mass shootings. Every time I see one of those I'm like "please don't be white, please don't be white ... fuck, you're making us all look bad".
I love his shows. The perfect combination of humor, cheesiness (almost campy), and investigative reporting. He actually debunks a lot of what he seeks to investigate which lends a lot of credibility to him. 
I can only imagine how pissed you would be, absolute assholes. That's why we take all of our gear to every show, yeah its a ballache packing and unpacking but I like my stuff and I don't like having to rely on someone's piece of shit bass amp or a crummy drum kit that sounds like a spongebob drum kit. As you can tell, I'm still pretty pissed at those guys tonight. 
That may temper the reality a bit, but if that was the point of the review then it is either poorly written or maliciously edited.  Reviews are notoriously bad in terms of having some useful criticism mixed in with a lot of useless comments to which the authors are expected to respond with a counter comment.  You get a lot of reviewers having a biased view of the work or trying to get their work cited in the paper.  That is just how things work.  But if the excerpted comments are representative, then the reviewer either failed to make their point or clearly crossed the line into flat out sexism.
They look so much better to me than a normal roshe. I see so many guys comparing the too. Good option for summertime to wear though. I hope the price is around 75-120.00
How does this compare to traffic manager's crosswalk placement?  I dislike the fact it won't let me remove crosswalks at intersections, only more or less place them down non-intersecting areas.  Will this allow me to remove crosswalks from some intersections?
He was attempting to clear the air on something, revealing later that he had made the decision to do it during a panic attack of sorts. People who experience those kind of things can make very rash decisions.However, Nshadow has shown himself to be, on all occasions but that one, very very reliable and friendly. His streams are great, his personality is great. I believe this decision will work out very well for eGr.
It's a good show. I thought it was pretty emotionally engaging at times, and some of the humor was funny. The art is great, and the music is nice. It isn't amazing and I also despise the ending, but it was very enjoyable to watch. I think it is worth finishing.
We can keep only the hot white women and maybe a few of the hottest latinos and asians. Other than that dump everyone into the ocean using the least costly method possible.
It's totally a play on Lorde and the fact that other English speaking places use "shite" sometimes vs. "shit", for those that don't know.  I like cooking burgers over flame,but I just eat one a day, when I make them.And I can be proud of my sizeCause I don't need lies, ain't no fat on me.And all the hams are likefeed me, I'm greedy, I'm goin' into starve mode, help me, I seem to, have gone and broke the commodethey don't care, they just put colors in their greasy hairAnd I'll never be a fat aaaass, there's no butter in my bloodI'll keep on eating just enough, cause I don't want no extra fluff.Got no love for fatties, they're killing my societyAnd baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)And let 'em die of jealousy.(and diabetes)
And btw you're not up to date on the latest news. Apparently it appears that I was possibly correct and there was a stop between point A and point B that was undocumented. [push a handcuffed perp down the stairs] "It's funny how they always trip on the way to the squad car".
Assume may not be the best word then. Say "jump to the conclusion before the evidence warrants it" or "assign too high a prior probability" (if you want to be a snobby Bayesian). 
No, it doesn't go both ways. Someone being ostracized simply for who they are can cause trauma. Being asked to bake a cake for a gay person when you are a Christian is not in any sense of the phrase a "traumatic experience".Gay people are not trying to "impose" their beliefs on bakers, they're simply asking for a wedding cake and to not get hassled over having two female or two male figures on the top of the cake. Meanwhile religious zealots actually ARE trying to impose their beliefs on other people by holding other people to their own moral code. That's ridiculous; there is absolutely no relevance in business exchanges between businesses and customers for closely held beliefs. Baking a cake for someone doesn't mean you endorse gay marriage or will go to hell for it. We're done here. Your argument is ridiculous and disingenuous. Non-sequitur. Apples=|=Oranges. Troll.inbox notifications turned off.
If you read their response, it wasn't a mistake. They specifically stated that it was not how they intended the game to function. And, in my opinion, with good reason. Why bother continuing to play the game, if you aren't actually playing the game.But again, just my opinion.
This apply to anyone who want to suggest someting about command block : Step 1 : Learn current command system.Step 2 : Suggest something to improve command system.
Wow, amazing!

Haste is good if you have insane uptime, but most of the time mastery&gt;versa&gt;haste&gt;multi=crit is gonna be your prio in 3s - it's simply because you wanna improve your KS dmg as much as possible since it's pretty much the only time you're going to kill anything. It's very likely that mastery and versa gives you much less sustained than haste/multi but only burst matters atm.
Doesn't matter. In fact since the 1st day MLS announced LAFC, galaxy fans started talking shit. Without Chivas &amp; lowering tickets prices they can't even sellout the StubHub. 
&gt; all the shit and lies the media tried to smear us withWhat were they? If anything the media and fans have whitewashed the Tevez affair.. You guys got off lightly, turning it into a heroic underdog story when the reality was an illegally registered player indirectly caused another, rule-abiding team (who would have stayed up in other circumstances) to get relegated. That's a pretty fucking terrible thing for a club to do but it largely gets overlooked because the on-field side of things makes for a nicer story. And that's not just my verdict, but that of the CAS
These guys could have probably gotten by on their looks, but instead, they perservered making quality rock tunes that guaranteed them a place in one-hit wonderland.
There were a ton of posts like this before the game came out - "where should we meet up for the raid?" The general consensus was that the amount of people in this sub are only a small fraction of the total number of destiny players. So it would already be rare enough to get a tower instance with someone who knows these locations, but even rarer to find someone who also is looking to do the same thing. And that's only one person. To do a raid you would be looking at sitting in the same spot for likely upwards of a week.
This seems like a stupid rule. Why not just go with the evidence and form a reasonable opinion based on the best info from the best and mist neutral sources?     
In particular  look at their new ultra line, the weight may be a little longer but the initial releases claim some pretty  significant improvements  with regard to weight and noise reduction and have a pretty awesome muzzle brake underneath. I just submitted for a ultra can myself
Thailand has many people using mopeds on the roads Not just one person, but a family of 4 on a single moped all without helmets.  A tire pops, unexpected swerving and an entire family is gone.  If you check out the website below, most traffic fatalitiess are outside of bangkok and the vast majority of those are motorcyclists.http://www.thaiwebsites.com/caraccidents.asp
Food is something we partake in all of the time. I'm a vegetarian. I like not cooking meat. I just don't think I could be with someone who eats it now. Not only for ethical reasons, but practical ones. I don't want to be stuck frequently making two dinners. 
This app looks great! So far my only comments would be an auto complete feature when looking for a card, and that saving a card doesn't need to give an update. Other than that, I love it
You aren't crazy. Back when I was a young spring chicken, I dated a couple of passive guys and hated it. Hated it. It took me awhile to figure out, but it bothered me that they always let me pick the restaurant or movie and would never ever engage in an arguement. It was a bizarre world where I was always right and I was on this weird pedestal. Its not reality though. There is no way that could possibly be sustainable. Surely these guys have some kind of opinions? Don't they? If they don't it's weird and if they do... It's weird that they just let me be the queen. It wasn't for me.After that I dated a guy who is nothing like that. He's my best friend. We fight about shit all the time and were both a little dickish so it works out. Been married 15 years.Some people just need friction.
To clarify (for those who don't know) smelter's final phase does 100% fire damage. So for the end of the fight if you stack resist you can literally take zero damage.
&gt; I call him to me then swat him on the noseThat sounds like a great way to end up with a dog that doesn't let you know when he *actually* has to pee either. 
I used to spend alot of time at a friend's house smoking joints late into the night while playing Mario Golf on his Gamecube. My friend was a huge hip-hop head so whenever I hear Freddie Foxxx (Bumpy Knuckles), Alchemist Special Herbs, Bobby Digital/Prince Rakeem, or Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth I think of Mario friggen GolfE: Alchemist didn't do Special Herbs... herp derp

Whoever gets mad at Shiek CLEARLY has never played vs ICs.But so long as you win, nothing really matters. Just keep doing your thing and as a pro tip, do whatever they hate more, so they will get more annoyed and lose focus.
Yes.  I worked with medical and military VR applications before Oculus, and used the most cutting edge gear in existence.  Even at a hypothetical price of millions of dollars per headset, there is just not enough there to engage with the people who make the best cutting edge technology.  
Actually I think it totally is about the 9 months of discomfort. They don't want to face that and they don't have to because of "body autonomy". If they didn't care about the whole 9 months thing, and it was truly about "not wanting to be a parent" then there is adoption. 
If you have time and don't mind a nice walk that's a tad bid "touristy", a proper walk through Hyde park and walking around the lakes could do you some good.  A nice escape from the all the noise and general hecticness

Oh damn. That really blows.I'm so happy I don't have to take another math/science class ever. For me its Statics and Structures which still plays with physics and math but way less unintelligible. I guess it just helps to have a real-world translation in the mix.
Okay this is not going to be very helpful but a few years ago my uncle brought back this stuff from Costa Rica and it was the best mild hot sauce I've ever had. If I ever find out the name of it I'll let you know.

I went to a ghetto High school. My bully is dead, or in prison at best. I didn't have a specific bully, but being white in a black school I had all kinds of bullies. They are all dead, in jail, or working in fast food. They can enjoy their wedding, life's already fucked them enough. 
I loved the changes they did to her Ultimate. I think the changes to her E was not needed but the Ultimate allowed her to force a fight. I mained her for a while and i felt her ultimate was very useless since my enemy would run away as soon as it comes up. I really hope they bring it back so I can try it out. Edit: I just wanted to add that her new ultimate actually made her feel like a dragon and better fit her identity IMO. 
SHARD GOLEMS WON ME MY ALCHEMIST GAME!Rush radiance after boots and a shield guys. Make sure to have a good aghs support like WD so you can say "support me hard, and you will get a 25 minute aghs and instead of buying that you can rush invis stuff".Radiance is core on farming Alchemist. It gives him so much now.Mud Golems give alchemist 4 times the gold that everyone else would get (3 procs of greed, the shard golems are almost worthless for anyone else).I had radiance at 16 minutes offlane, then BoT then aghs for wd, then basher then assault cuirass and at 40 minutes I got my heart after taking three lanes of rax.
Oh absolutely! Not denying that at all. I'd rather have a properly trained ER Nurse than a GP doc anyday. I just rarely get the opportunity to see them. It's not that we don't have them, it's more that my particular areas usually are smaller; so it's not worthwhile to have a specially trained nurse.

After so many patches of people bitching about WG adding fantasy some-guy-sketched-this-on-a-napkin tanks, they add real tanks pretty much as they existed.  Then people complain that these tanks are underpowered and need to be buffed for balance.  These tanks are tiers 2,3, and 4.  You'll be playing at most 20-30 games in them.  The FCM 36 took me a whopping 2 games to elite.  Many people have been looking forward to all these historical tanks being added.  To make this tank a premium would be a slap in the face to the historical battles community. What they did was perfectly fine and the tank is perfectly fine.
I think it'd be cool if they offered a membership + that offered things like exclusive mod events, an exclusive world, Q+A sessions, x amount of runecoins to spend on cosmetic stuff per month, increased loyalty points per month, an aura that changed every month... as well as making mtx mostly cosmetic based, with the option of purchasing a 5% exp boost per skill.  Just small things that make a bit of a difference. 
OSCP is very much on my radar. I have a good amount of head knowledge, but the reason I'm doing this is so I can move forward with something like the PWK labs.
One thing I suggest is to make 100% absolutely sure that you have cancelled your subscription when you want to end it. I ended up paying for 3 extra months because they kept telling me that I had ended my subscription but there was fine print saying I didn't.
While purchasing a couple of blowers would sure help, I just wanted to see if I could do this at a cost of between zero and uh, zero dollars.Believe it or not the top fan reduces temperatures at full load by about 6*C!And besides, nothing beats having an AMD system rely on an Intel CPU fan for cooling. Bonus feature is the gap made by the standoffs allows me to stick my finger in there and assess air flow, this thing is truly a modern marvel.

I think that Thomas is just one of those people that is just nasty. We don't know much about his upbringing, but he has certainly learned the skill of manipulating people and information along the way. I honestly think that he believes that this is a way to get ahead. I'm sure the gay part has a small percentage of the whole, but I don't believe that is the only motivating factor by any means. Believe it or not, I work with a person who is absolutely nasty for no reason, in front of others. That person is not a TV character and everyone that knows the person has zero idea what triggers it or motivates it. That person does actually meet all of the known designators for a sociopath. I don't know if Thomas is a Sociopath, but most drama needs that one antagonist to keep things interesting.
The redshift distance relation, Hubble's law, is empirical. It is derived from observation, it does not depend on dark matter or anything like that.And yes, I said that.
We won't know if a plant that's GMO is safe until it's had a few hundred years of interbreeding/interactin with everything else out there...maybe it's been tested on human GI tracts, what if it kills the pollinators?

If he ditched it, then he really ditched all of reddit. The mods knew his real identity and he could have had the hacker discredited.Still a possibility of course. The drastic change was really weird like you said.

Not a teacher, but when my sister was in elementary school, she was a little overweight (she's fit now) and very self conscious about it. She was bullied a lot for being "fat" and didn't have very many friends. One day in the 6th grade, her gym teacher weighed everyone in class, and he made her go first. And then, to my sister's horror, he announced her weight to the *entire* class and made a really rude comment about her weight. She said the class kind of sneered and snickered at her and the bullying got worse for a bit. That gym teacher didn't announce anyone else's weight. Just hers. 
He's a little older than me, and missed growing up with the Harry Potter books as they came out. Somehow we got into this habit: every night we'll sit outside on the front porch and drink wine as I read the books aloud to him. He bought me a Kindle for my birthday to make it easier, and I'm getting pretty good at doing distinct voices and accents for each of the characters. I've never done anything like it with any of my partners, and I adore it.
I can't help but think that teabaggers have serious brain disorders. How many times have the been told _and_ _believed_ crap like this, _always_ to have it turn out false. Death panels, Obama's a Muslim, Obama's birth certificate is forged, Obamacare would crush job creation, fox actually _is_ fair and balanced, vaccinations cause autism, evolution is a false theory, and on and on. Now they earnestly believe a US military operation is going to confiscate guns.sigh
Investigating incidents and assigning penalties, etc, falls under the purview of the race *stewards*, while the *track marshals* are the people waving flags, clearing debris, and so on.  But someone else here will be able to explain the specifics; I believe there are even some regulars in this sub with actual marshaling experience.

I'm a student so I don't get all the juicy gossip but my physics teacher called my partner (sat next to me) a "waste of space and breath in the classroom" when he wouldn't get off his phone for the entire first semester during the class and failed his mid-term final.
I have done this a few times. I can personally vouch for a few abandoned structures on my server because I misplaced or did not line up two tampers correctly. I hated leaving that trash laying there. We should be able to take them down.

What is your socail club name, smokevapor isnt me lol. Also with the update today, you need to downgrade the game to play with mods online (until there is a bypass). But I'm still on servers with people on them in the downgraded game. [Here is how to downgrade](http://www.reddit.com/r/Gta5Modding/comments/34glyt/3501_update_bypass_method/)
I'm sorry, but I just can't imagine that's true. You think people having raging success doing personal, very niche things like cosplay and mommy blogging are *inauthentic.* I just...it's completely counterintuitive to the entire reason for the existence of social media.

I mean, this deck looks awesome and all, but doesn't it just fold to Hungry Crab Kappa.Scary Webspinner stories aside though, I haven't gotten to play the deck yet, but I can definitely see how there's a lot going for it right now. With the prevalence of Paladin and Druid, Coldlight Seer is amazing considering it gives you resilience against small AoE effects. And when you do draw Murk-Eye, he's almost guaranteed to be an outright bomb. I have gotten enough Murk-Eyes from Neptulon to know just how incredible that card is.

Overweight people require more calories to maintain mass, and generally have more muscle to move it.Which means even if they lost the fat immediately from hunger, they'd need higher caloric intake to maintain the muscles.
I was asked to quantify why Valve is bad. So I talked about Steam being mediocre and Valves other losing ideas.You replied talking about the sluggishness and whatnot and how if I find Steam bad I should not buy anything else. I never said Steam was bad. I said Steam was mediocre. Valve is bad. Steam being mediocre is part of why Valve is bad.
Well.. Isn't this my time to shine. I work in the health care field and are female. Short term reasons... Uncircumcised men probably don't wash there dicks every time they take a piss or have sex, so why the hell would I wanna touch that germ infested dick pool... Jut saying... If you aren't very hygienic... (I know for a fact not everyone washes there hands, so why would a guy always wash his dick if he doesn't even wash his hands?) Your uncircumcised dick can grow mold... So I think it is safe to say... Circumcised please!
I suppose that is true, about revealing information.But then you should keep the old accounts, delete any posts you don't want seen, and keep using it.If you don't want to use reddit as much (sort of like me &lt;.&lt; &gt;.&gt;), find a way to block it. There are a lot of programs that will create blacklists for your computer.Easier still, turn of reddit cookies. You can't log in without cookies (I think, haven't tried for a while).
I work with kids who have Autism and they all are on a different part of a spectrum. I work in their homes at times too and I can tell you that even if the bad stuff is easier to count on the good stuff is always there. I love my job and it's been three years and I see how these parents love their children. It amazes me every single day the way I see the parents look at their children. The kids I work with aren't mine and I do get to give them back BUT I do love them with all of my heart because if I didn't I'd get burnt out.

In the patch that she was nerfed they also added Cinderhulk, buffed Urgot, and buffed Righteous Glory. And of course around this time Hecarim was gaining popularity. Teams started wanting more overtime damage rather than single target burst. Watch SKT vs Jin Air on what I think was the first 5.5 patch where SKT outclassed them in picks and bans where GBM picked Liss and SKT had all tanks and had a more scaling team-fight focused comp. And then everyone copied them, Vlad gained a lot of popularity because of consistent damage/takiness/good team fighting. And then Vlad became the new flex pick for mid and top. So Liss is still played but outclassed in the current tank meta to other picks.
Yeah, lightning trap has really shit crit chance and slow proc rate (gotta wait for enemies to step on them) so the chances of actually landing crits with lightning trap are really low. If you insist on doing a crit trapper you will absolutely need power charges

&gt; I think you have that the wrong way around, although the court did rule that way originally it was reversed on appeal in favour of Oracle.I didn't get informed of the latest update of the court case, and thought it was closed; nonetheless, if Google turns around and sues Microsoft because of compatible API namings, they will lose Android case to Oracle hard. You can't have the cake and eat it too. Google's claims could be used against them.

That seems pretty obvious. I just hate that people have to make post telling other people not to buy something.If I bought it I bought it because I wanted to. So what is the point in telling me not to buy it? If I do not think it is worth it then I would not have bought it. People just use reddit as a forum to complain about things. They need mass approval or else it just seems like senseless whining.

With some variation between guns a given, the recoil characteristic of the 45acp is also typically a bit more like a broad shove than the quick snap of 9mm, which can change your perception of the recoil. The gun's weight isn't the only factor, too; slide weight, spring strength, bore axis, grip angle, grip circumference, etc. Plastic USP 45s are even a bit softer than all-steel 1911s in my opinion, as an example. 
Everyone should be doing their part to make things run smoothly. It doesn't matter who messed up, everyone should be aware and working to make things go smoothly. 
It's not always about the air temp. The soil needs to be warm for tomatoes, peppers etc.  Kale and spinach are cool weather crops. They can take a bit of frost.Don't stress too much about the plants you lost. There is plenty of time for planting. I'm surprised the eggplant lived. 
Well, she was driving (I just can't drive in the UK. It's visceral.), she stopped the car in the parking lot of the place she wanted directions from, turned the key, and wasn't gonna go anywhere until *someone* (and it was just her 'n' me) went and did it. That's pretty close to "made" for my tastes. :) 
no i didnt, the funny thing is he doesnt even know why she said it...her husband and my father have a long history of not liking each other...and another teacher came forward and told me that she was trying to screw me by giving me a bad reputation and trying to leave something bad on my school record ( she overheard a phone call of her and the husband)...thats why my parents want to take her to court.
Really? Miller hurts me the most. We could *still* be listening to him. All those years. No offense to the team, because they're good, but Miller is just another level. I wasn't totally behind Gillick. I think that move showed how mismanaged the O's were, but it seemed a poor fit to me, so I didn't object to that particular move. Mussina hurt for sure. Mussina hurt for years. It almost hurt more during his worse years, and it hurts to hurt because a Yankee is hurting. That whole thing was horrible. Is horrible. Maybe worse than Miller.

I wonder if they knew of the Asshaii prophecy but in a chinese-whisper form like the prophecies we, the readers, know of.The prophecy stated that Valyria would be destroyed by the gold of Casterly Rock, perhaps they misinterpreted this as destroyed by Gold?  Yi Ti was the Golden Empire after all and sort of the predecessor state of Valyria in terms of technological advancement, secrets lost to history.Mind you, for a culture that was supposed to be cautious around Gold, they sure did commandeer/mine a lot of it in their conquests.EDIT: Nevermind, the prophecy is Valyrian in origin...

I'm almost positive I saw this, or something extremely similar, on the news a week ago. There is body camera footage of what happened, and I'm surprised that wasn't included.

On first listen I was a bit disappointed. After several listens I grew to love the whole thing. I think my favorite song on the album would have to be "Making Friends". It's really hard to say where I would rank it compared to their other albums since I've had years to listen to those. Though I think No More Stories... will likely always be my favorite and And The Glass Handed Kites will mostly likely always be my 2nd favorite. The only thing that I am still disappointed about is that "Bamse" and "Boy" are not on the album. Hopefully they do decide to record and release them in the future. Also, I'm curious what came of the song that was briefly featured in the Sensory Spaces promo.

&gt;reaching out and tying in other topics. It didn't suit their agenda to tie in other topics such as what may occur in a situation where the gender roles were reversed.
How? The movie was silly throughout. I think this is one film where you can easily bring a character back from the dead using ridiculous logic and get away with it. 
Yes, definitely. I've experienced the awful results of introducing a horrible disease that killed almost everyone,  and it's really devastating. Also, it's much easier to treat your new fish for any disease that pops up in a QT because then you don't have to worry about cleaning the medication out later or damaging your healthy fish with treatments.  A QT doesn't have to be fancy, either. Mine is an ugly cheap 5g I keep in my closet. I throw some plants in and a seeded filter that I keep running in my main tank, and the cheap heater I also keep in my closet while I fill it up. When I'm done, I drain it and put everything away again.

I understand what you are saying. That sometimes one of the spouses is a jerk and the other wants to leave, but in that case, why not just cohabitate without marrying? This would give you the option of ending the relationship with no legal repercussions.Marriage should have *something* that distinguishes it from an unmarried couple who lives together. I think that something should be additional relationship security by discouraging both partners from leaving.For this specific scenario, I would say she made a bad decision when she agreed to marry him. People would definitely have to take considering whether or not to marry someone a lot more seriously if leaving had consequences.

Interesting that at least some of the Raptors are hybrids as well.

/u/Brassrain did something similar using Ursaring and Noivern, and I followed with Ursaring + Glaciate Kyurem. That was more than 3 months ago. I've had my eyes set on this ever since Roaring Skies' Unfezant got leaked. Took them long enough.Anyways, this is a very disruptable strategy with many parts, so you have to literally build your deck to be both explosive with tons of item draw and hyper defensive with Jamming Nets/Head Ringers. Also plenty of switches to make sure Mew is active. This strategy requires that you hit them in that small window of time when their EXs have yet to charge up, and Mr.Mime is *hopefully* not yet on the bench. Of all the decks I've built, this is the king of glass cannons.Kyurem is in theory better than Spinda, because it provides you with a second attack that has the potential to wreck even if they play the Mime, and Glaciate totals up to 110 damage to everything. We all know what will be at 110 Hp after the set hits.

For me, the only way a sequel can affect the original is in a situation where the director is the same. For instance, I thought Peter Jackson was "going for" certain things in the LOTR trilogy. Seeing The Hobbit made me see things he did in LOTR in a little bit of a different light. Not enough to ruin them, but enough to make me question some of his motives.

A bit late to the party, but I had to chime in on this one. High school, junior year. Most of us were around 16, some had been peaking into 17. In my APUSH class, our teacher had been making some really sexist remarks. I had only been half listening so I can't really tell you then verbatim, but it essentially led to one of my girl classmates telling him, "If you were my age, I'd slap you so hard right now."Almost immediately, as if he had been waiting to say it for a long time, he nonchalantly replied back,"If I was your age, I'd be on top of you in the back of my truck right now."The worst part is that he still works there. The school can't bring itself to fire him, and he's gotten away with so much shit like this.

On top of what you said, some animals become even more aggressive when they're sprayed with something like that. That being said, the police officer most likely had a night stick, which would have injured the dog, but at least the dog would be more likely to survive. However, he probably didn't think of that, and instead used what was already in his hand.

As others have mentioned, there is more to criminology than just trying to eliminate crime. You're taking a very narrow view of what criminology is, and I would suggest thinking further about what other areas or questions may be involved in criminology. For example, what about the victims of crime? The rights of offenders? Prisons? Police? Courts? Is it even possible to eliminate crime, even if we did have a magic code?

Heat heat fruit, you can heat up your body to insane temperatures but not produce any flames, punches and kicks melt metal and possibly people but if you go too far (like a 30second period where the users body is nuclear bomb hot) you could potentially roast your insides. 
Yeah.. for us hardcore fans, sure, this puts in perspective just how far we have to go.. we'll learn from it, recover from it, and guard our optimism more carefully. But for the casual fans who we desperately need to get more involved for this team to have a future in Milwaukee.. it hurts man, this hurts this teams economic stock big time.. FUCK!
Adelaide's comeback a few years ago. hurts. so much. Last year's prelim was pretty bad, but it was such a blowout, it doesn't hurt as much as if we had lost by a kick. 
This is all if only because I had failed to address the problem in my first 2 months. I want to clean everything up and make the subreddit more appealing to those with less time on their hands.   
Most Respect: People who assume &amp; expect the best of people. Least Respect: Those who take advantage of, or even just look down upon people who are struggling.

might help to explain that "democratic" in this sense means "Democratic Party," which is generally left-leaning, though probably not anywhere close to as left-leaning as parties in Europe.
ESXi (free license) for hypervisor. Ubuntu primarily for VMs. It really doesn't matter which distro I use, I just use Ubuntu because I have before, and am most familiar with it. I also do some RHEL, Fedora, and CentOS work. But primarily I'm Ubuntu. 
They're harder to seat, the minutes hand is wider and mountain cut (faceted) so unless you press it at the proper angle it'll flex and deflect upwards. Can be a pain. Try a smaller die for your hand press next time.
Really? Because when Kimani Gray was killed there was a fucking riot in Brooklyn, even though he pointed a gun at the cops that shot him. And his face is still plastered on the "Kids Cops have Killed" posters being held up at the protests. 
Yep. In the past month or so, this is fourth brand that has been brought up. It's an epidemic almost worth a title; say elbow destruction by desk deterioration. Idk, working title.
&gt; good ol' boys club that Ralph createdRalph was hardly the problem. Neither Stelmach, nor Redford, nor Prentice descended from Ralph, and whether or not you hated him (and he was a very Hateable person) his administration was on the competent side of the fence.
tbh I have absolutely no idea why they even changed her E to begin with. Her E procing the Q was not what made her strong, but it made her kit feel like it worked together a lot better. Her damage on Q proc or her ulti damage were what needed to be changed. She feels a lot clunkier since the E was changed.
Not that outrageous when you consider Donald Sterling. Or that [it's a league owned by old white men and predicated on the sweat of young black men.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/diversity-in-the-nba-the-nfl-and-mlb/).Still an imbalanced power dynamic, with some pretty gross implications, and you hear something pretty close to a "plantation mentality" slip out on occasion. I think it was near the end of Spurs-Clippers game 5, there was a shot of (maybe) Tim Duncan standing on the sideline in front of Peter Holt. One of the commentators referred to him as "Standing by his owner." Yeah, sure, it's just an elision of the language referring to the fact that the guy owns the team on which he plays... but... it's also expressing something true about the relationship between the players and the owners.  
Nothing can move faster than c because it is the very definition of 'c'. c is and always be exactly 299792458 metres per second. Also this EmDrive is all about group-velocity.  Not *velocity*, but group-velocity. Group velocity **does not** mean that every individual particle is moving faster than the speed of light but 2 **different** photons from the same source can reach a detector where the impact of 2 **different** photon's would be faster than the movement of a photon starting from detector A and move to B. Imagine you have 2 blue cars. Each car moves at the same speed 20 km/h but in a 90 degree angle. Both cars never drove faster than 20 km/h but after a 100 km the distance between car A and B would be bigger than a car would drive from A to B.Group velocity means that you are not measuring one and the same photon just 2 different photons. 
Yes that's a good estimate for everything without DLC. Considering that last time the DLC gave us limit break, new classes, new skills, and new conversations, it could be close to $200.And if you don't mind answering again, how does the discount work on the other paths? We are talking about physical copies, right?
Threesomes of me being tied up (I'm a girl) and a girl/guy fucking me while I'm helpless. Or being raped by an attractive guy.. but I guess it wouldn't be rape if I wanted it.
I've always felt the same. Letterman, Leno, have had recurring bits albeit not "in character".  A more accurate comparison though would be the characters Carson did for years
I have gotten a few of those, which is how i actually reacted the first time. Im originally from NY but spent the past 6 years in MD/Baltimore area. Had to unfortunately move back to NY. : /
I feel the urge to say "Oxford Dictionary of Music" but that's very much a general guide. [It appears to be surprisingly cheap](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Oxford-Dictionary-Music-Michael-Kennedy/dp/0199578109/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) but it's what I use as one of my university reference texts (though I use the online version) amongst other similar things.I don't know if there's a specialist one for common practice/20th century. I suspect it's genre-specific, given the diversity of the 20th century.
Filling up the room would be fun. It would have to have a back door. Get them to chase you in you lock one door and run around and lock the second door 
Very nice. As much as I love my 05 mustang I still want a trans am like that...  Constantly thinking about selling the Mustang for one but then I drive the stang again and rethink that decision.. HahaHow much power is she putting down?

This is a reply to OP and also /u/strincheese13 and /u/elleundomiel.  It may seem like it, but please believe me that your future is far from ruined because of a bad year or two in school.  Sure, it may make things a bit tougher in some respects, but you are far from doomed because of it. For the vast majority of careers, especially that don't require post-graduate education/certification, no one even cares what your marks are, just that you completed it.  And that's not even getting into the many careers that are out there that don't even require degrees.
I have that happen to me too. Mostly in winter cause my coat adds extra bulk to my frame. I don't mind mostly. They want to stand and get tossed around in traffic. Not my problem. 
I own consoles as well. One of each generation as far back as the NES. I also own PC's from around that time, and if I told you I got more enjoyment out of the consoles I'd be lying.
yesterdays esamir alert was like that every time. and playing at like 4-5pm today.i dont think i can tolerate playing on this server for much longer with the amount of russians now on it. So much lag wizardry its insane. 
I don't need to know context of someone using a 10-ton machine capable of killing people when he's swerving around. Pretty sure context doesn't make me like the guy any more.
I agree that the Glenwood/Moreland realignment is way overdue and very happy it made its way onto the list! Folks turning from Moreland in that center lane onto Glenwood take their lives into hands as they attempt to complete the turn without getting t-boned. 
I am inclined to agree, if a 250 pound officer is incapacitated and needs to be dragged or carried away from a situation, then the fist officer arriving should be able to do it regardless of age or gender. 
&gt; You don't need energy to create a force - gravity does that all the time.Um, how come?Gravity is basically the manifestation of potential energy of mass (and other stuff in the stress-energy tensor) with regards to other masses. That's what General Relativity is all about. Spacetime is expanding thanks to a mysterious force, that is proportional to distance between stuff, so pushes the equilibrium state a bit "apart", but otherwise potential energy of stuff bends the spacetime manifold causing a Newtonian force toward the center-of-mass of the whole system. [[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space#Effects_of_expansion_on_small_scales)]Gravity as we see it is - in this sense - a direct result of the big bang.
I've been doing uworld question so long I actually had this dream last night where I'm taking step 1 and then, like in tutor mode, they show you the right answers with the explanation. So I change my answer and move along. 
I mean that they always expect the worst to happen or the worst of me. If I accomplish something (like getting into grad school) they think of every little thing that could go wrong and throw them in my face.Also, if things are going well, they think that it's all going to fall apart, I think it's a form of catastrophic thinking. 
Well, it may very well be a browser problem, because the fact that I'm not having any trouble (as well as none of my other devices) is a sign that this isn't intentional vandalism. My guess is that you have some browser extension/add-on installed that is interfering with the images. Check the webpage on either Google Chrome and/or Internet Explorer and see what happens in one of those browsers. Make sure you've disabled any unusual extensions.
&gt; good luck manThanks!&gt; very interested to see how the next one improves on the previous attemptThere was a lot of things brought up in the feedback we got that never occurred to any of us before, so hopefully it should be a more enjoyable experience for everyone.
I just can't escape the irony of calling the cops on someone whom you fear is going to harm themselves."Going to harm yourself? Let me call the cops, they'll do it for ya."
&gt; but it produced a bit of a feeling that the author was barely in control.Why is that a bad thing? If the story reaches the point at which it's so alive that it escapes the control of it's author, shouldn't it identify just how good it has become?
Thanks for the link. The best they can do in San Rafael is 18Mbps for $55 including tax. I think I will stay with 3Mbps with AT&amp;T until I can figure out another option. I refuse to go with Comcrap. I upvoted this post.
Twelve shotguns, ten submachine guns, thirteen assault rifles, seven marksman rifles, eight sniper rifles, six fragmentation grenades...Oh yeah, anything with Arc in the name needs varying degrees of nerfing, with Arc nades being the worst.
finding a good LGS with good meta where everyone isn't running top8 decks. and the prize is evenly distributed.. and then finally going 3-1 many times becomes a regular thing.   waiting on that first 4-0.
Completed my 4bb/100 challenge for 1 month, so if I can crack it again for May then that should be 100k hands + completed.Try some more 8 tabling 200nl + 100nl, seems like my game style is crushing both levels but might just be positive variance at 200nl.play 100k hands.Pay myself again, pad the roll, establish myself at 200 some more.Find an MTT coach, continue playing MTTs, study MTTs etc.Speaking of studying, I haven't studied cash in a long time cos my game is that solid atm, so maybe I should devote my studying hours entirely to MTTs.Aim for $4k cash profit. Need to not get over zealous just cos I hit $6k last month.
Yup. I tend to hang out in the middle lane. On some parts of 80, the freeway is eight lanes wide. Eight fucking lanes wide but I can see your forehead acne in my rear view mirror. You have seven other lanes to pass me with but tailgating me is the most logical option?
&gt;Drones are the greatest good for our peopleOur people? Everyone on the planet is "our people" fucktard. An arab is just as much your brother as your neighbor. Just because you worship some imaginary line in the sand doesnt negate that. We are all citizens of planet earth. &gt;The fact you think a seal potentially dying is worth saving one or two people is astonishing.THATS THIER JOB. 1 or 2 people? MORE CIVILIANS ARE KILLED THAN THE TARGETS. hahahaha&gt;We should save them for when we really need them.We...."really need them" now....to fight the war on terror.&gt;Ethically, these are better than sending in seals for us. I couldn't give a damn about them.Ethically, youre a piece of shit. Of course you dont give a damn about "them". Youre a piece of shit
Lucario!  Doesn't matter if out/in of box and any region will do.  Reason: I love Lucario, but I was unable to preorder it. Gen 4 is my favorite region and the one I hold closest to my heart (so many good memories). 
I like to think a Vancouver, Canada accent is the most real one. I think I've modeled my own accent after New York talk radio, but Canadian accents are nicer. I can't imagine somebody being genuinely angry with that accent. They would only sound elated and surprised. 
It's not even nostalgia goggles, she just hasn't given the game a chance and probably doesn't care enough to. Old games are fun, I guess she doesn't think so. 
Minmus is easier to land on, and I went there first, but the Mün feels like more of an achievement. I tend to only visit one biome per mission in the early game, until I get the 2-man landers.
the one against trixie was E4. depriving us of a good lipsync (correction: making us suffer through such a bad lipsync) in E9 is much less forgiveable!
Yes, and then you start seeing how your actions lead to, y'now, the white phosphorus part. What happened to Lugo.  Even the "good" ending flies in the face of the usual "Hoorah! Let's continue the mission!" sequel hooks for other shooters.
I wore crocs with socks the other day to Hardee's with my cousin. He said I looked like trailer trash. I told him we were in Holmes county Florida, meth lab capital of the state....
I appreciate the reply! I agree, I do think I am getting a pretty unique opportunity with job #1 and I'm leaning towards it heavily now. I think I will try it for a few years, as you did, and learn all I can. Thanks friend!
If your population is 20 and you take a sample of 15 people you aren't taking a sample at that point.  A lot of our statistical methods aren't as good anymore when you have more than 5 or 10% of the population because they assume each data point is independent but when you have more then about 5% it becomes obvious that things aren't independent anymore.
A campaign to change the name? I think that would be too much trouble and would never take. Just have it be a spinoff. If AntiSJW is the name of the new movement it should be a different group from Gamergate.I like Gamergate but I don't like the feeling that I'm treading on someone else's movement because I'm not a gamer. I'd rather have a pure anti-SJW movement with all the same people involved (Sommers, Milo).
Well that's what I thought too, though I didn't really look for a definitive answer. I read about this and assume there is an answer on the whirlpool forum. 
You seem to think that Riot being a business makes it so we have no right to bitch about them wanting more money. You seem to completely ignore that we are consumers, no brainless walking wallets. If we feel something isn't worth our money, we have every single right in the world to complain. 
To be fair, most Americans grew up with plain white bread and don't know about the wonders of European bread. Actually, Europeans seem to complain about everything in our sandwiches. They really hate American processed cheese, our cheap lunch meats, and also our lack of Nutella and Marmite. 
laftho is referring to the size of your conveyor tubes on the small ship.  The small tubes on small ships can only move a handful of small items like ore and scrap metal.
I really only focus on highly industrial products so I'm not really sure for you. I would recommend going to either Grainger or Sherman Williams and asking for a 100% solids urethane. See if they can come up with something for you. Keep in mind, you'll want to apply that at the thickness of a piece of notebook paper. 
I was dog/house sitting for my uncle last winter. Got super drunk, decided to skinny dip in his hot tub. It was great, until his neighbors came outside to smoke and started talking to me. 20 minutes later they go back inside, I'm super proud of pulling off not showing them anything by mistake, and then I realize the lights in the hot tub are on and they could see everything. GG. I was mortified when it happened, but I laugh about it now. 
Not that I disagree with you regarding the point about rioters generally being opportunists but hockey is broadcast live on tv. Just because they didn't have a jersey or pay the unreal prices to be at the game doesn't mean they weren't watching.
I guess I'm in a unique situation, because I became an atheist before I lost my trust in the church. I'm one of those people who apply the scientific method to beliefs, and religion just doesn't survive in such an environment.
West Coast Brownie, checking in.Rocking my Browns gear out on my deck a couple hundred miles south of you in Portland. (With a big-ass Ohio State flag hanging off the deck, because I find that shit hilarious.)
My house has those same plates, and I have only seen one break in my whole life! Although when they do break, they turn into some grade A prison shanks.
Iirc people have said in Japan they are required to display drop rates. Outside of Japan, they are under no such requirements so idk if they actually will do this. 
Yup, joining one of their comedy societies is like a ticket to being at least a writer. In this day and age, I'd say that this has actually limited UK comedy a bit. 
I used to be that way and occasionally the feeling comes back. Conquer your anxiety via meds, therapy, will, etc. or spend the rest of your life living like a neck-beard unable to leave the comfort of its mothers metaphorical basement. Its up to you; nobody else cares whether you buy groceries or not, or if you are malnourished or broke because you have anxiety.Remember- somebody somewhere is relieved that you are a spineless turkey because it means there's one less person to compete with in the rat race; this usually snaps me out of any kind of anti-social mood
I'll wait for people to text because I'm not sure who makes my phone crash. Its just change in my mind. One day x with text me with no problems, and the next it crashes instantly. Edit: Spelling
So you live a healthy life, and then one day you just die? Fuck yeah this is my favorite answer. Better quality of life, without the overpopulation issues.
Unlikely. He didn't say bring them to court, he said "take them to court **and prove it**". Judging by all the other confused replies, it's pretty clear from this post that most people don't fully understand the various roles of the US criminal justice system.
Most beta games are not very well optimized, so they require much more powerful computers than normal to operate at a sufficient frame rate. Once they get the code cleaned up (which may be a while), we should be seeing better frame rates on less powerful computers.
&gt; Why do you think this post is "opposed to fatherhood"?Because you were criticizing Paul's claim about Black fatherhood.  I was responding to you saying, "...because his comments after these riots aren't remotely libertarian".  &gt; My point is that Rand is discussing a symptom of problems that he used to recognize.What's wrong with that?&gt; He's doing this because conservatives love the "moral decay" narrative.What's wrong with talking about what Black conservatives like to talk about?  They are voters.  Their voter matters just as much as ours, and Rand is running for President.  Shouldn't candidates talk about issues that matter to Black voters?  I see no problem here.
The store didn't detain him. They didn't force him, or tell him, to stay.The store called mall security, to inform them of an unaccompanied minor. Mall security arrived and made the kid wait. Rather than bringing the kid to the security office, he and the child waited in the Lego store.
I had to upgrade from a 750w to an 850w due to instability. But I have 5 drives and about 10 case fans connected as well, also a modded bios in my gpus to increase the power.
I'm... I'm going to entertain you, because you just don't run across these people every day. I've never been to Europe, but from what I read the whole continent has lots of different cultures, some religious and some not. Now I don't think I'm going to change anything you're saying. Looking around the comments, you just want to insult people and feel smug. Also, because I believe I have to share my faith with others. Not on the Internet, but through relationships. 
I was using the east us server on oracle, for that was the only server my friend and i could use cause we are in australia. I tried west us and it worked and i got into games fine. Must have been a problem with the east us server
For both? Assuming they take back 2M of Phaneufs salary.. Something like:Ericsson, Smith, Wiess (purely for cap dump), Kindl, Pulk, prospect 1st and a 3rd. (The 3rd for doing us a favor of taking Wiess' contract). It may sound like a lot but keep in mind you're getting back a #2 Dman and a 27 year old 40 goal scorer. 
I have a microatx mobo in this case and it [looks](http://imgur.com/TNrvg8R) fine.Dat cable management would be better if it had a side window and on my desk.
So glad I found your sub! I have a hosiery fetish and I always like hearing from other people that have it too! Are there women that have this fetish? I imagine there are very few. My wife knows about my fetish but is not into it. She wears thigh high stockings for me but she is not into it so sometimes it's hard knowing that she does not like wearing them. Thanks again for posting the pics!
Americans got *one* (the Soviet one is virtually the same as the American one) because it is a vital starting point in the new TD line. Not to mention that they are based on the halftrack chassis already in the game for 3 of the American SPAA units. German halftracks are going to have to wait for their own line in the tech tree because of the amount of development time it will take (not to mention the fact that the rocket armed ones will need the code from the new Sherman that was just added).Besides the Germans got a StuG with a derp cannon, they didn't exactly walk away from this patch empty handed.
Watch the documentary "Heart of Darkness" filmed by Coppula's wife it show how fucked the production of the movie was and what a longshot it was for it to turn out decent, when it was release it was expected to completely flop 
That's one of those "Unconstitutional but still on the books" laws. People were very 'particular' about other people having sex back in the day. Weird times. 
/u/Rhendal   (You get tagged as you also responded to him).The beer is interesting.  Imagine having a light beer that has an Old Bay flavor, but without the after peppery heat that you get from eating Old Bay.  You still have the flavor though.
Yep, always had it since I was about 2 years old.  I don't mind peeing in them but pooping is another story, lol.  It will always be weird to poo with other people in the room, but try to remember they're doing the same thing and feel the same way you do.  Take some deep breaths and don't rush yourself.  I sometimes sing a song in my head to distract myself from what's going on around me.  I take Imodium if I think I'll have to poop in a public restroom or am having anxiety.  That's probably not practical to do on a daily basis though.  It's better to face your fear...even if you do it in gradual steps.  
Oh, I'm sorry, is Galaxy not an operable client? Also, if you take a look at the Galaxy posts referencing an NDA on the GOG facebook, they always link back to that post. For the intents of legal structuring no that wouldn't hold up as an NDA, but at the end of the day you're just being a prick by breaking it.
The only thing remotely like that that plays underground is [Planetarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiRRq2wpsDk), which now plays at the Outpost. Is it that?  With more information it would be easier to find, if that isn't it. There is specific music for every situation and I can see what it is in the files.. Such as what planet you were on, whether it was day or night, and how far underground you were.
&gt;Some creepy dude trying to get their rocks off? GTFOWomen's bathrooms are 1000x times more gross than sexy so I can't even imagine this would be the least bit common except for those with a really specific fetish. And I don't think current societal expectations really keep them out.

Yumex3 was released on Apr 16 2014 with Otomekishi. It was part of a series of new content celebrating 2 million users/1st year anniversary, including version 2.0 (EN upgraded a while back), new daily songs (EX not in a while), the School Idol Diary token events and the UR Eli. EN received the SID events as part of the normal series of events, but for the rest? Maybe around the time of the promo UR Nozomi when EN celebrates its own 1st year anniversary..
My rarest is probably Ogre Battle, but my most expensive is Earth Bound. I've also got Shadowrun, Breath of Fire II, and Congo's Caper, which are three I think are probably slightly more rare because I hardly ever see them in other collections.

Because a phone can do so much more.If you only want it for that purpose, then yeah, get the cheaper option, but otherwise the phone is a better deal.
I had a very long argument with my uncle about this. [MRW](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kyN9nFU4RYw/TydnmeTKNUI/AAAAAAAAAd4/lEsJX2q90XQ/s1600/moriarty+shrug+face.gif) he wouldn't even really agree to disagree. 
If he makes it to 27 there's something we don't know in the public. You're right, but BPA isn't quite that black and white either. The knee is still a small concern and I still think you can get a great RB at much better value at 60. 
The Tribes typically have very few permanent settlements, but their architecture and their Tents are heavily based on Native American housings.The Monks, part of the Tribes who live up in the mountains, are heavily based on Hindu/Tibetan temples.The Ver'Kei Empire(name subject to change) have a very "metric" sort of design to their starships and buildings. Their buildings are very cube-focused. Their ships are very triangular. 
I gave up on Destiny long ago after I'd get an error and kicked from online play after about 30 seconds. Never really felt like playing it again after that.
I take antidepressant medications myself and if I had a teacher say something like that to me in high school (I wasn't on them then, but looking back, I probably should have been), I'd fucking explode and probably get myself expelled or arrested for saying something like "You're lucky I did remember our you'd be fucking dead." Antidepressants and antipsychotics affect a lot of different receptors in the brain and, at least for me, going off for even one day can give me severe mood swings. Last time I was off them, I nearly quit my job for no real reason. So if the kid was on pills, yeah, that is not an unreasonable response. If they weren't, maybe they were just having a bad day.

Shit's been fucked for a long time.  This isn't anything new.  School is where you learn the cruelty of the humans you share this planet with.  It's not only the system, its the fucking shitty people in the system. 
Hold on there hive-minder, I don't drive better when drunk, however I do drive safer.  When I'm sober I'm texting, reading reddit, playing with the radio, and/or eating.  However after only a couple of beers I turn off the radio and the phone, have both hands on the wheel and force myself to concentrate on the road.  Combine that with a party college level alcohol tolerance that took me a decade to hone and I'm much less likely to kill you after a "few beers"
A long time ago, the only sort of concern the city had was to knock down all the businesses on Jefferson (jazz clubs, whatnot) by building an expressway through the middle of the neighborhood. Now that there are fancier people around, they'll do something about the neighborhood.
I can't say how 1.6 worked, but I can say how CS:GO works. It is extremely likely that 1.6 used this same method. But I don't know for sure.In simple terms, all the clients play in the future and the server retroactively decides how the game plays out.This has the massive benefit of responsive controls but causes some obvious issues. The most easily apparent way to see this in action is when you're jump-peeking anything. Often times you'll die AFTER you've hit the ground, even when you can't even see your opponents. Similarly if you manage to maneuver yourself around a corner and then die anyway. This is because the server is saying "hey, that guy shot you" and, because the server is always right, your client "rewinds" and kills you.
It was definitely in the theaters, so not a shitty Lifetime movie.  That's smart to ask, though.  I don't remember any actors.  It seemed not to be a horror movie, but a type of mystery.
I love Shock N Jock! SHOCKIN AND JOCKIN!"I don't know what country these crippled freaks come from, but I saw we nuke it and turn it to glass. Turn. it. to *GLASS*"
If you like league, you need to at least try Dota2.But otherwise, if you're looking for some space-action Star Conflict is a pretty solid PvP and PvE combat sim. 
Also make the Wolfspirit not ping once but 10 times it sees an enemy. As if salty motherfuckers that spamping the fuck out of your lane aren't enough. God.

I think it's still a valid point though. If you're of the opinion that it is wrong to be able to claim that amount of money, regardless of how many people actually do, then surely you must address it. Also, I'm not sure that Cameron offered these particular cases as examples of how the welfare budget can be substantially cut - rather, I think he considers it a matter of principle.
Can you imagine if this was Irish people walking down the street shouting "Tiocfaidh ár lá! Tiocfaidh ár lá!" they wouldn't tolerate it, and rightfully so.I think they get away with murder (quite Literally) in the west because Liberals are so quick to defend them no matter how many liberal principals Islam goes against.These people were handled properly by countrys like *Iraq* before the American invasion, yet we let them walk all over us, behead our soldiers and be proud of waving it in our faces?It's madness, pure fuckin madness.
Thanks, that looks close to what GTA defaults to, which I use but also lower in some areas, however I still get frame drops;  and when I drop the settings to the lowest setting, I get major lag, or screen tear I think it's called, despite my steam overlay saying I have greatly over 60 FPS. What CPU are you using if you don't mind me asking?
Hey, I apologize for not seeing this earlier.  You only need 1000 Tokens (the gold bars).  Unfortunately, we had some ratings get delayed and Australia is one of those regions affected so that is why the purchase won't go through.  Should be available any day now.
Which one am I carrying right now...  Really like the Sage 1 AND the Manix  LW s110v.  Leaf blades are infinitely useful.  Pm2 not my thing, but to each his/her own.  If you want to save a bunch of money, you can pick up a dragonfly for around $50-60, ergonomic, practical, and all around a good knife.  Enjoy the manix, great knife.
I had a bad burn all over my face, neck and shoulders last summer (though nothing like this guy's) and it wasn't until the first night that the chills and nausea came over me.  I remember laying in bed in lounge pants, thick socks, a hoodie, and cocooned in a blanket and it still didn't feel like enough.I don't want to imagine how bad it'd be with a burn like this. 
I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion. Reports vary but most places claim between 100 and 300. There's even a report from 1921 that says between 100-200...and says many reported use of bombs from airplanes. But that's just from a guy who interviewed people that were actually there...http://www.thenation.com/article/tulsa-1921
Really? Kuhn is overrated, look at how bad his backs have done outside of Lacy's rookie year. Leach didn't even play last year. Reece is good though. Tolbert is more of a runner than a blocker. Mccoy sucked at the beginning of the year just like his line did. Once his line got better, he got better. So yeah, I'm the dumb one that doesn't know football, you're right. 
If you did some actual research you'd know that these buildings will conform to any western building standards and are very safe even against magnitude 9 earthquakes. You probably didn't even bother reading the article.
You described it very well, "teetering on the edge of absolute mayhem" can be very exhilarating. I've just had too many bad experiences in a row. Having a knife thrown at me and seeing people catch on fire has made me appreciate structure. 
I don't know what rent is where you live but in any decent sized city in Canada rent is almost always significantly higher than 700, even for a dump. Most people in Canada spend significantly more than 25% of their take home on housing. In my own city it's something around 40% on average if I recall correctly
Guess it was de-irradicated? It was eliminated from the U.S., but is back, from where is the pertinent question? I find it odd how people don't get angry over FLU vaccines, 50K+ people die in the U.S. From the flu every year, but their is media silence, bandwagon much?

If I remember right, T-Mobile sold off all of their towers and is leasing space on towers from third parities. So couldn't the permits be granted in the name of the tower owners and not T-Mobile?Also T-mobile focus has been on upgrading it current towers and not adding new ones. Coverage gains are coming from lower bands and converting current towers to 4G. 
As I understand, you will be sent the newest release, not the first issue. If you're really looking to get into a current book, read from trades before subscribing to the book.

You may be able start at the beginning of particular story arcs, changes in the creative team, or the issues following crossover events.Or you could wait for Convergence and Secret Wars to end.

Kate Walsh and Sandra Oh are on an equal level of awesome. They made this show bearable. But it's okay, we have Maggie lisping all over the place and the torrid saga of idiotic Amelia and Owen to entertain us now. *  starts sobbing    *
What the don't seem to understand,Is the lack of attention from the manThey tell us to be silent Make us tremble in the fearCaused by the peoples violence. If you were to ask regular people Their lives are just okay, Some spend all day in steeple'sOthers deal just to get paid. I'm not gonna pretend I went through this all myselfBut I was lucky to have friendsWho didn't follow all those trends.

I'll up vote you man! Don't know why you're being down voted. It is a game and they asked what game you're gonna play this weekend.Edit: invite to up vote. Stupid auto correct.
Believing Milwaukee can come back from a 33 point deficit at halftime isn't crazy. Bucks fans have been believing they can come back from 3-0 all week, even more insurmountable. Go Bucks!
I'm a bit biased against Dalton because his Survivor recaps were my first source of consistent Survivor info, meaning I became a Russell-worshipping and Natalie-hating idiot for a few months before I found the Funny 115 through TV Tropes and learned that it was actually a debate. (Now I'm more or less anti-Russell)Still, it's nice to have someone official acknowledge the verbal brutality that's been going on this season from Dan, Will, Rodney, and Mike, even if I've come to appreciate the latter 2 as Survivor characters.
What is it about Reddit guys that sends them running for the hills when these type questions come up?  I've found that either:(a) guys will vociferously defend their sexuality or(b) focus on proving that two guys who engage in M2M sex can't possibly call themselves "straight".Is it an age thing?  Is there a specific age demographic of the guys on Reddit who will never admit to any guy on guy sex?  Or is it that the majority of guys who really do consider themselves straight and who occasionally will get with another guy simply don't read this Reddit?  Or maybe the subject is too taboo to discuss, even in the relatively anonymous confines of Reddit and guys don't know how to use throwaway account names?  The reason I wonder is because the responses don't seem to be representative of real life.I'm interested in responses, but not looking for any that focus on the definition of being "straight"!
Almost every top player (Justin Wong, Sonic Fox, etc) has expressed their discontent with Kung Jin. There has only been one MKX tournament and Kung Jin was in the Grand Finals. 
Everything you've just said indicates a Kantian absolutist worldview. The idea that some acts are inherently "evil" is one that the utilitarian rejects, and understanding this is crucial to understanding the utilitarian argument. From the utilitarian perspective, statements like this;&gt; Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil, which is *still evil*. are nonsensical, since preventing a greater evil from happening has a net positive outcome and is therefore morally good. Utilitarians are consequentialists; the intended outcome of a given action determines its morality, not any intrinsic quality of the action.
&gt;With a lot of pain, not knowing what is causing it, or what is wrong, makes it scary, and therefore worse.I said this practically verbatim to my husband the other day when we were speculating about the pain of childbirth. Glad to hear its so!
I already talked about the cassowary, you must've missed that. And are giraffes really colorful? Really?... I guess they have really nice patterns, but I wouldn't put them on the same level as smaller birds and reptiles that are just vibrant with colors.
They seem like a great time. I'll admit, I haven't listened to them much as they came out in the middle of the "faux-folk" indie blowout and I was kinda burnt out on it. Although, I'm hopelessly addicted to "Crystals" so there's that. Thanks for the info!
You're kidding, right?  You're surprised that the terrain matches?  That's as easy as moving sand around.  The pics of disturbed soil?  They can see there are tracks but no equipment?  Russians monitored transmissions?  Sure, we were being thorough about this shit though, if we'd faked it we were gonna fake it as little as possible.Again, I'm not a lunar landing conspiracy theorist or anything, but nothing in that website provides anything conclusive.  "Proof?"  I feel like that's a bit strong of a word.
I like the way you think. The fuckery that is -A sometimes astounds me like ... I barely got time to do all my adult things but he, she, it, bitch be like playing with dolls and making magic boxes and what not.
Sorry people are downvoting you for being curious. I think you are describing limits but that has nothing to do with that. This is called the superposition principle, and basically the energy of waves traveling through a medium can add to each other or negate each other, and that is called interference.
I've been interested in trying DoubleClick. I run a small SMB lead gen agency so it's probably of little use to me. I just want to see Google's take on management software. I've heard great things from people who say that it's often overlooked especially in the paid search and DSP side of things.

I actually hope so. It's been far too long since most of these characters have had a nice long conversation with each other. Plus, the Lalondes + Kanaya &amp; the Lalondes + Dave. 
The moment fans started chanting it at everyone months after the Austin thing ended, even back in 2001, I really fucking hated it. It used to get some funny comebacks from Taker but seriously, completely disrespectful. I facepalm and instantly despise fans/crowds who chant that during promos.
Uh oh.. I was fearing this since they introduced the new Bill site... I guess I will need to update my extension in the near future...On the upside... I hope is just not a cosmetic change, but that they actually *gasp* add features...
It's not a problem of enemy locations. We have been able to clear every single enemy out of the base repeatedly, it's just that when we killed the guy at the main gate an extra cone would spawn as soon as he died on the minimap. The game patched today and it was all ezpz; everything went as it should.Guess it was just a bug of some sort. Do appreciate you trying to help regardless.
I think people are seriously underestimating how much shit Spectre is going to get done. Radiance buff and heart buff are both going to be really nice. I also feel like NP will come back with early fighting shadowblade/deso strats. Deso is SOOOO cheap now.
As someone with a July delivery date, I completely agree. In fact, I feel so sorry for the people who already have their watches. Sucks to be them. I'm totally fine to wait an extra 2-3 months.:')
I still haven't tried Watch Dogs, this is the one game where the mixed reviews are just delaying when I get it. What are the different ways I can play it. A lot of the player reviews just say the hacking part of the game is pointless since everyone just kills each other.
Air battery can be replaced just like a flashlight on the go, just need the correct 18650  battery. Your solo might be malfunctioning idk, mine never changed quality on me, the batteries just die quicker over time.
The way he says "Kreider's gonna get a penalty." He sounds so sad. Yes, it was a high stick, the guy is clutching his face. Don't sound so shocked and dismayed.

I found the ball I love to play by picking up lost balls on the course.  I've tried so many different balls, but I'll remember the first B330RX I found.  After playing with that ball, I've never turned back.
Seeing as James Milners contract is expiring and he isn't planning o sign a new one it'll be interesting to see if he bothers flying out. Likewise interesting to see if Frank Lampard plays ahead of his (supposed) move to NYCFC.
If you are a support...why would that suck. Why would boosting your cores suck? I've already tried this as a 4. It's ridiculously strong. I had 3 aghs at the 30 mins mark.

A few things. Either there's something that makes me want to be friends with him but makes him unattractive to me (a personality trait of some kind), or I simply don't find him physically attractive. 
Have you tried the medallion on a support? Can't think of the name but it's so damn good, stick it on your carry during a fight and you've just won the game, well played.
I had a similar incident. I know who reported. The report was not knowingly false but based on a simple misunderstanding, and abuse was determined to be ruled out, but the whole experience was very stressful.  Very literal children and poorly formulated open-ended questioning are a bad combo.  Ended up getting some counseling for my kind of odd kid, who can now truthfully wear an "I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested" t-shirt.
Can't decide on a single favorite player - Temple, for being the dirtiest farmer I know; Therum, for always being weird on TS; or any of the BAID tankers, for completely eclipsing that weirdness on TS.
Crashplan. https://www.code42.com/crashplan/I paid for 5 years of the family plan about 4 years ago. I need to renew soon. I've backed up many a terrabyte of data with them. I like them because their software is crossplatform(java based) and they don't seem to have any limit as to how much data I can send them.
My best example for this is [fate zero spoilers]( /s "when assasin dies i gave no shits because we had no backstory or development, but when lancer died i was heart broken because i could sympathise with his character after finding out about his backstory."). 
It should be centered now. My apologies, there was a value left over from when I was testing the theme before that make all the backgrounds not centered horizontally and I just forgot to change it.
I know exactly what you're talking about. The guy who does the Eugene Yackle voice said that this was the reason Speedy stopped playing with him. Apparently, playing with someone outside of the Crew is purely to advertise their channel. Not because they're friends and enjoy playing together or anything. It's bullshit that the Crew lets ten year olds in YouTube comments tell them how to run their channel.
I can play bass/drums and I plan on singing, I also got a friend who's willing to learn the songs on guitar, so I'm gonna show them to him and once he's got them down we're gonna head into the studio and get as much recorded as we can (hopefully 4-5 songs).
Rape isn't consent. And they didn't say only people were raped. Abortion should be the right of each and every woman as a mass of cells shouldn't dictate their life. Denying them choice what to do with their life because of a fetus is also denying that fetus what they want to do with their life when they are finally cognitive enough to decide.
Running from prof. Moody while he was trying to do the death curse on me. I was telling stupify and throwing my wand. Somehow the wand kept appearing to my hand so I could throw it and tell stupify again and again. 
Well i mean we were dying around the corner in our practice matches against FOOL. It seems they had it easier with this problem which made fights even harder. These 1 second delays depanding on how server is behaving is one the main reasons why RO stopped playing 12vs12 scrims.
The hypertext attached specifically says to just avoid mushrooms all together. It can take days or even up to a week to feel the poisoning effects. Which is way to late to do anything about it. 
Yes and no.  It's still a fairly new channel, but there is a viewer base around for this.I'm trying to make it something people WANT to watch.  Not something found occasionally when someone is curious about a specific whiskey... although both are good :)
From what I understand, depositing large sums of $ from money orders in your bank will probably trigger a fraud alert and potential review of your account. I wouldn't chance it. Cashing them at Walmart may be a good option, ONLY if you are doing it for minimum spend. For regular manufactured spend/churn it is not at all worth your while. 
And yet many here are unaware of its origins. Edit: tongue in cheek means everyone is in on the joke but the person who first used it in this thread seemed to actively believe stan = fan.
Awesome. I have never had one before, I remember getting them from pencils and pens back in school but they felt more like blisters from gripping too hard. I don't remember much of school.
&gt;LoL's meta and entire game structure is based on it's business model.Elaborate. I don't understand. Are you trying to say that only portions of the entire champion pool are viable at a time so more skins sell? I don't think that's true. Most of the champions that are super good are good because of concept and not numbers, so they can stay relevant for a really long time. (ex: Orianna, Lee Sin) the unfortunate thing is that once champions fall out of favor they fall out of favor for the same reason, and number buffs can't bring them back in without making them TOO powerful. (ex: Malzahar, Evelyn )
A georgeous blond who can rock a little black dress. You are engaged to a Dr, CEO or Nerd?   Ok. The last was a reach but i had to hope9/10.   Damn closest to a 10 that i've seen here
I'm a woman. I love video games. I know a huge number of women who like video games, sports and action movies. It has more to do with individual preference than gender, really.
Yeah I was like "what, do black people not have places to be even when it's raining and they don't have a car?"And I realized I was about two steps away from a racist joke about unemployment or lack of education and cut myself off there because if I start generalizing people I'm no better than tumblr.
Yeah, In the Mood for Love is one of my favorites. I highly recommend Chungking Express and I'll definitely be looking out for that book, it looks really interesting!
I'm not talking about the homeless and drug addicts. I'm talking about people who are content with living off welfare. Yes, rent and food is a given. Although the government helps out a lot with that too in the form of food stamps and rent assistance. If they've got that covered, and they have enough money to buy a bit of week and some smokes, a lot of folks are happy. This idea that they will still be motivated to go out and find work because the basic income won't be enough, is wrong on two levels. 1) If it's not enough, then what's the point. 2) There are people who would rather not work, and not just because they are lazy. They could be depressed. Whatever the reason is, you've got to acknowledge that if given a basic income, there will be people who choose not to work (even if they have the opportunity to work).
Might be because of tourist trains and internal/external cargo going on the same track. Try segregating your rail lines (international cargo, international passenger, local passenger and local cargo). 
Sure. I just don't. Sorry I just don't care that much about tipping customs. I read about other stuff I just don't care about tips. Sorry, really I am. It just isn't important to me. I don't care. 
Robb blushed. "I...uh. Yes. I like my home. Hope you will too." He sputtered for a bit, trying to form words, but was rescued when his uncle clapped him on the back."Young Robb here seems to be a bit tongue tied by you, Annie. You're a very pretty girl." Cortnay smiled at her. "I'm sure you'll make a fine wife, if the Seven will it." He turned to Rodrick. "Accommodating your men will be no trouble at all. We'll be happy to have you at Parchments with us."
I wish they would book Rollins like a badass like they did at Royal Rumble and not like a chicken heel. He is the biggest pussy kayfabe wise. I get that's the point, but I wish we could see him booked in a better fashion. Some may disagree and I understand why.
I've used it before, it's basic but it's similar to the basic profile stuff but it takes 2-3 weeks to arrive and it usually comes in a ziploc bag or plain plastic instead of a box. Still comes with plastic silver plugs. It might be a bit short for a wide bar but it's not terrible. So cheap might as well get a few packs so you can change it whenever it gets dirty or mix up your colours.
GAH! Motherfucking Hyperdimension Neptunia on PC is LOOOOOONG! And that crafting system is just straight uncomfortable. Hope it gets better in next game. 
Cant count the amount of times ive dropped the uad emus on a track just because it was easier than patching in one of the analog units.  Was kinda POd when i finished building my first LA2A and it sounded almost identical to the plug. (and if i cared to adjust the presence knob inside the unit i could probably get it even closer). But thanks for writing that.  To add to the asinine stories, had the avid rep tell me straight faced at namm this past winter that my studio would be out of business in 6 mo. if i didnt upgrade my pro tools version to the latest, because "Steven Tyler wont go to your studio if youre not using the latest version". He looked a little upset when i said tyler wouldnt be booking my studio either way so it was an invalid argument. So coming up on 15 years in business, still getting booked 4-5 nights a week...  
I had some awkward sex time with a girl in high school and we just weren't compatible. She told some people that my dick was the size of a pinky. I confronted her and told her, "If your going to talk about my dick size, at least get it right. Its the size of a thumb."
This trip begins at the Upper Chena Dome trailhead (Mile 50.8 CHSR). Begin by hiking up the Chena Dome trail until you gain the ridge. After about 2 miles take a right to head down a North ridge into the Olympica creek drainage. Olympia creek is a very small creek that may be runnable at high water, but there are many log jams. It is easier to put in at the confluence of Olympia creek and the West Fork of the Chena. As of last year, the West Fork had a 2-3 impassable log jams on it. These required some bushwacking to get around. Continue along the river until it meets up with CHSR at any of the takeouts.

Thats due to the societal climate in this nation being so full of race baiting in this day and age.  But yeah, the comparison is due to the two individuals behavioral attributes.  
It's kind of nuts, that's why it's hard to follow.  The theory says that Tuesday Weld, sixties actress, was at the center of a satanic underground. She does pop up in a lot of places including the Stones song Ruby Tuesday. She had connections to the Sharon Tate murder and to a ton of esoteric goings on during the 60s and 70s. The guy who is talking about this theory is named Jeff Turner and there was an amazing documentary about him called I Think We're Alone Now. This is one of the weirder conspiracies to come out of the sixties.
It's an HD stream. It's just got some fun things you can snap to while watching, like instantly bringing up the draft ticker to browse on the side while still watching the TV coverage. Plus, I can watch the draft without having cable!
&gt;If I am a legal CCW holder, I am allowed to draw and possibly fire on someone who is attempting to falsely imprison me or rob me.I just would like to point out that you can use lethal force only when you're in danger of death or severe bodily harm. It's not a simple "Guy was doing this so I can shoot him."&gt; I'm not suggesting anyone draw on a cop, but it would make for an interesting situation.I'd say that if a cop is facing you, especially one with ill will, chances are he already has the jump on you before you can reach for your pistol.
You would really enjoy a new router. Range and throughput have greatly increased. You probably won't need any repeaters if you buy a brand new $20 router.Anyway, what does the manual for the router say about WPA2 ?Have you factory reset it recently ?
Where the hell do you get off telling me how to define RAPE. I know very well what rape is being a victim myself almost every week of my life since I was 15. The "man" in OPs post raped ops friend when he forcefully took it upon HIMSELF to think about her in a sexual manor and intrude upon her life and even commenting on her "pasty skin" with ZERO regard for her true inner racial indentity, this "profesional" should be found and chemically castrated
&gt; Yep, Reddit doesn't have its SSL certs in order for the NP subdomain.Not quite correct.

Somebody who wants to share a duplex with me so that we can see each other when we want and have our own space when we want. Preferably somebody who likes military history. Somebody who doesn't want kids. Somebody who has traveled the world and preferably speaks several languages and would like to continue living in various countries. Somebody who knows how to clean up, put on a decent show for the public and be articulate but most of the time doesn't give a shit. Not an axe murderer. "Nice" is relative. Obviously, I'm not going to put up with anybody's shit, but I'd prefer my partner to be respected rather than liked. No preference on gender, really. 
I'm going to say MTL. Price has to play out of his mind, and honestly I would not be shocked if all the pressure and constant running eventually gets to him.
I would advise against using RBMs nowadays. If you want to pre-train a deep autoencoder, you can just train shallow autoencoders to do that. It will work just as well as training an RBM and it's much simpler conceptually and in terms of implementation.But depending on the problem, pre-training may be unnecessary anyway. Just build a deep autoencoder with ReLUs and possibly dropout and you should be able to train that end-to-end in many cases.
Today officially marks the end of my spring semester woot!Guess I'll finally start playing Fallout: NV. It's been sitting on my desk for the past year or so collecting dust. 
Well, easy if you consider drilling, refining, shipping, and marketing to be easy.  But I'll admit the fact that it blows up with you set it on fire is very appealing.  Harley Davidson bikes have deliberately mis-tuned sparkplugs to celebrate that aspect of fossil fuel with a big growl, not unlike a dinosaur.
We are offended that Indochinese observers were not invited to this referendum. While we do not question the integrity of the New Zealander observers, we feel that given the suspiciously large majority by which the Burmese people supposedly voted in favor of joining China as well as China's history of attempts at illegally imperialistic expansion in recent years, it remains very possible that foul play was involved. Given these factors, we feel that we cannot in good faith recognize the results of this referendum and as such shall continue to regard Burma as illegally occupied territory.
Detroit MI - Kroger grocery stores carry a decent selection, but 5 Below is the best value, they are always 5 for $5. Bonus if you know someone who works there too, and can use their discount for you, 5 for $4!
The only way i'd do that and the only way it would make sense is if 50% of the profit goes to that team.So let's say i love TSM and they are doing great this split, pay for it, show you are a die hard fan. They get something, you get to show your support and rito gets to rake the cake.
So basically you have two accounts and now they are about the same rank?Isn't that exactly what you would expect to happen? It happens because your skill level is around that silver 1 to gold 5 level.
Here, [take this](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection). It's from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a highly reputable non-profit dedicated to issues of software and web security. It has cheat sheets for preventing a lot of different types of attacks, including SQLi, XSS, CSRF, and more.
The problem with Labour on the economy was that they continued the de-regulation of the banking sector and allowed the UK economy to be exposed to such a degree to it, both of which began in the 80's under Thatcher and Reagan, not their spending/borrowing which was fine up until the crash and they had to prop up the economy (admittedly, had they built up a surplus when the country could have afforded it then they wouldn't have had to go so far down the hole to save the system).
No doubt he has an argument, i just never got the feel that it was the consenses like Jordan is more or less the consensus GOAT, i think LeBron is most likely on his way to undisputed #2.
I'm a bit late to the party (pun unintended), but I'm intrigued in a game. It'd be my first serious game (my previous and first game only lasted for one session, and people were mostly inactive - I only remember one character). Skype would be great for me, although my best medium is currently written text.What sort of game were you thinking of? I have a character set up for combat, and another for personal.... wait, you're the same guy I talked to earlier xD Eh, at least you know I'm serious.
Party portraits still need an IDLE warning while in combat. Sometimes my ranged members fall out of range, and it's tedious to keep track of all the time.
Well there are black and white rules about these things. I'm going to give benefit of the doubt to the system here, but sure, they could end up bowing to the SJWS. But still, marketing sterling is marketing sterling. This could be the start of something...
This cycle continues until it becomes as natural as breathing.  At some point, you begin to internalize those negative thoughts and soon, they become part of your identity.  Therapy and counselling do wonders to help repair the damage that does to your self image.

The purple shorts are gorgeous. The home shirt is my favourite though, it may seem like a small detail but I much prefer this shade of blue to the lighter shade we wore last season.
I know how you feel, I can never get home in time to watch it just by virtue of how late school is let out for me and how long my ride home is. I was home sick today, so I got to watch it then.
Perhaps he didn't get the plan until after everything with Thea went down? Before that, he didn't have as much to work with, in terms of options, but when Thea was nearly killed, maybe he realized that he was finally dealt a hand he could play to his benefit.
Pest's door crusade is noble and I doth throw in my lot with him on that valiant mission! Lol. Seriously though I think doors are a worthy issue. The operator class thing isn't too big of a deal for me personally as I don't play with randoms, I only play with real life friends and family so sorting out who picks what will be a non issue for us as we coordinate well together. I do realize many people do play with randoms though so it may be a bigger issue to them.
It's not the "white guilt approach", it's pointing out how dumb it is to make this a race issue time after time.  It's a poverty issue.  And poverty is only a race issue because of the historical conditions.
Well now's a great time to start doing something with it. ;) Get the app on your phone or just check online, link your CC and bank accounts and it'll automatically categorize all your transactions. It'll show what you're spending and you can go from there.

Abathur is wonderful for that map. You have a ton of good mine spots, a lot of easy tunnel objective grabs, and you can sneak a dragon knight activation using a mine for vision and tunneling. (you should have a mine there anyways to scout for enemies when they have control)
The mirror episodes only make sense if you're familiar with the mirror universe that started in TOS.Honestly, go back and keep watching DS9. It gets so much better.
There are two billion Christians in the world, and all the Christians I know are completely fine with gay marriage. It's just some southern idiots making a bad impression.
Dude I was at the fucking US open, the footage was made to fit the narrative, trust me. There were people of every race joining in, mostly minors that were drinking trying to be bad asses.
Is... is this me? I was once invited to play 'dare' with a few male friends - when it was my turn, I dared the poor guy to wank off in the restaurant bathroom.  I'm not allowed to play dare any more :(
At best we supported a suicidal person, at worst we were tricked into supporting a supposedly suicidal person. I don't see how either can be bad.I never got those people who tried to trick others into sympathy as a sort of "Gotcha!". I mean, congrats! You showed that they're good people!
I like the lucian and lee ones. Pretty nice hope they do others for the other champs, wish they would lower the price or let me buy single ones but I really do not care. Riot is a business and they need to make money, rather they do this option practice than some other form of monetization that is an actually problem and we are forced to deal with. 
Hi,My name is Nicholas Cantacuzene and I am related to the Cantacuzino who this institute is named after. I don't speak Romanian and was wondering if you could explain this to me in English.
Reach in your pocket and "accidentally" let a stack of money fall out... then tell her how much trouble it is finding things to spend it on... hook. line. sinker.

/u/mtm028 can jump in here if my atheistic understanding of the bible is in error...That all sex outside marriage is immoral according to Christian theology is not in question here I believe.It is established in Corinthians 7:2 and Matthew 19:4–6, Mark 10:6-9 among other places that marriage is a man and woman and in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11,  Romans 1:24-27 and other passages that homosexuality is immoral.It seems to take a different tack from some churches such as the Anglican that homosexuality itself isn't immoral, only homosexual activity.There is one that is more open to debate, Matthew 19:11-12, which discusses men who are eunuchs since birth who are not to marry.  Talmudic scholars treat the same reference as being about gay men. 
I've always wondered how that woman that accused that man of rape could have lived with herself.Edit: The point is: it didn't happen and she caused the Greenwood riots.  But thanks for the downvotes for whatever reason.  You people don't surprise me one bit.
Or get sponsored by a rich org, buy a gaminghouse for the whole team to live in, and then rent out a office where they practice - scrims etc. Look at TSM LoL team, best team in NA at the moment and that is what they do.

What we really need is a specialized hospital unit, dedicated to life-threatening medical problems and other cases where prompt interventions reduce morbidity.  Things that can't wait until morning or be handled with a routine specialist referral.  Think STEMIs, strokes, major trauma, things of that nature.  We could even make residencies to train doctors to handle these acute medical issues, and train medical technicians to stabilize patients and transport them to these facilities.The one thing I'm missing is a good name for this unit.  I'm thinking _____ Department or _____ Room, but can't find the right word to convey its purpose.

Mech mage works pretty well. Throw a Foe Reaper in and save it til phase 3 and you're pretty much good. I heard using KT at the start of phase 3 makes it cake too.
This is stupid. If you don't like the game don't play it. If you want to get better get better. There is plenty of resources and someone gave you an example of a character to use and you threw their suggestion in their face. Play a different game.
&gt; Anything without a lot of characters in it, or where the plot doesn't require much talking would fail, even if it has a strong female lead.&gt; Run Lola Run comes to mind. I'm sure there are lots of others.You would have to demonstrate that there is a significant percentage of films that has too few characters that it would skew the test.The vaste majority of films have a decent size cast. Taking films out of the test like "Run Lola Run" wouldn't skew the test that much. Gravity was cited as another example that I might agree has too few characters to justify including it in the test..(despite having maybe 5 or 4 male characters).
I'd have to agree with /u/40thStreetBlack... It's the collective data gathered from the footprint evidence. Thousands of tracks from all over the continent, anatomically and physiologically consistent, and occasionally even consistent in their *pathologies.* The sizes of the tracks form a bell curve when graphed, indicating a living species with every size and age represented, and casting serious doubt that these could be fabricated and planted by even the most organized shadow group of hoaxsters. For me, the big four pieces are the PGF, the Sierra Sounds, the Cripplefoot tracks and the Skookum body cast. They all corroborate each other as well as a thousand other footprint casts and a hundred thousand witness testimonies. 
Firstly, no way he's going to the University of Michigan. They can't offer him the money or the clout. Well, he certainly hasn't committed to coming back to Detroit yet which is where most of the speculation comes from.Bob McKenzie/Pierre LeBrun has said that Babcock wants to set the market standard for coaches. If Babcock can get a much higher salary, every other coach's salary goes up as well. Also, cause he might want to set a different legacy by winning cups elsewhere too. 
They have a lot of food sources around, fish, algae and fungi so starvation shouldn't be an issue. However, that can't really be called a balanced diet so maybe some malnutrition could come into play.
Yes you should be set for Breakfast @ 8 / Lunch @ noon / Snack @ 2:30? Dinner you might be able to get something during one of the after hours events but I typically go out for dinner. The food actually isn't all that bad. 
15-25 eggs a day is not safe. Eggs are a protein source but they are also high in cholesterol. Putting that amount of cholesterol in your body every day would definitely raise your cholesterol potentially causing hyperlipidemia. It will be very hard on your heart. The American Heart Association recommends 1-2 eggs daily. 
Yep, the drag is what is making the rocket flip. Given a body with drag that is equal, heavy side will nose down... Right now your drag is overcoming that moment with its own and forcing the lifter into something resembling a dart.
Basically the UNThere is an International Court of Justice that is (currently) set up in the Hague (Netherlands)Part of being a member nation of the UN is that you agree to adhere to international justice, which includes allowing anyone accused of war crimes to be tried at the HagueThe judges are elected (from a list of suitable nominees) by the General Assembly and Security CouncilThey are basically "tracked down" though by whoever is closest. The UN will vote, pass a resolution and then assign people from whichever country is most suitable (usually the country where the person lives) to track them down and "bring them to justice"That's how it works in theory anywayIn practice is mainly just a massive circle-jerk 
God I wish the NFL would release footage of team war rooms after the draft. I can't even imagine what it sounds like in Tennessee, Philly, or Chicago's draft rooms right now. And the Vikings of course. They had video on their website of slick rick dealing with the Browns last year and trading up for Teddy. It was awesome seeing how it actually went down. 
would you have said the same about steve kerr?  I agree that donovan would be great for a younger less talented team, but either way you cut it he is going to maximize the value of the assets available, and in a capped league, I am very interested to see how well he does.  
How about [this one](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/51/052.html)? &gt;Although U.S. arms manufacturers were not as deeply involved as German or British companies in selling weaponry to Iraq, **the Reagan administration effectively turned a blind eye to the export of "dual use" items such as chemical precursors and steel tubes that can have military and civilian applications.** According to several former officials, the State and Commerce departments promoted trade in such items as a way to boost U.S. exports and acquire political leverage over Hussein.&gt;**When United Nations weapons inspectors were allowed into Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War, they compiled long lists of chemicals, missile components, and computers from American suppliers**, including such household names as Union Carbide and Honeywell, **which were being used for military purposes.**
Zerker for now, maybe a few asassins here and there, though you could wait a bit and see what anet will do with all the traits / skills and such if you care a bit about min maxing. But yea get a few asassin pieces here and there and most zerker and you be fine.  Sinister for condi'ish, but again, could wait to see what will be bestest. 
Put more lighting in these designated dangerous areas and perhaps increase the presence of security/police presence in these zones seems practical enough. It also has the added benefit of not reducing the female population as being potential victims. Women can't avoid walking alone at night. We work, we study and so we have to travel. Not all of us can afford cars, and not all of us have direct access to public transportation that will pick us up/drop us off directly in front of our homes.

I doubt that everyone gets their own personal tablet, I assume most schools let you use the ones that belong to the school division, and are already installed.    They won't make kids do the initial set-up on school-owned devices. If they do, then that's about as hard as teaching them to log into their email. If they can't figure it out, that's a separate problem.     Anyways, doesn't it indicate they're fixing these problems now?
Which is redundant and likely unused since we can just make small separate groups or use PMsProviding utoronto mail is little more than formality and accomplishes nothing of any particular value for students, facebook is riddled with spam and ads to begin with, groups have moderators, and one should be skeptical of what use facebook has for that email to begin with.What, will some Ryerson student join the group otherwise to try and chirp us over our universitys? Kick him from the group, whatever.edit: ryerson has no room to talk shit anyway lel
What a great documentary! I felt really bad for the South African guy, that girl was just horrible. She barely even kissed him at their wedding, and seemed to be disgusted when he even tried to hug her. Anyways, a great insight into something most people don't take seriously.
Sorry I wasn't disagreeing with you. I'm also a technical trader in the short term. My point was that that market bears almost no resemblance to the one today. 
Did you not even read your source material? That forced sterilization thing stopped in 1981, and there is a lot of litigation in-works for compensation for victims of it. My tax dollars never touched that shit. As far as rape camps go? That is, even being generous, cherrypicking. Rare instances where this has happened, and those responsible can and will be charged with crimes. Acting like billions of dollars are specifically put into programs with the sole purpose being LOLRAPE is...I...fuck, man, I don't have words for that level of misrepresentation!Stop worshiping companies, shill.
Yeah, I'd call it the ESEA community, but there wasn't enough dick measuring and degrading your mouse sensitivity settings.Its like the difference between the rugby team and the chess team measuring dicks.  
I appreciate the explanation and I agree that he is a HELL of a back. But I guess the biggest argument against what you've said is that if he frequently had ankle injuries and a bunch of carries in college, what do you think is going to happen against bigger, stronger defenders and a Shanahan offense that emphasizes running the ball?He definitely has the potential to be the next Marshawn. I think he could be even better than him, his ceiling is that high. But for me he's a risk and it's one i wouldn't necessarily take. I feel like we have to ace this draft and we can't botch our top pick.
ABC World News at 6:30 had a brief (~30 second) mention of his run.  It included no audio or view of his announcement today, but did have Hillary's tweet welcoming him to the race.

Yep, this is me right now. My husband actually made some sort of comment about how much TP I'm using and I just looked at him with dagger eyes. But, this sounds more viscous than that? I dunno, maybe the mucous plug, which pops out of a pregnant woman up to 3 days before she delivers? Or maybe someone just hawked a really nasty loogey and it caught on the side?

3D printing is expensive and slow.  Material prices are between 20 and 50 cents a gram, with specialty materials (flexible, rubbery, extra strong, water soluble, etc) often costing more than 90 cents a gram.   Printing a 100 gram object can take hours, though printing time is very dependant on the complexity of the print path.  3D printing is very good for custom work at low volume or for shapes that are impossible with injection molding.(Mass is a bad metric for comparing cost and time of print but it's close enough to get the point across.  Mass also doesn't give you a good sense of how big the printed object will be because the objects are rarely printed solid.)
One of the admins in the raidcall said that there are no rules to who takes what hero, it was a matter of who clicked first. Then, after I took storm, a teammate of mine started to troll me nonstop because he was mad he didn't get the hero. After that my team backed him up in all chat while telling each other to set me up in team chat like it was a joke. The way the admins dealt with this situation was by giving me two strikes and saying that the person who was mad was a "regular" and that theres no way he could possibly be messing with me. This type of attitude towards newcomers really pissed me off. Any newcomers who want a friendly guild should look towards http://www.reddit.com/r/NoobsOfTheAncient

This is FANTASTIC. My frame data sheet was all in real text and hard to navigate, and this will help me organize it more.How up to date is this? I was under the impression that Pikachu's thunder started on frame 2, not frame 1. I am not sure if I observed it incorrectly, but just wanted to make sure. There are probably more consistent frame data analyzers than me that can verify haha.
it was more of a reply to Hartleh. But yeah kinda hard to believe, seems kinda obvious to me the first time I saw it. I Immediately thought of the mountain glyphs in south america  
You know how I know that your on the right track? I'm JEALOUS of you lol. We have very similar issues, but i'm just a few years younger than you. You need to better yourself, become happy and possibly go NC on her once you're about 25 and can support yourself well! And another thing - work on healing. Venting, PM'ing people on here, etc can be SO helpful in this process.
You literally just need to look to see the only place the fire could come out of, the hole in the rock. Try to avoid that area until the fire and you're good, albeit easier said than done but it didnt seem like he even made any attempt.
Players make mistakes. He's young and the frustration just got to him. He is showing his emotions to the game of basketball and it just got out of hand.  He'll learn to control his emotions better in the future.
And by plot you mean lost right? Just because a character is incapable of killing another character doesn't mean it was plot. Madara survived because he was durable enough. Plots not an acceptable answer.
Probably but I can tell you that in the primaries I voted for Hillary, thought she was the better candidate even then. Who did the GOP get out of Iowa? Apparently the results were confused. I just simply hate their "We're first no matter what" mentality. 
The Black Edition card has a better warranty, and is higher binned. I'd say it's worth it, an extra 15P can save you a fair bit of time and money down the road if it fails.
I'm tired of people bringing this crap up. Beating the shit out of kids every time they're out of line isn't the answer. "My parents beat the shit out of me 30 years ago and I'm fine!' Maybe, but I'm sure it turned some kids more violent or made them afraid of their parents.

&gt;Viewed one way it's simply an interesting game mechanic (there are many "types" of people that have similar modifiers), viewed another it's a generalization of a whole people based off of stereotypes of the "noble savage" at home with the earth but too uncivilized for modern city life.I never got the "noble savage" feeling so much as "all citizens are recruited as adults, and natives who are used to outdoor tasks but have never been in a city will naturally be less proficient than people who grew up in a city." The mechanic there doesn't seem to imply any stereotypes, at least to me.&gt; I don't know if you play many tabletop games, but one called "Twilight Struggle" is massively fun, but it boils down the whole of the half century to just a battle between the US and USSR.That actually seems pretty interesting. I'll have to look into it.

Give BSG a look. It's the best Sci-fi show ever. The standing challenge I've had with all my friends: watch the mini-series and the first episode "33," and you won't want to stop watching. It's gritty, beautiful, and has so many characters you care about.

No. It isn't. EULA does not override law, that is correct. However, there is nothing illegal about revoking your access to a product that you paid for since you agreed that you're only having access as the developer desires.
Sorry, no.  Can someone fix this?  In the cast commentary on the Silence of the Lambs DVD, Hopkins said that HAL from the movie 2001 was his inspiration.  You are referring to his adjustment of the character for the sequel Hannibal which takes place in Florence.

There is a keyserver network. The machines talk to each other using a special protocol:https://sks-keyservers.net/https://sks-keyservers.net/overview-of-pools.php
"Possibly in Michigan is an operatic fairy tale of cannibalism, desire and dread in Middle America, a densely collaged narrative in which Beauty meets the Beast in the surreal landscape of shopping-mall suburbia. Two women with a penchant for "violence and perfume" take revenge on their animal-masked male persecutor. In this contemporary rendering of gothic enchantment, victim becomes aggressor and the familiar becomes the fantastic. Condit reworks popular narrative conventions using black humor, sing-song dialogue, and ironically gruesome images. Constructing a comically grim fairy tale of dreamlike pursuit and sexual violence, she inverts traditional Freudian metaphors to impart a subversive voice to her transgressive heroines: "I bite at the hand that feeds me." Possibly in Michigan is a classic tale of psychosexual horror, retold as an irreverent fantasy of the other."[Source](http://www.eai.org/title.htm?id=933)
No, I really don't get why he got so mad. I hated how demeaning he was about it to, he didn't just say it once. He kept repeating "really? ironing on the bed??" over and over again. 
I heard we wanted to move up to take Amari. I don't know what to believe anymore though, haha. I'm just going to sit back, drink my beer, and enjoy the ride.
Lamictal hasn't done much at all for me. I've only been on Depakote 2-ish weeks now, but it seems to have been helping a LOT. No weight gain on either. Hair loss with depakote. Somewhat significant cognitive impairment with the depakote though, which I find to be one of the more concerning side effects. Rather disappointing in that regard :(

Because their sale sucks relative to pretty much any other company's sale. Stuff like $22 for Black Ops, which came out 5 years ago. The only prices that seem reasonable (although still not super exciting) are their non-flagship products.
They can server as N6 only in a CSG, most CSG are moving to a N26 model. Currently they see IW/IP/INTEL as all the same group when it comes to command XO/CO, but on a ship O-4 and below it is rare to see em Crossover. IWs are the least limited group in the IDC when it comes to possible jobs.
Agreed,  I like the traditional feminist definition of someone who wants equality for both genders. They are still out there.  Sjw is perfect for the rest. 
Dude why do you even reply to people like him? You could be Steven Hawking and this guy still wouldn't listen to you because of your rank. There's honestly no point in communicating with someone that stupid.
A 15 year old could've slept with 10 people before hand, but regardless of that, if she says no it means no. Previous sexual partners is totally irrelevant.  
Aside from the fact that we just reached a deal to hand them over to a country with an even more blatant disregard for human rights...And the fact that several of these refugees are being forcefully returned to countries where it is KNOWN that they will most likely be tortured and/or executed.
I've been railing these little blue bits of serenity since Monday evening. Was going to take a break today, but that idea didn't exactly become reality. Going to take a break tomorrow instead. And, either Saturday or Sunday I'll be sober as well. Wish I had a few valium to aid me here. 
Well, the address makes locating it pretty easy, given the area where it's located, but I can understand your not being able to figure out the logistics of this with no time to prepare at this late point, just a day before the event. Hell, I work about twenty-six blocks from there (probably off by a few, since I'm not sure where it's located in relation to 7th Avenue), and even I wish I had known about this earlier in the week.
Most of the west was not very pro Soviet or Chinese communismVietnam had natural resources that both sided wantedThe west had set up a government that was not what the Vietnamese need to be happy and productiveThe majority of the population was not educated in politics or economics [outside of barter] The Cultural Revolution in China inspired communist revolutions elsewhereAdd some guns, a draft, the occasional war crime....good times, good times 
Now that the last wing is out would you consider adding any of the new card? Solemn Vigil, Blackwing Corrupter, Volcanic Drake, and Nefarian all seem like possibilities in different Dragon Pally archetypes. A more tempo/midrange version of the deck might include Drake, Corrupter, and Vigil with board clears and little minions to trade for huge swing turns. A control deck might use Nefarian, Corrupter, and Solemn Vigil.I guess what I'm saying is that Corrupter is almost too good not to play in a Dragon deck and Solemn Vigil is very powerful with Chromaggus, Muster, Equality, Consecration, etc. Any thought?
Pushing religion on children who are more interested in making sure that they please and emulate mom and dad than to actually stay true to what they may or may not believe if they had been given a chance to pick for them self with a free and clear mind. Oh and using a religion free game that is popular with children as a medium to push your religion because it dose not appeal to kids on its own. 
yes any type of indies would be great! I just wonder if there is any interest or following of people who want to see this game on 3ds or if it was just me lol!
The game is not open source, no. It's the Skullgirls engine. We don't own it, we didn't buy it, Mike Z and the labzero team generously gave it to us for this particular project. We are making minor edits to it to suit our needs/pipeline but it's very not open source. And off topic answer: no I am not involved with the fandom any more! I only knew about this thread because someone summoned my username! After Fighting is Magic, creating the first reddit pony and downvote pony, creating the mane six + template for the little pixely desktop pony walking sprites that I see literally everywhere (even on googlechat if you type /ponystream!!) I think I got kinda burnt out after the whole thing. I haven't personally seen a single episode after season two so I am pretty out of touch. 
Would you say that you had increased anxiety in classes where the teacher was less predictable? It's interesting to me that you were able to get so much from this teacher (including valuable social skill stuff) and it seems like predictability played a huge role in that. What do you think it is about predictability that so strongly impacted your ability to learn?Thanks!
I'd also like to expand on the fact that marriage is an older concept than god.  Hammurabi's code of laws has sections on prenuptial agreements and that was millennia before Christianity was a thing.
I'm inclined to agree with this, I know several people that have had great long term success with Weight Watchers including my sister-in-law who lost a ton of weight on it and kept it off. It's certainly not for everyone and sometimes they backslide (Let's face it, must of us put on some weight every once in a while because of life), the FA acceptance movement calls it yo-yo dieting when it is overweight people, thin people it is just holiday weight or turning 30, or having a kid, stress at work, etc.I think one of the great things about Weight Watchers is even after you lose the weight they encourage you to come back to meetings as often as you want for free to keep you on track, to support yourself and your fellow members in your new lifestyles which I think is great. I was honestly surprised when a few of my friends that had lost weight on it mentioned that they kept going back to meetings.
&gt; The US then broke that agreement and established a dictatorship and puppet government in South Vietnam because the CIA reported that the national hero of Vietnam, the communist Ho Chi Minh who had fought Japanese imperialists in WWII and then the French imperialists, would easily win any free and fair election.The U.S. countered a Soviet Proposal for national elections with an elections proposal of its own, which the Soviets Rejected. &gt;But the fact of the matter is that when the US pulled out and the North attacked the South, our South Vietnamese puppets quickly fell like a house of cards.So? That was expected because North Vietnam had a superior military. 
As a social justice campaigner, I nonetheless very much understand your feelings. It's just like when I somehow found myself as a door-to-door salesman. I still hate them, but I do sympathize with them too. Just ignore us if you can, we get it.
I had four days before I had to turn myself into prison for eight years. I had no idea what for, nobody could tell me. I spent the whole dream trying to explain to everybody it was a big deal and nobody would believe it was, they kept telling me it was no big deal, it was so frustrating!
Yep. Parrot owners who let their bird get this close to their other pets are a special brand of stupid. They are more than capable of snapping a 1/2" dowel in half. They will rip Fluffy's eye out if they take the notion.
Multiple references to the "Incident" which was the climax of the AvengersFoggy says he could call himself Captain America if he put wings on his headHe also kinda compared DD to the other heroes by criticizing their suits ("oversized pajamas")On the rooftop at night in one of the earlier episodes the older man with glasses says how every time a hero destroys a block in New York the premiums skyrocketWesley berates the Russians after being defeated by the dare devil and says something along the lines of "I'd understand if it was a man in a metal suit or a god with a magical hammer"After Claire finds out Matts secret she asks if he is one of those billionaire playboys, referencing Tony Stark and a line he speaks in the Avengers I'm sure there are more but those are the ones I picked up onEDITAlso I'm sure if you pause and look around Ben Urich's office during scenes at the Bulletin you could find some easter eggs. 
It is an alternate timeline. There are 3 possible endings to Negima. Without spoiling it: -The "GREAT" end was the final chapter, but Akamatsu said in the manga, it was one possible outcome, and it doesn't match up with UQ holder, so it's not the real one.-The "GOOD" Ending was the chapter before that, when everyone is happy and graduated, and the future is uncertain.-The "BAD" ending was the third last chapter.I've been bummed the whole series thinking it was the "BAD" ending, but something recently made me think it was based off the "GOOD" ending,which is a lot better.And yes, I Akamatsu's decisions have been frustrating recently, but I have faith he'll pull it all together at some point. He created Negima. Surely he wouldn't lose his touch so much :P
Was my birthday. Got dumped, got a meth head in the store who fucked up everything we could had to call the police then clean his shit, someone had explosive diahorroea in the bathroom, got my shift extended 4 more hours an hour before I was meant to finish, bitch manager kept touching my ass, missed last train home. Thanks McDicks. 
Does nobody on this subreddit watch any other competitive sports. Its standard for a team to replace its weak links with stronger players when promoted to a higher division. Saying louis shouldn't be replaced because he "helped them get promoted" is so far from a winning mentality its not even funny. Esports just like regular sports is competitive and you will fall behind and become irrelevant if you don't understand this.
In one of his podcasts he talks about how he didn't know all the pronunciations and ran out of time to try to get all of the many prunciations down. I definitely wouldn't use his video as a final say.
Hrm.  Mix it with a little cheese and spices.  Roll it up in dough and fry it up.  Mmm, fried wontons.   Or just slow cook it overnight in a big pot and the next day to make a nice broth.  Then add your veggies and whatnot.    Or just blast it with some good gravy and call it salsbury.
Remember that episode they found an empty chest with slots for terrigen crystals? Could be that.Also remember the first time we saw Gordon he had a crystal.

how does one leave body parts for family members? when i'm cleaning my nose hairs and really digging in there with the trimmer i think to myself, "I probably have a really great looking skull." I'd like to leave it behind for my kids or grand kids. 
"Punching him" You mean a weak push where Giannis clearly flopped? Even the TNT guys are saying "that's really not much contact there" about that "punch"
Put more lighting in these designated dangerous areas and perhaps increase the presence of security/police presence in these zones seems practical enough. It also has the added benefit of not reducing the female population as being potential victims. Women can't avoid walking alone at night. We work, we study and so we have to travel. Not all of us can afford cars, and not all of us have direct access to public transportation that will pick us up/drop us off directly in front of our homes. 
As in a sociopath would typically tend to do things and not realize they're making people angry. They tend to think for themselves a lot and a high functioning one would do less of that.1
Anyone watching the Jets/Rangers game? Fucking Galley and Randorf ruining this series.Remember when Stempniak scored the first goal at home? Galley said that "the last playoff goal scored in **this building** was by Norm MacIver in 1996", the guy is such a fucking airhead.Edit: http://streamable.com/46lm - Skip to the end
Funny, I think GC is the worst of the new items. I only think it's viable if you have no invis heroes at all in your team, so you can force your opponent to buy detection anyway. If they already have a reason to buy detection i'd much save for Solar Crest.
So you tell me this is good officiating? He punshes MCW in the face and nothing is called and he rightfully ejected Giannis. I dont deny that it was the right call on Giannis. You just have try on both sides of the floor even as a ref.
I tried it a year or so ago. It gave me a migraine when moving or zooming in and out. The lag was really annoying. But it's a nice thought. It feels that their time would be better spent working with a company that has some of the technology that they are missing as opposed to developing it from the ground up.
At the moment it's Bombie's 'nana Cream. I put an order in for Lenola Cream as well based on all the good things I've heard. Funny, I figured I'd hate banana flavors and yet I'm hooked.
You know your team is not playing well when a giant vagina can manage to get your player ejected and drops 19 points on you in a half.edit: Apparently Dunleavy has gained some sort of following that respects his game. 
Not long ago there was a thread talking about how to deal with old news being posted. I know the line was drawn at 1 year old, but i still wish it was shorter than that. This video have been posted countless of times already.
I love volunteering with them so much and I don't want to have to deal with the aftermath if they say they can't afford it or if they dont need me in a paid position. I don't know if I could still volunteer there after that! I actually feel like they would say yes as well which makes me even more nervous about it! :'( 
Not to spoil the fun, but interestingly enough [this photo is of a Pakistani KFC](https://robcrilly.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/a-photo-karachis-kfc-branch-went-viral-during-baltimore-riots/) which is fraudulently being used to promote...racism!
But you still need to have spent the time to get to level 80, which, while fast, isn't as quick as creating a character. You can get all of the profession-specific skins from character creation in about half an hour of creating and deleting characters. This way it at least shows you care about not just the skin, but the class as well. 
Agreeing with Bradley, but if I had to toss out a guess I would say it's because the GF in question uses those terms waaayyy too much and it is becoming pretty obvious that she just *really* wants everyone to know that she knows what 'art deco' and 'midcentury modern' mean and therefore is more cultured than you/everyone. In other words she's being obnoxiously pretentious.
This is all very exciting. Let's make sure we get the message out that the usual way of voting (AKA "voting for a winner") is demolished. Enough people need to start voting their consciences at some point. 
YO SUP MY BROTHA IN ARMS. i got two finals tomorrow. One at 8:30, another at 3:00PM. Macroeconomy and calculus 3... fuck my life... college is so hard... then next thursday i have accounting and microeconomy... :(((((
holy shit was that a frustrating period. can't connect on passes, can't control the puck, players look like they're half asleep and hungover from the pitt series. msg is quiet as fuck. we just don't want it yet. hope av has some words of wisdom for the period break.
My first real girlfriend had a fairly decent "outie." Didn't bother me one bit. I was just stoked to be getting' bare nekkid with a girl. Then again, this was before the onslaught of internet porn, when many kids started seeing a large number of perfect pink giggies and huge dinguses before they actually got down. Guessing it has had an effect on both sides of the gender coin.If I'm in bed with a gal, nothing short of obvious disease or serious defect (I dunno, teeth or something?) is gonna slow my roll. People are different down there, it's just natural. Like the size thing with guys, if it functions and isn't profoundly big/small/disfigured, the only one who reaaally cares is you.Same goes for hair down there. Sure, if I had a preference, I'd go for smooth where it counts with a little fashion fluff up front, but no way in hell am I complaining about a little bush. I think most non-jerky people feel the same.
It's not a slight to Kareem as it is a testament to just how great LBJ has been since he got to the league. It's only about titles and accomplishments when you get to talking about the top 3 players ever.
Q a minion if your stun isn't up.Q an enemy champ if your stun is. Then burn 'em with W.With Ult, stun up and flash you have a guaranteed kill at level 6+. Do R-W-Q-Ignite and your lane opponent will get nuked. Remember to ward, you don't have a real escape aside from stunning them both, and your flash is really important for your combos, too.
&gt;I got some criticism from my boyfriend, who thought I was appropriating gay cultureI would have laughed! I never read erotic fiction but when I was a teen I knew this girl who used to sit at her computer and bash out those fan fictions like nobodies business, she can "appropiate" if she wants because this girl earned it let me tell you

They are found pretty often.

Yep,sounds like what I would have done.  I had 2 retained baby teeth and 2 misaligned adult teeth that were grooving his canines removed.  Cruiser is a young dog, only 2, but I know that his breeds suffer from teeth issues so excellent dental decisions for the long haul are important.  He doesn't seem to miss the teeth at all.
Yes, actually.  Deja vu is one of the many consequences.  Sometimes the new reality is just off sync enough for you to notice.   Death is another.  Think of all of the times that you probably should have died.  Guess what?  You did.  Your consciousness simply slips into a reality where you didn't.  This also explains why we tend to not remember much about our near death experiences.  I imagine that this continues until the realities collapse, and there's no more plausible realities for you to slip to.  I've come to believe that the passage of time itself is simply us experiencing these slips.  That it's constant; not just an occasional thing.  In string theory there's a concept that time passes via planck scale wormholes constantly pulling matter into a frame.  Wormholes are also believed to connect alternate realities.  So, there's some amount of scientific indication that my theory is the case.  
definitely true, it's just that if the picture's shitty, the shitty person in front of you is more likely to own the copyright. if they had to ask for proof of copyright for every film roll/CF/SD/micro-SD card dropped off, they'd have to close up shop.
It's hard to argue over terms that are highly theoretical in sociology, especially when one side doesn't have confidence or even belief in the topic, ie, internalized misogyny or patriarchy theory.
Which is why I hesitated posting it! I thought I'd go for it nevertheless, as it felt exhaustive enough to share for what can sometimes be a complicated debate. Sure, I'll try and correct : 1. The only marriages that should be valid -- if we are to protect what is ethically best and most rational for us (as individuals and in society) -- are those between two people who first, out of mutual and true friendship, *aim for virtue* and then, if possible but not necessarily, intend to procreate (for the good of their union *and* the human race). 2. Correct. "Immutable facts" that depend on human nature and that are and have been gradually discovered by reason. 3. Reproduction is virtuous in the ways described only if "union in virtue" keeps its primacy.

My sister clerked for a judge when she was in law school. The guy would basically let her sentence people; she'd have to write up whatever paperwork and then explain why she chose that specific sentence, and he'd usually dole out that sentence. They had one guy who came in for his SEVENTEENTH DUI. 17. The judge just straight up gave that dude life in jail. He didn't kill anyone and I'm not sure how many accidents he'd been in, but the judge was just like "nope, fuck this dude," and gave him life.
This is actually a ludicrous amount of power.I don't think you have near enough understanding of the power of pull abilities. Take Orianna ult, for example. What you are doing is giving Aatrox a larger range, lower damage, more reliable orianna ult. That's INSANELY overpowered.i like the idea a lot, but they would have to nerf the shit out of his other abilities to make it a reality.
I'm really pumped. I've used Ronaldo's normal card and he was unreal. So was Messi. i've never used either of their IFs oranything in any fifa, so maybe price bands are doing me a favor? * gets shot *
EJ just said this was the biggest Bulls playoff lead ever.  Considering the Bulls beat the Jazz 96-54 in Game 3 of the 1998 Finals, I'm gonna say they did some pretty shitty research on that.The kinda thing that makes me wish I had a twitter, c'mon guys.
&gt; Feminism is hate.I think you're right about a lot of what you're saying, but I would modify this to: "Feminism = Victimization" (of women, and thus making men scumbags by default). No one benefits from this.&gt;Feminism sees men as tools/obstacles to female empowerment.Great stuff! And the really fucked up thing about this, is that this kind of male castration isn't really empowering women. True Male-Female polarity is empowering both women and men.
So Crimea annexed itself? Russia bitches so much about Kosovo and then goes and does something even worse. There is so much evidence of Russian troops in eastern Ukraine I don't know where to begin, we can start with the multiple Russian soldiers who posted pictures on VK of their convoys entering Ukraine. Did you forget that late last summer rebel forces were being surrounded by Ukrainian army and then the Russians came in and forced them back? This is what westerners mean when we talk about Russian propaganda and blatant disregard for facts, not that I expected any less in this thread.
Yes sir just picked up some new gear not too long ago. Extremely happy I might sell the 4k monitor I got because I don't really use it like I thought u would.

The crowd doesn't even like her at shows (chants "blue pants" nxt 4.29.15)...i feel like she is trying to be like a newer Trish Stratus, which will never happen. She needs to find her own gimmick or get the hell out
I bet. I'm old enough to have seen the Berlin Wall come down and the South African regime topple, seemingly overnight.  Things can happen suddenly through a domino effect.
You are/were right. I put 87 hours of work into a project that we had agreed on for $25/hour. He scooted town after I got the project basically ready to launch and didn't pay me more than about $50 since the inception of the project.I feel so much like a fucking idiot, but also angry that I took time away from looking for a job, worked my ass off, and now I'm out $2k and 6 weeks job hunting.I'm asking the guys at random acts of pizza for help tonight, as I can't really even afford noodles for the next unknown period of time.Fuck. 
No. Solar Systems rely on gravitational pull, and objects on a small scale don't have that kind of force. The force of gravity is a result of hugely warped space, which is a result of large bodies of mass, which is a result of lots of "tiny objects".Even if Scientists found a way to make small objects "orbit" each other, it would only seem like a mini solar system, and would rely on an entirely different force to make the "orbit" work. That is a very interesting thought!
`ubuntu` is a symlink to the directory containing the symlink.  It would recurse forever (or until you hit a filename length limit).  I'm not sure the reason why some Linux distros do this, but it has a purpose.
My first was WWF Warzone on N64. I liked making super heavyweight wrestlers, and giving them light movesets, just to see a fat guy (who I named 'Fat Bloke') skipping around and doing moonsaults.The game was really easy though if I remember correctly. Choose Rocky Maivia, keep pressing A to kick a lot and no one can touch you.
I'll get the whole team to put forward their own answers - so since some are in different timezones theirs will come later.JASE: That we can make a genuine difference to people and the environment using the skills we have gained by following our passion.JOLENE: Watching the sun go down with the team never gets old... and what Jase said. 
Although these are good steps to follow for any game in general, it simply doesn't apply in this case. Fighting games have been notorious for having connection issues and mediocre online experiences, but this is the worst I've experienced in...well...a very long time. Not only that but its being pretty widely reported too (although, this might be just the PC, as we have issues even connecting to other players at the moment).
Getting back from 0m on Jool is a lot harder now, since all the engines have 0 Isp at those pressures except for the aerospike, which only has an Isp of 65 s.
I'm with you! I have a few friends that have finished the series and they said it's very worth it to finish. I guess it starts to pick up again. Just have to make it through the slow parts! Haha 
In Germany I think it is not such a harsh cut. Of course you limit yourself in the first place, but even if you go to the lowest school ("hauptschule") you can still continue going to school after an apprenticeship and get your degree to university (via "berufsoberschule" or "fachoberschule"). So while I agree with your point, its not a 100% one dimensional system decided after the fourth grade. Many people just overestimate the importance of going to the " highest" school ("gymnasium") since they fear for their opportunities. 
As an aside, how do you feel about [this article](http://twistedoakstudios.com/blog/Post8887_what-quantum-computers-do-faster-with-caveats) on quantum computing?
I mean in the YouTube comments where it's like:  "AHAHAHA THIS VIDEOS SO FUNNY! +Fraddy Fezbear"  "OMG SO TRUE"  (Giant YouTube comment chain of people acting like animatronics)  It really bugs me.
Yea I noticed that today that some thing that would have had me in bed crying didn't even get to me. I am very aware which is scary and now looking back I've realized that I've had these quite often. The depression tend to out weigh the manic episode but then again I haven't really paid attention just dealing with the BPD is enough. 
The ACC schedule format is based on the SEC format. So yes the SEC has the permanent crossover game. The SEC has it so that Alabama can play Tennessee and Georgia can play Auburn every year.
Yes, I do, for all I see is a giant welfare state, not an economy run by and for its workers.  There are no socialist states, never have been, like I said.  Name one where the state's workers had democratic control over the industries they work in?
Oh, I am a very social person, don't get me wrong. I joke around with friends at school, I meet new people, I date. It's the implications that a guy would have that would make me uncomfortable. You don't have to be so condescending, I understand that some people view school like this. I said that *I* would be uncomfortable. It's not like I'm being a bitch and don't want to be this guys friend, it's just that he's definitely insinuating something, and that's what would be weird to me. 
I'd like it if he referred to his nurse as "illustrious". "Well if it isn't my illustrious nurse, Dana. Now how about getting ol' Stone Cold a cold one."
Damn man really sorry to hear that, I even saw your posts on facebook i live pretty close and have some friends big in the powerstroke stuff. Really shitty about the truck hope insurance took care of everything though, in the end it's only a thing.
My ONLY compliant about this work is that there are too many people reaching. I would have only made 4, 5 at the most. It makes the scene feel forced and surreal. You need some people reaching, some people just wailing, one person turning away, too pained to see their hero fallen. Emotions are displayed in hundreds of ways, and one scenario can trigger 74 of them. People interpret events differently. Think Les Bourgeois de Calais. That's really my only criticism. It's terrific as a whole.
If you look at the last picture he took, it is quite clear that the G4 processed the pic quite heavily to compensate for the backlight (something akin to the 'shadow/highlight' filter in Snapseed.You can spot it by the "shading" that appears in the blue of the sky.

That pistol isn't super effective in combat, at least on PC, but it can be useful. Like all items it has the basic version and upgraded version. The basic version gives you a one-space advantage in combat, when the upgraded one gives you a 2 space advantage.

Well, my parents aren't rich or anything and buying my dress was an expensive and appreciated contribution, so I feel guilty. I'm not giving up my certification though. 
I especially like the win an estate plan/legal service.  It is giving you a jar full of leads, people who have identified their own need for a legal service, and are into the sales cycle of selecting a provider.Make sure you comply with ethical rules about advertising a free service though.  
Work 7-4:30, train 11-12 or 12-1 with 30 minutes for shower and commute.  I train 6 days a week and help coach my daughter (7.5 yrs old) in the 7-13 year olds class 3 days a week.
We don't know, however... Rose's shield managed to save the surviving crystal gems from something aaaaaand they are the only uncorrupted gems on earth. We don't know if this is a coincidence.
BLM have E4E also, so you're essentially saying to bring a SMN for resurrect which isn't really "support" since you shouldn't be dying in a perfect world anyway.I also think they should get something that is valuable, I'm not against having support type Egi since if it's pure DPS people will always migrate to either 1/2 pets anyway. I'm not talking Selene-level of support, but a pet that has one or two support skills to increase party-wide dps or something like that.
  CCSC  https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/december/nasa-selects-commercial-space-partners-for-collaborative-partnerships/  &gt;December 2014:  NASA announced ... the selection of four U.S. companies to collaborate with NASA through unfunded partnerships to develop new space capabilities available to the government and other customers. The partnerships build on the success of NASA's commercial spaceflight initiatives to leverage NASA experience and expertise into new capabilities.  &gt;The Collaborations for Commercial Space Capabilities (CCSC) initiative is designed to advance private sector development of integrated space capabilities through access to NASA’s spaceflight resources and ensure emerging products or services are commercially available to government and non-government customers within approximately the next five years.
Do a sampler from [Mrs Mallbatch](http://smallbatchcigar.com/smallbatchmixes-smallbatchsurprise40packof5-p-1833.html) and put in the notes that you'd like em short.  I'm sure he'll hook you up
Big contracts seem to make coaches and management into gamblers. They feel compelled to play a guy like Howard because there's a chance, no matter how small, that he has one more monster season. And I imagine sitting a guy getting that kind of dough is a more obvious admission of failure.
Eh... If you're really that concerned and worried about potentially getting beaten up or killed... Identify all the potential weapons when you enter a room, as well as the exits.Walk into a room, see a coffee mug? That mofo will hurt when you club someone in the head with it (It likely won't break either, well, the handle might, don't hold the handle). Enter a restaurant and see people that worry you? You're on your own bro, there's literally enough forks and knives in that joint to go all UBW.Look, I'm not saying I'm crazy, but I'm totally crazy. If you are that paranoid of a person, just be aware there is literally enough shit around you at any given point that if push came to shove, you could end someone that was purely on the offense while you were on the defense... With something probably within an arms reach.
I really hope they do. Recently a few FC members have been joining another member for PvP since he enjoyed it and numbers were always low. It's a lot of fun but the queue times are awful. Waiting upwards of well over an hour (I think 3 was the longest anyone waited) with a full party just makes it seem pointless right now and very off putting.We'll continue trying but I'm not sure how long we'll last with those times.
Wrong.you threw that out there to deflect from the fact that I called out and presented evidence of this author's lying about his credentials.   You're are running away from the facts I presented in my post to falsely try to garner sympathy from people on this sub.   No one here is going to fall for this tactic so unless you have proof that the official record I presented is wrong, then there is nothing else to say
All I'm noticing in the Titans war room is the one guy who looks less like a member of the team and more like the teenage nephew of one of the executives, wearing a too large suit. 
Most retail financing arrangements are very heavily biased in favor of the store - high interest rates, prepayment penalties, high origination fees, etc.  Be very careful about this - you might try asking for a personal loan from your credit union. My recommendation though?  Go to a pawn store, or scour the web, for a used ring.  You could find just a stone that you like, and then take that to a jeweler to have a custom ring made to house it.  Then, take the remaining $5k and go do something like [this](https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/lifelong-learning/travel/2015/discovering-eastern-europe).  Most schools have similar programs, and they frequently just partner with larger tour companies that would offer the same stuff without the university association.
Just a heads up... Bullet resistant... And if you're like my pharmacy the window is bullet resistant but the thin sheet aluminum drawer and the window next to it on either side, are not.
I would think that more people became chicago fans once the old man died because games started to be televised, where as you either had to go to them game or listen on the radio to hear them play.
In home room in high school the teacher (former Vietnam vet) told a Vietnamese student for all we know I could be your father. Another Vietnamese student muttered "That's racist" and the teacher went off on him. He made the kid stay after school to right an essay on why he was wrong. 
&gt; pick and choose laws from the Old TestamentAnd the New Testament too. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth. In 1st Corinthians 12, Paul says marriage is between a man and a woman.
The bicyclist was completely in the right here. She was perfectly entitled to ride up the bike lane. Usually, if a taxi is dropping off a passenger, they will pull up in the bike lane next to the curb in order to prevent bicycles from passing. The taxi isn't allowed to park there, however it is essentially an unwritten rule that they can pull up to drop someone off. The driver would have clearly known that there were bicycles coming up on the inside, and the passenger should have looked out of the back window to check for cyclists seeing as there is the gutter bike lane up the inside.
I am defiantly not an NFL fan; this patch actually belongs to my wife. Don't know when it is from, but it is defiantly old and an interesting patch. It is a lot softer than embroidered patches that we are typically use to seeing. If only the 49ers used this gun shooting miner as their logo - that would be great.
The main draw for Black Ops is the Zombies mode (Singleplayer is good for a COD game but Multiplayer is pretty dead), but the problem is that Killing Floor 2 is a better game and it is 10 dollars cheaper.
There's all kinds of conversation/current events subreddits out there. You should try posting this there. I'm going to remove it to keep the posts here on topic and free of social issues.
Ha. I like your style. So for a single photo on a blog, I was thinking of letting them own it outright (it's not even a good photo) and ask $2500, and I'd be more than happy to settle at $500. Am I shooting too high?
I think your theory is quite likely, but I really hope it doesn't come true.  Show!Loras has been characterised extremely thinly and I'd hate him to not get any more depth before being killed off in such a manner.  I honestly prefer Book!Loras, who I think has a lot more going for him.  I feel like the show has tried to tie a contemporary issue (gay rights) into the plot, only to make a parody of a legitimately deep and interesting gay character, and thus do a disservice to the topic they were trying to address.
Nobody cares about t.a.t.u, just like nobody cares about Cascada. It's just nostalgic to a lot of the drag race demographic (early to middle 90's and probably a bit more in europe than in the states) and tacky stupid songs often make for good lipsyncs because everybody is in on the joke and the queen can camp it up.
No, I meant /u/Tomos1 .  He says "international license" in the title, but "foreign license" in the text.  I don't think he has any intention of getting an IDP, which most US states don't require anyway, and wouldn't really help since Australian licenses are in English. 
Sad thing is that some of us would really enjoy those jobs and thrive while feeling good about serving our country, but if you're transgender you don't even get the option. What the fuck does my gender have to do with my ability to even do a desk job in the military?
I'm totally with you about producing too much content. A year ago I was able to keep up with everything on the Let's Play channel as well as the RT one. But as of about five or six months ago, I've been way too overwhelmed with the amount of stuff they're putting out. I've pretty much stopped watching the minecraft let's plays (they've grown stale on me for a while), and now really only watch GO!, VS, GTA, and some of the independent let's plays that they put out (with the exception of they're classics like Worms and Minigolf, I'll always love those). Don't get me wrong, I love RT and I have for many years, but there *is* a thing as too much of a good thing. I've really grown fond of the FH guys now, which I think was a great addition to the RT lineup. This is just my opinion. 
It's technically blue, but when you consider that (to them and many other people) it's 'basically still Chicago' voting THAT much for Romney... Let alone how much people in that county act versus other 'blue' areas.
Hi. I tried it out, and it worked perfectly. Thank you very much for the guide!The only small issue I have is for characters with multiple pronunciations, For example the character 長 can be either *coeng4* (long) and *zoeng2* (oldest). I have a flashcard for "long" but Google TTS reproduces "oldest".Do you know a way I could fix or workaround this?
I disagree.  Star Trek is on a pedestal in my mind.  I honestly don't know of another show that had as much cultural impact.  I'm sure there are a couple, but few enough that they stand above the rest.
A lot of people like the Lucian Chroma.  This made me think about something.  I am much more likely to purchase the base skin chroma than any of the paid skin ones.  I feel like if I spent RP on the skin, I should be able to multicolor it with IP.  But since I can buy the champion with IP, the base skins are worth paying RP for the chroma.  Just my opinion
I also recommend you carry around a gun to, you know, protect yourself from people with guns.  And don't even think about stopping on the highway to help a motorist in need, they're probably dangerous and plotting to hurt you. 
I started playing on Christmas day, and I got my 1st Hawkmoon from the Nightfall(the last time it was Valus no burn around beginning of April), and I got the 2nd one around 3 days later, when I did Vault of Glass Normal mode on my Titan
Less chance of a huge return. In certain situations (for example, not much time left in the game), it's better to almost-guarantee the other team only gets decent field position (say, their own 40), rather than take a chance that they get fantastic field position or a TD.

My friend and I were discussing this and he doesn't believe we landed on the moon. Which blows my mind, but to each there own.I was telling my boyfriend and he says ever so proudly,  "I don't think we landed on the moon either!"And I shit you not in my head I think, "Oh sweetheart. No. Please don't do this to me. Please don't. I love you to pieces but I need you to be logical here." I haven't really addressed it again with him, I just sit there and shake my head every time I think of it. Love of my life doesn't believe we landed on the moon, oh well! 
If i buy this, do i have to replace the card in the near future or can  play game in 60 fps and full hd in the next 2 years? Do i need annother CPU Cooler? 
Yeah I never really purchase anything on eBay always felt like some sellers can be iffy. Amazon is always my preferred place of business for online shopping, so thanks for the heads up.
I had to go through damn near a third of the bag before I found any chips that were even remotely spicy. Good flavor and all, just some very weak marketing. I loved the fiery habanero Doritos when they were available... guess I'll just stick with my spicy nacho for now :)
It would make more sense if there was atleast a cross section showing the relationship between hats, amount people would pay for them and their locations.

Hey; you came into Dota at a pretty interesting time, after the release of a new patch. Don't let it discourage you, because a lot of people are sort of re-discovering the game themselves, just as you are. I'll keep my advice short and sweet: try out of many heroes as you want, and watch Purge's playthroughs if you do. Link: https://purgegamers.true.io/g/dota-2-guide/

Cheers mate that's awesome info!We are going to be in whistler for a few days, but not during crankworks.  Should be an epic trip!  I just need to get over my paranoia of mud and slippery tree roots (just learning about that now coming in to winter!)
Some people use food for the same reason some people use drugs...to cope with something. Shouldn't you also have the same hatred to people who are bulimic or anorexic? Using your logic that we aren't required to over eat...we aren't required to under eat and starve ourselves either. 
Good news. I skipped dinner completely. I'm in the basement. I'm drinking heavily. Best of all, my wife has given me the night off, meaning she'll take care of the kids tonight. This is a first. I guess I should be really stressed out more often. Full disclosure: I love spending time with my family. And they like me for the most part, but I've not been a peach this evening. My wife is giving me a break so she still loves me in the morning, not because she loves me now. 
Yup! and making it a level 80 would just make the power creep that much more difficult to manage. I personally am fine with it staying as level 70. Means I can use it for prestiging :D
We're both graduating college now. He's still struggling to get past this mental hurdle. I'm not saying that was the sole reason why he is the way he is, but if he could point to one incident, it is this.
He becomes much simpler if you stack fire defense.  I've phantomed this guy so much and few people seem to know.  The worst part is his fire breath which can hit 3 times and two shot you with low fire defense.  If you have the hexer or chaos set, use flash sweat, the dispelling ring, and the red flame defense ring +2 you can cut the damage by about 70~80% depending on your int/faith (which boost fire defense when levelled).  If all else fails you can do this and summon help, just not any NPC since they suck for this fight.  Once you can tank his fire attacks he becomes much less of a threat.  His physical hits hit like a truck regardless of armor so dont worry about low physical defense.
What do you see behind you? Not black, just nothing. Blind people see that 360 degrees. Does not apply to people whose vision is just so shitty that they're *legally* blind.

From what I've heard from teammates just about all of those recruiting websites are more or less scams. You'd probably be better off just emailing the coaches directly. 
-The moon is tidally locked by the gravity of our planet-The center of orbit between the two object is located within the mass of our planet-The moon has much lower radius than any object in the solar system currently classified as a planet.-There are currently no classifications with binary planet systems.I have not heard of any serious talk about classifying the Moon as a planet. It perfectly fits the designation of a satellite of our planet. The satellites Titan and Ganymede are both considerably larger, larger even than Mercury and almost Mars, but there is no serious movement to change their classification either.Pluto has a smaller surface area than Russia. The moon is not that far ahead.

A person that likes books has to keep in mind the type of library that they want to work in. I think most people think of a public library when they think of libraries. However, I'm a librarian in a large medical/special library and in my job, I haven't even *seen* a book my entire time there (there are books, most of us just don't deal with them). I work on a computer all day.Now, I do love books (I aspire to have a private library at home one day), but I can't imagine someone who wants to be a librarian simply because they love books being happy in my job. But I'm still a librarian, just a different kind.
so i was doing g2 quests with a random guy, he was pretty good, and the "owner" of the room, after some quests came this other guy, out of nowhere, already waiting with a quest selected, i just waited then picked the quest the guy i was playing before have choose, the other guy said, -faggots, and quickly exited the room, maaaaaan, g2!!! how do a fucker gets so far being such an asshole? 
Sounds better than the time I was 1v5 ct side and all of a sudden I hear the voices of 5 people repeating "we will drag them from our lands" and by then it was too late, the 5 nagevs were too nuch for my body to handle and they penetrated me violently before dragging me back to t spawn 
Is Winnipeg rough? I'm from there. It has a bad part of town, but I consider Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal rougher for Drugs, crime and violence (respectively if you like).Sure Winnipeg has the most murders per capita, but I felt quite safe there.

You don't necessarily have to rely on RNG for most captures. You can capture the Pokemon if you defeat it after getting it to wobble. Chesnaught is the only one I've had trouble with. Personally, I enjoy it more than Shuffle, because I can play it for much longer during one sitting. 
For me, and as most people have said, I don't dislike human interaction.  It's just when I've reached my limit of exhaustion, and people still want to interact, I start to get frustrated, and want to have some alone time.  I have a pretty small, tight friend group that spends most of our time talking online, or in person, but there are days when I want to just hang out by myself, and watch YouTube videos, or movies.  That causes some tension, because they obviously want to talk to me because we are friends, but they end up stressing me out with how hard they press me sometimes.  It's not like I can't hold a conversation with other people, but after a decent dose of social interaction, I need some time to recover.
They didn't Set it up so men can degrade them. They set it up for the sexy theme.  The degrading came in after they got established. Now it make no business sense for a place to close down or revamp their business model for moral reasons, especially when they consciously make an effort to support their waitresses.  Maybe you just don't like the business model or just the people who go there and treat them poorly.  The establishment provides food and food services to their customers. The waitresses choose to work there and are not coerced.   It's just a certain portion of the population that has that mindset of those women is degraded. How they are, I'm not sure. 
For Mayweather it will mean nothing, he would have earned more respect - and about the same amount of money - losing to Pacquiao 5 years ago then taking one or two rematches.Calzaghe's reputation is no better than Carl Froch's.

What's with all the negativity surrounding this article. All this "bull shit" replies. It's a bold statement, but I think it's great and I wish them the best. Despite their reputation, Red Bull are one of the finest teams in F1 and if anyone can close the gap to Mercedes from aero, then they can.If anything, I think it would be great if people could push and hope for them. Imagine if we had Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull capable of wins. That would be great!I am very exited to Spain.
That doesn't mean the still didn't do it. I read a book about nuclear weapons safety in the cold war recently and it's shocking how many of the people who were handling our nuclear weapons were all fucked up.And the people making the policy, while not trippin' on acid, were probably drinking too much for someone with that kind of power.
there's been interaction?the only thing I see bioware doing are harming people who got into an area that SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN ON PATCH DAY! still ignoring half the classes in pvp, sorry marr/snipers I've gotten to the point where I leave a pvp match if I have any marr/snipers on my team. they still haven't unnerfed the slot machine ripping people off with that one. and still run the worst f2p game out there.really the only game bioware is helping is the swg emu.
It is a well known practice to go on closed door rants about parents and/or kids at my school. There's not a single thing that we wouldn't do for our students, which is why we care and are ranting in the first place. The job can be soul crushing sometimes.It's the nasty truthing comments that I think OP is wanting though not the rants.
Right, so it went from none to *one in 1972* to 22 today. Before that it was...zero.&gt;Shareholders like to see women CEOs&gt;&gt;Do you have any evidence to support that? Because I highly highly doubt that. *Sigh*. Go ahead and disbelieve it, it doesn't matter to me. Just look in the paper every fucking week about companies with women CEOs. It's free positive press for *any* fortune 500 with a female CEO. You'd be a idiot to disregard that. I don't need to convince randos (with agendas it kinda seems like) on the internet of something that's way above their pay grade anyway. &gt;What makes you think the pay gap will close here especially when women tend to out perform men when it comes to making money for a business?Unless you work for a venture firm and have solid insider knowledge to back this up (you don't), I'm going to wish a great day and peace out.Fucking reddit. Try to have a reasonable pov and discussion and the ideologues come out the fucking woodwork. 
I support most of the choices here, but I don't get why more people aren't considering Katya. I know she doesn't really go around comforting other girls, but she seems to get along with everyone and hasn't really come off as rude. I think she's deserving of the Miss Congeniality title.
The only comparison i've heard is that people with Drivers licenses are operating "heavy machinery" every day. How are you fit to operate a car and not an aircraft? The idea being a single car can take out a line of school buses, or a plane can crash land in an empty field.
Don't know about weather.com, but weather predictions are based on atmospheric conditions. 60% chance of rain means that historical data shows that 60% of the time when the atmospheric conditions were the same, it rained. At least that's how I understand it.
Yes, the wipe and patch for test server might be going on now or they're working on it. It's usually where they stream the live pre patch but we'll have to wait untill next week for that. to come back.
Is it possible for acid to last say 20 hours? for example I take it at midnight and stay up and I feel trippy until I go to bed the next night and have the strongest visuals as I'm starting to get tired. I know it sounds like do(x) but it's more just like my visuals come mostly *after* the trip Is over.
Oh God. I was an English teacher in Korea and the kids would freak the fuck out whenever I said h because of this. They were like, "NO TEACHER, IT'S AIY-CHEEEE!"No kids, it's definitely not.
Eh, that's what happens when people got on the speculation hype-train with no proof.  Even if those were the original ideas (which I don't think they were) it would have probably been far too ambitious, and be super hard to balance, and who needs balance when you have ludwig's holy blade anyhow? :D
I dl'd a bunch of Sandman videos this way but ran out of room and patience. If I try it again, I just want the audio - I don't need bigass mp4's. Fuck an a, I still have Radiolab podcasts I'm trying to consume.On a sidenote, I think the little MGTOW vendetta between Sandman and Stardusk is somewhat amusing, but mostly "meh." Aren't we all supposed to just "go our own way"? I think they should just say, "Noted," and move on with whatever subject they want to talk about.Stardusk does make a point in one of his rebuttals that he doesn't bother to dumb his shit down, he feels most men ought to be able to grasp wtf he's talking about, and there doesn't need to be "beginner" and "advanced" level MGTOW categories. That said, Sandman is like MGTOW fast food, and Stardusk is more of a normal guy, with significant depth. As long as you know that, both can be useful.
Ugh, I hate these frames. There are so many times I've picked up what I thought was a cute frame in the store, only to realize it had some treacly shit about "God" or "Parents" or "Grandparents" on it.
"However, Bentley knew it was wrong to use the drug for the pain of both conditions"That's right folks, it's WRONG to try and ease your pain with naturally occurring plants. I feel society is much better off now this criminal has learnt their lesson...
I wasn't trying to posit some scientific hypothesis, you nin. I was merely pointing out that the same people that disapprove of black riots (ordinary white people who are racist according to Reddit) likewise disapprove of white riots.What confounds is how you whooshed on that.
Well that is good, the way you put it makes me feel that there are enough counter to ensure playing against him isnt one dimensional like pick huskar or lose kinda deal. That is good to see I mean the new item is good bu I feel it is overated. I mean it is awesome to have but getting it is so hard. The spell steal seems miniscule compared to a satanic for example. That being said it is definetly a worthy tier 4 item and surpasses blood stone on almost every bloodstone carrier with the exception of storm IMO.
Youre....kidding right? Media bias of what?The media shapes the way the public views pretty much everything. Are you really trying to argue that people dont watch tv and are influenced by what they see? hahahahah

I'd get married, but for the legal protection the paper gives to the person you love (if you die without a legal document like a marriage certificate, your loved one will get nothing as regarding work pensions etc, even if they are a beneficiary in your will to receive monies that's all they'll get instead of a widow's pension on top) but kids, no thanks. I like being able to play video games all day and I'm 30!

Re: Not going to get into the rest of that, but as to discussing things in private, I can see why. This whole thing has been brewing for some time and is getting out of hand (on both sides of the issue) and I'm sure more than a few people are starting to form the opinions similar to /u/bak1984 below regarding all parties involved.
Ugh, so much misinformation.  No, if another player picks up the disc, it is NOT a handoff turnover.  But yes, if a player is *correctly* delayed under this rule, a legally positioned marker can initiate a stall and continue it even if the delayer runs off.  Just remember that *any* effort towards the disc stops the delay and would prevent a stall from ever initiating.
No they didn't. Shortly after, I booted the less than desirable Bf for unrelated reasons and I had to pay to fix my car (which was next to it) and my front door out of pocket.  While the valve was faulty, the inspection of the bottle and the components became the responsibility of the new owner once the purchase was completed.  It was fun watching him try to tow it away when I kicked him out, though. 
&gt; Wow... the anti-vaccer is being upvoted and I'm being downvoted.Is he/she an anti-vaccer though?  Making the link between why some people are sceptical with drug companies producing fake medical journals is spot on.You don't have to be an anti-vaccer to make that distinction.  People with multiple sclerosis are starting to get sceptical with drugs such as Avonex/Interferon for the exact same reason.Don't blame people for being sceptical, blame the drug companies for tainting the medical professions integrity.Being sceptical is healthy.  If people weren't sceptical, there wouldn't be science.
*Mit his the ground hard in a reckless landing before pulling himself to his feet and screaming to the peek of his voice at her.*"Prove it! How are you different?! I've been fooled way to many times before! So don't you dare lie!"
Cleanse does no remove nautilus ult, ww ult, sion Q, and zed ult, Death Mark can't be cleansed but can be Qss'd, same with WW ulti, Sion Q is a knockup, and you can't cleanse that, and Nautilus Ulti is a knockup too, so you can't cleanse that, I'd take heal in those scenarios and get a Qss after IE+Pd/Ss+Bt (if you feel you'd need it b4 BT then get it before bt
In the same project group that this guy was in, we had another student who was dating a graduate CS major. She was super clueless AND did something -really- dumb. She got her boyfriend to write her portion of the project for her, and tried to pass it off as her own. The level of code was well beyond our capabilities, clearly wasn't done by her (she couldn't explain any of it), and didn't even meet the project requirements or our documentation ... Yeah, that team was a piece of work. Thankfully, I had about 6 other useful team mates.
From the drinking alone you will not be able to get in due to the security clearance requirements. Cyber warfare officers only go up to O-3 and then you must go to a new community. IP officers are a hard community to get into, most of their jobs are fitted for LDOs and Warrants.If you want to do hands on computer stuff then enlisting as a CTN or IT is your best bet.
Most towns have minimum square footage requirements both to boost taxes and boost minimum build cost (and thus the bottom line of local builders.) Even outside of towns many subdivision HOAs have minimum footage requirements, or rules prohibiting permanent occupancy of "portable" structures.
Just remember, you don't become a high school counselor by being successful at life.I'm not saying there aren't some good, dedicated, counselors out there.  Some may be in it for humanitarian reasons.  Just none I met.  All the ones I met were utter failures who were terrible.
If you think two buildings collapsing perfectly and WTC 7 collapsing perfectly from simple fire damage, does not raise serious alarm then youre the idiot
Definitely not.If I could go back, what I would have done was:* 500mg Test Enanthate* 500mg Tren Enanthate* 20-30mg Superdrol I would just have permablasted that on a bulk until I was massive, then cut on DNP and Test until I was really lean.Then I would have run:* 250mg Test Enanthate* 600-800mg Mast Enanthate* 25mg Dbol* 50mg VarThe theory here is that the Test is low enough to prevent use of an AI, the Mast will keep you looking and feeling good with a high libido, the Dbol is enough to allow you to make gains without giving you tits, and Dbol makes you feel great too. The anavar is there for collagen synthesis and joint protection.That's my ideal stack for looking and feeling incredible with a huge libido, minimal sides, and still making solid gains.
Oh shit, this reminded me that I totally need to check and see if the new Fairy Tail chapter came out ~~I'm not a weeb, what?~~ Edit: there is not and I'm sad now
Of course. He is fat, and west coast teams will pass. We don't give a shit about that. His hand strength is like Joe Thomas's and very impressive push and leg push. He would play with Thomas for 10 practices and we would know if he was gonna start or not. 
Again *tier two.* it could possibly, possibly be a good idea to spend it on a tier four. By why waste 10K on something that's only useful until tier three. 
Still addicted to Dark Souls 2, trying to get that dank Platinum trophy. I recently bought Fallout New Vegas Ultimate Edition to replay and I can't wait to play the dlc's I haven't played yet. Project Mirai comes out May in America so I'm excited for my rhythm game goodness. 
I'm surprised you rated Ireland so high. They may have a high disposable income, but from what I understand, the economy is still in really bad shape. Ireland would be great IF you have a job. But most of the Irish expats I meet (and there are tons in Aus) say they wish they could go home, but don't feel there's a future there. These are college educated, hard-working people- so it's pretty telling they've flown across the globe to find work.And to exclude Australia because it's isolated? Yea, it's isolated from Europe and the US; but Aussies travel a HELL of a lot. If you live in the north, you can be in SE Asia easily. Likewise, if you're on the east coast you can visit a number of PI destinations. If anything, I'd look at availability of travel (I.e. Number of airports, modes of transportation, frequency of services, etc.) as a metric for isolation. It was an interesting read and I get that it's not meant to be objective, but I thought I'd throw my two cents in.
I have to strongly disagree. Teachers should never mock students. They don't know what kind of repercussions it could have. And they should know better. It's juvenile and immature. There are better ways to get a student to speak more clearly, like just asking them to.
i learned a card game but forgot it's name lol start with 6 cards face down and draw one looking for 1-6 and if you get it it goes in that spot and you use the down card or discard it, play works around the table till someone has all 6 then play restarts with that person having 5 cards, etc etc until someone gets the ace when they needed just one card.also, i've met new people here lately, watched a documentary on atheism in america 
Exactly! It's kinda sad that my husband  was an emergency c-section that could have been prevented had he listened to my MIL, but he never charged her for delivery!

/u/TheTasteOfAwesome, you were redeemed for 1000 points on April 23rd and again on April 25th. I am not sure what your complaint is about, as you've only gathered 278 more points since then.
Dude like I said let that shit dry on fabric and then tell me it isn't urine. I has FE in it sometimes but it's still urine. If I pee in a toilet and the spit in it technically it's not just pee and distilled ground/ river water, but if you drop your phone in it and it splashes in your eye you got pee on your phone and your eye. It's pee.
&gt; It doesn't violate because all you are doing is taking a screenshot of your profile. Agent Stats is just fancy excel work as said.As kumquatqueen stated above.
Vikings in '03. We actually fudged twice in a row, so Jaguars (Leftwich) and Panthers (Gross) got to pick before we managed to get our asses up there to take Kevin Williams.

Most are plunge and moulded cups, which may not work well for everyone. Padding is also super intense, but a lot of them have a removable option. I have found that once you remove the padding they become true to size. Weirdly, the silhouette they give can be a little on the pointy side without padding. All that being said, they're super cute!
Yeh I think they needed some kind of tutorial for rolling i-frames. It isn't really intuitive that you are invincible for certain parts of a roll and the weapon can literally pass through you. Maybe some kind of fire you need to roll through in the Undead Asylum?
&gt; Oh, and by the way: Unless you want to do the chance events, you have to get good at winning with this ship. Winning with the Engi will unlock a new ship too, but winning with that ship would unlock the Zoltan ship. Thus, you have to win with the Mantis.I've checked the Wiki, and unlocking the same ship via "chance events" would probably be much easier for Pak than a Mantis win, *if* *he* *were* *spoiled*.But without spoilage, he may well eventually get it via Mantis win first, because the first step of that particular chance event requires a very un-Pak-like action with absolutely zero warning that anything significant is at stake.
Oh snap ... ecigs *are* cessation devices. Whodathunkit ?The AHA and ALA must be scrambing to get the word 'smoking' redefined to include vaping right now.Sometimes living in the real world, where one can [call a spade a spade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_a_spade_a_spade), pays off.
It's not really about spoiling story segments, I just want the game to be as fresh and new as possible.  I want the most of what I see to be completely new for me and not having seen it somewhere else.
When I was twelve years old, the teacher was sick one day. So we had a temporary teacher for the day. I think it was the second last hour, we had a test and afterwards when we finished, we were allowed to go to the computer room and do whatever. (Which was very holy in elementary school).Anyways, when the ten first of us were done, the rest was not allowed to go the the computers. So natrually, when all the rest was finished, we started complaining. He asked us to be silent, but we were stubborn 12 year olds, so we continued to complain about him beeing unfair. Suddenly out of the blue, he just snapped, slammed his fist in his desk and shouted: "Shut the fuck up! I'm getting fucking annoyed here! You're all acting childish as fuck! Now shut the hell up before I really punish you little fuckers!"My class went dead silent after that, until a poor girl started to cry.Next day, he was fired.
Hiko at his best is definitely better than both, its just a question of whether he'll be at his best on Nihilum. LG's never gonna be a top team though IMO, Lex is hardly an Invite level player and fl0m and Anger will never be consistent.
The NEX is a mediocre unit. An EVGA (G2, GS, B2), XFX, Seasonic or Antec (HCG, TPC, Edge) would be better. The X61 isn't worth the money, IMO. At this price, a Swiftech H220X or H240X would be better and cost only slightly more. Either that or a Noctua DH14/15 or Phanteks TC12/14. Motherboard is overkill but it's top-of-the-line. The case isn't really worth $90; a Phanteks Enthoo Pro, H440 or 450D would be better IMO. The rest looks good. You shouldn't have to touch the BIOS except for enabling XMP (so RAM runs at full speed - 2400MHz). It takes literally just a few quick clicks to do that. 
Yeah this is the same guy that claimed there isn't a bakery or shoe repair place in the neighborhood any more even though there is a bakery _literally right next door to him_, and Anthony's Shoe Repair just a few blocks up Kearny.
Yeah... I'll admit to being a hypocrite on that, I'm usually the one telling people not to do that. Long straight empty highway though, so while still not right, it could've been worse.
No. It's time the Government remembers why it works for us. It's not some uneasy alliance or some benevolent being to be trusted.The government used to work because it feared us. And it's high time we got back to that.
And I for one, cannot wait for that fucking storm to finally get here. Bring it on. I'm from two towns over (Wayne, NJ) and had guns drawn on me because of a personal vaporizer. Once they realized that it was a vape the amount of "sorry's" I recieved was disgusting. Fuck em.
I've had trouble diagnosing my CFS and am also desperate for answers, and options. Just recently saw a CFS specialist and have been on 500 mg of Valtrex due to elevated Epstein Barr for about 2 weeks. I also have low natural killer cells. My body also doesn't react to stimulants, just got put on Nuvigil by the same doc but it hasn't helped the narcolepsy/fatigue. Have you had extensive bloodwork?
Am I the only one thats completely jaded by everything?Do you expect anything good to come out as a summer blockbuster? Fast and Furious 7 broke all sorts of records, was it really that good?This is what happens when you have too much money and too many special effects and no brain.Don't get me wrong, I'll see it eventually.But going out, paying money, anticipating greatness, munching popcorn. I just... Bleh...
Yep...oh well, I have learned to research or post on here before selling...I'm fairly new and that was my biggest sale so whatever. I ended up with a honors 99 Rodgers and an Easter emmitt Smith 99...sold my 94 Tony Romo and got some gridiron packs...
Okay so I have a question about recovery certificates, when I worked at corporate stores they were given for long wait times, making your drink wrong, general dissatisfaction etc.Now I work at a licensed store and we give them out instead of refunding? I mean that earlier I accidentally hit "Add blueberries" instead of "add espresso shot" and there was a .20 cent difference, didn't notice it and charged the guy- he was SUPER nice but said "hey I am looking at my receipt and you charged me for the wrong thing, would you mind just refunding the difference to my card?" I said yeah of course! But my manager was just like no no give him a recovery certificate... I feel like this is wrong?
If another adult uses the word "furbaby" to describe their pet, they will have to overcome a lot of prejudice on my part to get me to take them at all seriously.
It's good that you know what you like and that you like it, but I think it's good to ask yourself why something sounds good to you. Everyone has a reason they think something is good, be it food, music, paintings, sex, etc., whether they realize it or not.What about vaporwave sounds good to you?
I know it's selfish and fucked up to say, but I'm voting for whichever person has the better marijuana policy. I did my waiting. 12 years of it. In Azkaban. 
Finland was strongly influenced by the Soviet regime during the cold war, and was defined at a part of northern Europe. Finland in particular experienced a strong soviet pull, and was culturally influenced by the soviets. 
You implicitly assume that people only have lots of sex because they lack the ability to restrain themselves.  I don't see why that's true - it's entirely possible (and I think likely) that many people are having a lot more sex than is traditionally "moral" because of those changes in STD prevention and birth control that were mentioned.  The risk reward structure has shifted dramatically.  It may not be the kind of behavior you prefer, but that doesn't mean that people aren't making a rational risk/reward calculation.Also you're assuming that the motivation of polygamists could, of course, be only sex.  That's a pretty common assumption, but not necessarily true either - if sex was the only issue there are plenty of other strategies that don't involve a marriage commitment.
Hi! Great photo! really love the angle and composition.Just a personal opinion here, I don't know if you added that vignette on the top left corner, but I think i'd much prefer if it wasn't there. Let that sky pop through! Other than that, Really compositionally sound photo, I enjoy it!Nice!
I would FUCKING KILL for a cubical. I work in a bullshit open office, so I'm damn near stone deaf from wearing earphones all the time. No privacy at all, and everyone walk right up to you and starts blabbering. 
Or because it actually doesn't require much more than knowledge of high school curriculum. Which, shocker, most people have gone through. By far one of the easier jobs to get in terms of knowledge threshold. And yes I realize you can be a great teacher and know a whole lot about teaching, way more than would be necessary to teach high school. But that's not what's required to teach HS. Throw some work problems at them and tell them to read the book.
He could also fail his test, and then go home to play H5 and have it suck ass.His dog might die too.It could very well be the worst day of his life.
&gt; Couldn't that be because they're less well-known, though? That is what the other poster in this subthread before me said and I agree with him.  He said we already had a Clinton, so we say "Hillary" and we have already had a Bush so we say "Jeb".
The TV ending is a festering piece of unforgivable shit. And basically Gainax admits it. It would be a good show if they just stopped at episode 24. Instead they gave us 40 minutes of a black screen with nonsensical rambling. 
If money isn't an issue for you. You will drop the bike and it will be expensive to fix if its a ducati. Also maintence and parts are quite pricey compared to japanese bikes. But on whether you can ride it or not? Sure, you'll be fine. the 696 isn't that bad. Just as long as you aren't stupid you could basically ride any bike you want.
Well,  considering cellphones had been around quite a while at the start of X-Files,  they could have had them.  I was just pointing out that it is one of those little things that shows how old the show really is.  What exactly is a bumb? And how do you clot it? 
That's my 3rd white horse in 150+ honor summon pulls. The rates are terrible but yeah...I suppose they need more time to paint the brown horses to white.
Gays can already get married just as much as anyone else can. The problem is when they want to pretend *a completely different relationship* is marriage. And to make it worse, that relationship (sodomy) is gravely sinful.If gays asked for legal privileges *similar to those of marriage*, but without trying to taint the term "marriage", they'd get further. Even moreso if they advocated for those privileges equally for other non-sodomite relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, nuns, non-sodomite same-sex flatmates, etc).
Don't forget, though, that [Lockheed Martin is promising us fusion very damn soon.](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/compact-fusion.html)So that concern about megawattage might be obsolete pretty fast. :)
This seems like pretty weak confirmation. Did anyone from Lucasfilm confirm that this is part of the new canon? I mean, they're still publishing the old books and comics under the "Legends" label without recanonizing anything. How do we know this wasn't a "Legends" display?
 &gt;Quarterbacks are all about character. How bad do you want it, how much do you want to be great, how much do you want your team to be great?Cris Carter (I think?) just said this on ESPN and I immediately thought of Teddy &lt;3 So nice to not have to be worrying about a QB for once
**LEVEL 1 CLEARED!**------------------------LEVEL 2:They're both instances of class BarImplementation, and only differ by a string setting passed to their constructor (example: PDO, setting: connection string).
Certainly! But there are things one can do to limit that, (not sure about how to do it on a mech... a kick, maybe?) Limiting the voltage is a good start.
Je ziet het verkeerd. Vlaanderen moet zich aansluiten bij Nederland. Alle Nederlandstaligen in één land! Hoe vet is dat?! Jammergenoeg vonden de Belgen in 1830 dat niet zo vet. Nu is Groot-Nederland verworden tot een vrij rechts ideetje. Maar ik heb nog hoop. Desnoods noemen we ons de Lage Landen! ;)Ik heb mijn TomTom alvast ingesteld op de Vlaamse vrouwelijke stem.
People that don't know what going on and just "Press Play" get sent to whatever public server is getting filled currently. If it's player created, then you're basically connecting to someone's server, and therefore are affected by his mods. In a video game, to receive an animation, you must download it. If there is no rape animation included in the game, then at some point in time, you must download it for it to show up. If you join a modded server, you automatically download said mods. Now some where actually nefarious, it stripped your character of money, weapons and clothes, and gave them to the owner. As far as I know, those were not permanent. Hell, the mods can go as far as reskinning all characters are hot naked chicks. 
At least while both were concurrently existing, I agree.  The later years after the Hospitallers moved to Malta...they became quite the douches themselves.  Rather lost the beam.
Gotta justify that shoulder tackle somehow I guess.Let's be real, MDJ is a pretty normal dude - maybe he did punch someone intentionally, but why the fuck would you beeline across the whole court just to tackle him like that? Hit him in the gut or something that shit's dangerous.
Yeah, I saw a similar thread pertaining to the CZ75-A/Tec-9/Five-SeveN loadout and was curious as to the loadout of others. I used to play with the M4A4/P2000 setup when I was a lower rank, now I'm MGE, with 900+ hours and I've better adapted to the silenced M4 and the USP-S. Cheers for your comment, though. :)
If you'd watched the first 2/3rds of Portland's season you simply wouldn't be saying that. Despite the recent tear everyone's been on against his defense (coincidentally since Zach Lowe tweeted that he thought Dame was awful on D, shocking that eh?) he was actually much improved on that end for the first 40-50 games.Then he hit his shooting slump, his confidence and his defense then slumped with it. This is actually the third cycle like this he's had, where he's unreal for a couple of months, looks easily a top 5 PG, then it drops a bit because his 3 ball stops falling. He had a slump his rookie year, a slump last year, and a slump this year, and every time the media (and the /r/nba echo chamber) jumps on his back like he's lost that ability. It's crazy.He's absolutely worth the max. He's only going to get better with experience.
I like how Oddworld New and Tasty did it's "speed run" trophy. You can replay chapters to reduce your time and once your time is below the three hour mark you just replay the last chapter (which is only about two minutes) and snag that wonderful gold trophy.
&gt;Some people transition just because they feel better as the opposite gender - like fixing your clothes being a few sizes too tight.That's a bad analogy.  You're comparing a mild physical discomfort to a mental anguish.  Transitioning is not like getting a new haircut.
I have access to a service for Rogers that takes 12-48 hours, but it would cost $47. You're probably better off going through your carrier. Any other phone would cost less than ten. Bell would be $35. Too bad you don't have bell.
Ok, my initial 3 opinions are...1.) That would be a super cool way to support multiple teams.2.) Hmmm, not really a fan of buying something that will disappear. Old icons don't, don't really see why wards should.3.) Could be a foothold for advertisement. Wouldn't be a fan of seeing TSM logo in the mid lane or Coke Zero written in the bushes in top lane.
You can start a career game and in the difficulty options panel in the new game dialog, give yourself a ton of starting funds. With funds not being an issue, you're pretty much playing a Science Mode game.The other option is to open your save file after creating it, and delete the entire SCENARIO section about Funding. The game is able to function without it, and will assume you're in a Science or Sandbox game and never charge you for anything.Cheers
1. No idea, really.2. Pokemon. Right now I'm doing my first nuzlocke. I'm playing Uranium Version.3. USA! USA! USA!4. Lit. and Comp.5. Chocolate chip cookie dough.6. Horse sized duck.7. I know a lot on our Lil' Monsters urn.
Ask the same women on a different occasion how they'd feel if a nurse *deliberately* gave a mother the wrong baby in the hospital, and what they think should happen to the nurse and the hospital.  Suddenly knees are indeed jerking.  The difference is, men find both scenarios equally repugnant; women for some reason do not.
It'll settle! I use fluorite in all my tanks, and I don't think I've ever rinsed. A good filter will clear it up in no time. Just leave it on and let it do its thing.
Honestly, speed records don't mean a whole lot of anything other than that guy can move his fingers very quickly. For example, the vehicle with the current land speed record isn't something I'd like to drive to and from work every day. I need something that can do 60-80 mph comfortably and for a long time. That's what swiftkey offers. Swiping with swiftkey may not be "record breaking" but it's a lot more comfortable. Customizable long press, multiple in line language support, it has all the features I want. Sure it's not a Rolls-Royce Spey 202 jet engine, just a 4 cylinder Toyota built car engine, but it's much more practical.  
The two heavier gauge wires are most likely 120 VAC input.  Wire it up and probe the outputs with a meter.  Determining current capacity is a bit more difficult.  You can get a ballpark by looking at voltage droop under load.  You really need to look at core and wire heating, though, and be aware that it can take large transformers like this several hours to reach temperature.
Sure I get the frustration but when you are a professional you can't let that happen. Like, you could get ejected from a rugby game for a hit like that...
Same here! I just hope they don't change too much, with every book that turns into a movie or anything like that it's almost inevitable that something will change. But I just hope that whatever they do decide to change doesn't affect any of the central themes or character traits in a bad way!
If you cited everything, 9% is actually pretty decent lol. It's been a while since I've had to use it, but turnitin gives a lot of false positives. It'll pick up a random sentences as plagiarism from an essay Joe Smoe wrote at Podunk university back in 2005 lol.If you were to remove the similarities from citations, quotes, and references, you're score would probably drop.
I'm taking E&amp;M right now and it's my favorite physics by far because it's pretty much just Calc III.  I fucking hate physics so it's a nice silver lining.
have you ever heard of 1988 shia irani tunnels bombings in makkah that killed and injured hundreds or the 1996 khobar bombing by saudi shia that killed around 20 US mericans or the plot to assassinate king abduallh in makkah 2011 by irani intelligence. its a matter of national security to the saudis you cant blame them if they become suspicious.  this is all shia propaganda you need to always hear the other side story before you develop a judgment. 
Okay are you talking about people who kiss their *adult* kids on the lips...? Because in my family (we're all American with Italian, French, and Irish roots) parents and aunts and uncles all kiss kids on the lips when they're little. And I don't think that is that weird. But I do think it's strange/gross when you see adult parents and kids kissing on the lips like that hockey coach and his daughter that was in the news a couple months ago.
Yes, thanks for saying that. Babies are so tiny that I tend to forget how fast they are, and I often hold them too loosely. They can flip onto their feet and jump out of your hand with no warning. They can take a bad spill on the floor or bounce off of something sharp. They are crazy that way. But nobody got hurt, and all's well that ends well.  
We don't really know how long this dude had tried to be reasonable with her.  At a certain point, escalation is the only way to move a situation forward.
Why the fuck is high school counselor still a thing? They look at a kids transcript, roll some chicken bones on a table, and give a shot of rum to Jo Boo and tell a kid his professional future?
That is actually ideal.  Watch Scott Manley's latest vid, he does just that.Also, http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34d24k/protip_rotate_your_rockets_slightly_in_the_vab/
Well that's really the problem most people don't care how cops treat people living in these poor neighborhoods. And in till people start caring stuff like this will continue to happen. Look at Ferguson the media loved covering the riots easy ratings. But when you compare the amount of on air coverage and discussion of the riots to that of the finding that the DOJ made that Ferguson had systematic discrimination against African-Americans its disgusting.    
This time with Indonesia, east timor, nieuw holland en nieuw zeeland! Oh, and rest of south asia. Groot-Brittannië gib nieuw holland plz. Dont make anglo-dutch war 5 happen. Will end like other 4.
What if you try using back row mage characters with S in your front row and the front row S fighters as mages in your back row. That could be interesting lol  
God, I hated Louisiana cornbread. It is sweet there. For all they do with food that is good and right, they can't do cornbread or BBQ for shit in Louisiana. Now I live in Montgomery, and we still have great options for meat and three here. Farmers Market just changed hands and while not as good as before, is still very good. As long as Martin's never changes, we will be fine here. We also have Payton's place and it is OK, and the hot bar at Dirk's is good, if you are in a mood for modern instead of traditional. 
Well Jesus, now I am.  I was watching a show with an actress he really likes and was thinking how hot she is and then grossed myself out because I sounded just like him in my head.  Ughhhhh.
Tesla can't even get combined output of 691hp (best guesses so far are just north of 550 at any given time), what makes them think they can do 900hp combined simultaneously???And Tesla's engineers are about as smart as they come, no way they forgot about 29% of anything.
To be in a research role you should probably go for a PhD.Even with an MS you're unlikely to be engaging in commercial research for that kind of system. (I'm currently in a PhD program in a related field in bioengineering.)That being said, the best way to figure this out is to try to find job listings for the positions you're interested in and see what they're asking for in terms of qualifications.Also, keep in mind that most PhD programs have an option to drop out at MS or MEng if you realize the full ~5 years isn't for you.
All I can say is that I hope the showrunners put half the thought into how things turn out as you do here. Good theory! And it would make all of these meandering flashback scenes relevant for a *very* delayed payoff.
Trade secrets? I think its more so young Steven thinks twice about telling his boss to fuck off then go down the street and get another shit-paying job the next day.  Non-competes for sandwhich delivery boys is fucking insulting and no one should ever agree to sign one for a sandwhich store.Edit: op clarified it does not apply to hourly employees.
&gt;Can I at least get through the first section of the paper without having to see another article about gay. Enough already. This is not top priority stuff.Behold, the very image of privilege.
&gt;Her dad brushed it off; apparently she was ‘beamed’ with a pitch and it caught her in the head.Holy fuck.  If that were my daughter, I would have taken her to the hospital immediately.&gt;For the 1st couple seconds the dad was objecting,What a fool.  I'm actually pissed off right now
its called constant tension and what hes doing is the correct form for that specific exercise. I bet you wouldn't be able to do each of those exercises just for 5 reps in a row. 
Who stands to profit?Cartel wants turf;Cartel informs FBI;FBI bust competition;Cartel has immunity;FBI gets promotion;FBI early retirement with bigger pension;exFBI goes into politics;exFBI gets huge donations "to run campaign".
I have a Lumia 1020 and I love Windows Phone, plus the 42MP camera just means when I'm out with sisters etc they just ask me to take the pictures of them for their walls on FB etc, because their galaxy S5 or iPhone 6 still can't compete.I think yes it is the apps that are the point people don't like but I think WP is a great platform.
No hack-a-shaq is done outside the final two minutes. The Spurs are able to foul Jordan whether he has the ball or not and it is just counted as a regular foul as long as there is more than two minutes left. 
Ugh I know the feeling of having a very derpy snek... My bp once got stuck in the belt loop of my jeans... He was walking around casually on the couch and I should've paid more attention coz he decided to go in the loop and of course he's too big so he got stuck. I tried to remove him by trying to make him go in reverse but he got very tense and wouldn't sit straight - probably because he was scared :( Almost panicking, I rushed out of the room with him to grab some scissors and cut my jeans... Edit: I might have been more scared than him x)
I was wondering if the window on that side of the house [not having the EoP/Bill image in Northwest Manor Noir](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gravityfalls/images/f/fd/S2e10_rainy_day.png/revision/latest?cb=20150218012613) was an error or correction (like the stairway error) but now I think it's a correction because of that detail.
This is the first post I've read where a different perspective regarding the Ukraine has been offered.  I really appreciated it.  Sort of cynical, but it rings true.
To be fair, the four eggs in the album fed both my wife and I. And I love that you wanna change it up.The next time I make this, I'm gonna use sour cream instead of HWC, and I'm gonna top em with salsa instead of green onion. It's gonna be fantabulous.
So wait... Rollins is showing confidence and determination after being bullied by his boss into having a match where he has almost no chance of retaining. How is he not a babyface?
I'm in the exact same boat as you. After having had one internship for one summer, I realized that the challenging design projects rarely came, and that much of graphic design was the monotonous 'bitch' work. The fact that most companies also chose the safest designs of your concepts were also not much help. I recently got into an in-house situation, and while there are some problems that required more design thinking, it still consists of a large amount of setting type over predictable images that are not as stimulating

are all cops retarded when it comes to dealing with people/animals? i mean a dog has natural instincts and if someone barged into your home, and looked menacing like that cop was with his gun drawn, the dogs gonna get excited, it cant tell if thats a cop with a gun, and for fucks sake its a dog, can they not take theyre riot stick, baton or whatever they use now to just give a dog a swift hit and drive the dog back, no need to use a gun.

Model minority theory is exceptionally well supported, and exists for a variety of reasons. The most obvious is pay- Asian men are the only demographic group who make as much as white men, and Asian women actually make more than white women.
That would be pretty cool, actually - like in FPSs where if you're out of breath or have a poor marksmanship score or something the game makes the view wander around to make it more difficult to zero in - instead, they could vibrate the shit out of the mouse so that it was simply harder to control the thing physically.
You might be able to sue your roommate for everything since it was their subtenant that did everything. The landlord can go after you or your roommate though since you both signed the lease.
Next upgrade I highly recommend is a good pair of headphones and a dedicated amp and DAC.  Those gaming headsets are near the bottom end of the spectrum when it comes to audio quality.  Sound cards are not good either.  Particularly how they have so many limitations (power, noise interference).  /r/headphones is a great resource.  
At this point, no, the Mac is not better for running Adobe Creative Cloud. OS X doesn't have 10-bit monitor drivers, and Windows does. So even though I'm a Mac user, if you're happy running Adobe products on Windows, I'd recommend that you continue doing so.
Yeah you can store files to them, and if you do install any programs it's not like the drives magically stop working if the SSD isn't present. You could still access their files you just won't be able to run some programs.
We live like 15 minutes by car or about an hour by public transportation, so I understand it's a lot easier for us. But if they don't want you guys sleeping over, you could rent a hotel in the area for a few days while you visit. I don't imagine they'd be too keen on letting her go for a few days if they're really that traditional. And in our case I think it has more to do with knowing where he is at all times and that he's okay than tradition, though I can't be 100% sure.

I feel pain every day and joy every day. The more I face the pain, the more joy I feel. I just recently spoke to someone who has been with one of his partners for over ten years now (all of those years were poly) and he said just in the last couple of years he has finally learned how to operate without any insecurity. Even if it takes a decade, that sounds worth it to me. The pain is not from polyamory, the pain comes from inside. 
I suppose. But anyone with a basic understanding of IP law can get out of those suits. That's why it's a civil suit and not a criminal one. It just preys on people who can't/won't lawyer up.

Yes I wouldn't have minded as much because in the end that would probably have directed traffic to me that I otherwise wouldn't have received. Instead they replaced every instance of my name and channel with their own. I actually wonder if there are automated scripts to just make these websites or this entire exercise took some effort on their part.
&gt; (or maybe they've disabled all NFC). Since Apple Pay is just EMV, so far as I know there's no way to disable Apple Pay while still accepting regular NFC.
I really can't see much wrong with playing out a position like this in a blitz game. Probably depends on the level though.If it was a 90 minute game then it would be a bit obnoxious, but in blitz, I'd say its reasonable for your opponent to make you prove you can convert the win without blundering a draw in time pressure. You can't take these things for granted!
I am not sure I grasp your question, but I will give it a shot.  &gt; People who are 'gay married' in the legal sense wouldn't be married in the religious sense, which wouldn't be a problem.The issue is with public gay couples, living out a lifestyle of sin in public.

When I was in high school I stayed over at a boyfriends one night, I didn't really want to have sex with him since I had only just lost my virginity but we fooled around. We ended up drinking a bit (stupid teenagers) so I was a little more willing than I would have been. We didn't use protection but we didn't even really have sex he just stuck it in a bit (with consent) but I decided to stop. It was just before I got my period and it ended up being late so of course I took a pregnancy test ASAP not knowing that you have to wait a bit and then got my period right after. That guy was mean though as soon as I mentioned it to him he broke up with me. EDIT: changed a word. 
&gt; Why is that? I fail to see the difference.When someone doesn't know how to do something they can't and don't do it.  Its common sense for a leader as your job is to break the work up into tasks for others to do.
Haha, you want to get used to treating your knees and legs as shock absorbers for the rest of your body. Keeping them slightly bent not only lowers your center of gravity but also gives you a bit of flex for fighting through rough terrain like that "tactile paving" (TIL) on the sidewalk.The other big thing is keeping your weight off your toes and more on your sole and heel. For rough terrain you can even 'pick up' your toes a bit as you get into it to make sure you don't catch that front wheel.Happy skating!

Oh so you've got lots of build room! Anyways for now I would stick with your 10ish wraps and enjoy it. Given the change though, I'd get some 28g, 30g, maybe even 32g, those are going to have hire resistance, so you'll need less energy to heat them up, allowing you to have more surface area.
Just left.  I came from living on the land in Australia and I didn't need too many comforts.  My biggest cost was a tier one school which would be in addition to the amount stated.  No car, no moo ban, local shops (not western) and I lived in Chiang Mai which in some ways is cheaper than down south, but other ways is more expensive.
It's a couple of things I think.1) The pay2) The inexperience of the rest of an independent cast.  I don't think RDJ completely ruled out ever doing an indie film, it's just going to take considerably more personal interest in the project to get him to do it because there are in general far more negatives to him than positives.  If you could make movies that you enjoy AND make a lot of money, why bother dealing with the headache of some of the smaller projects.  Especially if you aren't particularly interested in being viewed as a "real artist" like a guy like Shia LaBeouf.
I live in an area where every damn driver will tailgate me and try to force me to speed up even if I'm a little over the speed limit. Or suddenly change lanes, pass me, and then cut me off. Bitch, I don't want a damn ticket, get off my ass. It's not my fault you can't leave on time for your damn job, god.
- He knows Bob Nicholson- His dad died so he might be thinking of home... and Edmonton is the closest city to his Saskatchewan home...So flimsy and full of bullshit. 
Yeah and I FE'd on both bc these vendors require it which is reasonable with them being so trusted and I've never had a problem before but it sucks bc I probably could've had it shipped by the same vendor on blackbank already.. Paying a shit ton of money for express shipping is kind of pointless when it ends up taking longer than regular shipping lol..
&gt;  imaginary reputation bullshit.Ed Woodward's whole marketing push has been to create a galacticos brand for United. The transfer strategy's almost certainly centred around "reputation" or as it's more commonly known branding as a key component.
I get a very mild head pain when I tighten the hood too much while MIG welding and it lasts maybe 30 minutes. Nothing even close to the same level, so I can discount that.I wear dark shirts and try to lower the helmet so that it touches my chest to minimize light leak through that as I've been warned about that, so pretty much just leaves the noise. I'll give some foam earplugs a shot tomorrow and if it helps, I'll pick up some nicer ones.The ones you have remind of music ear plugs I used to have. They were vented and had hard cores that could be removed so that they don't interfere with the frequencies of music as much. I'm sure these don't do that, but similar concept with that.

Even if they can be annoying at first, normalfags don't stay normalfags for long.  They either assimilate into the culture or leave.  And there will be normalfags with or without dubbed anime.Besides, I'd definitely say normalfags aren't the worst part of the anime fandom.  I'd take normalfags over shitposters any day.
I'm one of the ones who don't think there is anything wrong with this. If the student didn't want it anymore and she actually physically raped him then that's another story. But these instances where the students are fine with it...Smh I just don't see why it's viewed so badly. And if you notice it's usually women who are the ones saying it's such a terrible thing. 16 is old enough to know what you're doing.
Thank you. I hate to say this, but the pencil drawing was so good and I wasn't entirely happy with how the inking turned out. I'm glad you like it, though. 
All wood floors expand and contract to some degree due to humidity etc over time.  This is why you should put it down under the baseboard.  It's more work but its the right way to do it.

awesome review.     While I like flavour... don't care about that as much as build quality.... so probably not for me...  also I saw a review here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvbK128E4Y0which I didn't really like...    throwing away cotton like that.... middle is better, wtf dude really?   I think his review was not good.Also when he says "silver plated pin, very nice condunctivity"......    silver is the BEST conductor of electricity.   look at my name, I know this.Doesn't seem bad to me anyhow... but wouldn't be what I would buy.   and I am currently looking for something like that.   Though at this stage....  it's all very much personal preference.
Her power has a master element.  Possibly her trigger involved losing a powered loved one, whom she desperately wished wouldn't leave her alone.  She got that wish in a typical shard-derived way.And as for Gray Boy, I always assumed that by the time she went for him, she had some cape capable of putting him down.  Lily can't be the *only* one ever able to beat his defensive power.
I don't know what area you are around, do you have an aldi's around?  They have great prices.  Also, you might want to check out some of the 99 cent stores. They often have great prices on fresh produce that may help you out quite a bit. 
&gt; "you'll change your mind and regret it later!"So what?  The world's overpopulated and there's orphans who need adopting out there, we should be snipping people left and right.
I would say that it's both kind of a little weird (jack off all you want; don't jack off in the 'default' fashion) and totally reasonable (you don't want to have porn going on while you're around). I wouldn't say it's contradictory and unless you guys are both at home together all the time, there should be plenty of chances for him to masturbate to pornography, especially if he doesn't do it all that often.
Exactly. It's not profitable for them. I can not think of a single Xbox player I know that would be interested in it. Stick to PC where you have a bigger audience.
Looks pretty good for a first submission, keeping it simple. It's hard to say anything about a map like this. The lighting looks good, though. A lot of people seem to select straight up yellow for their light_environment.
I don't smoke all day but I smoke every day.  I think it's because it's such a benign drug.  Doesn't last too long, not too intoxicating (unless you get really ripped), hardly any withdrawals, no threat of OD'ing, it's just too good.  I don't like to smoke all day because then I feel really foggy and I can't do my work, but I can't find a legitimate reason to stop smoking every day....other then saving some money.
Here in Australia, they're quite expensive - you'd expect to pay $25-30 for (what i estimate to be) ~100ug - and the quality is nothing great. I've not found a street vendor that knows what exactly it is they're selling, and usually just buy on DNM.
Jim Rickards claimed "insider trading occurred and it was blatant" on Max Keiser's show last year. He then went on to state that it was Al Qaeda terrorists doing the trading. I don't know what to make of that guy.

When I was finishing sixth form a teacher organised a charity London Paris bike ride for his church but opened it up to people at the school as well.I was one of only 2 students that went with 4 teachers going. There was a mutual reslect of knowing that the teachers felt responsible for us and that we would listen but it wasn't necessary. It wasn't part of school just coincidence we took the offer and nothing required authority to be taken so all interaction was extremely friendly and beer fueled.
I mean, she is probably the closest character he has had to a love interest. She is the only characters who loves him and Luffy is aware of. I imagine they will end up together after he becomes king of the pirates. 
Thanks!&gt;EDIT: OH HAY mah res crashed, what do you want your fancy new tag to be?Today is just one of those days when you think to yourself, "if there were a leprechaun in front of me right now, I'd bunt that bitch so hard his children would feel it in their gold pots". Then all that would be left is to ride a tortoise into the sunset, or the next several.
I've become entranced with this game and am trying as hard as I can to convince my PC gamer, tabletop gamer and comic-fan friends to join me.This is my attempt at propaganda. I'm very new to generating video content, so it's a tad rough. Would love to hear your feedback though!
GE didn't cause inflation as it doesn't affect the supply of gold whatsoever. Boss drops have introduced inflation through alchables in rs3 and 07, but this is just a correlation.
Variks the Loyal is a very old Fallen Vandal of the House of Judgement. Probably because he hated the rest of the other houses, he lost some arms because of them. With the Queen, Variks was amputated with two mechanical arms. They also seemed to be the upper arms.So, I'm assuming that a Fallen's lower arms can regenerate, but the upper arms cannot.
I am excited to see this video and I hope you will talk about whats involved in the process and how well it transfers to a humanoid avatar. Do you know if you can track other objects AND your body movements if you had enough sensors? 
Yeah but if there were no political parties to vote for then people would actually read a tiny percent more about politics and make more of an informed decision. It's not like its hard to skim through the bullshit these days.

Nice people do dumb things. It's not like it was a 12 year old, he was 17, which makes this perfectly legal except for the one little fact that she was a teacher. If she were just some soccer mom there would be no crime. Hope they don't go too hard on her.
&gt;Also the phrasing of a "past tense theft." Good to know we're not in a Phillip K Dick novel, investigating future-tense crimes.I think the need to clarify when the theft took place implies that the Concord police do investigate future crimes!

A previous thread on this had the top comment as 'like kissing through a plastic bag', which is pretty damn accurate.I think the reason why they're less popular with us guys is that a wrapped penis still creates friction for the girl, just with some of the detail masked. For us guys, all the friction is lost because the condom doesn't move and all we're left with is pressure.
Oh my god. You were so helpful to me last month. And so supportive. I am so sorry. So so sorry. My SO is also in the military and this is my nightmare as well. That this happened is absolutely awful and I am so so sorry. All my love to you mommaboo. All of it.
i hate pistol round because of the undeserved kills from the tec9,they need to slow the fire rate down or make it like 1000$ so it cannot be bought first round and its more of a gamble buy for save rounds
After years of rigorous critical reasoning regarding this phrase, I've decided it's actually pretty OK. Saying "I could care less" only underscores the fact that you care so little you can't bother to say it properly. 
Hijab is an Arabic word so it's probably safe to assume that a woman wearing hijab is Muslim - or perhaps just following Muslim law because she's in a Muslim country or community - but there are other religions that require women to cover their hair when in public, usually with a scarf, snood or wig (e.g. Orthodox Jewish), bonnet (e.g. Amish), or veil (e.g. strict Catholic). In general, I wouldn't assume any religious customs are such 'common knowledge' that you would be rude for asking about them IF you already know the person and the topic comes up.
What you seem to be ignoring is that if the viewers are unhappy and don't want to watch, that means less money. People come for the games and then contribute, not the other way around. And the only reason the sponsorships happen is because of the high viewer count. You can't prioritize making money without also prioritizing making an entertaining show.^(**Edit:** Toned down the beginning a bit. I'm not trying to be a dick.)

The fact that we view ourselves this way reveals a lot about us. For example, if fat is natural, why do we naturally view ourselves as not fat? Why do we have such a desire to be thing, or fit? Because evolutionary programming knows this is best for us.

Aiden Pearce, from Watch_Dogs. He killed so many people and committed so many crimes just to avenge the death of his niece, which was ultimately his fault in the first place.
My advice would be to eat the whole eighth, trip with at least 1 or 2 good friends, and be somewhere you can go outside without being near a ton of people (nature while frying is fantastic.)Also, I know you mentioned being on a t-break but I've always found weed to be great for calming down if shit gets too instense.

&gt; he said he told the police and then in the same breath said he didnt tell police anything.He told the detectives. He apparently doesn't know that the guys without uniforms are cops just like the guys in them. 
The thing is 1080p is decidedly last gen. 1440p monitors have been readily available for a good price for like 2 years now. Plus 4k is right around the corner of mainstream. (4k, 32" IPS panels hit sub 1000 last black friday. So next black friday should be awesome.) In other words you are overspending hard. If you really want 1080 then get a 970 and a monitor for no more than $150; you'll save 300-400 dollars on the build. If you're serious about editing then you're better off just getting a 5820k like I did. If you plan to keep the cpu a long time (3-4yr) it's probably worth investing in a 6 core anyways. Also most modern games are ike 60gb (gta v, assassins creed, bf4) and trust me when I say the load times off hdd (at least for the last 2) sux. I have a 256gb ssd and it's okay but if i was building a PC today I'd prob get a 500gb samsung 850 evo. (you could also channel that gpu/monitor savings into the ssd and good keyboard)
Yeah there's another post about it closer to the front page, I thought the exact same thing as you my friend. I'm more likely to jump off a balcony from reading that article than eating an edible lol
Isn't $LNKD's revenue stream primarily fees from recruiters? Who is going to build the service that disintermediates linkedin, dice, etc.. and directly connects employees with employers?
There's a newly opened bar in my city that focuses primarily on board games, but also allows stuff like magic and so forth. Since board games are really popular here, the crowd there is really diverse and it has an amazing atmosphere.
Since I calculated it for another thread:I decided to check my own numbers. Electricity is .10 kwh.3x290x does 2300h/s on claymore's 9.1. killawatt shows 830 watts at the wall with cpu idle..830x24 = 19.92 kwh 19.92 x $.10 = $1.992/day. income estimates to $1.08/day 1.08-1.99= -0.91 (loss)
Crashplan does do differential backups. It can also do backups with versioning. I can restore old versions or files, or files that I have deleted locally.

I honestly can't believe so many of us lie about height. It makes it miserable for a short guy like myself to be honest about my 5'7", because after one day of browsing this sub, it seems like everyone will assume I'm 5'5" or below.How unfortunate.
Nightly Show 0.652mil viewers (0.22) after the Daily Show's 1.141mil (0.39) ([source](http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-100-wednesday-cable-originals-4-29-2015.html))sorry about the delay in posting wednesday's episode - I put it in the title but forgot to post it.
Pie looks like it could be tasty to me, pizza looks gross to me, but this is /r/shittyfoodporn we're talking about--that post looks ten times better than most of the "check out my kraft mac and cheese mixed with pizza rolls!" type of posts on there. 
Not really. I was using my Target credit card for this, so 'only' saving 5%. I wish I was still doing it so that I could spend 100% of my prepaid loads in a Target. In fact, I'm looking into doing it again.

Just apply for the Cadets. They're paid shit but the police recruit over 50% from the cadets so turnover is high. If you can't get on with the cadets you don't really have a hope in hell of getting on as a cop. ALSO if you're really interested in a career in policing then I recommend applying to forces in other cities as well. The days of WPS force expansion are over and they're under a microscope with their budget. First thing to get cut is recruiting. Five years ago they were hiring 100 officers a year. I don't think they've hired more than 40 in the last couple of years combined. All I'm saying is competition is insane to get on with WPS right now. 
Caps rust in the fridge relatively quickly. I had some Bourbon County sitting in my fridge for 4 months and there was rust around the edges. And in my opinion anything remotely light gets completely consumed by the flavors of oxidation after about 3 years, excluding sours. Just my two cents.

The problem is, these kinds of people create a polarization. Because people like me and my FNM group hate playing with people like that (overly competitive, unhygienic, poor social skills), we tend to congregate at one store, while they hate being shunned and criticized for their behavior by people like us (casual, accepting of newbies, low-budget), so they congregate at other stores.In other words, when you go to a store, odds are you will either like everybody, or nobody.

&gt;Think of ROC strikes, or regular Crucible. How many times have people just AFK'd or quit mid game? It happens multiple times a day for me.Um, people quit in PUGs all the time. It's a fact of life that, if you don't have a regular group, you have to put up with shenanigans. I think most people requesting matchmaking understand this.
Meaningless title. Either stand by your prediction or don't make it at all. Could just as correctly say "one in six scientists may be completely delusional about effects of man-made global warming". It's hyperbole for the sake of hyperbole.Edited to add: (prepared for downvote to hell by lemmings)
It depends on what the bible says. As of right now I'm neutral until I see what the scripture tells me regarding the death penalty. I'm inclined to believe it wouldn't be biblical? But maybe I'm wrong.
ugh the two guys i stacked against him went 0-4 with a BB. Travis/Donaldson that is. Of course Webb comes in to pitch to travis 3rd at bat. I sure how Cleveland brings mop up pitching in and lets donaldson/travis get some
It means I'm not attracted to him or romantically compatible but we're friends. Yes I have dated men I was friends with. That's usually how things work. Relationships build in stages. 
I say this because you mentioned medical things. A good friend of mine in CHBE was having thoughts similar to yours at this exact time - right before our senior year. He decided to get a minor in Biomedical engineering in addition to the Chem E BS. It took him an extra semester, but he is really glad he did it. He's now working in a field he's passionate about and loving it.I suppose this isn't advice so much as a relatable story - I don't know what your situation is but a minor in a more applicable field could help you focus and show tech companies that you mean business.
The thing is, in terms of money made per hour, the Conda/T9 can make the most in trading. The max I can make at a RES is 3 mil an hour.. if I'm lucky. The conda can make 6-7 mil an hour reliably in trading.
Yeah that was kind of my point. I was being idealistic and based on my point of view I'm an idealist. My point was that coming from that point of view I can't really afford to be too invested in amiibo. I kind of need to be more relaxed and chill with the whole situation.
Hover over them and you will find out if it trains attack, strength, defence, or Controlled.Controlled means it will equally split the xp between all three skills. If you chose attack it gives and invisible +3 boost to your attack level. Same for Strength and Defensive.Controlled gives +1 to all combat stats. Only Controlled or Strength has the ability make you hit higher, but even then it would only be 1 more than you could hit on accurate, and depending on your current strength level it may not have an effect at all.
As much as I love Smash, I'm absolutely terrible at it.Seriously, I know a bunch of stuff (including some pretty cool ATs), but I just suck at the game, I just seem to always make the wrong decision.Whatever tho, I still love this game.
Yup, the point back then was that if you raped a girl, you the had to provide and care for her and the possible child for the rest of your days. Sure it's pretty messed up, but it's better than the family throwing her out for no longer being a virgin and her being a beggar/dying in the street.But whatever, let's all bash those stupid religious folk, amiright?
Why? She isn't politically conservative. Her rhetoric is spectacular and she avoids many common pitfalls. She is respectful, compassionate, interested in engaging in controversial topics and legitimately listening, and she always has a reality-first approach. Regardless of whether or not you agree with her conclusions I would hope you agree with get rhetoric. I believe that rhetoric is far more important than positions currently held. For that reason I would rather have one Sommers than a dozen Twitter sarcasm machine feminists, even if I disagreed with her on every point. 
I wish I would of never wore gloves. Such a waste. I wish I would of packed two garbage bags and a towel to clean up and pack my wet/muddy stuff home. Two bags to double bag and keep the car dry. 
Well the history of sierra is actually quite sad. Around the mid 90's they had a corporate takeover, that coincided with the rebranded logo. When the takeover took place, the original company which made games, was more or less gutted, and they just became a publishing label. By that stage, the soul of the company was gone. A lot of people were fired and it was only sierra in name.
The game is to wrap Android apis so existing stuff can work and then extend the api with microsoft-only features that don't work on Android.  And then attempt to replace Android.
Right, after the fact. Denial and shock only last a few minutes, combined with drunkenness and possible injuries, she couldn't accept that she had done what she had done at the time. 
Lower Shadow Mod is rarely ever affected by updates. It has remained completely stable since ~Update 35. Goon, Poco, and Hox are usually your main offender when it comes to mods breaking games, since they offer much more than texture swaps or lowering shadow quality.
What is her price range? I'm an investor in Boston and it is very hard to find a place with positive cash flow unless you're talking about outside the city.
There is an actual Wiki for that name. Probably not related to him.  I think its just another Benjy Gimmick. Years ago, he would (pretend) to flip the fuck out anytime that name was mentioned. 
yeah i get what you mean. i can definitely appreciate all sorts of watches for what they are, but i guess there are always going to be snobs in most circles who will look down on people with less expensive possessions. sorta sucks, but it is what it is i guess..
A lot of people, myself included, are annoyed that there are no in-game rewards for time played or achievements. One skin once a year, for a champion that has generally been nerfed soon after? A ward skin if you spam games with a team? Oh boy. It's highly underwhelming. This seemed like a good way to introduce a reward system with in-game content for people who do well, and instead it was turned towards profit. I used to buy a ton of skins, I won't be buying anymore unless there's some form of actual in-game reward anymore. More and more of Riot's model is to move things away from IP and into RP, doing so can alienate people who previously spent RP.Simply increasing the ways in which people can pay you does not actively increase the profit.

Seafood chowder.  In a restaurant in Taupo, New Zealand.  I can't remember the name of the place, but it was a fake-tudor decorated building.  It came served in a hollowed-out cobb loaf and after I finished the chowder I started scraping the inside of the loaf with my spoon trying to get a little more.  I haven't eaten chowder since.  I know nothing else is going to measure up.
This idiot said Killstreaks are hardcore lol. Holy fuck these COD kids are so bad. This game pisses on COD in terms of skill curve... please know what you're talking about before posting 
I thought you were joking, sorry bout that.  Guile has one of the best zoning games in Street Fighter.  He has a lot of really good normals and his projectile game is super strong.
Here's the thing: She KNOWS she was not supposed to do it (legally or ethically). She did it anyway. Fuck her feelings, tell her off and let her know she will NOT do it again in the future. No ifs, ands, or buts.
Yeah, we're all three of us besties and cohabited for many years--they got an opportunity that didn't have room for me (at the time) so I've been on my own for about a year now.  There are tentative plans to get me to move up to where they're living, but it wouldn't be in the same household anymore.  Edit: I'm hoping to live closer to them again soon, until then we play lots of video games together and spend lots of time in skype together.  It's still a "Thing" but less of a living-together deal, more like it was before they broke me out of pokey.  Edit again: gosh I need to stop hitting "save" with incomplete thoughts.  There is no map because it would just be like, I don't know, a road squiggle?  
My sister (twin) was always causing trouble, going out, typical of a rebellious teen girl, never got in that much trouble. I stay in bed 20 minutes too long, end of the world. My dad was like "You're more responsible and I like you more, so I'm gonna punish you more". I'm still baffled to this day. 
For the next little while i'd be happy enough with WGs having an effect on resource gain on the continent. Going further cutting off enemy territory has the same effect (but reduced) depending on the amount of cut off terrain. For example. Cutting off the WG: 90% less resourcesCutting off a single base: 10% lessCutting off a sizeable chunk: 40% lessEtcThe effect creates some very good fights in bases we barely see!
Because you seem to think they have no choice. They do, because a pay cut is usually acceptable if you get to play. Rotting in the reserves is rarely good enough for people who have worked hard enough to get to the top. They do however have 100% choice, as clubs can't sell contracts.
well, SupremeSmoke's H is very very noddy and i love it. He ships out like clockwork but recently raised his G's to $182. i hear PandaExpress does have nice china white but Thelemonadestand, caliclaire and recently Lordorlov all have nice product. My go to guy so far is SupremeSmoke just because i've  ordered more than once from him and each shipment was 2 days or less.
You own drop!? Man... I think I remember being handed a card while standing outside in Lincoln Park one night when you guys just opened. Me and a group of friends walked past and were skeptical that it was a legitimate place because it was not very well signed. Glad to see you guys are still around! Maybe I'll convince my friends to visit 
Good tips here but sadly not applicable to me. I don't watch porn so I don't have an issue with being around women, I get on great with women. It's just masturbation I'm having an issue with, mostly due to the tension i can't deal with lol. Thanks anyway, the cold shower thing is likely applicable. I was actually looking forward to wet dreams thinking they might help me deal with tension, did you say you try to avoid them? Why's that?
This sucks for all of us.  With Boise getting into the NY6 last year, that opened up another bowl spot so that everyone that was bowl eligible could get a spot. If we end up with extra teams eligible again and someone doesn't make an NY6 game, that means someone is stuck at home. Last year, Nevada would have been stranded. Just stick to Miami BYU. Leave Vegas to people that will enjoy the town
How are altec and pob proven players? Because they both proved they can't carry a team? People LOVE pob and altec and say they are so good, but when will they show it? I haven't seen it. Why is it acceptable for Alex to come in and carry but pob and altec can't carry the team they've played with all year. They are mediocre at best and I'm guessing people will finally learn when they go through another round of relegations.
I did say I didn't find anything on the matter. I just looked it up. Zip, nothing. I also mentioned that in case it does happen it does not make much sense to add them since the rate would be minuscle (hence me never having heard of it or finding anything about it). Women are the main cause of rape claims.You're the one implying that they do. Be consistent, change my mind, prove to me that they do in a percentage that actually does matter.
Has the same not ever happened to you? You meet and girl and think she's nice but have no interested in dating?But, honestly? I don't know. I guess there's just some sort of chemistry spark missing. Sometimes I think life would be a lot simpler if I could have that romantic attraction to more of my guy friends (two I know would be open to dating me - I'm just not attracted). But, at the same time, I *am* attracted to a number of my guy friends and they don't return these feelings.It's not a gendered thing. Not in my experience.
No, you're just parroting what you heard.  The only real reason he might be unelectable is because of people saying he's unelectable and others assuming that its true.  Nobody expected Obama to beat Hillary at this stage of the 2008 elections.
Yeah and most asian food in supermarkets is anything but not what people in various asian countries would eat, while alledgly greek products often aren't greek etc....So, as it is made to fit certain tastes anyways there is no point in complaining about there to be more signs for some regions of the world.
Fantastic post. I am going to add this post to my favourites.I will contribute by saying that the 3 female intercourse outcomes that you posted go nicely with a women's reasons for sex. She either 1. gets fucked hard by an alpha, and yields; 2. she gets fucked mildly by a BB for ulterior motive (be it, monetary, social, economic, or protective gain); or, 3. she refuses penetration.Great post. Opened my eyes a bit on the female side of penetration.EDIT: I also wanted to say that I full heartedly agree with your description of invention and the value of aggression in invention.
You should definitely say something. I'd be a little upset too if there were this many small parts and didn't have a label to instruct keeping away from small children.
Yes. I meant to say "*if* OP's car was actually towed overnight..." Without the "if" my comment came across as being surprisingly aggressive, for which I apologize.
Sanders has quite clearly stated his own positions. They're left of center, but they're not socialist. I don't mind people supporting Sanders, but I do mind them flooding a socialist forum with content irrelevant to socialism in election season.Saying "He's a Democratic *Socialist*" when talking about Sanders is as much of an argument as saying "They're National *Socialists*" when talking about the Nazis.
Maybe use some of their millions of dollars of profit to monitor the logs that they undoubtedly keep and use that data to determine who is legitimate and who is not?
Both Cyanide and Xpeke has said that they were thinking about leaving/retiring for awhile. You honestly fucking think that they would make important life decisions based off of a 17 year old? 
if the titans really refused to take the philly offer that was reported they truly are the dumbest fucking franchise in existence in all of professional sports
I went to military high school. My friend, a colossal fuck-up, was dubbed by my algebra teacher "the poster child for a 9mm retroactive abortion."My friend protested, so my teacher gave us an in-class assignment, issued my buddy a 35lb log, and made him run around the parade field with the log on his shoulders.They don't fuck around in military school.
of course I do ive studied martial arts my entire life, no one in the situation was attacked and as a matter a fact I dont carry a gun, not that i dont like guns i own a few myself. I have just never had a problem I couldnt handle without using a gun, even when ive been attacked, even when ive had a knife pulled on me. If the guy had really been a threat and you could justify drawing like say the "attacker" had brandished any kind of weapon then by all means go for it but people die, sometimes they dont deserve it but it happens your gun wont save you from everything and you should not solely rely on it especially in situations like that is all im saying but  people like you are the reason guns have a bad image. I guess I could have used more eloquent language and not said "man" but clearly you couldnt comprehend much more past that.
Lets say you have all three sheen items, you will only get the spellblade damage from whichever single one does the most, for example if you have all three but have three other ap items it'll probably be lich bane, but i think you get icebourne slow aswell regardless. But basically never ever do it.
I'm a woman and well aware of that but not everyone operates like you or myself. Maybe she's more shy or not trying to be too pushy or something? Who knows.
Because you ordered the 100, you need some extra things. Eye protection, full gloves, plastic apron, and a respirator. Think breaking bad style. Just inhaling the vapors or a few drops could make you sick, a few mLs, could send you to the hospital or even possibly kill you. Also make sure you do it in a place with good ventilation. 
I just switched over to android from a jailbroken iphone. One of the things I miss (and primarily the main reason why I jailbreak my iphones) is SwipeSelection. Basically you swipe left or right across the keyboard to move the cursor so you can easily edit typos. Is there any keyboard on android that has the same function? Currently using the Google Keyboard and it's good but I miss being able to just swipe and edit instead of trying hard to tap.
See, I have a major problem when people who don't know what they're talking about try to lecture others.The NDP does in fact have a plan to pay to balance the budget.  It's only been one of the biggest points in the campaign:  raising the corporate tax rate to 12%, instituting a progressive income tax scale, etc... and it's been gone over in this election numerous times including having been a focus in the debates.  So for someone to come on here saying "they don't have a plan" when they've detailed it and their opponents have discussed these details is just downright idiocy.
alright i can see what you are saying. i would disagree that it doesnt matter what you call them, the downvotes tell me that people really care. i dont know a lot of teams that have someone they have doing just analysis, except swag but i dont think anyone thinks he will analyze anything.
No Child Left Behind kind of pushed kids through the system without giving a fuck if they were ready. We had yearly standardized tests that we did, Iowa Tests for Educational Development, or ITED's. The older Iowa folk might remember them as the ITBS tests.The highschool would let you out for two days in the spring if you got so many points over your 'goal' for scoring on the test. Kids figured out that they would graduate anyway, so they would just bomb the tests so next the next year they would have a lower score and be able to pass it easily. Dumb motherfuckers never realized that if they didn't try, they didn't learn, and if they didn't learn then they weren't going to get a higher score the next year.
I'd be lying if I said Drink More Water 5 wasn't up there. I understand some of the hate Makonnen gets on this sub but he just makes really fun music imo. Also 56 Nights is crazy good.
The Rogue River in Rockford above the dam is really nice.  Not too quick, not too many sharp bends.  A nice relaxing paddle with some pretty nice scenery.  That is the closest river to Grand Rapids, other than the Grand River, but I have only done a small section of that out in Allendale, and there wasn't much scenery.  North of here there are quite a few rivers that are really nice to paddle.  Look at the Meetup group called The Gold Coast Paddle Club, they are usually out paddling somewhere each weekend and there is a good chance you could carpool with someone.
Whaaat? I'm kind of a closet raver and I don't know how you could hate the people. Yeah Kandi Kids with all their kandi and fluffies and shit look a little crazy, but everyone is so friendly and willing to talk. Every show I go to I make new friends. Maybe try chatting to some folks who look a little less into the scene. I usually find people who are in more normal clothes and are just dancing and having a good time are less overwhelming than the hardcore ravers. 
&gt;they usually don't stay out on the floor more than two or three days[Because....?](http://www.theonion.com/articles/petsmart-manager-does-morning-sweep-of-enclosures,38401/)
Would love to play that with my girlfriend, not many good local multiplayer games out there, and that looks perfect :DEdit: I won! Would like to thank OP for being awesome.
oh for crying out loud.  The man asked for info, he didn't call you names.  If you want to be taken seriously treat the issue that way.  If there is a conspiracy show us why you think so.  This kind of spam doesn't help anyone.
Dammit.  I thought the Chargers would really make a stab at getting him as the successor.  Instead we're not only moving to LA next year, but also starting some random jabroni as the QB.
mostly because of the number of people they have been killed which in iraq is over half a million (only upto 2011)n the destruction is self im not sure how to answer the questionthey are obviously not fighting for humanityunless they are not humans or their supports arent human 
one of the fundamental beliefs of Christianity is that anyone who does not believe in jesus is going to hell. This isnt some secret, this isnt something i dug out of some anti Christian site , this is stuff ive heard said by actual Christians in order to validate their religion, both in real life and on the internet.
[](/facehoof) Damn it. I am aware of that, but this is not the first time I make that mistake, I have to be more careful about it. Thanks for the correction.[](/sp)&gt;I assume you translated from "el gente," the singular collective noun?[](/sp)[](/twiponder) Normally I try to avoid thinking in Spanish before I write something in English. Specially lately, I am trying to be more fluent with my writing. But, since you ask, "el gente" is not correct in Spanish, because "el" is an masculine article and "gente" is a feminine noun, so the correct form to say "people" is "**la** gente"
Yes video, like usual it's available on my clipstore :) it's the shitty workout video. I just put pictures here without advertising the video to keep the gonewild-esk feel here. 
Oh I'm not arguing with you bud, I am just pointing out an off shoot of the polarized topic.  Like You're point is Topic A, and I am throwing a Topic B into the mix of a related issue.
Giannis just put out a big neon sign to opposing players that it will take very little to throw him off his game, he can expect a lot more of that going forward now.
Some of the best things I've ever made have been sauces from deglazing the pan after chicken breasts. I could (and did) eat it with a spoon after but you kinda need the meat to make it happen. 
Thrusters not working here either.My t10 hover used to be so light, maneuverable, and fast.8 t10 hovers, 2 t10 forward thrusters, 2 t8 reverse thrusters, 2 t7 steering thrusters.Now I get speed matched, and even passed by tank treads, and it feels like a brick?And my speed isn't improving (much at least, speedometer test incoming) even at overclock level 13?
I'm reminded of an episode of This American Life. It's [Act III of this audio](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/554/not-it). It sounds like NY might have cleantech, but not the political will to implement it. 
Jesus Christ, Goodell.  It's not Marioto.  It's also definitely not OREGAWN.  Fuck you so hard.  How can you not pronounce the last name of this guy?
It's those assholes who falsely accused him who should be hoping it wasn't because of them. Their mean-spirited prank could have caused a lot of problems for a lot of people. 
OHKs basically any enemy in chapter 18, 20, and F, and you have like a million deployment spots, so there is little reason to not use her. If you let her get a little bit of exp, her stupid defensive growths kick in and fix her hole of durability, and by that time she still has more stone uses left than Fa started with. But of course SS is do easy that you don't need her at all. Still, she is fun. 6/11, mostly availability brings her down. 
I'm just pointing out the obvious that most Americans are sadly ignorant of.  :). I mean, come on--who wants a glans clitoris or a glans penis with the texture of leather when what nature gave then was a smooth, supple, sensitive mucous membrane?
I'm 100% sure on my faith. Just finding a way that is not wrong. I once tried to look into different areas of religions, but i found Christianity to be everything I needed and accepted it. And thanks.
The dam is an ok camping spot. Take a drive too sleeping giant provincial park. Drive to the thunder bay lookout in the park. Drive to silver harbor. Go to the blue point amethyst mine if you want to collect your own crystals, or thunder bay amethyst mine if you want a tourist experience similar to what is reported from eagle canyon. Farther east you can find Kama Point, just about the highest shoreline in Ontario; great sunset photography. Keep going east and you will get to Rossport, nice place to stop in. Go to visit the island pottery, eat at the Serendipity.

I would like Don't Starve Together. My favourite band is 30 Seconds to Mars. I first started listening to them back when I was a teenager when my first girlfriend borrowed me their bootleg CD, I still remember how I instantly got hooked when the first song, [Capricorn,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-tqzcq1BY0) started. I listened to that CD before it stopped working. So I never returned it. But I'm really proud I was following their work from the beginning. Their latest album was kind of a let down, but I'm hoping for better stuff as the time goes on. [My Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/id/ex7animo)Thanks for this giveaway!

Hey there, I live in Adelaide ATM, currently studying nursing at uni. You can rent a place or a room for ~$100-$300 aud depending on what you want pretty close to the city (but coming from the states everything will be close to the city in comparison). Nurses are paid pretty well but its definitely worth getting onto Medicare. Have a look at the nurses awards on the gov websites. Feel free to pm me if you want more info :)
I dunno... there's plenty of fat men with tits. What's so feminine about giggly lumps of fatty tissue hanging from a person's chest?Now, if we're talking about the breast as a mass of tissue and mammary glands, which have the true purpose of providing sustenance to babies...  yeah, that's *feminine*; however, *feminine* is not the same as *sexual*. Those words are not synonymous with each other. 
What do you think of [this](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834232376&amp;nm_mc=AFC-C8Junction&amp;cm_mmc=AFC-C8Junction-_-na-_-na-_-na&amp;cm_sp=&amp;AID=11552995&amp;PID=7707424&amp;SID=)?
Because people spend SO MUCH time and effort into these things, a 15 minute video doesn't feel like much to the creators. It's easy to slab a bunch of video on a timeline and let it go. Editing is a really powerful thing. 
And they're not even the same. Jameis did a bunch of dumb shit. JaMarcus was just dumb as shit. And lazy. Jameis isn't lazy and will actually work hard. The comparison is bullshit.
I just realized that at the top of my chrome tab it says "Bernie Sanders, the demo..." I thought I had accidentally opened a conspiracy post regarding Bernie Sanders being a demon.

I've been watching her on My Neighbor Charles and it seemed like some Koreans weren't happy about her singing the national anthem since she wasn't fully Korean and she didn't pronounce some words exactly.  She did ok for her debut but I don't remember seeing her in the top 10 of any of the shows.  I think she has a strong voice and they definitely should've given her an Ailee caliber song with powerful high notes, but maybe it wouldn't have been as age appropriate as Why Why Why.  Look forward to hearing more from her!
true. probably aggravated reckless endangerment or something. I was referencing "If the victim died you might argue for involuntary/constructive manslaughter" but you're right - there would be no "attempted" lesser included offense for a negligence charge.
I hate condoms with a passion. It feels like the penis isn't "real". Like it's fake, plastic, and it dries me out. I hate it. Sex without a condom is the best. It's warm and wet and feels natural. And this is one of the reasons why I only have sex in exclusive, stable relationships. Outside of that, I do not have sex. No condoms for me. I'd rather go without sex for a while than have sex with a condom. Oh, and I love my IUD!
No, it's outrageous.Bethesda got their acceptable amount of money from the vanilla game + dlcs that they worked on.  They do nothing to work on the mod and do nothing to maintain compatibility over time.  Valve (I'm not sure about Bethesda too) basically said "sucks for you" if an update came along and the mods were incompatible.I also forgot to mention the part about how both did nothing about the theives who ripped mods off of Nexus and sold them on Steam.I also doubt that the distribution platform is really so hard to make to justify a minimum of 30% of all sales going to Valve.edit.  The mods are also basically the #1 reason to buy Skyrim since Bethesda releases incomplete games and counts on modders to finish it for them.
It's unnecessary and just marketing move but if it will force other producers to match their offer and makes 3gb standard at low end instead of current 1-2gb i welcome it.Seem phones are reaching the point of computers when i don't really care anymore about cpu and ram because all in market are already good enough since i don't play games. Phones seem to reach this point faster than it took computers. 
&gt; What arguments does these religious people have against this kind of stuff?The New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth. In 1st Corinthians 12, Paul says marriage is between a man and a woman. The flowchart is a straw man by pointing out Old Testament Leviticus.
Clear Bluestone is sold by Carhillion.  Clear Bluestone +1 is in a fucking impossible to find chest in the misty forest area. Best advice I've heard is stand at the sun ring chest and head straight into the woods. If anything, veer a little left.  Clear Bluestone +2 you can get by ascetic-ing the Skeleton Lords and killing them again.  It's almost mandatory for a caster.
By far the hottest character on the show. Just goes to show, BB was a series that didn't have to rely on hiring attractive actors (not saying everyone's ugly by any means, but you know what I mean) as a crutch to get viewers.
RPers have what I view as an unhealthy view of relationships--they see them as competitions rather than cooperatives in far too many cases. I understand where the cynicism comes from, but they take it well beyond where it should go.BPers are still in the 1950s with their feminism, so they're fighting an imaginary enemy. Women are paid the same for the same work, and it's illegal for that not to be the case. Society does not support rape. The only rape culture is in prisons. Women are treated better in most situations. Dating is far more difficult for men. Both groups have a pretty serious problem with assuming that trends apply to every individual rather than the population as a whole.
I've got the same problem, a spiral on the right side of my neck just below the jaw. I was concerned at first but as its grown the hairs seem to have finally given up and started to lay flat from the weight.
This kid is going to be one of the best of his generation no doubt. A team could spend 10 or 20 mil on him now and easily get a great return a few years down the road.

Yep. There was a dispute between Intel and Activision circa the release of WAW, iirc, and Intel was threatening to sue. They settled out of court by basically saying that they could never charge for WAW DLC.
Installed it with an android phone.  Waited for it to show up on wear then turned off the android's Bluetooth.  Then used ble utility on iOS to allow the pairing to happen (a card came up explaining how to do this).  Then notifications and music control just worked.  Pretty good for being 3rd party.
Yeah lol, or with the new permissions stuff anyone who does not have permission that opens the door to the trap could be subject to an insta spawn of them.
I've had to have that conversation with several students who want to be doctors. No kids, a 3.0 gpa and 20 on the mcat isn't good enough. If that was the best you could do, you need a plan b.
Just ordered my Sigelei 30w box after my 1st gen Sigelei 50watt crapped out (6 months of constant use R.I.P.)Definitely no need to get a 150watt box imo.  The Sigelei will regulate the vape well even when its low on battery charge so as far as vape quality there is no difference.  As well, the 30w box should be insanely easy to switch out batteries.  Only reason to go with a 150w is if you prefer the form factor for some reason.Also, if you want to get into RDAs and coils maybe get a coil jig https://www.fasttech.com/products/0/10012175/2066300-kuro-koiler-wire-coiling-tool-3-piece-set*Main goal is to quit smoking not become a coil artist or an electricity expert :P
Saitama went from a human to planetbusting+ in 3 years... does that count? Ichigo got a huge power boost within an hour (in dangai it was 3 months) but in real life it was an hour.

but what would the lannisters do to the boltons, exactly? It's not as if there's another stark to displace them with, so even if they tried to overthrow them militarily by attacking Moat Cailin and Winterfell, what end would be achieved?
Meh, I'd rather look to move Kessel for a pick in this year's draft.Not a bad alternative but it seems like one of those deals that simply won't be agreed for.
A deposit is actually a sum of money you put that goes towards the final payment that guarantees the seller that you are committed to buying it so they don't miss out on a sale.  I don't hear about it much at dealerships (I can imagine if it's a very in-demand car) but as an entertainer that's how I make sure people don't book me then and forget about me or cancel last minute for a day that I've turned down other events for because they booked me.
this happens **all the time** in korea and china. If you are used to holding doors open for women/children/elderly, you're in for a shock. I'd be holding the door open for an old woman carrying two bags and out the corner of my eye I see people *sprinting* for the door I'm holding.After the first few times of me being some unpaid door holder-man, I just started letting go. It's kinda funny now when some busy Chinese woman sprints to the door just to have it slam in her face. The best part is, she looks at you like you did something wrong. lol

FYI endclothing is in the UK and people have reported in the past that they've been hit with import duty when shipping stuff over to the states. Do some research beforehand if you're concerned about this at all. I remember it being hit or miss...duty is 19.75% and they hit you with a handling fee as well.http://www.dutycalculator.com/dc/134411975/clothes-for-men/t-polos/dress-of-woven-cotton/import-duty-rate-for-importing-end-clothing-from-united-kingdom-to-canada-is-17/
Magma Armor should reduce Water and Rock-type damage or something, similarly to Thick Fat, rather than the useless ability to stop 10% chances in the event someone decides to Ice Beam your Fire mons.
Sunnis have their narrations too. And we also view them as proof. And sunnis don't take the shia narrations and vice versa I'm sure. And if that's the case we're stuck at the same impasse. And I did not, and would not ever insult the Prophet or his family.It's also not fair to say that everyone else has to prove their claim except you, because we already know. If A sunni had said that it wouldn't be an argument.
Chinese SKS's with serial numbers over 9 million come with a spike bayonet. They are made of Chinese wood, I honestly don't know what it is, but mine marked up annoyingly easily compared to a hardwood or laminate Russian SKS.
this is literally super toss up. The matches that are SEEN on HLTV and people bet on are the only reason why their slightly tilted towards mostlyH statistically speaking its PERFECTLY DEAD EVEN based off stats from ESEA and Cevo which few people look up. People are using chain logic that since SKDC lost to MostlyH's best map and SKDC beat WinOut in a pretty close bo3 then obliviously MostlyH is better then WinOut. Im not sway1ng anything. I just feel this match deserves the 50/50 that it really is. But theres nothing I can do if the matches people happen to see makes them have chain logic. You can look up the stats urself on cevo and esea if you don't believe me. Also im good friends with vulcanium and pretty sure hes no longer in MostlyH
It is funny how it just comes out. Like "woosh and blah blah blah and hey did I tell you about this, it was totally awesome. Hey so *insert random question A B and C*. Yea..."

What surprises me is how QUICK you can get max-level these days. I remember when I first joined, some of my friends were already 60 (vanilla), and it took us weeks to get me to 60, since pwlvl in inferno was a tough shit to do, you couldn't just swipe through and clear entire floors in seconds.  
Yeah, I didn't see that until after I posted the comment. You'd think an article about an arrest would have the most arrest-y language in the headline  but no. And, I mean, I can't possibly be expected to RTFA.

Hello Senator Sanders- Awesome to see you here. I'm very interested in your campaign and would love to see you in office. However, I'm too young to vote in either the primary or the general election. Where can I learn more about your campaign or how to help? 
I'm just going on my own experiences with being cat-called like, a lot. I live in Philly, for what it's worth.Now, being cat-called *five times* on the way to somewhere? Lol no.
Personally I would just like an option to mix and match in the future.You are required to pay 590 for 3 of the same champ. Maybe instead they can charge more of a premium along the lines of a regular skin (975, or more depending on if its a skin or a base model) and I get to chose from the color packs whatever 3 skins I want. So I could get jax, leo, and a fizz, instead of 3 of each one.
Easy enough if you're new to oversteer, and react improperly. It wasn't really fishtailing, where the rear end lets loose, it was classic oversteer, where the steering has a mind of it's own, seemingly.
That wasn't Missandei. It was Doreah, who said someone from Qarth had told her the tale back when she was a whore. Right? I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure.
Go for it. If they've been at it a while they've seen it all. Even if all they do is listen being able to just air your shit free from judgment is so helpful.
I'm very tempted to start making the exact same things my statuses and see if people call me out for being a douchebag or if they tell me I'm "deep" or some bullshit.
Cool. I'm kinda getting tired so we can hold off tonight if thats cool. My next day off work is Sunday so we can start then, gives you more time to complete it.
Batman. He is a billionaire who selfishly spends the majority of his time and huge swaths of money on crime-fighting, when he could invest further in Gotham's commerce, infrastructure and education, employing more people and giving them a chance to improve their station in life.
I wasn't saying Rand, I was saying Ron. Hmmm... I want more money in education but I don't know how I feel about it being more centralized. Personally I'm an anarchist so centralization bothers me. I guess I'd have to look more into Sander's positions on that. 
The thing that many people don't realize is saying "A cup" or "C cup" really provides no information at all about size of the breasts other than that an A means a 1" bust and a 3" bust would be a "C". Band size directly affects cup volume. Therefore, 38A, 36B and 34C all have the same volume but are intended for women with different proportions. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/6KJjw.png) is one visual explaining the concept of sister sizes and [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Hhwoarq.jpg) is another.

And you honestly think they'll be gone forever? Really.They're suddenly the good guys for bending to tens if not hundreds of thousands being angry, wasting millions on emails and black faxes, and losing a dozen points in ratings? They didn't do it out of the goodness of their hearts. People rarely if ever do things out of the goodness of their hearts. There is always something they want, be it recognition, money, or power there's a reason. This was most likely to save face long enough to re-introduce this further down the road.
I think a lot of Americans lack political and cultural awareness beyond the USA. Not all of you and not through any fault of your own necessarily but it's something that the rest of the world kind of resents about you, that you seem to live in a bubble. I hear more about what's going in the US than my own country at times.For instance, we have an election coming up very soon here in the UK and it's at a point where I've seen more about the american presidential campaign that barely just started or the racial tension that's currently going on. So it would be nice to see more Americans taking an interest in our part of the globe once in a while. I already know all about the states.
[Case in point.](http://abcnews.go.com/2020/GiveMeABreak/story?id=124248)  Even when it's something nobody hates, they want to shut it down.  Male patrons at bars certainly don't object to ladies getting free drinks.
Does the video actually show "protesters" (in quotes because you insist on calling them protesters or whatever) lighting him on fire?No?It's a misleading title.
No offence to you Billy-Orcinus. The dish looks a little unappetizing... but that's just my personal opinion. I'm sure it tasted good? Are you thinking of trying it with some other sauce in future? :)

Except as a straight guy meeting the love of your life is an opportunity for sanctification. Family, joy, your whole life together. What's it like for the chaste gay guy meeting the love of his life? Torment. An opportunity for damnation. Darkness. Loneliness and necessarily unrequited love.And do you have male friends? Try falling in love with them. Try feeling the anguish of not being sure whether your concern for your friend is rooted in friendship or something more. Try becoming emotional when your best friend forgets to text you back. Try never being able to fully consummate your friendship. Try having sex dreams about your closest buddy.Try constantly feeling out of place, unhappy with girls, whom you don't really like, and constantly frustrated with men, who are both your only source of happiness and your destruction. Try not being able to fully explain to your family what's wrong It's not the same.

Considering women buy a little more than half of movie tickets, I'd have to guess that the industry is effectively giving women what they want to see more often than not. From there, the conversation can very quickly turn into a question of agency that I don't think is very useful.
Yes, I did freeelance. Your hourly rate depends on skill level, project, and client. A senior level artist can get as high as 55-70 per hour depending on the job. However, I've worked for around 10 less per hour for smaller companies because they just don't have huge amounts of money to throw around. An important thing in this industry is to not sell yourself short. If you're trying to get experience, it's acceptable to take a few hits you are comfortable with. But as a professional, it's not worth working for somwone who doesn't want to pay you what you're worth. Hope this helps!
Does the universe count? Because its kind of mind numbing, the whole "we exist". The whole "I am a collection of atoms which given an infinite amount of time coalesced and just happened to be able to make more of themselves."        ^^^and ^^^now ^^^I'm ^^^having ^^^an ^^^existential ^^^crisis  
Thanks so much for doing the AMA! I'm a huge fan of BB and Better Call Saul. I was wondering, why did you choose to make a spinoff about Saul instead of another character, like Gus or Jesse?
Don't worry. I've steadily been buying nintendo products since the NES and only registered this year. I was able to register a bunch of my Wii/DS purchases (though not the consoles)... easily made elite status this year. But I got some sweet coin gifts coming.It was awkward filling out pre-play surveys for things like Twilight Princess and Metroid: Other M. nine years after release...
Yeah, but what's to say that the universe was created in a way where physics behaved in a totally different fashion? What if everything behaved in a way that everything we know could not exist in the way that it does? Not really sure if I'm explaining what I'm trying to say well enough
A friend of mine has an uncle that 'inherited' his fathers (my friends grandfather, who was not actually dead at the time) guns. The grandfather was a retired gunsmith.The uncle was a neurotic idiot who threw them in a lake in a panic because guns. Thousands of dollars rusting at the bottom of a fucking lake.My friend never forgave him, military hardware was a bonding point for him and his grandfather.
He had two pairs.  He kept one in the trunk of his car in case he wore out the other pair.  Seriously, he was ahead of his time in the "zero fucks given" game.  Some of the best interviews of Ali came from Howard Cosell.  Howard was one of those unflappable guys, but Ali sparred and jabbed at him during interviews and it was funny seeing Cosell have to keep up with Ali.  I feel privileged to have been able to watch Ali fight in his prime when I was a kid.  Those were the days when the big 3 networks would carry boxing matches live on TV before PPV came into play.
Nice! I drove a short par 4 and literally lipped out the eagle putt from 12 feet. I was mad at 1st until after I realized getting a birdie for me is rare. 
If I had a decent char I would do it for you, but unfortunately I have not. Btw if a guy named Neffyy talks shit to you for asking a plvl, just ignore him, he is retarded. Gl lvling.
It shows how Ronaldo can be selfish, he is a very good player but it is relevant to the Arbeloa incident. Why are people giving him shit for these things? Because he puts himself in front of the team.
We do, but if no one was willing to give up good picks, this was the best move to make. Besides, Glennon will take the lumps this year until we get a OL.
I just watched a video from eNtak. He took out two KV-1s just by spraying 3 to 5 rockets at them, all at oblique angles. It seems that the rockets don't work of of penetration, all you have to do is shoot a few and the enemy tanks just decided to explain for some reason.HOW DID THIS GET PAST TESTING
And it was the most predictable pick it could have been! Good - I don't think the Titans were just a QB away from challenging us. I'm glad they didn't get 2-3 1st's.
Congrats, your team only had to be the laughing stock of the league for years to finally be considered to have potential.  Most teams pull that off without the years of sucking.
Possibly my favorite opening theme music (closely tied with Kingdom Hearts' stellar *["Passion"](http://youtu.be/fGjFauNjiFE)*).This arrangement is from the Chrono Trigger Orchestra Extra soundtrack and holy shit if the CT soundtrack isn't just a goldmine of awesome music.
I seen many full fades sells for normal 390-400k on reddit and it wasnt a quicksell either. So i think its safe to assume 97% fade is roughly 360k and its QS is around 320
I also have this problem, so it isn't just you (it's what's putting me off buying the pressed versions tbh.) Not really a great fix for patchiness or blending issues (which I also have with the new ones) BUT what I do is basically layer something else on top. I use Doge because it's sheer and also my transition shade, but obviously you could use something different - I'd suggest either a sheer transition colour or a colour similar to the Blackbird shadow. It evens out the colour and makes it look quite seamless, and if the layering shadow has any shimmer or sheen to it the light reflecting will blur the effect of the whole thing and make it look really gorgeous. Of course, this really works best when your whole eye is Blackbird because it can be annoying keeping the overshadow to one area.
Indeed. Hex no longer applies the break mechanic. Silver Edge/Aghs Demonic Purge/Aghs Doom do, however, stop evasion and all other passives not listed there.
What happened to "Tell me who you're going out with and what time you think you'll be back"?If I wasn't back by the time I said I would be, I'd get a phone call to find out what's going on. Just because we have the capabilities to track our kids, doesn't mean we should without them themselves giving us just cause. By all means, have find my iPhone on standby, but don't use these Apps to track your kids when they've just gone to the park with their friends. Place some trust in them. 
It doesn't contain any of the shitty tumblr gif symptoms though (weird color filter, way too short for the caption, accompanied by 3 other short gifs to help it complete aforementioned caption)
&gt;  She is a little shit, but he's supposed to be a professional.Supposed to be, but he's not. And the job doesn't require that he is. Subbing is a thankless, horrible job. Depending on where you are it doesn't take much to sub. The prerequisites for the job don't define a professional position and neither does the pay. And neither does the treatment you receive from everybody involved. Of course he handled the situation very poorly, and he shouldn't be allowed to sub again. But I just want to make it clear that subbing is not a professional position. It should be, but it isn't. 
Do you have Ikea there, they do lovely large prints. I also have one wall in my massive kitchen wallpapered with a mural of Bangkok at night, it gets loads of compliments. I got it off a German company through eBay.
im actually giving it to my girlfriend so im not going to mess with it but that one that i bought is the smaller female sized one. it wouldnt even fit my wrist, its too small. add the skype: pickupjerseys and ask them for the cartier bracelet. The shipping took 6 days in total.
First of all, you're a 9.3, not a +9.3. A handicap with a + is better than scratch. As in the player must add strokes to hanicap even par. Saw a post recently that Mickelson actually does keep a handicap and its in the +6 range. You're not better than him.Ball construction and composition is what matters. A 2 piece ionomer cover ball (the top flites you have) will all be the same to you, regardless of brand. The more expensive balls are 3 or 4 (or 5) piece urethane cover ball will be very different than the others, and you might be able to tell a difference between brand (better players most certainly do). Quick Google search will tell you everything you want to know.
I never said that people should stop playing Melee. Let's look at this from outside smash, and at the FGC community as a whole. With seemingly every other prominent franchise, the community moves on and accepts the new game as the new meta. Smash exists in its own bubble, and with every new game comes a new fissure in the community. I would just like for the community to move on to the latest game. When I go to other fighting game forums/subreddits, it isn't a competition between previous games, and it all seems unanimous that people are moving forward with the new game. That's all I am confessing to what I want in a smash brothers game. Of course it will never happen, because the support for Melee is incredible, and the developers chose not to embrace what melee has become and instead chose to take the game into a different direction.
And that would be the perfect front to a large scale meth operation. No one would think you would *actually* do that after making a TV show about it. Perfect I say. Genius I tell you.
No offense, but doesn't it seem a bit over the top that you need to type this up under a fake name at your sister's house?How much have you normalized this behavior in your mind?  How much are you willing to go through?  He's going to say sorry, and that he'll change, but you mentioned that you put your foot down on this matter over a *year* ago.Sweet talk isn't going to match reality, but it's a fun poison to drink when you want to normalize things.

Thanks /u/frankasaurussmite, personally I don't mind the UI as it makes a change from the standard DNA cloned GUI.I agree without the silicone sleeve, it is slippery. It's always on mine though, I think the sleeve looks fine. But it can be a hassle if you over drip and get juice underneath it, or when taking it off to charge / change batteries.
Can someone explain to me how it is possible to catch a gun or a boot or any other item that should just be waited down? Do the currents wisk them up and they get tangled in a small fishing line? Seems like an almost impossible chance happening to me. (I'm not saying this wasn't caught, I just want to know the physics of it)

Wow, Ali Al-Bokhaiti has a really shitty comment section. Poor guy probably gets death threats from all sides. I'm surprised the Houthis haven't done anything to him.
That's cool! My parents were somewhat conservative and pretty religious so nudity was pretty taboo. I guess it had the opposite effect on me. It's not that I prefer being naked over clothed or vise versa, I just don't care either way. 
Oh yeah, losing santa thing. I'm retarded. I think your reasons are pretty decent at that point then, I just kind of glossed over the losing the santa for some reason. My bad.I understand that pain of losing a bunch of money, I just had some short term memory loss I guess. Heh. 
It has never been my end goal to constantly expand my nation and I quiet don't understand that.  Yes there is a lot of conflict but there is also just as much diplomacy, national events, roleplay, and other items if not more.  Some will always choose war but to say its the only option for nations with no neighbors is wrong.
I'd point out, though, that "making love", depending on the decade, can also mean simply being flirtatious or charming - buttering someone up, maybe - and has no sexual connotation whatsoever. This leads to things like etiquette/advice columns advising fathers to "make love" to their daughters to try to cheer them up/be persuasive/whatever. 
The show pretty much entirely relies on whether you can identify with the characters or not. I could, so I really loved it. Didn't think any of them were assholes, just imperfect kids being put into difficult situations. But I understand why some people don't like them, since it is hard to rationalize their behaviors.
God, we really are going back to the Cold War era of diplomacy, if we're criticizing the violations of human rights in a communist country and their counter argument is "And you're lynching Negros".

Tommy's match comp vs Seattle. If you ask me, he's as good as gone. too creative for our team. different wavelength from our players, which is so sad. 
The answer is yes to all your questions except the last one. The question is complicated because war changes the political dynamics. People have to adapt in order to appeal toward the population.
Sorry I meant before bassnectar but I then realized set times haven't been announced yet. Both days are around 11 hours so I'd smoke a blunt or something before coming have a beer or two and then drop your tab later maybe so there is 5 or 6 hours of peak time at the festival because I assume bassnectar is closing saturday
Of course it is, I didn't think he was being egotistical either.  He certainly said some things that honestly should've been commented on more from Robin.  Like the deal with him believing that the whole uproar was a minority of 4chan/activists, I believe that Robin could've easily refuted that by saying...well no, there's plenty of discussion on the Nexus about it, the biggest Skryim modding community out there.In a lot of ways Nick took this situation too much like how TB described some people took it, he was way too black and white about who exactly was protesting this move from Valve, too quick to just dismiss them as an angry uncontrollable mob, in the same way really as...well I don't wanna bring them up but, anti-GG does.
If you want to try getting more use out of your shimmery/bright colours, have you tried wearing them lightly as just a hint of colour over a neutral matte base? I have hooded lids so I'm not a big fan of shimmers but I like putting just a little pop of brightness in the inner corner, or a sweeping of colour over the centre of the lid which fades out to my everyday browny/taupe shades in the crease.I don't have any experience selling so can't help you there but yeah, if you really don't want to part with your collection then maybe try some alternative methods of using the stuff so it doesn't feel wasted?
Well I have something that I call starvation mode, but it certainly doesn't help me get fatter. Basically, when I am hungrier than usual my body enters ''need to hunt and find some food'' mode, and I get really focused. It can be helpful on exams and such.

My prediction:First 2 seasons Winston is decent but we fail to get to the Playoffs while Mariota struggles..then, after the third season Mariota starts being a beast and we regret this decision.
Sunblock for men is -- indeed actually different.  It has a different chemical composition that is far better suited for men's skin.  The best brand I know of is called Brawndo, and it's got electrolytes . 
I think it'd be cool to see something related to the canal...maybe start at the Ottawa River and work your way to Dows Lake, sharing history along the way???Either way, cool concept and I'd like to see the result!
a lot of shit has happened, but I do believe that the media has been the worst offender in this. I really did not realize the power they had until I saw the street in front of me and then how they showed the same street on tv 
I definitely really like the fact that you no longer have to program all of the color sets at once anymore... Nothing is worse than being on your 8th color set and messing up xD
Not that I'm disagreeing with anything else you said, but Cazorla hardly ever dives, he just had that one really bad/obvious one a couple years back which got him the reputation. People also assume he doesn't track back or get stuck in because he's built in the small Spanish playmaker mould, but he's been one of our best players this season playing CM and when he's playing well he always gets a foot in.EDIT: Interesting how this got downvoted lol, the dive I was referring to was West Brom. If you actually watched Cazorla for Arsenal (I admit I can't speak for Spain or his career in La Liga) you'd know that he hardly ever dives, especially considering how much he gets kicked. It's misinformation and unfair on Cazorla. Sanchez was a fair shout though. 
We have a lot to sit and talk about. I have yet to see him since he dropped that big old bombshellI'm lucky enough to have amazing family, friends and co workers around me and I know time will fix everything
I'm in the same position as you are, so all I can say is, "Be strong. Be very, very strong." If it helps to motivate you, there's a player in my residential ward (I'm on Midgardsormr) who mains PLD, who doesn't have a static and plays at offpeak times, and yet is fully decked out in dreadwyrm gear now. AFAIK, once FCoB went on DF, he played in DF repeatedly until he got his gear. That's a person who is unafraid of the sociopaths who sometimes pop up in DF, and we could all aspire to be like him.
Have to be without my PS4 from Thursday evening through Tuesday, so I went HAAM sandwich in the IB over the last few days. Just maxed out my Warlock earlier this afternoon. Bought my emblems, shaders, bond, chest piece, helmet, Spear and Lash. Jolder's, Silimar's and that sweet Shark Whisperer ship dropped. Hooray!Love this game.See you in the crucible, Guardians.

Not a teacher just truth spread around like wild fire, but in my middle school a teacher actually put "wont succeed in life, would end up working at mcdonalds". Yeah that teacher wasnt in the district anymore. 
I've actually had administrations roll their eyes at me for calling them too much, when class after class had kids acting like this. Sometimes they come and you explain the situation, and they look at you as if to say, "well what do you want me to do about it?" Some schools have an attitude that you're supposed to deal with it in the classroom. That's less true for subs than it is for full teachers, though.

That "ERIE" one looks pretty old:http://www.castironcollector.com/erie.phpEdit: that looks like a 1st or 2nd series there. Manufactured in early or late 1880's based on what castironcollector is saying.  That could fetch you a couple hundred if you clean it up and sell it. 
Shibas are really weird man. Taro gets all weird in certain places and fine in others. Kiba doesn't explore around the apartment complex but the moment we are in the backwoods area he really opens up.It takes a bit for puppies to get used to things. Took Taro about a month to get used to the car sounds when walking on the road. I could only walk for about 200 feet before she would give up on life.

The alpha builds of the Witcher 2 used a heavily modified version of the Aurora engine they used in the first game (instead of RedEngine, CDProject's in house engine which they used for the final release), which is why originally Geralt looked very similar.
Good and evil is subjective irl but in Pathfinder they are real forces that can be detected and to some degree measured which some of the necromancy spells fall under as that is just what they are.I wouldn't perform these acts with the expectation that others aren't going to react negatively to them but you could roleplay it as fear through ignorance, that spells are tools and how you use them is what really matters with an ends justify the means darker set mentality.
Basically. I'm here totally legally and everything, but You can basically come in on a cheap tourist visa and basically just stay here and let it expire.. Foreigners are not allowed to own property, but you could rent. Landlords are technically required to check your visa status and submit your address to the police department but most are hesitant to do so as it means they have to pay tax on their income from your rent. If any authority figure at any level asks to see your passport or visa, you can resolve the issue with a small amount of money instead
Aren't some of this years wrong? I had the idea the president of the United States served for 4 years each term. I also tought the previous election was in 2008, and Obama took office somewhere at the start of 2009.1 - Bill Clinton  2 - George W. Bush (2000-2001?)  3 - John Kerry (2004-2005?)  4 - Barrack Obama (2008-2009?)  5 - Mitt Romney (2012-2013?)  So it could have been 5 different presidents. Just not sure about the years of election/taking office.
I've been muted more then enough times for "evading filter"... You're pretty much saying "Go get muted to explain your point"... The way majority of the mods see it, is that the filter is there for a reason, so don't evade it.That's the problem.As for the bad mood, explain why these are a thing:loli - fine ladyfuck - firetruckdress - rainbowfarm - playfarming - fruit pickingkappa - umbrellasI read those filters as "I don't like this, or that, or this, or sick of that, or that". Loli got filtered suddenly. One day I addressed a friend as a loli, and said hi like I normally do. The next I'm asked why I'm suddenly calling her a fine lady. Asked about it, got silenced for 2 hours. The only person who silences longer then 30 minutes on the first offense, other then Zallius is peppy. Zallius was offline at the time.
Nope. Basic math says a salary of 150k means bunk with 500k of loans. After all taxes you're probably looking at 100k take home. But also there's 35k+ in just servicing the interest on the debt. So now you have 65 take home, apply 35k to debt. So now you're a doctor in their mid 30s most likely, making 30k and still in 465k of debt. 
I agree. Her protection is that you can't just lock her out- even on oral month-to-month you have to serve notice to quit, etc. At the minimum it's 30 days notice. If you did lock her out, the cops can and will knock on your door. 
They can kinda glide, they jump and flap their wings but it doesn't give them lift, more of a controlled fall. So yes you are right, but what if he got a running start and jumped from a house?
I had a pizza for the first time in months yesterday.  Flatbread margherita individual sized.  Was the lowest calorie option and I love basil. Ate half. It was not that I didn't enjoy it, but there are other things in my life that I enjoy that are incompatible with pizza.

My goodness, are you me?I felt the same way. The petty nature of anti-GG'ers in SRD/ghazi far outweighs even the most hardcore Pro-GG'er. It's like boxing your own shadow.
It was a block attempt and he got socked. Not intentional but still a foul. Just anger at a key player getting injured and the way the game is going I think. EDIT: Just saw it from a different angle. It does look intentional actually.
And what did the leaders before Erdogan do? Were Turkey in a rich state? Remember 2001 economic crisis? How many economic crisis were there since 2002? And remember that that he gets the vote of half of Turkey's population. The "Turkish society" you talk about doesn't represent the whole Turkey and only seculars who hate muslims and Islam are the ones who hate Erdogan and his friends. Coincidence? Hardly.
Well, I am a doctor of scientific studying. I can confirm that obesity is not real. Because 100 years ago Marlyin Monroe was obese and she was worshipped. There is even evidence in science that I uncovered archaeologically that Jesus was obese. So with all of my doctor science facts, I have proven obesity is not real. 
Was just poking fun. The S prefix is the 4 cylinder sport bikes. There isn't an S1200 anything, only S1000.He probably said or meant the R1200 (2cyl) line, like the R1200GS or the R1200RT. 
The NOAH as well as the UK Albinism fellowship facebook groups are pretty active. I wish people would use Reddit instead; helps with keeping discussions more private.
This may not be in Texas but I do have some examples. Quite a few people in Texas keep guns on their boats for their protection from strangers as well as some type a of fish. In my area there are alligator gar. Just catch one of those and see how fast you freak out.
My stance:1) Song choice and lip-sync style *definitely* matter. As soon as that country song came on in season four, I knew Chad was sending Latrice packing. Kenya is an example of this. She can kill those upbeat, pop songs, but as soon as A Natural Woman came on, Latrice snatched her so hard. Hell, even Malambo no.1 is an example of this. There was no way that Jinkx was going to get sent home on a song she could sell as funny.2) This season just doesn't have strong lip syncers left. With Kandy and JDF gone, the only strong lip syncers left are Kennedy (assuming it's an upbeat song and she's not in a gown) and Katya. Violet *might* be able to turn a lip sync, and if it's a campy song so could Ginger and Trixie, but other than that, you're not going to get Laganja-levels of dancing.Ultimately it was an underwhelming lip sync, yes, but it's also not like Pearl and Miss Fame are among the best lip syncers nor is this even a season with a lot of dancers and lip syncers.
At the end of the day, the only thing that ever really changes the world is the power of the people.Even in instances where massive governmental pressure is brought to bear, ultimately it is because it has the support of the people, that it happens.Case in point, the US occupation of Japan in the 1940's, which they privately expected to fail - they thought there would be massive riots, civil unrest, constant rebellion etc.No, there really wasn't.  Because the Japanese people were sick and tired of their old government's bullshit, sure they weren't fond of these big vulgar Americans, but it was better than the military junta before....Only when the people of Indonesia are properly pissed off, motivated, and sufficiently empowered to do so, will change occur.  
Oh that's okay.  I knew you didn't have a shred of integrity the moment you completely ignored the arguments on American Medical Associations criteria for recommending circumcision simply because you knew you couldn't refute them.  Thought to myself, "Yup, this one is going to be dishonest *to the core*.  This person wants to win arguments more than he or she wants to *actually be right*."Now you're posting dumb circular links and I'm thinking thanks for proving my initial low opinion of you correct.  Cheers.
I get people that grab the chalk and start chalking when I call "safety".  I get that you know you will be shooting shortly, but wait the 10 seconds.  The last guy that did it to me, without saying anything, I pointed to him with my cue, then pointed to his chair.
He's hired by someone who wants to use both his talents. He wishes to experiment with rare ingredients. When he returns, the kitchen seems so small. The act of cooking just seems petty in comparison to the risks of adventure. He failed. He can't go back to the kitchen where he made food for the one he loved, so he chooses to roam. 
I had to use painters tape. Its not as sticky as much as the other tapes are. My snake went missing for about 2 weeks. Tried everything in the book. One day i turned my ac on and put tape everywhere on the floors and had a small heated spot in the middle of the room under a hide. Middle of the night i heard lots of rustling. Tape came off quirt easily and the snake was just pissy that i was handling him.
you watched this more than once?!! brave woman. i was zero months pregnant and this left me an emotional wreck. i don't think i can ever watch this again.
Except they're also... y'know. Athletes. They're athletic. They're performing a physical activity. Video games are not the same as sports no matter how much you delude yourself. The laws of physics don't change every couple of months. "The NFL has released a patch to reduce the passing range of Tom Brady" doesn't happen. 
&gt; Schroedinger's ImmigrantsThat is fantastic and I am totally stealing it. It reminds me of negative stereotypes about women that simultaneously have us too stupid to run companies/do tech stuff/do math, but so cunning and devious we can bend men around our little fingers and trap them in all sorts of creative ways.
In my Christian Anthropology course I was taught that the Jewish people at the time did not grasp the concept of creatio ex nihilo as they couldn't properly conceptualize nothingness. Thus, in a manner similar to most of the ancient near East religion they shows their deity separating rather than creating.

I dunno, at least locally where I am the Warhammer people are pretty normal. Probably has something to due with the fact that only people with good enough social skills to land themselves a job that pays well enough to afford Warhammer has something to do with it, but aside from two or three people, everyone's pretty normal. When I played MTG though..... Ugh. Ive never walked into a room and felt like I was literally the most "hip/cool/not neckbeardy" person in the room before. It wasn't exactly a good feeling. 
Does anyone have a copy of Ezra Taft Benson's book he wrote "Title of Liberty". Page 42-50 that contains the controversial talk he gave at the Logan Temple in 1963?
Stereotypically people who are weird and flashy with an obsession for anime.  I'm well aware that the stereotype is just that and no more, but it was a joke.  Thanks for ruining it.
The problem with registries like that, is that it's hard to make them "essential" enough that anyone looking for a game goes to *that specific* registry. That said, I've had some luck with /r/lfg and meetup.com for finding local and online games.
Ok, see this actually educated me quite a bit. In fact, I think tonight will be my first Muslim play-through. I've always looked for ways to play the game as Muslim and it looked amazingly fun however Decadence always through me for a loop. This helped a lot but what do I do with heirs? Do I give them land if they're a male heir?

And now you've answered my question for me. :) 
Yeah, it isn't really all that pleasant on the eyes.  The different lighting conditions and source frame rates aren't helping either.  Over the ten months between the videos I spent countless hours trying to throw better and ~0 hours learning video editing.

I acquired the 'Despecialized Editions" recently, and really enjoy watching them. Not only was I surprised at what was added, but also parts of scenes that were removed from the later releases - especially in ANH. 
I believe there may be a discrepancy about WHAT exactly is older.A particular "robot" may be older than a particular "tree", however, the FIRST "tree" existed long before the FIRST "robot". Same as Twinkies may be older than a particular senior citizen, senior citizens have existed before the invention of Twinkies.Therefore, what I think the original poster means by "natural" is an IDEA or CONCEPT of something predating another rather than a particular instance of something predating another.
I honestly have no idea. It appears that people aren't attracted to them all that often (big surprise there), so it's probably hard to find examples of this.
Not necessarily. If you check his dates for festivals, and the dates those festivals begin, the date he has on his site is always day 1. This could just be the format for his tour page.
I wonder what would have happened if Chip played it cool and called at the last minute.    He might have made up the Titans mind when they saw how much he was willing to give up.

Yeah no. Unless you're working for a huge company with scripted helpdesk, this is not as easy as it sounds.  Yes, you can google the answers, but dealing with the average user is not what I would call "zero effort".
The way I see it is she used the necessary amount of force to stop the crimes that were being committed in her presence (criminal mischief, disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, etc) and the necessary amount of force required to stop him from harming himself or others, thus potentially  saving his life.

I've been doing sms marketing for 2 years now. I doubt the telco (telstra, vodaphone, optus etc) has a deal with a jewellery store as it's not really target marketing if you're male. It's likely you have a recycled number and the previous owner of the number had signed up for promotional material.You can opt out of most SMS campaigns by replying STOP, however if the promo campaign doesn't have an OPT OUT clause at the end of the message, give ACMA a call and keep the message.
I honestly think most people who go to law school don't really want to be lawyers, they just don't know what else to do and need a little more time to figure out a game plan.  The meme before I went to law school was that a law degree was good for a lot of things, but the fact is, unless you want to be a lawyer, you should not go to law school.I have a good job and enjoy my work for the most part, but if I had to do it over again I probably would have tried something else.
I am also a transfer and I hear alot of mixed reviews on it. Since you are new to the area and don't know a lot of people like myself I am assuming,  on campus living is a must for first semester to get things settled. To meet people and get comfortable and possibly finding a job. 
Government union: a contract. Religious Ceremony: a marriage. There is nothing here that is forcing churches (or any religious institution) to perform marriages on gay people. LGBT unions by the government are a legal contract for many reasons that LerrisHarrington detailed some of:"When people are talking in favor of same sex marriages, we're talking about the legal definition with the government. Its important for legal reasons, hospital visitation rights, decision making if your partner is too injured to direct their own medical care, inheritance, taxes, all kinds of mudane but important stuff."

RNGs pretty crap on E2 for me at the start. Did a trial run on Hard and got crit to red on the first node. Didn't think I would make it through hard so I dropped it to medium. Got hit again to red on the first node... Proceed to clear it the next 6 runs on hard and only end up using something like 30 buckets
*shrugs* can you even quantify 'sounds good' with 'good quality'? Most of what people flip over is simply against what they're used to, i.e. double-blind studies have shown teens *prefer* med-lo quality mp3 over lossless, likely because that's how they are cultured.Just saying...
&gt; but in standing up for yourself you also get branded a racistOk, I have been seeing this same sentence being thrown around /r/videos and I'm starting to think it's bs after seeing all the comments being upvoted there.
I think they'd have to throw it another B level prospect or 2nd round pick this year. Even than idk if it's worth it. Next year they'll be even better and the pick will be around 20-30th overall which is a crap shoot especially for a player of phils caliber 
He tried to commit suicide in the early 80s, but was unsuccessful.I guess you could make the argument that the "trip down the stairs" was suicide, but his biographer doesn't think so. He was just a frail old man who took a tumble.
I don't think they realize how big of a game league is.  They see 600k~ summoners and think they're over half the player base when they're not even close to a tenth lol.
I have post apocalyptic dreams. Usually about nuclear winter/aftermath, though I've had incurable diseases, flooding and loads more. There's always something I have to do, somewhere I have to get to and I have to fight my way there. I call them my 'Quest Dreams'. They're quite lucid and I can control them quite a bit. I never seem to be able to complete the quest. I feel kinda weird about it. Never quite get things done. 
That's cool how Lucy helped your depression! I actually read an article a few days ago about how psychedelics can possibly medically help people through depression. Just trippy shit I thought I should share
That's not a bad idea.To be honest, most jobs are soul-crushing and monotonous. I definitely understand about having a toxic, goal-driven workplace. Sometimes calling it quits is just necessary.
If you cant get north south pick west facing.  Your back yard will be shaded in the afternoon and that helps keep the pool temp lower.  I've been here 28 years and have seen about 5 scorpions. Tnats one of the great things about living here very few bugs. I moved here from Louisiana.   
I don't suffer from some false sense of security. I know the risk me being born female places on me just walking around on my own and I fucking hate it. I'M not responsible for your actions or your values or whatever and I refuse to be held accountable cos an asshole can't control his sexual and violent urges. 
as a silver lining, whatever happens this year, the clippers should keep their core. we have shown we can go toe to toe with the champs, this team is a few pieces away from being unstoppable.
This is strongly my own opinion, but for healing, I would say that getting those top ranks isn't exactly an indication that you're the best healer of your class. Like Glubbi explained, a healer getting high ranks is usually the result of either less healers, slacked healing, or something was dealt with incorrectly which caused an unusually high amount of damage and required more healing.However, if you do manage to obtain a high rank, you should still be happy with it! It shows you're *capable* of putting out high enough numbers to keep people alive, or at the very least keep going long enough to kill the boss. Just don't try to grab those ranks by forcing every bit of healing out there and hindering yourself later in an encounter.
It used to be the top 15 or 20 percent of students went to college. Now that we feel everyone should go, college degrees don't garner near the same respect they used to and for good reason.
Beautiful! I wish this happened on our plane to Armenia as well. I just recently came back after a visit to Armenia to pay my commemoration to the Armenian Genocide.
For everyone complaining about this being sold at a hospital they aren't saying eat the onion rings with your pizza and oreo cake. They give plenty of options, this was OPs delicious and unhealthy combination.
When you damage skin, cells congregate to help the healing process. With this it brings extra melanin, which gives skin it's pigment. Or, something along those lines. I'm too sure of the terminology.
i can't be the only person who is just perplexed by this coverage. they never showed a replay of the "high stick". I mean, this is just embarrassing of a major tv network. i can't believe this awful play by play guy and amateur coverage is the best they can do. 
Whether the songs are good or not is obviously a matter of opinion, but it's a pretty objective fact that with only 2 (maybe I'll give you that Chicago Wombat as #3) exceptions, the songs featured any extended improvisation and are pretty much interchangeable with the studio versions. They were also horribly overplayed, much more so compared to any other album release they've done. 
I work in a hospital, and if we didn't laugh at this stuff, we'd all be severely depressed or dead within a few years. I agree it shouldn't have been filmed, but the others are probably taking pictures to show their spouses. We're not the TSA, we're not the secret service, we're the ones pulling dildos out of butts. If we don't get to laugh, you can try to get it out yourself.
I bought one specifically to laminate my study materials because my cat kept chewing on the corners. The things are like $13 on Amazon. Every house in America ought to have one. 
Nope, they definitely are loaded. Protocol is having the gun on safe with an empty chamber and a loaded mag. That way it takes two different operations before the gun is live. 1.) Chambering a round 2.) Taking the gun off of safety. Then pulling the trigger.
yes. I'm buying 3 this month. [Yukari](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/236151), [Mitsuru](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/251437), and [Aigis](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/143044). If you want to get into figure collecting, do yourself a favor and read [this](http://tinyurl.com/buyfag). AmiAmi and Mandarake are probably the best places to buy figures.
I dont know why, but for like 3 solid minutes I thought that there was some sort of magic trick in the shot, because of the angle of the mirror and the light, I thought that you and your reflection were two separate people. Like the mirror looks lighter in your hair and eyebrows, plus the way your hair parts adds to what my high little brain was already saying.
The chemicals did not react well to her system. She was on it, lost weight, was getting weaker, and she passed out cold on the couch. Couldn't wake her. I was maybe 9 or so. Apparently something in the food plus the "vitamins" poisoned her.
Ha! No - I just buy a lot of non-working watches, and I've over-extended myself. I didn't know if you were the one who made the video and service notes for the Poljot. I figured that if you were, you might be interested in a bunch of non-working watches. Lotta Russian stuff in there, plus a bit of everything else. I can eventually get to all of them, but I'd feel a lot of weight off my back if they were gone, too. I have a tendency to bite off more than I can chew. 
I agree with you on nearly everything but I guess the things you have an issue with don't seem to bother me. The intro is what it is. It's actually a blend of crisis core, the tech demo, and the original. These mods are just a collection from various people. There's no set "this is the official" mod for ff7. The point I guess I was trying to make with this post was to build awareness towards the project to potentially find more people who would like to get involved to bring a more uniform feel for the update/upgrade/whatever you want to call it. I appreciate your detailed response btw! 
I understand! If you are still looking try contacting developer teams like alcove and PixelFire is always looking for people if I am right. But you can always try to contact any team to ask to join or collaborate. 
i think it's harmless to harbor these thoughts or impressions. sometimes people rub me the wrong way in my studio-for example, people in the front row who don't try to make mirror space for the people behind them. i view it as a lack of conscientiousness.
In movies yes, or characters in shows that don't play a big role. However when we're talking about one the MC's in a tv show, the trope grts really boring after a while. Movies aren't usually as long so it's not as much of a problem, but it can have a big effect on a tv series. But I agree, Joker from Dark Knight made that one of my favourite movies.
Freebirds is pretty meh. I prefer tex mex style to the more "authentic" style of chipotle, but ill pick chipotle over them anyday. I usually go to qdoba as its closer to me though
ME3 is still too easy for me on Insanity I wish there was a harder setting. ME2 just upped the damage and made the enemies bullet sponges and ME1 had a broken combat system that made the combat easy and/or frustrating.

Both. On my first accident, where I even blacked out, and my bike was way shittier back then, the first thing I did once I awoke, on the ground next to the car, was get up and go see how the bike was. I can imagine I was blacked out for a bit, cause when I got back to the bike, the driver was out of the car, there was some oil and gas already under the bike (even though it didn't crack an engine case), and people were already out of the stores and stuff, watching the whole thing. I didn't care about me, I just wanted to pick the bike up and see how she was

I use to have the same problem...I fixed this by paying attention to my "take away". I really started taking the club away from the ball and tried to keep the club low . "Low on the take away" (that was my swing thought trigger for years). At least it felt like i was taking it away low....Go to the range and try it... you may hit behind it once or twice since it will be new. But this helped me a bunch.  I actually use this thought process still on my long fairway shots; woods and long hybrids. 
Not so much what I don't want to see (since sp is about it ;) ) but I DO want to see a mercenary playlist. Other than that, I don't really care as long as they keep the core mechanics.
the level of frilly sugary girlyness that Japanese bras attain is way more than i have ever seen in US, UK, and EU bras. there are still basics and things closer to what places like Aerie and VS do, but stuff like [this](http://www.shirohatoshop.com/en/shop/g/g261438525DE/) and [this](http://www.shirohatoshop.com/en/shop/g/gA5693720/) are what i think of when Japanese bras come to mind. its more of a 'cute' aesthetic than a 'sexy' one, if that makes sense.
&gt;  If he's not making the effort to fix it because he is comfortable just ignoring polite requests, make them impoliteThat's childish and extremely inappropriate for a teacher to do. If it is really such a giant problem, then the teacher should talk to the parents, not openly mock a student in front of their peers.
I had that happen my senior year of highschool, but my teacher was 25 and a beautiful girl, and I was 18 and a virgin (shy and awkward). I caught her, and she smiled at me, so I smiled and walked out lol. I was foolish. 
In Stirling, Scotland...one of the guys I lived with had a nice roll and ecstasy as a midnight snack. Ran straight into a wall outside the halls of residence. Broke his nose. Knocked himself out.

Just a reminder, Steven went back to help the gems because Greg mentioned how Rose's shield was one of the major reasons the Crystal Gems won the war.This is great though.
Not demolishes. Is a little bit better performance wise. The 750ti has the newer architecture, WAY less power consumption. And it's much more gpu for the price even disregarding power consumption.
This. I only even bought the URF finisher icon because at least I got the Heart, and I really liked the design of the icon itself.As for 250 RP, honestly, I feel, and have always felt, this is how much a ward skin should cost as is. Even 390 would be better than what it is now. But a ward skin being more expensive than even the cheapest of champions is absolutely ridiculous. I will never buy a ward skin at their current standard price. And I say this as someone who has a history of warding a *lot*. It's just not worth it to pay the same amount for this little blob that I would for an entire character revamp.
If the Eagles actually offered two firsts and a third round pick and players [as reported](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2448023-titans-trade-rumors-latest-news-rumors-and-speculation) including Bradford, the Titans just made the biggest mistake in their franchise history.

I remember reading that initially, Walt intentionally moved Jane out of the recovery position, knowing that she would die, in order to open Jesse's eyes. Bryan read this and thought that it was too malicious an act for Walt's character to do yet, and he talked it down to Walt accidentally happening on her shifting and then standing by as she choked to death, in order to get Jesse to get out of his phase.
"The Fellowship should've just called the Eagles in to drop the Ring into Mt. Doom." Tolkein more or less plugged up that plot hole in his other works. It's been debunked quite a few times, but people still share it like 'Mind=blown' ALL THE TIME.
Sorry about that the formatting went bad after copying and pasting.Here's it fixed: http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/34gjoo/factoring_terms_in_sets/The sets are separated by the commaThe answer is 4st^2But I don't know how to get to this answer
First find the value you can deliver that most people cannot and then exploit that. If you can blaze a trail that makes money, most paths lead profitable (for you) opportunities.I know I simplified the approach, but it you have some industry knowledge there's tons of ways to save/make cashEdit: The safe paths are usually not the most profitable when you have a horizon of 10 years.
You need to be connected to the Internet, but as for Ps+, I'm not sure, sorry. You level up with xp like most games, though the story is not an exclusive way to make xp. You can buy Crew Credits from the PS Store to buy cars with, though Pvp racing is lucrative (not matter your placing) and kind of fun at times. Upgrading cars is done by doing Skills found around the game-world. Advancing the story is not necessary, I have not finished it. The only perk is, well, perks. Throughout the story you meet up with characters whom grant you perks, like attributes to an RPG. Easy to pick up and play, put as much effort, time and money into it as you wish. 
I didn't downvote! Hey I'm here showing my body, why would I get upset S: I did get a breast augmentation, it helped me because obviously I needed it! I hope all women who lost weight have this option as well:)
Then someone Googles it and you suddenly have some explaining to do. :P But seriously, dirty cross-stitchings always make me smile and this one is great! :D*Iron Bull Greatly Approves*
Floyd is a joke. he'll be a trivia question just like pernell whitaker and roy jones jr. no memorable fight in his career,no great rounds that anyone can think, much less talk about. and here is Iron Mike, long retired still doing interviews because he was a great boxer who entertained the masses by destroying his opponents. 15 years from now we'll still be watching interviews of mike and none from floyd. the only legend in the ring this saturday will be many because he's fun to watch because everyone accepts him.he doesn't have to brag about his greatness,he shows how great he is i the ring. the other guy just runs his mouth.
I do not know actually and none of my sources either. Logic says tomorrow but heart wants it today. I was looking forward to that more than 6.84I think they just wanna finalize teams before they announce the Compendium so they can release it at the same time and not bother about hiding the invite pages and team profile pages if the Compendium were revealed first.
I think the Rangers played better, despite getting scored against. Ran laps against the Caps all other times that wasn't the Ovi goal.Should be a good second period.
I wasn't using Oakenfold as an example of a techie, and I never implied that, so you're misconstruing my words.The dude asked do I've "ever *been*" to the playa, and I said yes, and shared an anecdote about my immediate experience there.Are all techies the same? Clearly not, that is prejudice. Do many notable, wealthy techies have an anti-society, anti-public goods, elitist libertarian political and social agenda? Absolutely.
Tape is great for a temporary solution, but I would also highly recommend "Shoe Goo" for a more permanent fix. You can usually find it in sporting goods stores/skate shops. 
That's fine. I have no problem with that. All I have said is that in certain countries in Europe we laugh at you for believing in God. Not everyone but a large portion of the population finds it very funny. I never said anything else. I never bragged. I just said that one thing. I'm sorry if it upsets you but you have to accept that some people will find your beliefs funny. What I don't like is you making up stuff about me. I never bragged about my country and o never started to insult. Only Americans insulted me first because they cannot handle people laughing at their beliefs. 
Have you ever eaten any of the burn site morels? I'm an east coaster, only ever found morels once in the last 15 years, and they were awesome. As morels are so scarce in my area I told my local mushroom buddies I was going to buy some from the west coast, but they snicker and talk down about the morels you find out there. They all say they're full of sand and grit and not worth eating.What are your thoughts on edibility?
See everyone seems to have their preference, hair to no hair. It's split right down the middle.I'm surprised myself actually about the soft pictures, I didn't think I'd end up posting the album.
You didn't say it, but other people on this post have.While your scenario is plausible, I don't really see how she could "go with it" as part of a problem. She's supposed to go with the movement, that's why it's done. Nobody says, "Well, if you had resisted more, this wouldn't have happened." You apply the amount of force you need to move her. He went 'use all of my strength possible' immediately. If he had done what he said he did 'guide her to the ground', she wouldn't have left so much blood on the floor.  
The use of the clinical term is dehumanizing. That may not be what they intended, but it is certainly an effect. Just as an interesting experiment in your own life, find someone who is absolutely smitten with a friend of his/hers who has a significant other. See if they ever refer to that person by name, even if they do know it. 
They can't. There are YouTube videos of shooting an engine block with [20mm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzio_20mm_rifle) rounds. The engine doesn't disappeaear in a puff of parts.

It's not a conspiracy. It's a terrible Charity. The Clinton Foundation spent as much on travel as it did on charitable grants, [only 10%](http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/27/in-2013-the-clinton-foundation-only-spent-10-percent-of-its-budget-on-charitable-grants/) of it's expenditures.
It was nowhere near Skyrim's level, I think that Skyrim will seriously be like the most modded game ever. Lol. Witcher 1 didn't have too many mods, and Witcher 2 didn't either, but that was because they released the REDkit like 2 years after the game's release. They're releasing the REDkit for Wild Hunt along with the game, so we'll see more mods. But if I honestly had to guess, it would just be graphics mods, or UI mods. It's not the type of game that you can mod like Skyrim, because they're both open world RPGs, but at the same time they're completely different.
I can see why women would be offended at this, but to me it looks more like they're taking the piss than anything else, I personally don't see it as sexist. The article talks more about men than women and lets be honest, its an article in a paper with very little respect these days. It shouldn't be taken for anything more than humour from a shit newspaper. And fer the record, Jo-Anne Dobson is milfy. 
kinda a bit of both. it was an evil one off campaign where he was supposed to overthrow the government. he figured the best way to do that was to cause general havoc and eventual riots. we were mostly just playing with mechanics and an evil objective left us with fewer.... limitations.

Arabs are muslims, I didn't say it's a two way street. I'm aware there are african, egyptian, serbian, amd even white muslims. But they are mostly arab, and until very recently, pretty much all arabs were muslims.Educated? I've read the Qu'ran and have spent quite a lot of time with muslims. But please, keep nit-picking at my comments I write in 20 seconds and completely avoid the subject at hand.
I got an HHR as a rental vehicle once. It wasn't a bad vehicle. The SSR isn't BAD, just not good. It's a matter of taste .  Kind of like the Plymouth prowler. Great idea, but limited by the v6 and auto tranny only design. 
Matcha is powdered green tea.  It does not contain sugar.However, Starbucks' matcha is mostly sugar, not pure tea, because they use it in their sweet drinks.
You could hold two strands, one of the alpaca and one of maybe mcn or merino/nylon fingering personally I'd choose a springy fingering merino and make a thick boot or bed sock
Apology accepted. But I'll be calling you blaziken until my heart mends from the deep wound you inflicted on me!I'll calculate how effective benevolence is tmr :p I'll summon blazikenwastaken when i finish. 
It's not going to just be Philly. People are fed up everywhere. We've been putting up with 'contempt of cop' situations leading to violations of civil liberties and outright violence for far too long. People complain about black culture, and there are serious problems without easy solutions there -- but the EXACT same thing can be said for police culture. 
There's a few ways that could've not been a penalty and since they didn't show a replay who knows if it was. Kreider's stick could've gotten him while he was already on the ice or it could've been a follow through.
Parents basement master race checking in.I have a sick job, sick gainz, sick life, no rent. I don't care anymore. I was self conscious, but yolo only care about dat GUAP IN DA BANK
The same thing happened to my sister up until she was four. I know everybody's different, but there aren't a lot of success stories in this regard, so for what it's worth: she turned out to be just the most incredible mom. She's got her shit more together than I do. Her children are beautiful and happy, and she's been married to her best friend for twelve years now. I know what it is to feel completely ruined, like human garbage, but it doesn't have to last forever. I hope you get all the help you need, and I genuinely hope your life gets the happiest outcome possible.
(BTW when I say "a little weird", that's not intended as criticism, I can't imagine there are very many people who don't have something "a little weird" going on (myself included) when it comes to the complicated beast that is human sexuality.)
WTF.....where do you people see Yusui as some amazing player? You guys watch his stream and like him or something and that means he's good? He's been in Challenger for like 2 years and hasn't done anything special even against Challenger teams
lol my feelings are nonexistent. give yourself some more time in retail with your attitude and your heart will be cold as stone like mine. Youll grow to love retail, Im sure honey ;)
&gt; everyone wants their recognitionIndeed, it's probably legally contractually mandated, in the case of things like Bink video and SpeedTree.And yes, it always kills me on consoles when they go through all this, *then* ask me if I want to load my last save just like the last 23 times I played.
Here's my screenshot this week!I gave Marian his favorite item for his birthday and got something back in return! &lt;3https://miiverse.nintendo.net/posts/AYMHAAACAAADVHj03dEuRQ
Hey there, I'm gonna give samsung priority on class picks but otherwise you can pick whatever class you want or we can play around and see what you'd be best at. We'll all be helping each other learn the ropes so as long as you put in the effort you should be able to get decent pretty quickly. Feel free to add me on steam and I'll make a group here in a few minutes that you can join.
hey i like to help people get better at hots ^^ you can add me in game on either of my accounts: weskimo#2994 or weskimoeu#2804 both accounts eu server. im rank 1 and diamond on both acounts, i basically like to play with people of lower skill levels who want to get better and help them improve. I also have a website with guides on for maps and heroes, tier list etc at : weskimo.com    hope i cam help and give me a frend request if your on eu ^^
Once again use Readit. You are using a low ram device more than likely and baconit is hitting it's ram limit. Not sure if Readit will fix that to be honest. 
Actually, not resting at the bonfire doesn't help. Your respawn point sets to the bridge where you first appear inside. Learned this the hard way on NG5+.
3 houses...  One collapsed about 15 minutes ago.Everyone out safe...  No injuries.Live view on KING 5 right now.Fire crew was having water access issues...  The house in the middle was fully engulfed and collapsed within 1/2 hour of the initial call to the fire dept.
I don't believe Bredon is cinder. Remember Kvothe has seen both Bredon and Cinder. if they were one and the same either; Kvothe would recognize him when he came to play tac, or cinder has some sort of Shape-shifting ability that we haven't discovered. The shape-shifting theory seems thin, as the story has given no evidence to support it.
Don't sweat what he is saying, I think his frustration is displaced. It's not out of place to post a thread about footballers by a former footballer. And I disagree with the people that would be accusing you of karma farming. I think the real problem that most people have is that the most upvoted threads are predictable and typically the same, if they're not highlights they're about the same top 5 teams and top 10 players. Not your fault by any means.Honestly though it is a bit perplexing that Messi/Ronaldo threads always are upvoted, I wonder who the guardians of the new threads are that keep at it like this.
Everything looks...dead around you. The black is quickly advancing, killing the trees, drying up a river you see in the distance, and animals collapsing into skeletons before your very eyes. This orb must be somehow connected. 
I forgot to say.. outside my student loans, we are debt free. We are able to bank ~2k per month. We are saving for a house so 1k of that is housefund automatically and cannot be touched. We already have an emergency fund and money saved for the two trips we are taking this year. We are not financially insecure in any way, it's more of an emotional issue and is this really ok when we're not millionaires issue.  
Yes you do choose the order in which the ETB effect resolves, but all creatures are put on the battlefield simultaneously, so triggers that check the rest of board, like constellation, are amplified.
When you do go off subs I highly recommend Kratom for the physical and mental issues that happen. I dread sub withdrawal, def worse than h WD and longer. I could say that I decided not to use the needle any more because of getting hep c and getting cured and dealing with that and the shame from it with my conservative foreign family but the thing that really seems to stick is the never ending pain of losing my best friend to a speedball in 2009.He stood for so much and was such a shining beacon of light that I don't think I could do it again, it would be spitting on his memory and life. I had already been clean for 5 years when he passes but I can't stop feeling that it was the needle that killed him. Heroin has never taken that much from me before but it took my brother from another mother by way of IV. Ugh. Life goes on and on but I wish he was still here.
Ah, the infamous shedding of the female Troll leaving her mark for all to see. Trust me, there's been so much hair left around my boyfriend's place the past few weeks before I got my hair thinned out. I. Feel. You. 
Rather than just ask a question, I'd ask you all to outline what you think the world will look like in 2049. Is china's rise inevitable and what does it mean for humanity.
I know you said fantasy city, but saying it reminds you of Leisure Suit Larry makes me think Les Manley. It had some cartoony graphics in earlier versions (LM:Search for the King) and some digitized images in a later version (Les Manley: Lost in LA)

soup.bag of frozen broccoli or cauliflower  garlic or onion  4 cups vegetable or chicken stock  1/2 to 1 cup milk (i used unsweetened almond milk)  salt and pepper  boil vegetables in the 4 cups of chicken stock until soft, then puree. taste, add salt and pepper and then add in milk. top with cheese or croutons if you wish.i made this with frozen broccoli and cauliflower and 1/2 cup almond milk the other night, and it was about 82 calories for a giant serve.
I think it should be, and if it is even going to be in the game it should be at least 10%, probably more like 13% or so.Also, if your reasoning as to the grip not being in BO3 because it makes the game less skilled then that's a bit flawed, because Battlefield has 3 different grips and still take more skill than Call of Duty, no reason for the grip to not be there.
I've lived here my whole life and I had no idea. Most people live in either Paradise or Spring Valley, and not actually in the city I guess if we're talking technicalities. I don't really understand how this works, though, because it's all LV metro police except for north las vegas who have their own police. There's a police station right next to the strip, even. I would assume being unincorporated the LVMPD shouldn't respond to calls outside of the actual city? I don't get it.
I'm an iphone 6 user and xmod user. The bot is working fine except it seems to be attacking the first attack selection. Xmod is on and it's on search for 100k of elixer and gold with meet all criteria. Any ideas? Thanks for your hard work! Also, is the Ipad mini one still in the works?
I've had this problem as well, their is another form the dmv will give you to have the seller sign. And if I remember correctly (it's been a few years) it also cost more.  As far as contacting the seller, I've also ran into that problem too, I just so happened to "find" him later that day and took the title back the next day. 
Oh my gosh, stop badgering her!! She never once said that those people (or herself and her husband) are settling! It is, I would say, common knowledge that in many cases, partners are of similar attraction levels. It's not settling. It's often how the world works.You have no right to call this insanity! Think about how your words affect others, for goodness sake!
it's there now. Sorry, GFYCAT rejected my first three attempts after saying they were uploading because, you know, they were 17 seconds, 15.5 seconds and I didn't pay attention to the last one. 
"Bob Sapp is a force in the super-heavyweight division. This guy has taken on kickboxers like Mirko "Cro-Cop" Filipovic and Ray Sefo, grappled with Antônio Nogueira, and boxed with Aleksander Emelianenko. This is a big guy, who isn't afraid to hang with the best, and has legitimate knockout power"
Well, Charlie Hebdu was actually sued 13 times by catholic organizations and only once by a Muslim one. So I don't think that Islam is more likely to get upset.http://qz.com/322550/charlie-hebdo-has-had-more-legal-run-ins-with-christians-than-with-muslims/
Visage though ain't a normal support, he secretly gets every single kill in the game and gets massive amounts of gold(at least when I play him)He is one of the greatest roamers and a snowball support like no other IMO.I think he gets massive amounts of gold.
Would you care to define hostile? Hostile as in "FUCK YOU!" yes. Hostile as in some vague feeling that they're less than excited than your best friend to see you? No. If you need an employee to coddle you like you're the most specialest person ever, you need help.To put it another way--unless someone is actually cursing at you or clearly, objectively being rude, then not only are you being an asshat, but you're going to have a hell of a time proving your point, especially when you were acting like an asshole yourself.
I thought I heard somewhere that eventually Iniesta would start playing Xavi's role, the same way Xavi started to play Guardiola's. I think there was a Guardiola quote that went something along those lines. I don't remember- but to be fair, it's not my club.
So I have been actively avoiding all draft talk until tonight. Can someone explain to my why Goodel is announcing the drafts and why the players aren't physically there dramatically sipping water
Why couldn't they add just one more item to the upgrade list and make a very neat rectangle. at least before the unevenness was fine. but it's so bothersome now
I agree that SAF was very good at grooming young players but in the last years of his managerial career I can't help but think so much of our youth development stalled.  
There's no reason to vacation to Connecticut compared to basically any other place.  I live here so I feel like I'm pretty well informed on the matter.
You should design separate stages for different parts of the mission. That way you'll know where you're messing up and wasting fuel.I'd recommend learning the proper way to get to orbit in 1.0. It will save you some delta-v.
I only played in public once, a Friday Night Magic at my local game store. The dude I was matched against kept muttering about being "stuck playing the girl". (I was the only female in the place.) I beat him, then left. Never bothered going back. I stick to playing with friends now. 
Being blind, how would you describe color to other people who are blind?Could you tell us the story of the day or night you got shot, the circumstances, what happened after, ect?
6-8 mil? Even with the cap increase, that'd be an overpay. I'd rather keep Wesley Johnson on a cheaper deal because he adds all of the things you mention (good perimeter defense, young, improving, etc.) and seems desperate for a long-term deal (i.e., we could get him for an affordable price).
I didn't have a particular setting in mind—I almost exclusively build my own patches from the ground up, because factory presets don't really give me what I'm looking for. The only thing that I *always* do is make sure that the incoming DI signal averages at -18dBFS. Audio emulator software R&amp;D uses that level for test tones because it's equal to 0dBVU, so coming in at that level ensures a higher degree of realism.
despite the penalty score, it was a solid period for us.  we've seen the result of av's pep talks during intermission before, so let's own this second period. 
Oh, I came into it with a different view. I initially thought that you could by the colours separately, and when I noticed you did not it felt like I got two colours for free!
According to them: yes, and keep punching until you're better. Or dead, whichever comes first, but definitely ignore the science and medicine proven to work.
First time watcher here!  pretty good so far, different from everything I've seen in a while!  I thought i would be lost but I can actually keep up with the story...or can I? I have some theories as to what will happen, but we'll see.  LOVE the atmosphere, there are many bleak/dark/grey anime, but this...this somehow feels different, it's creepy and upsetting with a sense of mystery, thanks to the long silent sequences.  So, Lain. What I like about her: Her eyes and her pajamas (seriously, I want that). What I don't like about her: Seems pretty boring to be honest. Well, she's clearly an introvert, that's portrayed unambigously (I like when they take "show, don't tell" seriously) but watching her blank stare (even with dem eyes) got a bit tiring after a while. SAY SOMETHING! REACT TO THE EVENTS!  Also, I'm not sure if I can limit myself to 1 ep a day if it gets even better
I know. I know a bunch of Metra engineers.Some are people who try to beat signals or cross unsafely. Some are what are termed "nursing home elopements," which aren't "old people in love." Some are suicide by train.Engineer has to pee in a can and do admin leave. Gets paid base, no OT. Reality: It's pretty much never their fault, but, regulation.
Well since tf2 barely had an esports scene you have to grow if you want to compete with other games. And i never said you couldnt play two games. All im saying is that i think overwatch will become a more successful esport because of the mess that tf2 is now. But ur right overwatch isnt an instant success. But from the looks of the game its moving towards it.

Hi! I am new to this subreddit and reddit in general and I was interested in selling two eBay gift cards that are worth $25 each. I'm guessing rep is the same thing as karma which I only have 1. The only thing that will help you trust me is that I have a traded Nintendo amiibo on reddit before. I got these two eBay gift cards on eBay back in January but they do not expire. You can ask me anything about the cards.
They are pretty annoying to drive in. And in my opinion a whole lot more dangerous when you have assholes who don't indicate direction. But they do improve traffic when dealing crossroads that have 2 large roads intersecting each other. I have several roundabouts within walking distance and they are at least a lot less annoying than those fucking traffic lights that waste about a minute each.
Xbox. There are three. Left of castle, top of stairs castle, and then to the right of castle. DO NOT sprint for them. Slowly collect them before you drop the boss.
Time can do as much damage as miles though, more so if the car isn't driven. If it has been sitting it could have a bad battery (not necessarily immediately apparent), bad brakes, flat-spotted tires, etc.
But that's the problem with why many people believe only whites can be racist. To most, It's only considered discrimination if you don't hire Paul because he's white but it's racist if you don't hire Jen because she's black.  
The speed of light is c in all reference frames, so there is no rest frame for a photon (the speed of light would be zero in that frame).The oh my god particle would be at rest in its "own reference frame". We call this frame its rest frame. Every massive particle has a rest frame.
Check out Melanie Rawn's work, she does the generational family thing in her series.C J Cherryh's Fortress in the Eye of Time gets there in the latter volumes of that series.Isavalta series, also, by Sarah Zettel, crosses generations.
I was eluding to the fact that back in 1993, when the film came out, Spielberg etc were taken to task for making the velociraptors large and the dilophosaurus small (and with frills). I guess in the 22 years since then, they've sorta fixed one of their errors (also, I realize I was 11 when JP came out...so long ago). As for whether or not it's the same dino that ate Nedry, that remains to be seen (although I hear the T-Rex is the same).
17 y/o female I am not allowed to drive, get in the car when someone under 25 is driving, date or have friends that are the opposite gender. My 14 year old brother however can date, drives and is encouraged to be friends with girls 
All Out Moving. They were great to work with and took great caution when handling my belongings. They also work smarter than typical movers meaning, they have all the gear to wrap and cover your boxes and big items up to make loading and unloading easier. Plus they don't drag out their hours. The quote was fair when I moved back in 2011 and their reviews have held up. 
I would love to snag an e-mail or have you join the [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/816908774999881/) page -- I'm hoping to see it grow. I'm hoping students will interact and get to know each other before getting to campus and in a place that is more convenient for their schedules. If you have any ideas please chime in. We're also trying to gather data to assess the focus of the group. If you have transfer students have them contact me or the Gender Equity Center. 
Yeah it's actually a federal offense to relocate a desert tortoise out here in Mojave, CA. Touching them will kill them almost every time, because they void their bowels so they can move faster. You literally have to sit and wait for them to cross or find another route.The same cannot be said about Turtles. They'll most likely be fine honestly because they aren't found in arid climates that I know of.
What does advanced acoustic guitar with a plectrum look like? It feels to me like at a certain point on acoustic you're just playing chords and you need to move to fingerstyle to start doing more nuanced technical stuff. I'm not at all trying to say that I've mastered acoustic guitar with a pick because that's ridiculous, but I can't really see how far you can go without fingerstyle, whereas on electric there are so many technical things you can do with muting, bends, sweeping and all that stuff. Of course you can do some of that stuff on acoustic too but it seems more suited to electric.
I don't trust telegraph at all recently. During the winter break and shortly after they linked us with about 5 players (Reus, Čech, Khedira several times and few others) which all were bullshit. They just spew transfer rumours almost in the same frequency as daily mail. The credibility of this newspaper went down so much lately.
They aren't even plays though. Both of Dunleavys plays were dirty basketball plays, but my god Giannis overreacted both in how hard he acted like he got hit, and his response was just childish. 
Maybe they still have a few but according to this they sold all/most of them in 2012.http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-09-28/crown-castle-to-buy-t-mobile-usa-towers-for-2-4-billion
Seriously, though. I don't think it'd be so bad if there wasn't a calendar still on every single page.EDIT: [It's fixed now. Never mind.](http://i.imgur.com/tciKiN7.png)
I like it too.  I had sounds off because I really like listening to music while playing and the sounds in the game had no middle ground.  Either loud or off.
Thank fuck that's over... I'm glad they didn't take what we offered to them. I don't think he'll be nearly as good for them as he would be for Chip either, so, cool. Move on. See who we can get at #20.
It's because people's favorites are going home. At the begin of the season it's fun to root for a group of queens but once it gets down to the wire and you're worried about your number 1 going home things get a little more dramatic. 
Well, you could ask that some of the time, the complaints go to friends instead of to you. "I know it's stressful living with your mother, but it's getting stressful for me to hear about it all the time and it's straining the relationship a bit. Could you find a friend to vent to every once in a while, so our relationship isn't carrying all the tension?"
Look, its obvious we are both standing on what we believe to be true and I respect that. But in my corner is the bias created when one loses 120lbs in 8 months and feels amazing. I've been in nutritional ketosis for 2 years. I haven't consumed carbs over 20g unless fibers attached. My personal results and the countless others in my life who have listened dictate to me that this is a corrective diet and it's the diet of a homosapian. I have the science behind me and it is what it is. I'm always happy to read contradictory evidence so please show me something that backs up your claims.
Don't feel bad for posting! It's important to do things right.I'd recommend checking the keto calculator on the sidebar to redo your macros. Right now you're aiming at around a 40% deficit. I'd recommend lowering that to 30%. You also need more protein for your muscles to stay healthy.Try with these:19/F/5'6" | CW 176 | 40% BF | Mostly sedentary* 1337 kcal Goal, a 30% deficit. (686 min, 1910 max)* 20g Carbohydrates* 84g Protein (64g min, 105g max)* 102g Fat (30g min, 165g max)Seems like you're on the right track though :)
Honestly your use of believe is what gets me on that. However the way macroevolution is taught I am surprised that anyone can get an informed opinion on it without more than common learning. The way I learned it in high school was and then it happens... No real scientific justification of when it is considered to have happened or explanation of how a suitable breeding population is established. 
Hmm, okay. I've been feeding him as much as he will eat to be honest, which usually works out at about 6-8 crickets every other day. He'll often eat a few then go back into his hide while there's still more running about. He's almost completely uninterested in mealworms so they're no good either. 
Gotta have strawberries, blueberries, and cool whip haha.  And the veggies....eh, not a huge fan but as my metabolism continues to slow down I've been trying to eat better.  I've already had enough venison bacon to counteract any amount of carrots and celery though hahaha.  Fuck venison bacon is good.  Venison is good period.  
I'm scared they're gonna pull the trigger on turning Ambrose heel on Reigns at Payback. It would be cool for them to book Ambrose in a serious story, but I don't want to see him lose a feud to Reigns right when he turns. I don't know, I just get this feeling that he's turning with all of this random Reigns/Rollins/Ambrose stuff they've been doing on Smackdown. It's too early for the triple threat, so I feel like something's about to happen. Could easily be wrong.
You can delete that whole section if you want, and Funding will stop being an issue. The game will assume you're in Sandbox or Career mode wherever funds are concerned.Cheers
This is completely wrong and I have no idea how you formed this opinion, medical journals are where pretty much all medicine-related research is communicated.
My trigger food is cookies. I try to explain that I can't have them anywhere near me. No one gets ho hard it is for me not to binge on them. I feel like no one I know really gets it.
Yeah, of course the soldiers had to endure the tremendous task of walking up a fucking hill, blindly - lacking basic equipment like binoculars and scopes on their endless amounts of sniper rifles from the towers by the wall.  What brave men indeed who not nuked the entire hill after spotting three people in the grass against one of the most well equipped "defense"-militaries on the planet. 
Oh yeah, there's certainly a catering to the straight male audience.Personally, one of the best things about the show was showing me that parents can be bigoted and you just need to accept it, love them and learn to ignore their intolerance.
It's pretty FUBAR, but imma go out on a limb and say that was a [Lacewing](http://bugguide.net/node/view/592398) larva. Compare the pinchy part of your pic to the head [here](http://bugguide.net/node/view/843531/bgimage). They are known to "nibble" on people, but not to suck blood.
I don't think I've read an article about this from a US Libertarian who mentions that the wage rise is actually a gradual increase to $15 over a period of 7 years.That doesn't make a sexy FREEDOM IS UNDER FIRE headline though.
Purely accidental typically isn't a crime, but killing someone through negligence, though without intent, is. For example, if a kid runs out in front of your car and you don't have enough time to stop before running over and killing them, it's not a crime. But if you were driving drunk and hit and killed someone, you can be charged with manslaughter, even though it certainly wasn't your intent to hurt anyone.
People on this subreddit are really anti-DIY anything. I remember I replaced the battery in my non-warranty iPhone and they went at me like I am crazy for not spending $80 on a new one to get installed by Apple. Guess what? $7 and it's working good as new.
Social conservatives all over the country worry that gay marriage will blow up marriage. So, social conservatives in Alabama are going to blow up marriage.You can very, very often count on a reactionary to turn a contingency into a certainty.
In the big scheme of things yeah I'm happier, I still have the bad day or hour that pops up. Like right now that my daughter has gone to bed I'm in a shitty mood, but that'll pass. The biggest change is I have hope for the future now, a lot of hope. I can still mourn the lost dreams, but those are slowly being replaced by new dreams. Which is pretty awesome.
Everywhere I seen term "paper rocket" used, it is paper rocket until it launches successfully. Rocket that sits upright on launch pad one second before it's very first launch is still paper rocket.
i hate when people say 6/6 on the finals stage is better than 6/10 (Kareem) or something similar. It essentially means that a player would be better off legacy-wise if they lost in the conference finals than the finals. Winning your conference should NEVER be held against you. Losing in the finals isn't a ding. It is a sign that you won your conference, and did better than 28 other teams in the league. I feel like the only reason we hold finals losses against players is because the greatest player happens to have none, and we assume that any characteristic of his career must be a positive. If the bulls beat Orlando in 95 and lose to the Rockets in the finals, is MJ's career somehow worse? He would have won more series, but losing in the finals would be a "ding".Losing in the finals should never be a ding. LeBron carrying Cleveland through a terrible conference in 2007 and then being hopelessly overmatched in the finals isn't some failing of his as a player. 
No, it isn't. It's not a bad analogy. Not every single transgender person feels it so intensely as to be suicidal. It's an actual fact.There is absolutely a majority of trans people that do feel mental anguish, yes, but people who feel much less strongly exist too.
That's because they cycle their hormones so they don't loose size/bonerability. They also take Viagra usually. Most trans girls don't look like what the girls do in trans porn either.For trans girls both the testes and penis shrinks in size, usually noticable in less than a year. This is also in addition to a decrease in sex drive and a changing of sexuality (not orientation in this case but the way trans girls are turned on). For instance I don't get erect without stimulation anymore (I'm a trans girl FYI), but I start flushing, getting hot and still being turned on (just not noticeably). I'm assuming in a few years the ability to get erect eventually dissipates.
I'm a huge lore nerd and that definitely makes me love this game a little more.With that said, the game is hugely enjoyable regardless of your knowledge of previous Blizzard games. The matches are relatively quick, community is fairly decent, and the game itself is beautifully designed. Knowing the lore just allows you to fangasm a bit here and there.
I noticed that i skipped a line in that analogy. Maybe it will make sense now.Consider you are sick. You need medicine to get well again. (You are alive and need to reproduce to replace yourself) medicine is necessary for that. But it is bitter. Only if it was sweet...
That whole speech pissed me off. Because I believe that it was an insinuation of his own thoughts of himself. And then he panicked and voted for the most vulnerable and most emotional person in his alliance rather than someone that won't lose their shit.
worst song yesgayest, not even top 10And there's nothing wrong with gay shit, gay people make awesome music.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRdo7WXTVoM tell me this shit doesn't make you feel like you're flying
Isn't it not too late to trade him for picks since he was going to go number 2 anyways?  Now there's a lot more time to work on the compensation for him?
I think it's from dehydration, as I'm unfortunately the world's sweatiest man, and I lost at least a gallon (maybe two) during a two hour practice.  When you're dehydrated, your body secretes [aldosterone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone) to maintain blood pressure by conserving water and sodium, with the side effect of wasting potassium; the low potassium is what causes the cramping.  I get cramps like this almost every day, although usually not this bad.I just got back from a 1 hour class, I started at ~244 lbs, finished at ~234 lbs, and I gulped water a couple of times during practice as well... It's amazing girls ever sleep with me more than once! ;)
I plan on max-skilling mine so i can use it as a bind clearer, since I don't have an lmeta despite hunting her every gf she's at 3x. I do have an amaterasu, but she's way more of a pain in the ass to max-skill imo
I really wanted to get a trade, I thought we could get more value from picks than just from Mariota. But hey maybe they couldn't get a good enough trade
Hey, her hair has that mildly crazy thing mine does.That's pretty cool. You seem relaxed and pretty cool, too. I'd probably be tempted to start a conversation if we ran in the same social circles.
actually anything "I _____ better when I'm high/drunk"  Except shooting.  Apparently Alchohol is considered a performance enhancing drug in sport shooting.
Actually, if you believe the movie with Christopher Reeves, he could beat up one villian, then turn back time and beat up the next one.  So, he could be in multiple places.
You should ideally place your spies in Civs' capitals or most significant cities if you want to steal tech quicker. The more science a city produces the quicker you can steal; if you're putting your spies in a minor city, that city probably isn't producing much science. If you put your spy in the right city in the renaissance era right when you get it, you could steal your first tech in less than 15 turns.
At least with the Flag Room you don't have to call it by its new name - it will still be the "flag room" to everyone except a plaque in the corner. The seal however...

the kicked the shit out of NATO forces and we all know the minute we withdraw Karzai's dictatorship will be replaced by another Taliban dictatorship. Saddam's armies fell flat on their backs within a few months, but ruling the place was impossible, until ISIS demonstrated the complete failure of the coalition war effort. Taliban ruled Afghanistan before NATO invasion, rules most of it now, and will rule once we leave. It's just the Central Asian Muslim version of the Vietcong (Southeast Asian and Communist) 
Well fuck me. Swype claimed to be updated in Google play, but was a version back. I uninstalled and reinstalled and wham! ✈ 🚆 and 🚗. Thank you! This is now undeniably the best Android keyboard.
If I recall correctly over-investment in the grid based on ridiculously flawed usage predictions (not taking into account rapidly evolving solar technology &amp; uptake, which was plainly obvious) was used by the power utilities used as a basis for never ending price increases. Left to their own devices the private electricity market has clearly been gouging the system as much as they can, so they can hardly complain they have forced ther regulator to finally consider stepping in. Highest electricity prices in the world or something like that..
I make note of how many systems I've visited before leaving on a trip.  During the trip, I keep a tally of all the life bearing worlds I find.  Other than that, I don't really keep a log.
Totally annoying  and even  worse - totally  normal.When i was 12 i wanted  to stand  out so i invented  an imaginary  friend- i insisted  "she" got a seat on  the bus. I would get  upset if people   "accidentally  pushed  her".Like me your sister  will cringe  when she's  30.PS To a lesser degree   i also changed  the  spelling  of my fairly commonplace  name by adding  several  unnecessary  Ys and Hs. Yoonique spelling FTW. I'm telling  you - major cringe. 
&gt;If the US wanted to fuck Iran's shit up,They'd have to deal with the International  and domestic community who are sick of wars in the middle east. &gt;they wouldn't need to follow around merchant ships to do it.  Stop being a retard.Such a persuasive argument... 
the shoes themselves are amazing and fit perfectly, its just that the metatarsal button insole is not compatible with my feet. I popped some different insoles in there and they are way better, these should be fine till I order some new ones. thanks for the input. 
Just going by the Riddick series, I imagine that Vin would "just happen" to roll all 18s for his stats and grab all the best magical gear before anyone else got there. Then he'd be a multiclass fighter/rogue and his character totally sleeps with all the hot elf chicks you guys.
&gt; "ENTSCHULDIGUNG!" was the next thing uttered by my rapidly clenching stomach. Appropriately, Andrea looked up in response."Sind Sie Kaffee machen?" she asked.Am I making coffee?I have never seen such an amazing story on Amazon, nor do I expect I ever will. I guess this should deter me from eating sugar free gummies. Following a low carb diet...I sure miss Haribo bears!!
I'd still be angry. The victim is still a human being, a reasonable person should be able to understand that when another person is saying "no", then they are telling you "no"
Having the thought might be normal. I don't know though. I would hazard a guess that while awake most people would have some control over it after they realize it's happening. This comes with complete inability to push it away.It's hard to say what "normal" is since I'm stuck in my head. Know what I mean?
The reason why her mobility is a problem is because of her ult costing no mana lol. If it costed mana it'll make her more decisive in her trades, how she roams, when she uses her R Distortion. Giving her a no mana cost ult is just as toxic as giving kayle a 0 mana cost ult that gives you invulnerability on a VERY low cd but thats another story for later.
I think there was much greater emphasis on geometry and analysis at the time. This is just one example, but compare the syllabi for Harvard's Math 55 today[(first semester)](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/class/harvard/55a/08/html/syl.html)[(second semester)](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/M55b.10/)with the textbook for the analogous course in the 1960's:[textbook for full-year class](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~shlomo/docs/Advanced_Calculus.pdf) (warning, big PDF)Today, the entire first semester is dedicated to modern algebra. It even gets into logic and representation theory. In the 60's, practically the whole thing led up to classical mechanics and differential geometry, with linear algebra as necessary for those topics (tensors, inner products, etc.)
I Love this game mode. The grappling hook is incredibly fun and the power ups make it even better IMHO. It may suck to be killed by the vampyro but once you get strength on demospam it's so satisfying. The objective is actually fun to complete for once and is satisfying as well. It feels very polished for how early it is in development.Also, for your hook problems, I just bind Q to grapple and press my number keys to go to my weapons, but that's just what I'm used to (I don't normally use quick switch).
I'm sorry, I just don't agree. You said it yourself, LMA is consistent while Lillard has not been this year. I love Dame and hope he continues to get better (especially on defense), but he's not the best player on the team at this point in his career. Lillard is already top 10 at his position, but LMA is roughly a top 10 overall player in the league. His skill set is unique and he opens up the floor, making it easier on all his teammates. I hope Olshey can bring back the core of this team, especially LMA. I suspect that some of the slightly anti-LMA sentiment I've seen lately is because people suspect he may leave and are bracing themselves for that reality.
4 times to the same gun in less than 10 minutes in a FUCKING SURVIVAL game should never happen. period. this game is an arcade sandbox shooter, and a mediocre on at that. especially with how dumb downed it has become since launch. especially with all the build-a-bullet workshops everywhere. especially with all the shotguns everywhere. i honestly wouldnt care if i was dying to somethign other than the shotgun. but that just never happens.
It was over the course of a couple weeks, and we kept asking him why he was submitting non-compiling code into the SVN and if he could fix it. When we sat down with him each week, we saw the same problems crop up.
My brother came up with an ingenious way to fix the BB issue. He put a screw through the piece where the hose connects just far up enough so when you blew out the BB would dislodge and then settle back down. It works brilliantly.
They look a whole lot less similar now than they did in the 60s/70s.The only real difference was the Bengals helmets.  The lack of a center stripe  and the word "BENGALS" as a side logo was it. 
Ridiculous move from Tennessee. They don't have even close the talent to back the guy up, and here they had an amazing opportunity to get a bunch of picks, and they just pick a guy they don't even really need right now. 
The Scion of Darkness. *he nods appreciatively* Well met. I'm glad you're here, and I hope we will have ample opportunity to work together during our short time here. *he is still acting the part of a subordinate, but you can tell it's a ruse. He talks smoothly, as a politician would, or another powerful figure. ~~think Lucius Malfoy from Harry Potter.~~* May I be of assistance?
No one does "smooth, but threatening" as well as Fassbender. He's by far the best candidate that's also at an age where he could take over after Daniel Craig.

I don't think it is that bad. Shows like Friends and Full House are just silly: not hilarious, but still entertaining; you'll find yourself giggling along with the bad jokes and references.

[First time trying my digital sketch software even though I got it a year ago.](http://imgur.com/fmAxUPh) It's nothing like the amazing things some people post on here, but I'm pretty proud of the shading/fading I did on the bodies.

Chubbies are super dope if you wear them right.Honestly, I don't even care if you have chicken legs and wear them. Just don't look like a middle schooler who thinks TFM is the bible.
So, other than the main site, is there any other material out there that they have released?  We have sage advice and unearthed arcana.  Am I missing anything else? 
I moved out of a $760/month apt on Park Ave a few months ago. RDM Property Management. Ask for Roy. It was #319. There are 4 apartments in the building. 
First, don't worry until you know the specifics. These questions are somewhat random, and don't read anything into them.Second, create an account on creditkarma, they have details of 2 (out of 3) of your credit reports, as well as credit scores. Review the details.
Hell, remember in early 2007 when Rudy Giuliani was way ahead of any of the Republican hopefuls and expected to sweep the primaries in 2008? Then came the primaries and the highest place he got in any of the states was third place. Of course that is an extreme example, but it shows how much can change in a year. 
You don't need to do any of that to buy a car.  You do need to do that to drive on public roads.  That's how most states deal with licenses to carry a weapon. 
From that video and the previous one, she came down with pneumonia and is on a ventilator.  It sounds like she's stable now and is slowly being weaned off.  The only sources are the other sister's videos.
A doctor that listens! Hallelujah!! That's the main thing I got from your post and I think it's earth-shattering.It could just be a UTI you aren't feeling yet, maybe a kidney infection. I'd take either of those over preeclampsia. I agree with /u/sockalaunch that if it's possible, an MRI might be preferable. 
Ok! Ill see if that fixes the problem. If not, ill just take out type status all together to see if that works (but I really like it so I hope it isn't the cause).
In fact, Rekkles recommended Puszu to FNC because he thought Puszu and forg1ven were the only two ADCs in soloq that matched up to him. Rekkles also told forg1ven to join CW after he left to join FNC. 
I guess 八 may have more powerful metaphorical connotations, but things just tend to come in threes in a lot of cultures? Here's the 三 list:&gt;三木(x2) 三浦  三笠  三郷  三原(x2)  三股  三好  三次  三種  三春  三川  三鷹  三宅(x2)  三沢  三朝  三田  三島(x3)  三芳  三豊  三郷  三戸  三条  上三川  南三陸  市川三郷
yeah, the exchanging of wild theories among fellow fans was definitely a highlight for that show. sometimes it took a few days for them to come to me, so I guess i'm glad I watched most of it as it was airing

I'm not talking about the fact that it exists, I'm interested in what's on it, or rather what isn't on it, and how it differs from the assignment photo (which you can view right at the start in the first classroom scene). There's a very similar publicity shot in wide circulation that emulates the assignment shot but with the existing wall and an almost completely different set of photos. I don't think it's a player screenshot since Max is camera central which doesn't normally happen during play (not that I've noticed)
No. I am legally separated and in VA they won't allow anyone but your husband  (separated or not, even though I haven't seen my ex in 7 years) to be on the birth certificate. I have been stalling to keep him from being on it because of his behavior.
Regardless, we perceive the world in a way that cannot be grasped by others.How does that have to do with our outlook, compared to being misunderstood for a life time? Relying on finding happiness within what we accept, is unacceptable, to me.
The video cuts off. The owners/workers of the shop were actually there and defended their stuff. Pretty sure they recovered all the bikes. Not to mention 'Looting' and what is happening here aren't exactly the same, looting is when a shop is turned completely up-side down and the majority of their goods are taken or destroyed. I'm not saying white people don't or haven't rioted. But I live in Southern California only miles away from HB and it certainly wasn't a riot and shops weren't looted. It was just a bad comparison is all, no racism.
Calm. Its a really wonderful guided meditation app with many different meditations for any kind of circumstance (for motivation, positivity, creativity, sleep, etc) its $10 a year I use it everyday and the kids I nanny really love playing with it too as it has all these beautiful moving backgrounds. Might seem like a lot but for me, most beneficial app possible. 
I honestly never wanna see anyone talking shit about Drogba (as a person) no matter which team you support. Top player, and genuinely just a good man. 
It's Turkish sand coffee. They actually have Greek-made ... crock-pots (for lack of a better term) that they use to heat the sand. A hooka place where I used to live 5+ years ago had one. Pretty good if you're into that kind of coffee.
Before Spring 2013 Ewa was universally known to be running a size small in the band, at least. That is no longer the case, based on bratabase info and my own personal experience, I'd say a healthy majority of the bras released from 2014/15 are running TTS, band wise. 
For those who need a drinking game:**1 Drink if:**A player has great "intangibles" or "instincts"The word "reach" or "steal" is used to describe a pickFans boo their team's pickA player is called "raw"A reference to the player's 40 time is made**3 Drinks if:**A team trades out of or back into the firstA future pick of any kind is tradedThe player's name is mispronounced during the pick announcement**Finish your drink if:**Somebody stumbles on stageThe player clearly does not want to go to the team that picked himA team trades up from the bottom 20 to the top 5.**Bonus Drinks:**For every player left in the green room after the first round, drink twice for that player. If any players are left in the green room for the start of the third round, drink three times for each one.
Actually stuff like this is the point of good meta-data schema. This was done on purpose. But feel free to keep calling it gore if that makes you happy. 
Definitely perplexing. In terms of this situation, the fact he didn't seem too fussed either way about being caught seems odd, but it was online, so he could have been freaking out for all I know. I doubt it, but possible.Outside of the situation, he drinks a lot and seems to feel the need to always be out of his house. He's always *kinda* been like that, but it seems to have increased lately. So I can't exactly tell if it should concern me as much as it kinda does, or if it's just him. I have definitely taken myself out of the situation and it's just a waiting game to see if he rings me drunk again. However, I'm not about to cut him out completely because if there's more going on, I want to be there for him. 
Question... I can never seem to find where my exploration data is while in transit. I can only see it when I stop at a station to turn it in. Is there any way to check it out of port?
I'm all for a good hard foul for retaliation but that was bush league by Giannis. No place for that in the NBA. He should be suspended at least a game at the start of next season too

芸能人なんか事務所がネットに限らずメディアを駆使して人気を”創造”してる状態なんじゃないか。気色の悪い電子音楽を「こいつはスゴイ」というステマと共にしつこく垂れ流してCD売ったり、ぜんぜん実力のないスポーツ選手の”実力”をステマで捏造して企業スポンサーを集めてみたり、まあ、”洗脳ビジネス”だよね。芸能界で確立した手法が最近では政界でもさかんに使われだし、テレビタレントが選挙に強かったりするのも一種のこれで、やるほうもやるほうだけど、それで簡単に洗脳されちゃう方もアレで・・・後略
I know you are looking for an ultraportable, but I wanted to see what you think of the [Lenovo Y40](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/lenovo/y-series/y40-80/)?If not, the [Tp300LA](http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/ASUS-Transformer-Book-Flip-TP300LA-Signature-Edition-Laptop/productID.308008300?tduid=1472f6fb6b899902abb011170803e71d) would work great.
Nah I just bet on what feels right. Remember I don't have a large CS GO betting profile, so 33% for me is about 2 dollars. Thats not a painstaking loss for me to lose, but it brings in a nice amount if i win. Its a bad idea at casinos yes, I just have incredibly good luck, and I don't go very often (Ive gone twice in the past year), but for some reason its worked, my last time I went I brought 50 dollars and walked out with 800.
I don't know why you're getting downvoted... it *is* frustrating watching all these other configurations ship faster.Doesn't mean they should be delayed to keep us happy, of course, just that it is frustrating.
It's not re-evaluated, it's not hindsight and it's not conjecture. That's history as it happened, as it was understood while it was happening and how it has been described ever since.

Round 1, a Japanese Arcade/Bowling chain has brought it to the US and it's running on the official eAmuse servers in JP. I played some last week, and it's great. I don't know about other states, but I know the PHM location here in SoCal has 4 cabs and the Lakewood location also has a few as well.
Good points. Except that I called the office and they told me to apply, so I'm unsure if it actually is fraud. They believe that a full time pursuit of schooling is enough to warrant compensation. For the hell of it, I will pm you and let you know for sure if the claim actually goes through.
I agree wholeheartedly with your assessment, I said previously that I believe the idea that China is a stronger region is correct. As much as people would like to deny it, they've consistently had more teams in the finals/semis of major international tournaments than the western regions. I do believe that the head to head results are also important and point to the top teams from both regions being more competitive with each other. 
I actually wrote a paper about this, not clash specifically. But I found that in western culture there is a strong 'honour code' that people follow without really actively trying to follow. It prevents most people from doing degenerate things like cheating in games. In eastern culture, although they do have an honour code it is different, they beleive that it is fair to do anything possible to get ahead and if that means 'cheating' the system then that is fine. 
The Intel build would without a doubt serve you best in the long run. i5 chips reign supreme in terms of mainstream performance right about now. You don't need to spend that much on a motherboard though, a cheaper one MSI H81M-P33 can be found cheaper and will do you just as good of a job. Expensive motherboards are really just for overclocking. 
"You know what I need? A really tiny rifle that fires .22 Magnum, but for $.50 a round. And then I'd really like to pay the ATF $200 to reduce the performance even more."Pass.
I do high-bar as well, but once i reached higher weights there was a need to make a super tiny adjustment to lower the bar down just a bit or I would lean forward a lot and it would be hard to get up. Thought this might be the case. I would honestly just say it was a bad day try again next time or just continue to progress how you normally would.
I mean, he kinda botched saying the "t" which made the o/a sound weird... coulda just been dry mouth. Plus the dude has to learn a solid 200 names in a month. 
If United spent £100m on Pogba, it would probably be £65m to buy him and £35m to get him to dump Mino Raiola.  Otherwise, Pogba will be angling for a move non-stop like Zlatan was his whole career. 
I work from home too. I have Comcast Business class service and Centurylink residential DSL for backup. I can't bill my client for work if I can't work.
Exactly!My family came over to NA as refugees with nothing to our name and started off on welfare, living in co-ops with other refugee families. Parents couldn't get N.A. diplomas and their overseas ones were not recognized so they had to jump into any work they could find.Happy to say they worked hard, did not make excuses (even though there were plenty) and victimize themselves and we are now a happy middle class family.We did not come over illegally but like you said it is a person's mindset and determination that makes them successful not hand outs or constantly blaming others.
There is.  I'd post the link...but literally seconds after I posted the FIRST link to someone else, it was shut down.  So...good luck finding it *shrug* sorry, just seems like the NFL is clamping down on this shit.

&gt;completely punishing anyone who achievesNope. There isn't a single Green Party policy that states people who achieve will be punished.Who told you that was Green Party policy?Anything's frightening to the paranoid...I'm just a bit sick of people lying about Green Party policy.  And it's always the same policies. As if no successful nations have ever done these things!Question. How did we stop shootings in N. Ireland, and terrorist attacks round the UK by the Irish? a) We legitimised their political position.  b) We bombed Ireland to hell.  
I'm guessing you've ruled out Northern Cardinal?  The very first call they play in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9LNexIoCW0) is what I thought of when I read your post.  Starlings can mimic and blend and pretty much make any sort of song they feel like, so that's always a possibility.  
Thanks, I suspected that was the case.OP, I think you should fight this. You should try to find a new job (just because retaliation is unlawful doesn't mean they won't do it) but you should fight this for the sake of the other people working there.
I'm lacking motivation because it's usually around midnight when I'm in bed after a long day at work etc lol, and im already tired. I suppose I'll just have to get up and do some push ups lol.
In high school I was pretty good at making random noises and figured out how to whistle like a baby chick without using my mouth too much to conceal where the noise was coming from. I did it so often and kinda showed off in class (Idk why people thought it was cool) that one day we were in class, just chillin so everyone's just chatting away except recently dumped/socially awkward. I was whistling and over everyone in class the teacher heard me and snapped, "fuckincoffee, if you don't shut that damn bird up I'm going to throw this freaking book at it!"      edit: for you nit pickies
Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Tell me this though, when you were reading AGOT for the first time, didn't you want a just and honourable man like Ned being Robert's Hand? I sure did.If I look at things through Robert's eyes, Tywin Lannister being the Hand would give the Lannisters more power than even the ruling family. Robert also realized that Cersei hated him and her father was never one of his loyal servants. I wouldn't want Tywin or any of his men near the Red Keep.
&gt; That's suggesting that the photos are good because you paid a ton for the equipment, nothing about the skill and 'eye' required for good photos.the point is that there's multiple barriers to entry here, and your average know-nothing "photography is easy duh" person isn't even going to get past the first two hurdles: monetary investment, and technical ability.after you master those, then you starting getting to the *hard* part: talent and artistic ability. so when they take a few snaps, you get to critique their work...
These stickers were a big deal on reddit for about a week, maybe a couple of years ago. Several people sais they placed orders for them, it wouldn't surprise me if this one came from one of those people. 
Serious question, what makes them trash in your opinion? I have them on a work Truck and they've gotten me through some serious mud and deep sand while not being too bad for on road driving, so i was considering grabbing a set for my new jku. That being said, I haven't put a ton of miles on the all terrains so I'm curious if I'm missing something. 
Number 3 is incredibly good. I love the use of contrasting colors and short, powerful strokes. Kirby's portrait looks especially good, as well as Falco's.
I'm pretty sure you can move the .vmdk file as it *IS* a hard drive (for that particular VM. As long as the receiving part can work with that version of virtual machine 'hardware' it will work.
Really, what Aldens did you get? I think I prefer my Wingtips to these by a wide margin. Especially considering the Vibergs likely cost more than my Aldens did. 
It definitely goes! Do you play any instruments or xbox360 or anything? I play CoD:ghosts, GTA V and Titanfall every once in a while if you want to game some or something. 
I've read every Stephen King book at least once, most of them at least twice, except this one and Colorado Kid. I tried CK, but just couldn't do it. I've not even tried this one. Should I?
Hi OP, It's called a flashback, and it's a common symptom in survivors of trauma, from combat veterans to rape survivors.  I'd suggest you talk to your therapist about it, as they can give you strategies to cope with it.  Do talk to them about this experience *even if you decide you're not comfortable talking about your rape anymore*, because this is the sort of thing that might happen again unpredictably if you experience a smell, sound or sight that reminds you of the event.

I'd just play and if they say something just tell them straight up their shit is getting old. If they get butthurt over something as small as not wanting to play a game with them....well they're shit friends anyways.
Almaty, Kazakhstan. Cammer is a green Kia driving on a main road, the other car is a Nissan on a secondary street.  After the collision, the Nissan flew onto the sidewalk, ran over a mother and kids (one in a baby carriage), and broke the fence of a house.Various people were taken to hospital: the driver of the Nissan, who hit his head; a female passenger of the Kia, who broke an arm; and the pedestrians. Some reports says that the mother and the youngest child are in intensive care.via [RusDTP](http://rusdtp.ru/38810-v-almaty-sbili-mamu-s-detmi.html)[news story](http://auto.nur.kz/news/auto-nur/745399.html) (in Russian)
Farrand or Baker. The real partying happens off campus, though, and people are going to party in every dorm, you just have to find those people if that's what you want.
Maybe not so weird. My other half said that she knew I was The One when we first met. I took a bit more convincing, but for some people, something clicks.Just had our 15th anniversary. 
&gt;I don't understand all the hate Nvidia is getting in this thread&gt;but I don't follow either manufacturer closely.That's why you don't understand the hate. Everything AMD has done has been open technology nvidia would be free to use. Everything nvidia does is proprietary. They're holding back pc gaming because they want to be selfish. Obviously it's a business, but it's a dumb decision in the grand scheme of things. 
Hahaha! I've been struggling with making my brows even for a couple weeks now so I think it's finally time to let them grow in a little and start reshaping. Thank you!
-Well gravity is "just a theory" as "we are all held to the earth by god's blessing".-"The fact that the bible says that we're made of dirt and that we're made of dirt is proof enough that the lord made us"-" Carbon dating is a big lie." *proceed to explain carbon 14 dating based on half-life "No one lives to be  5000 years old, so how can that measurement be true?"-"If you don't want to be killed for adultery, just don't do it. It's as simple as that."I gave up on reasoning with people.
i know it's been said, but Katya and Fame talking. i guess it's just really raw for me, because alcohol and drug addiction is something i've struggled with my entire life. i found out my dad was a heroine addict for 16 yrs in january and that just changed my life forever. hearing Katya talk about that was so raw.and then Ru telling her she had an addiction to anxiety, i lost it. i've never related to something so much. Ru saying that helped me overcome a lot of my issues with my anxiety. this show has actually changed my life and i am so grateful for that.happy tears were shed when Joslyn married her husband tho.
Why do you assume they were taking advantage of her and that they "fucked her for sport"? You weren't there, you have no idea how things went down. Some people enjoy having casual sex. Just because they weren't in a relationship with her doesn't mean that the sex wasn't enjoyable or meaningful. 
I am bored by live version, I want to try beta because it contains many new skills to try out.I want to make unusual builds. New uniques are mostly build enabling ones, I love this approach. Sire of shards is love, it is lifeLast but not least I want to check desync fix called lockstep. Desync kills whole fun
Walking around indoors doesn't seem to count towards anything for me, but walking outdoors always fills my exercise ring for some reason? Maybe I just storm around when walking outside**Exercisegate**
I think there's a lot of complaints you can make about this game even in the beta stages. Balance, match making, decisions, communication, etc.Just about the only thing I think you can't really justify complaining about is technical instabilities though. That's kind of the definition of a beta test. It might be more helpful to post your situation to their forums so they can hunt down the reason for the disconnect.And don't worry about the one loss. Your rank is ultimately determined by hundreds of games. One loss is nothing in the scheme of things.
I acknowledge that, however the way in which it was opened doesn't seem to look like a mechanical error. It looks like the hands of a person not proficient with a letter opener such as myself.
See? That's a rebuttal.And we can't compare our thoughts on historical figures to our thoughts on people today. Of course we can't judge people from the past by today's standards. You know what we can judge by today's standards? People living today.If you help burn or destroy the shop of someone who did you no harm, you're an asshole. If you're out on the street attempting to hurt people you don't know without them directly threatening your life, you're an asshole. I don't give a fuck how you were raised, that shit isn't excusable by today's standards. 
My baby may be on the larger side of normal as well, though I think they estimate high just to be safe. At 33 weeks they estimated my son to be 5 lbs, 12 oz, which would put him around 9 1/2 lbs at birth. Could be a big 'un! Which would be interesting, because babies on both sides tend to be small.I honestly think they round up when it comes to these measurements, so don't worry too much.
That too, but a lot of German communists were pissed over the SPD's lack of action after the war. The USPD and later KPD formed as a result of the SPD's moderate stance. I certainly simplified the issue, but my point is that the left shoots itself in the foot because it has problems cooperating. Also, the leader of the SPD at the time (Ebert? His name escapes me right now) was totally against the revolution and was happy that the Sparacists were killed. He loathed revolutionaries. And the USPD (the first major break from the SPD) broke off in 1917. 
Check out the journal of applied behavior analysis. Generally, case studies are not published, instead applied research is published (specifically in the above journal). The practices found in those articles are more controlled but generally representative of good applies practice. Good luck!
You should try exercising with a friend. That's what I've been doing. It really helps! Before, I had trouble sticking to it, but when you have the obligation to finish, since your friend is keeping track of you, you end up getting a lot more done.
I hope so. A few years ago a man reported that a bear attacked a mountain lion to save his life and it made the national news. Not long after, it was called into question and pretty much proven to be bunk.http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/04/dna-tests-dispute-hikers-claim-of-a-mountain-lion-attack/1
Am I missing something?  She is trying to locate John Doe but John Doe's friend took the picture and somehow she has a digital copy.  If the friend can give her a digital copy of the picture, the friend can give her John Doe's number.  Or did I misunderstand something in the article?
it is hard and will have different discomforts but those are result of your body strengthening(ie muscles and soreness) rather than compression.the slouch this is tough, you definitely still slouch when standing without a concerted effort...not for everybody but I like it :)
Doing A Levels (17-19) Physics we had one week at college where we let 12 year old kids from primary schools near us to come in and see the kind of stuff we do.The teachers at the college are used to relatively mature students with little messing around but 12 year old kids are still 12 year old kids and things got broken.End of the lesson we are using a van de graaff generator to screw around with static electricity and we ended up letting the kids touch the thing and get a small shock.End of the day, once everyone had left and we were clearing up, my Physics teacher sits down, sighs, and says "God it felt good to electrocute the little bastards."Had to agree with him.
"Remember what Barnabus said. Nerull is going to all is to kill innocents, but never for no reason. We have to think why he's asking us to do this. I don't want to kill her either"
Unless we're talking about just a thousand or two a month, you should stop sh*tting where you eat, because that's exactly what you are describing. Open accounts with banks (credit unions) you don't care about and recycle your paper there. Then when they decide to terminate the relationship you move on with no harm done.
Damn, yeah.  Wish I had got an advance notice or something.I've listened to some of my playlists for so long I've forgotten what most of the songs were even named.
I was told the same thing. One of the greatest moments of my life was when I can back to homecoming 2 years later. Said PRINCIPLE asked what I was doing and i told him i was attending a major university.
Leds are directional by nature. You have to work at them to try and make them omni directional (multiple leds with varying angles, reflectors .. etc). In this case its a good effect.
Nihilum/LUM got the best out of this NA shuffle. I tossed in LUM only because they were able to grab Pyth while all the NA teams were fighting over Hika. Yeah I did that on purpose. C9 grabbing Ska was also huge, I do think C9 will reclaim the top NA spot.
Bulls have assisted on 80% of their baskets (20 of 25). Shooting 51%, 53.5 % from deep.Bucks at 13/33 (39.4%), 0% from deep with 10 turnvoers. So far Zaza and Middleton are leading scorers for them.
They just have so much potential for their own series. The interaction within the group and how they interact with the rest of the superhero/villain community is so unique I feel like no matter which way they went with a series it would be great. A heist based run would definitely be a very natural fit for the group.
Up in and around Georgian Bay there is a few things to see. I particularly enjoyed the hike at Bruce Peninsula National Park. There are a few places to go cave exploring in the area also.Tobermorry and Lions Head are cute little towns, if that's your kind of thing. Manitoulin is very pretty, and I'd say it's worth taking the ferry from Tobermorry to visit it.  I hope this helped!
The researchers at Stanford have been known to be really smug about their 40K HMD, they've said multiple times that they have the 'best' VR HMD in the world. It's satisfying to see them finally admit that the DK2 is better.
&gt; I don't think that every movie needs to pass the bechdel test Nor do I. The Bechdel test is just a comment on the average of the all films. I don't think it was intented to measure othe value of each movie.&gt; proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movieFor one it's a "low bar" test. As someone else commented, Porn movies have passed it. it doesn't comment on the feminist value of the film.It's just a litmus test... one that has merit when recognized for the broad strokes it does measure.
Why you're saying that it will never be finished?The game is getting updated nearly every half a week with constant experimental updates and "dev blogs"Now that the game is made by Bohemia Interactive and they have so many buyers there's no way it won't be finished.
[Story of the Blanks](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/573755) is probably the most well-known pony game after Fighting is Magic. It's a short 8-bit-style game. Don't play if you're planning to sleep tonight.
Sad to see the show go. I loved the ideas and where it seemed to be going. It's an odd feeling. At least we got 2 seasons, that's better than some shows.
Very interested in the clock stuff. I recently disassembled an anniversary clock and am about to put it back together. What kind of clocks are the ones you are working on?
&gt; It's irrelevant if the study is well constructed, replicable and peer reviewed.That's not how bias works. Research Colcrys. If there's only one study, and it's paid for by the manufacturers of a drug(or a chemical), your first thought should be suspicion. *Cui Bono* is an applicable mode of thinking in our world; and saying a peer-reviewed study is replicable doesn't hold water for people paying attention until such time as it is actually replicated.
The Titans are going to ruin him.  With so many holes on that team I can't believe they didn't trade down for a couple more picks.  One guy isn't gonna do much.
In your opinion "demonstrate that you can overachieve in something" == "Demonstration of commitment" ? If we remove "demonstration" we are left with "commitment" =="you can overachieve in something" . Not really the definition of commitment, is it?
I think if you're going to call yourself a feminist you have to take on the baggage of all of these definitions as well as the less common ones.You're not allowed to join the "it's okay to falsely accuse people of rape" movement and get mad that people think less of you for it.
Enabler just means they can break a lot of the deployment rules like bands and dwell times.  It also means that you may be rack and stacked by name or dwell time.  We were enablers but we just switched to the stupid p bands.  Now we are talking about going back because we don't like playing with the overlords controlling our deployments.
I totally disagree with Chuck when he says Rose needs to stop the jump-pass. Yes, MOST point guards should never do this. But Rose has like 10 seconds of hang-time and can fake like 3 different passes and move defenders out of the way before finally firing one across the entire court if he wants. It's ridiculous. 
Why would someone want to have freckles removed? I didn't even know that was a thing. I thought freckles were pretty commonly considered attractive... That's like someone with deep blue eyes having them lasered out for aesthetic reasons.
No, I've tried to physically help fat people. Most don't learn. That is not an exaggeration or slander. Honestly, these people don't care that their fat is killing them, and that they are costing their family and other people time and money.Anyways, I have a friend right now who has put on about 30 extra pounds. He is getting fat. I am almost daily inviting him to the gym, but he keeps making excuses. His mother is heavy. I wish with every fiber of my being that it was politically correct to just comment on someone's weight like their hairstyle. Because it's almost that easy to change. Yet some people still are too selfish and lack the mental capacity and willpower to realize the mistakes they are making and change their habits.Taking a picture of a fat person and laughing about it is the same as taking a picture of a midget or retard and laughing about it, except FAT PEOPLE CAN CHANGE THEIR DISABILITY. Fatties inflict the pain on themselves.
CORE (OP) YOURE A FAGGOT AND WONT LET ME BUNK WITH YOU. Nah dude you should pm me for info if you're interested, i live in Cincinnati and plan on going.If you can get their we'll split the rest of the cost and we can take your car or my own down to OPs and he can probably help us from their (if he's still down).We'll probably be on our own for housing though, if we can get a few more people shouldn't be an issue but until we do I'm keeping my eye out for cheap stays
Doing Web and mobile development. Also analysis, dealing with multi million row datasets.  Using a 1 year old machine machine with 8GB of RAM and continually running out. Also using an i5 and running out of CPU.  I commute via bike/train and want something light/small.
Just seems like an awfully roundabout way of saying gay marriage is wrong.I would expect the official Catholic answer to the OP's question to be "No, I do not feel the same way about marriages performed by other religions because those are 'Natural Marriages', unlike 'gay marriages' which are wrong (i.e. do not exist)."But for some reason many Catholics seem shy about just coming out and saying gay marriage is wrong. Pope Francis for example dodges the question splendidly every time. I wonder what the reason might be.
Oh, apologies! I had no clue. I would really like for someone to watch my game play though rather than just look at my stats. Summoner school just really doesn't have a lot of people there, and I feel like a lot of requests just get lost in the ocean.Can I post again omitting the stream, and only provide the link for those who say they are willing to help? Through a private message of course
No, Conley and TA didn't play at all, and Gasol was playing with a sprain from the Clippers game, so when it got out of hand he sat down.   What no one wants to talk about is how the back end of our bench absolutely crushed it. Russ Smith and Jordan Adams are clearly better than the Splash brothers. Secret Weapons. /s
You might have mentioned it, so I apologize if this question has already been answered. But, are you seeking any form of counselling? You've clearly been the victim of some form of trauma, and the things you've posted here are what you need to be telling to a professional. Good luck. 
Gel packs / energy beans.  Going in everything I read said there would be bananas and oranges at the rest areas.  There were none.  And the water tasted terrible (Jacksonville sulfur water).  Ran another one in NJ last year and it was well stocked, but I will always carry gels with me from now on.

The murder acts like a catalyst to aid in the splitting of one's soul. Having murdered does not split your soul.If it did, Voldemort's soul would be in more than 7 pieces. (movie refrence: Charity Babbage, Cedric Diggory. Fairly sure the old man in the fourth book was used to make Nagini a Horocrux)This still does not change the fact that the knowledge not being available would end in more deaths. Not knowing the spell and method would result in more deaths while they practice and perfect it.As for Nicholas Flammel, assuming the sorcerer's stone has the same method as in FMA then many people will also have died trying to perfect it, or copy what he did since it's quite clear he did not share the knowledge of how to make it with anyone.
&gt;... hope to someday make a career of making them... I'm always playing something.So, when does he plan on doing the work necessary to learn game development, if he's always playing them?
My grandmother had an obsession with Michael Crawford. Her closet was filled with anything and everything related to Michael Crawford. My mother likes to tell me the story of how she found out her great-grandmother, my grandmother's mother the of the one above, who worked as a sex educator in rural communities in the 20s, 30s, and 40s. She had a journal that was filled with homemade birth control methods. They learned with this journal that apparently my grandmother was also an accident and my grandmother had no idea until after her mother died. 
Nothing happened, he's a late round pick who showed *some* potential as a rookie. If you roll with him as your QB you are taking a massive risk. If you get to draft in the top 3 and have the chance at a franchise QB you absolutely have to take the chance.
I think this is what I've been slowly realizing and it's terrifying.  How do I now tell someone that I've been with for so long and love that I don't want to be married to them?
Oh for sure... I was on steam basically since month 1. I remember the pure pain... I remember thinking: "Why the FUCK can I not play a game that I paid for, just because I have shitty internet? You see you fucks! You all told me to get this STEAM shit, and look what happens. I'm going to go buy the CD like a *normal person* you twats..."
I've been in toxic relationships too. I've made damn sure to learn from my mistakes (I run from red flags instantly) and I have little patience. I recognize these things as flaws. BUT like you said, it's *if* they fix the problem that matters. 
Haha, they're like "look at this hipster bullshit."I wish the roost offered things other than coffee. ;-; My town is tea themed, so I'm torn on spending money to open a competitor's shop.
I kind of want to build Abzan ProsBloom/ lands combo, but there isn't a relevant commander. I was very intrigued when someone posted mentioning their Doran land-sac + Faith's Reward build.
Bees. The second I see one I am uncomfortable until I am out of it's line of sight. All joking aside I get panic attacks about it. I've been stung so many times that I can't just open my front door and stroll to my car without making sure the path is clear first.. I think the moment it became irrational was when I was walking my dog and did a 180 and went back home because I saw one buzzing around about 10 feet in front of me...
I personally drink about 10 little cans a week and it helps tremendously. I drink 2 a day at work when I'm thirsty instead of water. GF said its helped fantasticlly. For the 5 dollars it costs me to maintain the habit I'm more than happy to do so.
After a long hiatus, I hopped on a few days ago only to discover that the game progress for all accounts was reset last year. So that gives me, and plenty others I'm sure, an excuse to replay!
I have seen quite a few mini-atx cases with one of these in them, seems quite doable in many cases.Cool concept with that compact of a computer and this much GPU power. Like [this](http://cdn.overclock.net/8/8a/350x700px-LL-8a9b863b_2.jpeg)
Anabolic steroids aren't illegal, they're just a controlled substance. Doctors can still prescribe it.They're controlled for the same reason as recreational drugs, they have a relatively high potential for abuse. 
Additionally, you can't string as many hops together when using a gunlance. You've gotta have evade distance and evade extender to make dodging viable with it.

I'll agree that the recent opening of our club helped me dive back in to the hobby as we have some really excellent brewers in our club and it's fun to be inspired to try new things. I had been brewing as a mostly solo activity for several years, but it's way more fun to have others off whom to bounce ideas and to get to try everyone else's tasty beer. Also, I learned what gruit is last month. Now I need to try one. 
Good: amazing chassis. Good build quality (clunk when you shut the doors, nice seams). Super torquey motor at low RPMs. nimble handling. Lots of features. Cool mirrors. Looks great. Pretty practical for what it is. Also I prefer the electric PS to hydraulic (that's dinosaur shit IMO). Bad: Brake dust. Stereo crashes a lot and does weird things (but it's still very cool most of the time). No projector headlights in the US. Gas mileage isn't as good as I'd hoped or advertised, but I have a tune which I'm sure effected it.Overall: an incredible DD and fun weekend car. If you want something sporty and FWD, it's a maniacal beast. Light years better than anything else as far as I'm concerned. 
Yep. I'm pretty sure I bring them with me because they enable me. I mean, I'm probably going to buy it anyway, so it's better if someone agrees with me.  It makes me feel better at least. 
Wow this is amazing! Great job please post more like this. It's hard to find photos that aren't super edited from NASA. I can tell this is a natural photo even though it might be enhanced a little bit you can still appreciate the detail, once again great job! 
The Dutch commentator for Spanish football often mentions it, but [here's a quick link to an article about it](http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2013/06/29/4082197/isco-why-my-dog-is-called-messi) 
Is it your position that things can only get done from within the system? I can speak to people on their level, organize with them, empower them, and make real changes without casting a single vote. I don't mean to be rude but for someone advocating for "speaking to people on their level" you don't seem to be understanding where I'm coming from at all!
I debox all of mine so they can have adventures.  And I customize, so I pull off heads and other horrible things.I usually carry one or more Pops around in my bag so I can take dumb photos of them helping me eat pho or drinking too many cocktails.  My Pops have been to Dubai, Australia and New Zealand, as well as Walt Disney World.Oh, and you asked about my first Pop, that was Stitch, which a friend bought for me.  Started me on the Dark Path.
Hi there, i think i should win these two amiibo just because i am new and only hold onto 1 amiibo, Sheik. I would really like to start a nice collection but have not found good rare amiibo to actually do it. All amiibo sell super quick leaving only Peach and Mario respectively. I can understand if you do not pick me, but know this, i am a new collector wanting to start on a new journey to collecting amiibo and this would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Bye
Normally, they just get distracted or antsy. Everyone has things they're doing before the snap. The QB and center are making protection adjustments. The QB is also changing the play or the routes or the gap the run is through. Each linemen is focusing on how he can get inside/outside leverage The crowd is cheering as loud as they can to distract them. It's a lot to keep up with, especially as you get tired and it can be easy to forget whether the QB said the snap count was 1 or 2. And the O lineman is trying to get the jump on the 300 pound behemoth in front of him. Against guys like JJ Watt, you need every millisecond you can get 
Youngstown thanks you for the shoutout! Downtown has certainly gotten better over the past few years. Definitely more hopeful for the city now than in years past!
Have you explored your beaches, including under the water? I've had him glitch a couple times where he was actually under the ocean, instead of on the beach or on the water.
I think that was one reason they brought her on the show to begin with, though she thankfully didn't rely on that in her character :DI do have to agree.  Though, I like thinking of Seven as Data's future.  The episodes where they both gave way to 'offspring', you can see the vast difference in their characters there.  I'd have to pick Seven because of that reason, that she is Data's future.
Playing cello. I played for 9 years and had to stop because I have a mysterious wrist mobility issue that the doctors couldn't identify. I'd love to start playing causally again if I could find a super chill local orchestra or something since I prefer playing in a group.
Polls from this week: Hillary Clinton 62.2%, **Joe Biden 9.8%**, Bernie Sanders 5.6%, Martin O'Malley 1.6%, Jim Webb 1.4%Warren's at 12.7, so if you give that all to Sanders he gets bumped up to 18.3%. But he still has to contend with Hillary's 40-point lead. Anyway, 'what-ifs' aside, I was just pointing out that Sanders in 2015 is not in the same position as Obama in 2007, and has a much steeper hill to climb to get the nomination. 
I listen to EDM when working out, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPioLizQKuc) is currently what I listen too during those sets that need that extra push.
Everyone has some story about a certain delivery company and why they *hate* them because of something like this. The fact is, every company does this, and I bet it has more to do with the way it's packed than how it's handled. There's always a risk when shipping fragile stuff. I just prefer the USPS because they deliver faster, more days. They have more planes and trucks that end up delivering shit to pretty much everyone in the US, six times a week. UPS Ground means it never goes in the air, whereas I feel like if the USPS has room on a plane, they'll do it.
One win should see us safe. A favourable run-in with four games to go against lower half of the table teams, with some of our better players returning from injury/suspension. We've lost 7 on the run and if we don't pick up any more points in the next four games then we quite rightly deserve to go down. A relatively smallish chance of being relegated but it wouldn't surprise me if it did happen. If we stay up, next year there needs to be massive changes in terms of manager, playing staff and in how the club is run overall, ideally with Mike Ashley selling up and getting the fuck out. Overall, very disappointing season due to dreadful management from the top. 
I like the framing better in the original. I'd say OP's post wins on a majority of fronts when critiquing the 2 photographs. but hey, thats just my opinion, and my degree.
Ford had serious issues with these transmissions... That code is telling you and me to trade your car in for something newer or spend 2500 dollars to fix and keep it 
WAW's DLC was only free on PC. Supposedly this was because they couldn't figure out how to enforce DLC payment before using it, which was solved by Steamworks.

My brother got a form of temporary paralysis after an injection when he was like 12 so he tries to avoid any type of immunization that's not absolutely necessary now. That being said, I think that's the only valid reason though NOT to vaccinate your child (if they have a severe reaction), and parents most definitely must vaccinate their children otherwise.
Not gonna lie, I'm actually really excited the Eagles didn't get Mariota. I'd much rather keep the pieces we have now. Although I'm not completely ruling out a trade yet.
Basic supply and demand. Being a teacher is "easy" to do and many people can do it. Same with being a waiter/waitress. By easy I don't mean fun, I mean a lot of people are capable of doing the job. Not many people are capable of being engineers(yet)/willing to be engineers. Being a janitor is important, otherwise we would have shit and disease everywhere, but anyone can do it, so basic supply and demand lowers the price.We don't have a value problem. It's not hard to teach kindergarten, I can even do that, but ask me to build a phone that can charge in under an hour and I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.Basically, if only one person can do Job A and 50 people can do job B guess and demand for job A and B is just me, then I can get Job B done cheap but not Job A. 
Right. So I've read that engineers are getting a moa bomb. With the elite mesmer specialization chronomancer being shown today, chronomancers will be able to double-moa, possibly triple-moa if a shatter recharge signet works with the F5 shatter.Will engi/mes moa lockdowns become meta?!?More importantly, the chronomancer additions are HUGE.

I feel as if both guests and TB had this opinion as well at least to some degree, and honestly I agree with them (most internet drama is this way, gamergate anyone?). They might not have expressed it as aggressively as he did, but I felt all 3 of them were on the same wavelength on most points, so not sure why you single out just him.
I don't think I've ever seen him not lean in and make a comment to his guest as the camera cuts away. Also, the way he just stares blankly downward as she's making her final comments... that's pure disdain. 
Eh I don't know how truly different it will be. I feel like in the last couple years of the Colbert Report the character gradually faded and we got more and more of the real Stephen Colbert.

Well to be totally honest Ronaldo had the best angle to finish around that defender coming in timely with the slideThat being said holy shit this guy is a self-absorbed greedy mother fucker how can he not let Pipita take that shot, like even the other day when Arbeloa stepped in front of him to finish a tap in (which by the way ended a FIVE YEAR scoring drought for him) he threw a complete hissy fitDefinitley a Madrid fan and a fan of what CR7 is capable of on the pitch, definitely not a fan of his character
For fuck's sake, I said it was a minor nuisance. I posted it about it more to discuss whether that would really be the case or not, not because I'm being bitchy. Stuff like this is interesting to me, I'm not an app developer. On iOS or Windows Phone, when you build an app, do you have to write a line to include the bouncing animations in your app's scrolling lists, or does it happen automatically anywhere in the OS that scrolls? Since Android doesn't have this bouncing animation at an OS-level, I'm just noticing that it looks like devs may have to implement small stuff like this "on their own" during the porting process as well, otherwise why would MS have shown a video demo in which the bouncing is absent?
I just read [Adesokan's _Postcolonial Artists and Global Aesthetics_](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/african_studies_review/v056/56.1.stephens.pdf) and was blown away. Historical materialist methodology but very interwoven with fantastic attentiveness to many different kinds of African arts, but especially film.       Basically, if you want someone theorizing Africa as part of global life--as opposed to, say, the victim of it, or not yet ready to take part in it--Adesokan is bringing a lot to that conversation.      I'm not a historian.

I see them as having they learned a bit of linear time perception from Sikso. We see them having possessed Sarah, Sisko's mother, leading to his birth and subsequent life leading up to becoming the Emissary.  If they stopped the ships another time, his path would have been different, probably not leading to him fighting Gul Dukat and the pah-wraiths.
I am so glad they took him actually. My worst case scenario was them taking Leonard Williams and either having Shane Ray drop to them in the second or them climbing back into the first for him. That'd be a legit defense.
that wouldnt make sense given my electric bill is less than $40 a month. unless everything goes on the rice cooker, its impossible to consume that much energy. maybe 600w WHEN ITS COOKING (which is once a week - yay energy efficiency!)

I have this one student who has sort of a gangster appearance but, if you give him a chance, is really sweet.  I was describing him to a colleague who also has him in his class as a "big puppy dog".  My colleague replied, "you know, people used to put puppies in bags and drown them."
I don't disagree with your second statement (well, maybe a little).It seems I was looking at the publisher and not the developer when it came to future releases. My mistake.

You can research as much as you want but in the end you are rolling the dice. I took a job in Saudi Arabia a few years ago- Dave's ESL Cafe had  a few short but good reviews, but as I later found out they had all been posted by the schools wildly bipolar Director of Studies. Several people fled the school in the couple of months I was there and we all got into posting a discussion on Dave's. The DOS responded with a multiple abusive replies from multiple personas which ended up with the tread being deleted by Dave- hence no more bad reviews.All you can do is use your good judgement and trust that if it all goes tits up in one place you will at least have a good story or two to tell your grandchildren (KSA =  '4 legged fried chicken' and walking through the remains of a  2000 year old city that was untouched by archaeology)
No, because the question was about what the *human* experienced, not the nignog.The correct answer, of course, was not listed. The human experienced going to the store to make a purchase in a civilized society, where customer and merchant each are a vital part of a symbiotic relationship.The nigger was simply followed to ensure he didn't steal or destroy something. Sure that was stereotyping. So what? It's called being smart and playing the odds.You know, if niggers don't like the way people treat them because of stereotypes, the problem is NOT with the people who are being understandably wary. The problem lies within the nigger population itself.

200 HP / 252 Def / 56 Sp DefI can't really give you an explanation, it was the spread I saw suggested and it works. There is no real wrong way to EV him, you can go full physical, or shift more towards Special. I'm considering shifting a few HP EV's over to SpDef but at the moment it has pretty much just enough SpDef to take 2x MegaGardevoir STABs (a Pokemon who is excellent at finding gaps in team comps), allowing him to switch in, then set up Wish stalling the next turn, so I think I'm happy like it is.

I agree if the CB2 was closer to the performance of of the c720 even then it would be the best chromebook you can get besides the pixel. I'm actually returning my Acer i5 since its little to big for me to carry around as a student.I would be willing to pay a little extra for a Chromebook with less compromises. I'd imagine a $400-$500 Chromebook can be made with a few less compromises.

**EDIT: Just booked tickets. I am going to be hyped as fuck from now until August. This could be tiring.**    Coheed are playing at Hevy Fest on Friday 14th August. I live at the other end of the country and none of my friends are particular fans, but I *really* want to see them perform. IKSSE:3 is my favourite album and I will be able to die happy if I see the whole thing performed live.    I live way up north (Leeds), but I *might* be able to drag one friend I know. If there are any other COTF going it would be fantastic to meet up with some of you. Any thoughts?
Yeah, that's a very vague term and it was intentionally vague because obviously there's no numbers.I probably should use the term "significant"?  Whatever term you want to use to mean "unavoidably noticeable".  What I mean but substantial isn't that most of them are like that.  I mean the population of people that would do that isn't small enough to pretend it's just an anomaly.  For example if there was a white guy that murdered 10 kids, that's a very very very tiny portion of the population of 30 year old white guys so you can say "that guy is just crazy."  Now if 5-10% of white guys murder multiple kids, then that's a small population but substantial?/significant? enough to fuck up our perception of white guys.Hopefully that helps it make more sense?  It's like the Muslim terrorist thing.  Most Muslims aren't terrorists.  But there's a ...(whatever term you want to use)... population of Muslim terrorists; enough that you can't pretend they don't exist.

I actually prefer the bottom one as well. The skin shader (subsurface scattering, I beleive) is a bit too strong in the top one. (though not quite as bad as dying light's skin, euuwgh). That, and his face just seems to have more personality in the older pic.
Today in my EMT-B class we were talking about diabetes, and our teacher told us about a lab he did in college where they put a certain amount of insulin into a goldfish tank so that they would go into diabetic coma, and said when they did this the fish started swimming sideways and when they put glucose into the tank the fish returned to normal. After he told us about this, this girl raised her hand and asked if people walk side ways when they have to high of insulin levels.... this isn't even the most stupid thing she has said. I fear for the lives she is expected to save.Edit: This is not an answer to the question, my b.....Edit: Fixed my edit.Edit: Fixed my "fixed my edit"

There is a difference. Had Father not become a priest and married a woman instead, he wouldn't be ostracized. Now, I'm straight, but for the sake of argument, if I were gay and I were to enter into a relationship with a man, I would be ostracized from my Catholic community. The choice becomes staying in the Church and feeling alone for the rest of one's life, or leaving the Church.It's not an impossible cross to bear, but seriously consider the position many gay people find themselves in, and you can get an idea of how heavy it is.
it can be done from a series of photographs and photogrammetry software such as 123dcatch or memento. you'll need to do some post processing, but this would be the best way to do it IMO

Possible, sure, but since Motorola doesn't release images for 99% of the variants, and since every update seems to include an update to the bootloader that prevents an old image from being flashed on a locked bootloader, it might as well be impossible.

Measure how deep the tread is, and look for any wear patterns. Shouldn't have that, if they're pretty new, otherwise you have some alignment issues to deal with. New tires will come with about 10/32" deep tread, so if you're close to that, you should be okay. Just look for consistency around and across the tire.
I think the only way this would work to avoid all lottery/tax/legal issues would be to run it like /r/millionairemakers, where after someone is chosen, the "winner" provides paypal account info, and redditors individually can choose to send the winner $X.xx directly. It relies on trusting that enough people will send the person money. However, as /r/millionairemakers has shown, this usually ends up in all sorts of judgement of the winner (see good explanation of the state of things [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/millionairemakers/comments/33vzx8/who_wants_to_know_the_millionaire_ahem/cqp1kc0)).
Just to play along with the prompt here...The East Side has exactly one good neighborhood: Fox Point.  The rest of the East Side is painfully dull, lacks diversity, has bad urban planning, crappy restaurants, and is full of disrespectful college students littering beer cans and alcohol bottles everywhere.  Not to mention climbing the hills from downtown is really unpleasant.

I just got dogs so I can explain some.Dogs can start out bringing 3 animals a day. You train them using the animal whistle in the morning by standing next to them and pushing A. It will only let you do it once and then every other attempt is met with a note saying they can't be trained any more today.Supposedly as you raise hearts with them they can bring more out. Also they will only bring out 1 choice of animal, chickens and rabbits or livestock and sheep/ wool producers. You can set this in the pet house, the same way you can move them from house to house.

Jay did get burned telling facts that were later contradicted by alibis.  But he kept iterating on the story.For example, in the first on-tape interview (already after the long off-tape interview in which the police said his story didn't add up), Jay said that Adnan got the call from the police while they were at McDonald's, not Cathy's. Then whoops, Cathy was interviewed says she saw the call at her place.Next interview, call took place at Cathy's.Jay had a lot of shots to fire and did in fact miss with a lot of them.Another thing to keep in mind is that when Jay is being questioned, he's brought in because the police suspect Adnan.  That context would suggests quite a lot about Adnan's possible alibis to the person being interviewed, at least, that they weren't trivially verifiable because the police are looking into him.
Do I have to be an engineer to use programs like that? Or is there something I just don't know? I want to start doing some DIYs, and I see a lot people that post one here use some fancy programs to diagram their projects. So am I just out of the loop or what? Thank you. 
&gt;Because clearly it it's a reasonable possibility that the military would take over Texas.Where does Paul say that? Nowhere in the interview is the military operation even described like that. Paul is asked if he's heard about some military operation, he says no -- he'll look into it. That's it, end of story.The irony here is that *you're* the one actually demanding this absurd theory be given more attention than it's worth. And you're saying the onus is on Paul to somehow know about any given conspiracy at any given moment so that he can adequately dismiss it to your judgement. There's partisan hackery and then below that there's /u/matts2.

You are so inspiring to me! I hope to follow in your footsteps (4 little ones sounds AMAZING!).

Oh yeah it went uphill RAPIDLY after that.And even with the rant, like, it wasn't Kankri or even Porrim levels of bad. Since, like, he was more saying "dude society is -dead- why should we care" whereas the other two are like "Society is dead, but we should still care about the injustice that the society once had". Makes it easier to digest.Still, definitely the lower point of the dialoglog.
Those cinderbricks they use to build these retaining walls are actually essentially primed for painting purposes. The process of creating them (crushing cinders together) makes them only slightly porous, so paint sticks without dripping. Honestly, catching tags on a flat cinderbrick wall (that isn't striated like this one) is the type of thing to give a writer an erection.    
wow that's pretty shitty, I remember a while back, a veteran was shot dead by a bunch of cops who raid the wrong house. I wonder what happens to the cops, probably face a few years in jail at most.

They are also raising taxes on anyone over 125,000$ saying they need to pay "their fair share" , which can be smeared easily.It's actually funny here in Edmonton you see NDP signs absolutely everywhere until you drive into the upper middle class neighborhoods and they disapear entirely.

Well the reason why would be because they sold me a concept of a team that was based on a lie. I probably wouldn't switch allegiances, but I would not renew my season tickets. That said, I'm a strong believer that CFG will do everything possible to build in a good location within the city. 
Most respect for people who give a shit. Least for those who don't. There are clearly people who go through life actively making a difference in their own lives, as well as those around them. They wake up in the morning with a plan to get shit done, even when that shit is just the basic stuff. They are actively engaged in the world around them. They're always thinking about what they're doing.Then there are those who just subsist. Yeah, they get up but they just drag themselves from activity to activity. They half ass at work, they come home and stare at the TV or the computer and they get up and do it again. At no point are the thinking of a way to do something more. No goals, no to do lists, they're just alive. 
Crowd control, mostly. If you've got an endless swarm of pigmen or spiderps after you, it's not easy to get a full shot off, but high knockback will let you get low-level shots off.

I really wanted feedback on my commentary at bum's school event back in January but none of it was streamed or recorded due to technical difficulties. hopefully art will let me get on the mic since last time nobody commentated at all, but now that Yipes is steam co, he'll probably be there and I won't be able to try
Protip: you can have Winamp configured with the streamripper plugin (not the GUI) to listen to internet radio, fetch all the ID3 information and dump the individual files into your trance folder. Make sure it's a high res stream though. 
Holyfuckingshit, that was awesome. I haven't ready anything like that for a long time. Huge inspiration, and that's what TRP is all about. Keep going bro, you just started winning at life.Edit: i refresh this page and boom, original post is gone :/
1. Choosing Gator at the start of Crystal2. Drawing, watching anime, getting more hobbies in life3. New York4. Science, really any type.5. Cookies and Cream6. 100 duck sized horses7. I have 3 turtles as pets. 
The main reason I use it over a $50-60 IWB kydex holster is the "belt claw" which helps conceal my G19 around my body type. Besides that I do like the thin design although it feels plasticky, holds well on my belt, and very smooth draw. I've seen DIY methods such as a foam wedge but I figured well, if the Eidolon can last a few years it'll be $100 well spent. 
That was awful. I mean they've been saying his name for years now and its not a hard name to say. You would think the guy whose gotta announce the players would know how to say them. 
I read it before I'd really heard all of these things put together, but yeah. It's better read as a helpful memoir of an accomplished writer than as any kind of manual.

In law school I am often allowed to take "One page, front and back" in with me to an exam. You would be genuinely surprised how much information you can get onto a single piece of paper. 
I think he made a few PR snafu's on his social media, and several pro players have spoken about his (age appropriate) immaturity. I believe that coupled with the whole community being irrational about him leaving his "family Fnatic" has caused his decline in public opinion 
Too late, man. I'm committed now. Starting to feel relaxed like a muscle relaxer but it could very well be placebo. In all reality, in a couple hours I will be on here saying it def was not placebo
This is precisely what should happen since Karl's Super PAC does not serve the tax exempt purpose he has claimed.  The very same tax exempt discrepancy is true for the Koch Brothers' Super PAC's.
As a member of gen x, I made the mistake of assuming that what I thought were intelligent people that graduated HS with me wouldn't be creationists.  I was so wrong. Every single one who went to a non religious college isn't a young earth creationist, but many who stopped at HS are. 
Yes, the Garmin 430 does not decode airways.  I use Foreflight.  So I put the airways into Foreflight and use the setting decode "bends only". Then the Navlog in Foreflight shows each bend in the airways that needs to go into the Garmin.  Then you have to enter them manually, of course!
Sorry about that, we get questions and posts here constantly from people saying he can't win and that it's a waste of time.if we went all out, I'd say the chance is 50/50.I would probably take that bet, but yet again it's way too early to know for sure, all the support he has could vanish the moment they actually have to put work in.
I know what you mean, but there's a big far part of me that thinks that if you'd get in trouble for something as tame as this at work, maybe don't go on the internet at work? Or at least not Reddit... 
I couldn't stand any of the companions apart from Rose :/ I forced myself to watch for the story of the doctor though. Once Rose was out as a companion, the new ones that came were obnoxious as fuck and annoying.
When I looked at the armor for the hull of the new t34, it only showed something like 15mm of armor, is this a local bug or is everyone else showing this as well?
Ok fair enough, but that is definitely not what people are talking about when the say wax/oil/shatter.  And it's for sure not what op was referring to. Also are you for real dabbing butter?
Wow, sad fucking day when a piece of shit like Mayweather could pull $100 mil for one fight.  Meanwhile people THAT MATTER are making a fraction, of a fraction of that.The money thrown around in boxing is just sad.  If you pay for this fight and NOT pirate it... fuck you.  Pirate it and give that money to a charity or something.
She'd dismiss it as "Good grief!  I know, already..."  But I strongly suspect that if OP dropped to Jamie how much work it must be to be in an open relationship ("Just how do you do it?"), she'd likely be scrambling out of confusion.
No one seems to realize that the X1 isn't the 360 right now and the gaming scene is way different. Not to mention the oversaturated market for shooters. It's going to take a big push with TF2 for this game to climb. Saying Halo Reach has 17k players means nothing. Think about how many people own 360s. 
I think if they were wrong about anything, it's that the community wouldn't spread a bunch of misinformation and fear-mongering. Almost without fail, the first couple comments would be confused, misinformed people, thinking that the mods they have are going to be disabled behind a paywall.

Again, we werent there, we dont see the social intricacies that went down. You can be nice and creepy at the same time. It's your replies and your post history that has convinced me that you are lacking in social graces and have personal issues to work on. The specifics are not available to us. Your version of the story is all opinion and speculation. We cannot tell you EXACTLY how to dress and behave because we just are not present. There is no standard way to act or not act. Beyond that, acting doesnt work. Socialization is not a checklist. Its a dynamic flow, changing directions as the situation progresses. This is above our pay grade.This is something your therapist should be helping you with. Again, if you aren't getting results, you need to seek out alternate help.
MY TIME TO SHINEI have not a recurring dream, but a recurring place. I have a whole dream city where most of the dreams I remember take place. This city is entirely fictional as it is sometimes a little whacky, but it never changes layout or anything. It is a consistent "solid" city.It's by the sea, it has big mirrored skyscrapers that give away to seaside town. Further you go it becomes jungle.Yesterday I dreamt about the mafia that runs "my" city. It's super weird.
Who do you think collects crime and justice data, performs analysis and research, publishes findings, develops theoretical frameworks and critical perspectives, makes recommendations to the government, legal system and law enforcement agencies, just to name some of the pointless activities that criminologists engage in. The law fairies?
Whether *you* know what the color name refers to is immaterial.  The name comes from the object. Except for the basic red, yellow, blue, green etc. (and not even orange), I think that's the case for every color name.
Not a keeper. 14 team Yahoo H2H, my other OFers are Puig, Pederson, Guerrero and Khris Davis. Think I'll stand pat unless I can talk him into a straight up 1-1 Dick for Cutch, or throw in someone that's not Myers or Joc. 
I put coconut oil in the microwave until it was boiling, then added ground bud (my kitchen isn't weed friendly). Once it turns a nice green you can add it to the ramen. Make sure it's a small amount though, drinking too much oil will fuck with your stomach. 
She threw the pile of those things at him, but I don't think that warranted grabbing her by the hair. And the people saying they would've punched her the first time she said fuck you are fucked, he could've easily been sued and never taught again if he did.  
There's much discussion to be had, if solo queue skills meant so much then Pobelter would be a god. GBM himself said the Western player who he'd do best in Korea would be Pobelter, simply because Pobelter did by far the best in Korean solo queue out of any player who's ever gone there.EDIT: Also want to note yusui has way less time to show off his solo queue skills as he is still in school and you know, actually plays on a team unlike incarnation.
I'll be honest here. You should probably improve through matchmaking before you take alternate leagues seriously.Just find people to queue MM with until you end up with a solid group of people. Ask them later if they want to do alternate pug services.
I believe he interview for Minnesota once but that was probably the last go around and some think it was for leverage.  ISU wouldn't want a repeat of hiring a UNI coach with the way the McDermott hired worked out and would hate the style switch.  Iowa had a similar disaster with the lickliter hire that would be similar to hiring Jacobson. I really don't see him going to either Iowa or ISU.
Just a personal opinion, but I see DIY route as a fun hobby, than a viable route to care for your skin. There are so many decent options for less than $20, and they are a little bit more sophisticated than water and LAA. For me, bottom line, do a cost/benefit analysis and ask yourself a question, am I willing to invest in raw ingredients, specialized kits etc?
Well they are... For the same kids, who grew up. Superheroes grew up with us. From an artistic point of view, this is a testament to the quality of what Marvel/DC did. From a marketing point of view, maybe not so much. The things that attract kids today (for the last 20 years, actually) are designed for the kid demographic and will never evolve. TMNT, Sponge Bob, and the endless franchises created to sell junk to kids like Skylanders and Bey Blades and Transformers. Seriously, can you imagine a dark, complex Optimus Prime? 
Er...until I stopped watching Sailor Moon? Whatever age that would be when kids start outgrowing princessy stuff and stop playing house (I was also a water princess when we played house).
Housing would be the least of our worries at that point if we still haven't done anything about it. Yes, there will be foreclosures, but previously the foreclosures were what caused the market to crash, this time it would be unemployment that directly affects the crash, and the last time that happened, we called it something worse than a recession.
They nerfed the scaling by like 5... That's not totally significant. It just sounds that way. At least they didn't Azir her; nerf-nuke her from fucking orbit then realize they'd actually destroyed it and decide to rebuild it way later. 
I've shopped and consigned a lot at Buffalo Exchange, and there is no way they would have taken her clothes. Their sizes pretty much max out at a Large, and even that size is limited. A 4X to 6X? No frigging way. I've never been to a consignment store that carried that size, even one that catered to an older crowd. They usually stop at 14 or 16.

We were, [sorta](http://i.imgur.com/uDK8gkD.jpg). We were in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. I didn't realize we were so close to the dragon until after we got back home. We were still on very small, windy roads with some seriously great views.
I'm sure adjusting the clutch comes up on your first service.  If you don't like it make the folks who sold it take a look. It might be ok but it sounds like it might need to be adjusted.

Don't feel bad, there were plenty of other hints that it wasn't a different book and like you said, it wasn't your decision to change it. Besides, I got another friend into the Demon Cycle by giving him my second copy.
Who the fuck is advising Pacquiao financially? He's spent the majority of his expected purse so far.Expected income for fight: $120,000,000Expected taxes to pay on purse (35%) -$42,000,000Top Rank's cut after taxes (27%): -$21,000,000Freddie Roach trainer fee: -$8,000,000New Home purchased in LA for family: -$12,000,000Tickets for the fight: -$3,000,000That leaves him with $34,000,000 and that's presuming Top Rank takes their cut after taxes which may not be the case. That also doesn't factor in Koncz fee, other training fees, etc. That is a huge chunk of his purse, that's great that he is generous but he needs to look out for his future as well. Given the rumblings about previous tax issues and advances from Top Rank it begs the question.
With 3rd party game releases only a small portion of the sales go to the company who made the console. For them, more of the benefit comes from, "This game you want is on our system, so you should buy our system! And now that you have our system, you should buy these games that our in-house developers made!"
Unless I'm forgetting something, the show has replicated every appearance of the Others/WWs from the books, plus added the [spoilerish?](/s "Night's King") scene from season 4. Granted, show-only people probably think wights and white walkers are the same thing and have no idea what's up with the Children, but the point is I think most would acknowledge there's some sort of fucked-up ice humanoid stuff going on north of the Wall. 
the pathet lao and vc never even officially acknowledged the existence of hundreds of airmen downed over laos.  there could still be american servicemen there by their own choice or not, even now.edit: [great documentary for those interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYhfjTOj9s8)
Unlike what you see in the movies., arthropods with compound eyes actually combine the images like humans do with their two eyes so they perceive one cohesive image. It would be more a curate if it look like a fish eye lens
Thought it also happened to Kansas City one year.  Now looking it up I see the Raven's missed their pick and Kansas turned their card in before the Ravens could so they moved up one spot for free.
Also BBAMFCOAL you have been playing for 2 months and have a lvl 99 MP score?? I don't understand.  The 19120 battle points I understand (7th battle rewards), but the lvl 99 I don't get...
there is a prop sensor cable so you can put a sensor on like a sword or something. Positional tracking of props though would require optical (or Lighthouses ;) )
Thats an extension of the main principle of gather as much information as possible.You cant know whether to act weak or strong if you dont know if you are the weak one or the strong one.
&gt; As there is little else to spend alloys on at this point of the game, any investment made into plasma weapons has to be sufficiently expensive so as to meaningfully impact the player's economy.I have difficulty taking this argument seriously. It lacks verisimilitude and leads off a cliff if consistently followed. It would make just as much sense for high-level soldier promotions to cost alloys (you can justify it in the fluff by pointing to the HP increase).
Are the analysts even raising the possibility of a Mariota trade later. Philly doesn't pick for two more hours -- and all that they are offering is still there for the taking. I think Tenn is shopping him as we speak. 
&gt; I disagree with these stats.So? Stats are stats, numbers don't lie whether you agree with them or not. You can disagree the **method** those statistics are collected, but you can't "disagree" with the stats.
Yeah I think it's still set to the original build or something. I have Port Tanzia marked on it's own waypoint, but I only included the uppercase "nation" waypoints in this release.
Hmmmm, ...Is Kepner filming another movie?  Or taking some time off for her baby?  Trying to figure out why they're sending Hunt and Kepner away for 3 mos.
Maybe the UFO-eye is an object that sits up there in the place of the UFO and detects when the player is close enough to see it?  I recall that the chiliad UFO "despawns" or disappears after you move a certain distance away from it.  Perhaps the Ufo-eye object remains there invisible.

I wouldn't know, never tried twitter. I assumed it was even more attention-whorey than FacebookAlso, people don't have time to evaluate everyone's opinions seriously.. so most good things, if not conformed to the majority, get ignored.
50lbs before I reassess. I'm not hyper focused on a goal weight, so much as an aesthetic goal, and a BF% goal.I get at least 8 hours of sleep per night for sure, save for a couple of nights where I've been restless, and I'm quite proud to say that other than Sunday, which is my rest day, I've only taken two days off in the past 6 weeks! One because my knee was bothering me, and the other because I hadn't slept at all. Working out keeps me sane, since I work an office job where I sit for 8 hours a day.GNC is SO expensive, I definitely agree there, and I'm glad to hear that all kinds of supplements are NOT needed. Like I said, I got most of them for free, so I likely won't repurchase! 
Size/number of points shouldn't be rewarded at all. There is no way to compare results like this. I think it would be better if it just compared the points to an actual circle (ignoring any filling inside of it) and it gave a score in the form of % of resemblance to the perfect circle (with decimal places).
I can't believe this is a bug in the PC. It's irritating on the Xbox but I figured it was just a bug in the initial release. It would have thought this was already working on the PC. The game has been out 2 years? How is this not fixed?
That would be more acceptable, its a little bit of a grey area because the comments say its her profile picture. The time stamp says it was a while ago though so I'd approve it if you resubmitted with that or edited the original link so it would look like that.
Cool. Yeah I really like the looks of them even though my wife doesn't. But she's not driving it.Have you driven it in snow? Curious how the AWD is in snow. 
I've been hit like that in the throat before. It feels a lot worse than it looks. I guess it's a smart move by Dunleavy, especially knowing that Giannis is such a young player.  But yeah, Giannis just needs to learn to stay calm (or be #sneakylikedunleavy).
The clothes make the man.  When a man puts on armor and a plethora of tools commonly known as weapons, he is then going to use the tools to do his job as efficiently as he sees fit.  Most patrolmen DO NOT need armor and batman style belt to de-escalate situations that may require their attention. 
If you want to help out young adults who are aging out of the foster care system, check out The Camellia Network. They are a former client of mine, and my team built their website and the tech that leverages an Amazon API to allow these young folks to register for the things they need to get their adult lives started. Think of it as a gift registry for adulthood.Over the last couple of years it has been amazing to watch these young folks in need go from zero to fully sponsored.I'm not connected to them in any way, but it is some of the work I am most proud of having done.https://www.camellianetwork.org
Well Tacitus had a way with words. He in all likely hood made up the whole speech, as its just far to Roman in tone and theme to be anything other than a Roman invention.

It's called an undercut.I didn't realise it wasn't a thing in the US yet, they've been pretty popular here for the last couple of years along with other haircuts pinched from the 40s and 50s.
I really, really respect this specific opinion. I was steered away from the arts at a very young age by high school english classes. You'd read a poem, be asked to provide your insight and opinion of the imagery and its effects on the character and dialogue... sounds good so far.Then they start grading you on how well your interpretation lines up with the one your teacher thought up.... Similar to the lines of what you just said, art is subjective, timeless, and  *open to interpretation*. The idea that you have to predict your teacher's opinions to pass a class irked me to no end.
it took me multiple times to get into TEW 2013, and like others said i just can't go back. but this right here was one of the big ones that held me back. my style of booking is pretty conductive to going fast, i pretty much only book 2 promos a show, run no storylines, i cheat alot using the editor ahha, and i use autobooker to book all of the REGULAR show's matchesthen just going through picking winners, because i noticed if you don't have really awesome road agents, yo match rating goes down the more notes you give it.then PPV's i go all out and shit with the big gimmick matches and people meeting up to fight for titles.it takes me about 1-3 months to play a year in TEW 2013, thats with 2 shows a week and 12 pay per views a year, also i spend a SIGNIFICANT ammount of time messing about with pushes at the beginning of every month.if i really grind i could do a year in a week probably.
I know nothing about "skipping first year", but I started working in a lab in the summer after first year through the SWEP program. Funnily enough, I graduated my undergrad and masters, and have a fulltime job in the same lab. So it's possible.
It's possible that perhaps the average consumer has changed? We might be seeing far more early adopters because everyone was so ready to leave the last generation and the switch off was very smooth. I'd guess that if you were a PS3 or Xbox 360 owner and you didn't jump to PC you were locked into gaming and buying a next gen system was just a matter of time.
If getting visa is not a problem why many countries sign agreement about visa free travel? Why do they bother? For example, as far as I know, Mexicans can travel to Europe without visa as tourists. Are Mexicans on average less  problematic from the point of view of security? Are they less likely to stay? Is Mexico on average a richer and more stable society than Russia? What other ways of outreach to Russian citizens would you suggest which would be meaningful to them and would be appreciated? 
Seriously, one of the high points of the game for me is telling her you don't care what she does with the marquis at her salon.  I just wish she had more places where she'd interject amusing things into conversations!
There honestly is no point in getting Smash Bros 3DS if you have the Wii U version apart from some 3DS exclusive stages but I remember playing it on launch day and I can tell it definately felt like a taster for the Wii U version.I personally recommend Fire Emblem Awakening or Animal Crossing New Leaf but if you're patient enough, you can probably grab the actual boxed copies for a decent price on ebay and use the eShop card to buy Virtual Console games.
Aussie here, after a player gets drafted, how do they negotiate contracts? I mean how do they settle on a salary and what is the contract length. Because if the team offers them a certain salary, and the player doesn't like it, what do/can they do?
&gt; we will probably have the episode from Steven's perspective inside his gemIMO the easiest way to do it would be to have him knocked out by a villain or monster, like when Jasper knocked him out at the end of The Return. Or they could have the story start in media res, with Steven thinking that he's having a weird dream or something, and only revealing the fact that he poofed into his gem when it shows him regenerating at the end. Or they could have him accidentally retreat into his gem while he's trying to do something else (like summon his shield, or shapeshift, or learn to use some other power we haven't heard of yet).

Unless you work 2 hours from Portland there is nowhere that is completely RES dominated. There are neighborhoods where RES have a majority but they are under constant attack. Portland ENL doesn't win their cell by over 100k MUs 30+ cycles in a row without having an overwhelming number of players/time who are willing to travel all over the cell.Anyway, I did not post to say anything about Portland specifically (like I said I've only heard positive things about almost all Portland toads) only adding on to your statement about players like in OP's situation burn out.

Ended up picking these up today for a total of $1.00. There is a guy who runs a junk / thrift shop near a job site I am working at. He charges .25/ea for any "music CD". All of the cases are in very rough shape, but manuals are pretty decent.What do you guys do for new CD jewel cases?

Splurging every now and then on comfort foods is fine as long as it isn't a constant thing. Moderation and self control are key if food is used as a coping mechanism. Even so, there are healthier ways to cope.
Am I missing something?  Seems like the church is being very accommodating to the music store.  50K behind on their lease, I would have evicted them the day I took possession of the property.
I have been pushing to beat my highest rank of 10 for about a week and I finally got to 9 a couple of days ago. I got greedy these last few days and tried to go for 8, bobbing up and down at rank 9. I did it today and I'm sitting at 1 star over 8. I'm extremely happy. Hopefully I can get some upgrades to my deck next season now that I don't have to keep paying for Blackrock.
Honestly even a marriage visa with an Australian native is a 2-3 year process before permanent residency is granted.Also the fact that you are both foreign citizens and already planning on requiring government financial assistance seems a bit unfair I would think.There is an amount of time before people on even resident visas can access most social services I believe. 
Late 90s were nearly 20 years ago, not all that shocking that some people on Reddit weren't around to see them then. I was, and did, but I can understand how some kids would be really excited for their first chance to see the original three on the big screen. 
Most folks go via server browser into low pop or custom server hotwire matches with a 50-100% rep boost. If the enemy team are doing the same (which they likely are in such a server) you can simply grab a vehicle and drive in circles until you hit tier 4 without having to worry about being killed.

Some guards will look in your cigs, some won't. Sometimes you get a little pat on the sides, never thorough, and sometimes you just get waved through. You can usually scope out which guards are just waving people and which seem to be looking harder. Just hop to the next line if you are skeptical. They never touch at the front of the waistband, around the navel, which is where I stash sometimes. I can say, don't put anything in your hat. They will check there 50/50. Honestly, if you got the room, inside of your shoe is one of the best places.
...Meanwhile, on the main banner, the newest videos (which are basically never even close to the newest videos) are cut off on the right side of the screen.
Ask the tens of thousands of people in Latin America that get killed in drug gang wars every year what they think about it.I think all drugs should be legalized, but nothing justifies what the drug lords do.I don't support the death penalty for other crimes, but if there is one crime that justifies it, that's drug traffic.
How's his recovery going? I'm always happy to see other husband/wife team ups in Destiny! How are you guys going to decide who your third is for ToO?
The Cuban vote it strongly republican for older generations, and normalizing relations with Cuba only solidifies that. Otherwise, I don't think the Hispanic vote will be too much of a problem as long as the current differences between the parties remain status quo.
No. My evidence is mostly anecdotal because I never finished doing the research since it was for a subject I'm not majoring in, but people in eastern european countries didn't report knowing anyone with similar problems, excluding people who had suffered an injury of the brain through trauma or illness.Either that or they are just really polite about their friend's developmental years.Generally I think the alter ego trend thing (not the alter ego mental illness thing) is a trend like those angular S's  where it doesn't have a specific known starting point but it tends to be perpetuated by people who have access to the internet. But not necessarily the english internet, as I believe there are some people who do it in China, where they have their own internet.So Western meaning having similarities to Western Europe, not west of the atlantic.
He gets to grand finals by being a top player, not by being a good fox.  Most top players would agree that fox ditto's are too sporadic to be a true judge of skill, though that's arguable. But i believe he wins by having top player mentality, a.k.a he could get to that point in the tournament with any *viable* character that he has developed basic consistent tech skill with.
Bill Clinton got $600,000 from Achmea Health Insurance for one speech. Achmea is the insurance company that sued the Slovak Republic for voting for single payer and ti limit the insurance company's profits to 20 percent. The money was seized under investor-state clauses similar to the ones in the three pending TTIP and TISA and TPP FTAs. They seized approximately 20 million euros in "lost expected profits" from Slovakia's taxpayers.Basically after an FTA is signed, policy becomes a property right attached to the land, like in feudalism. 
I don't think being partners means you share everything, but when asked a direct question, you certainly answer it.Yes, he is hiding something. Yes, you have a right to be upset. No, you are not crazy. The core issue is not your lack of trust. The core issue is that he refuses to answer your question. He completely dismissed your concerns and invalidated your feelings. It is not a null argument if it matters to you. He does not get to decide that.I would bring it up again and explain that the way he is treating you is incredibly disrespectful and you deserve a straight answer. If he can't give you that, it will cause you not to trust him. He is clearly hiding something.
I couldn't agree more but your comment was abit off or hasn't made any contribution to the comment itself. Good sir i may have to downvote you. *tips hat*
I remember, in elementary school, one of our teachers mentioned that some Tibetan Buddhist Monks could keep their bodies warm while in extremely low temperatures.Reminds me of Freud. He described patients he saw, I think while working with Charcot, about how some patients would get so hot that they'd throw themselves into snow in the middle of winter. And then more recently, something about Japanese Zen Buddhism, where a master was saying that you should be meditating so hard that you sweat. Makes me think of Dune, and the control of the body through awareness, for some to such a degree that you stop aging (and maybe become a giant worm). AWARE!!!!
After years of playing MMOs, I've just accepted the whining as universal of all MMOs...never played one that doesn't have it. I just ignore it and have fun anyways
When my dad died my mom had bad dreams and was really sad. So I went to the store and got her this GIANT walrus stuffed animal. It had a tiny baby walrus attached that when you squeezed it, it woudl make walrus noises. (I don't even know why this is a thing) but my mom LOVED it. Slept with the pair every night and would squeeze the little walrus to make noise. When she moved she took off the little walrus to keep and gave me the big one. Big walrus is my bro. Best neck rest and fuzzy pillow of doom. And how many people can say they sleep with a walrus? 
well, to be fair, the guy is only 20 years old.  I'm sure with a couple more seasons he'll get a little calmer.  Plus they're trying not to get eliminated, so emotions are running high.
the one problem i have with every superhero show is the villian dying idk why like especially big season villians when they die it just makes me mad cuz now in the future it won't make sense.
He's also good at doing stupid crap off the field.  Honestly, I'd rather be up against him twice a season than Mariota.  I see Mariota as Russell Wilson 2.0
yes, however he figured out the southwest corner method to avoid chinning the mage/ranger and how effective it was with black chins as well as attacking boss between throws to avoid melee hits 
&gt;a "woman" with a penisWoman. No quotes, now you're just being bigoted. And if that's the case you're not worth discussing this with.I was a 14 year old girl, I wouldn't have to imagine. No one really "watched" me, they were kind of just there as I did my thing and they did theirs. Even if they had a penis, it wouldn't change that. I'm cool with lesbians watching me, I'm cool with straight girls watching me, what does their genitalia have to do with how they change? They get into the same clothes I do and use the same facilities. We don't separate bathrooms for the express purpose of trans people, so I don't see what this has to do with locker rooms. Trans people use the same bathroom as they pass like, so why not locker rooms?

My dorm had Unisex bathrooms. Stalls with walls open at the top, and showers too.Me (guy) and my friend (girl) would have peeing competitions when drinking. Whoever did pee the longest won. Sometime we would change it up and do 'loudest' or 'morse-code' pee contests too.

This thread is mostly based out of British men's opinions, so this whole "rule book" might be different in France. Don't be scared!I was suprised by this post too as here in Brazil people wear team shirts very often casually, but you still wouldn't wear one in formal situations though.

&gt;although if the libs had drawn up this exact same plan, it would be the worst thing everIf the libs had drawn up the plan they would still fuck it up with backroom bargaining and a lack of transparency. 
Note: if you are completely dry, you absolutely can touch across 12Vdc. It will not shock you. You won't even feel anything. The resistance of your body is so high that there is virtually no current.
Completely agree on that. They're getting a future 40 goal scorer for a present one in Pulkkinen for Kessel, two solid top 6 d-men for a top-4 in Smith and Ericsson for Phaneuf, a 1st for their future, and some potential trade bait in Kindl and Weiss. I wouldn't be surprised if it was easier to take Weiss and Kindl out and throw in the 3rd instead though.
No, it really isn't enough to carry you out of nova, not when you get blatant (prefire every time you peek, prefiring bait jumps) wall hackers, not to mention forgetting to check corners being a death sentence (I'm not hiko)Be real. You can't rely on aim to get out of a rank. I get 4ks on the rounds where I don't forget to check corners, where I don't run through smokes, where I don't get flashes, where I don't get prefired. But that is not every round. And every single one of those players out skilled me without out aiming me - positioning, nades, gamesense, anything.He corrected me, said I was wrong, when I know I am right - because my aim is NOT good enough to net me 3ks as consistently as I can on pistol rounds. Yet I still get them, every single time. I retaliated by giving actual REASONING as to why it works, why I am right, as compared to him saying, effectively "because that is the meta" as reasoning.
I was just curious about others' experiences. I got some 200 mg caffeine pills some weeks ago and I've been using them moderately, usually half a pill like 3 days a week, and when I don't use I don't notice any withdrawal symptoms. That's why I was curious about others' experiences. Sorry for the english but i'm pretty benzed out

So my grandpa died and I received this gun.  It is a Smith &amp; Wesson.  On the top of the barrel it reads "SMITH &amp; WESSON SPRINGFIELD MASS U.S.A. PAT'D JAN 17 &amp; 24 65&lt;new line&gt;JULY 11. 65 AUG 24 69 FEB 20 1877 REISSUE JULY 25  1872"Above the cylinder on the frame of the gun it has a 4 leaf cloverish looking thing and the text reads "PAT'D APRIL 20 76" and "DEC 18 1877" At the top of the grips there is the classic S&amp;W logo.  On the butt of the grip the serial # is 72377.Those are the only markings on the piece.  It is a 5 shot.  The ID of where you would put the bullets is about 8.5mm.Anyone have a clue what this thing is?
If and maybe, if he got straight on the road then maybe no-one would of caught up with him, but his small crew couldn't have faced off against much out in the open, they could have held winterfell against hundreds until reinforcements came, the problem is they didn't come. I don't think he would have be able to come and go as easily as Asha did if he had the stark boys with him.
This is NOT a patent of multisig. It is a patent of the specific details of the BitGo wallet. If we didn't have patents, we could easily become victims of bigger companies that do.

Hi. Thanks and yes, im the admin and still developing the site for almost 2 years now. XP efficiency is built in by tracking and using your 7 day best run. You'll need to populate the database by manually importing several times over the course of the week and it'll automatically give you an ETA with a piechart on the next 100 paragon level milestone along with actual required experience needed.Look some of the top paragon levelers profiles as examples and you'll see what I mean.You may level up using season and non season at the same time, the site automatically adds the two together.
How did the breeder know he's just a carrier for degenerative myelopathy?  Was he actually tested, or was the breeder extrapolating from bloodline?TBH, if you're looking for *any* corgi, you can probably find a non-show corgi for cheaper.  If you want *this* corgi, it's a fair price, but you can always try negotiating.  Depending on how bad you want him, I might throw out an offer for $800-$900 and see how the breeder responds.
Bit of a slow news day hey, oh no wait ISIS is still murdering refugees, a Russian space cargo ship is falling back to Earth and scientists discovered warp technology. But let's just fear monger and divert everyones attention from real news like always.

Kevin, i am a great fan of you, i'm 16 years old, from argentina and i have some questions for you. -Since a no so long time ago you said in a interview that in the third album will be "more pop, less rock". what made/makes changes your tests enough for do differente music? is that an individual experience or what?-What do you think about Mark Ronson put you on youtube like a collaborator in "Daffodils" when actually, you are the singer and higher collaborator of the song?-What do you think about Argentina? Do you know it? (not only Buenos Aires,of where i am not from)-And the last question: What are the music that do you hear now? do you hear pond? do you like the Nicholas Allbrook's music? i doThanks for reply, you are the best of the best! and i would love you follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/Endor_Moon
I agree and would champion the cause in terms of education and vocal opposition to what I see as animalistic behaviour. I think it's sick that people with power prey on the vulnerable and wish it never happened. I'm not so sure that education alone will solve the issue though. Some people just give zero fucks.
Yup, that's about it. PC mouse look toggle and auto attack was added, bugs fixed, classes balanced a bit. Still plenty of people online, but if you're looking for something new, you'll have to keep waiting for that free MP DLC pack to drop.
I think Bronn really did give him the opportunity to yield, though.  [Check this video at 2:35.](https://youtu.be/NN30YMzja6Y?t=145)For about 15-20 seconds, Ser Vardis has his sword arm stuck in position by Bronn, and Bronn looks up expectantly at Lysa Arryn, as though she might be about to call it.  We get enough time to see the reaction of several people that the fight is obviously over.  Ser Vardis just sits and waits, and then gets killed for not yielding.  With Brienne and Loras, it would have been insane not to offer a more explicit opportunity (although even in this example, it's implicit not spoken).  Loras was an important ally and the King's brother-in-law.  
A 50 year old male and a 21 year old female are still required to match the same scores to pass my academy.  In fact, I've got a guy in his 50's and 3 guys in their 40s in my class, and they're expected to keep up with the 21 year olds of the group.  I don't think it's discriminatory at all, especially in a day and age where everything is *supposed* to be about equality.  If you have different standards for each sex, how is it "fair"?
God, he's the best. He's far from a great comedian, but I watched Jack and Coke yesterday and found myself laughing a lot. I guess I just don't have enough Artie in my life...I miss waking up with him. Maybe I'll have to pay for that podcast...
Uhhh....are they implying that Obama should have resigned because the website was kind of slow for a couple weeks? Or are they saying he should have....walked into website headquarters and like shot himself or something? I'm really confused by this analogy.
*he nods figuring it might at least take your mind off things*Alright.. Well I got a lead on my parents, my real biological parents.. So I went out to try and track them down
All BMW "HP" bike production were limited production run, and I believe BMW sold all of the limited production of each series.  There were three HP2 models, the Enduro you mentioned, Megamoto and the Sport.
Unfortunately you'll never get a $150 million movie made with a young guy like that (see: Ender's Game).  You need a movie star, which makes the list very short, and even then it's a gamble as Edge of Tomorrow bombed in theaters and even Will Smith can't open a movie anymore.  Personally, I would've preferred Chris ~~Evans~~ Pratt, who did a SEAL in Zero Dark Thirty. 
Have you considered the Open Uni? I messed up my A Levels and I study at the Open Uni. It's cheaper and less work but you need to be dedicated at what you're doing and stay disciplined :) Plus there are no entry requirements.
Excellent! Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota are off the clock.  Now let's draft less popular people, but super talented guys, fly under the radar, and come out next season and whoop everybody's ass
Simple as far as ingredients go (egg yolks, butter, lemon) but technique wise it can be daunting. It's very easy for the sauce to break after you've been whisking for 15 minutes. 
Because the first thing I feel after playing a Witcher game is inadequacy in my monster hunting skills.  /s.No one wants to be Geralt. He's a great character, but he is a social outcast who is good for killing and not much else. So no. He's not a power fantasy, or an ideal, he's just a man with flaws. Also fuck you He-man is the shit.
You're right and I'm probably lying anyway. I think every comp player will want to hop right in once it comes out. There's an awkward issue in items being currently balanced for 12v12 that are broken in lower player counts like 6v6. Wrangler/Rescue Ranger for example. That would be hell to take down in 6s.I don't know what the solution is. Valve can't change the weapons to work for &lt;13 player games without completely changing the way items are currently "balanced" for 24 man servers.If teams are much bigger than 6v6 it loses a lot of hope of becoming an esport. It's tough enough to get 12 in a server in a timely fashion for online games as it is and LAN would be an organisational nightmare with more. Then you have to imagine people leaving games mid round.
I have.  It is fun if you dig single player RPGs.  Very moddable and customizable.  At the same time it didnt do it for me.  Something about it just didn't click.  Nothing wrong with it, and I completely see how people love it, but meh.
Yeah, the only other private one I know of is AnotherFNAF, but that ones not very elitest and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't count as a "cool kids club". (Then again I might be biased because I can go there.)
Ah. I'd think Lampard, too, would be gone. I don't think he can officially play until early June but I would think NYCFC would want him ASAP to begin training with the team. 
Yikes, I almost had to have that ~~fixed~~ replaced before. It had an issue finding the SSD for the longest time and the drive tested fine so they wanted to replace the MLB, I refused and replaced the drive myself and it fixed the issue of my macbook finding the SSD on bootup but this being an issue again makes me think you are correct! Might just hold off till they refresh the MBPr 15" and upgrade then. 
I've seen it.But let's pick one:&gt;Require Code of Conduct for US corporations abroadA code of conduct requiring what? Applying how, with what enforcement mechanism?
I'd like to see something like the ash warriors you talk to in DA:O who fight along side there mabari, I imagine it mostly be passive tho if it was a thing
I have a friend who is 29 years old and was in my science class (2nd top group) but the bottom class for maths. He was easily distracted and a bit annoying (despite being a good friend of mine). Loved WWF (when WWE was WWF) and was a bit daft. Did nothing after school and you'd think was going nowhere. He's on an access course and about to start an astro-physics degree.I'd tell him I'm really proud that he's doing that, but I don't know if that'd add pressure or whatever. You just can't predict somebody's potential like that at a young age when there are opportunities later down the line.
I know nothing about this game, but I think there's a character named Godot, whose theme is really awesome. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMnrl0tmd3kIt goes well with a fireplace and/or a bit of rain outside.
I feel like I'm out of the ordinary but I *love* tripping in public even goin and meeting random strangers is so fun but mostly I just like to skateboard around town when I trip
It happens. In my hometown, a girl had a baby the summer between seventh and eighth grade because her (female) cousin took her to a party where she got really drunk and when some twenty something year old guy advanced on her, her cousin either encouraged him or just let it happen (depends on who you talked to but the girl definitely didn't stop him from fucking her 7th grade cousin). The guy had like two other kids already and I think he went to jail. The girl actually became a bit wild after she had and kept the kid. Hosting a drinking party at 11am on a school day (my sister was her friend and they actually ran from the cops when it was busted) was her low point, imo. She eventually had another kid a couple years after her first but at least it was conceived consensually with someone her own age. 
I'm moving to Nevada and REALLY REALLY want to get a CCW permit....however, since I'm a pilot I convert everything I buy into Hobbs. For example: Gun + Permit = around $600 = around 6.0 Hobbs.So, if I got a gun for free (there **has** to be a government program for that) I'd do it....otherwise I can't really justify the expense right now...
So is there any real reason to go TWF when I can go sword and board with duelist and get better AC ~~and better damage?~~Edit: looked again, duelist is lower. 
Im kind of relieved at this point. It sounded like the only way it would happen is with a ridiculous overpay. Im glad Chip kept the presence of mind to not do that.
I suspect the red color might be for AIDs awareness?Edit: Why was I down voted? Many gay people (especially his generation) have lived through the AIDs epidemic in the 80s/90s and many lost a lot of their close friends. I think it is a highly likely possibility that there could be significance related to that.
Personally, I think it's just fun/comical to use hyperbole when describing reactions.I'm screaming.I'm crying blood.I'm literally flying off into the sun.
Personally, I find Qins can work fine if Arachne if you build her with it in mind. Albeit I dont always buy it, if I have the spare gold and a fair lead, I think I can risk it.However, something DOES need to be done to it. Whether they add the extra 1% or 2%  to it, or give it more attack speed, im not sure. In its current state, it is too weak.
lc training is more difficult than regular i think.  there are lots of complicated ev spreads.  stats are calculated different for level 5 pokemon as opposed to lvl 100  i found some more info on [smogon](http://www.smogon.com/dp/articles/little_cup_guide#EVs) which may be useful
Regarding Rebellion, I would've been happy if they'd taken the concept of the ending and done it End of Eva-style, as an "alternate version" of the end of the series. The fact that it was just the unnecessary, new, canon ending was what annoyed me, because it takes a totally different direction to the series. It was basically guaranteed to please everybody who didn't like the ending of the show, and piss off everybody who did. It's certainly divisive.
Welcome to life, some years will be better, some years will be worth, but it'll be a hell of a ride both good and bad.Oh, and Happy Birthday.  The day before my birthday this year features the end of my marriage.  Happy birthday to me I guess.
Don't worry! I deleted it because I forgot to before, I posted that while I was half asleep so it's a tad ridiculous heh. I think you make a good point about the rule though so I'll re-approve the link and leave it as is. Enjoy the up votes.
The chinese tests recorded much higher thrusts because the input power was much higher. The NASA tests still recorded measurable thrust but used more lower input power so the recorded thrust was very low.
Maritoa's actually on the phone with Chip and laughing saying "don't worry I'm just going to tell them I won't play there." Lol wait no he's a titan now sorry guys I knew that bums a lot of people out.  Now do we trade down? 
I think that's crazy but to me my now-husband and I actually talked about it before we got married and still will mention like "If you let yourself go and get super fat that's a deal breaker." where for a lot of people they think that's super horrible or whatever. For us that's just normal...we like being attracted/attractive and active together. It's probably just differences between more fit vs. nonfit people really :/ And unfortunately at this point it seems like a lot of people are more comfortable with being unfit than maintaining fitness.
Totally agree. You can make excuses by saying hes young and such but that was super dumb. Still feel a little cheated on by the refs because of the Bunleavy calls but we probably still would've lost.
The team was reportedly offering 3+ first round picks and players.... it could have gone either way.  Don't gloat like you had the inside scoop.  This entire offseason has been unpredictable, you got lucky.  Personally I think you're crazy for committing to an answer at all.
Endings elude me and I was not particularly happy with this one. I think I'll write my next piece backwards and see how it pans out, but that's why I love these challenges. They really lay bare your weak points so you know what to work on. Thanks for reading and I'm glad you enjoyed the character conflict. That alone makes me happy because its something I'm working really hard on in my bigger projects.
Since no one has answered this very explicitly I thought I'd fill in the gap for you.I can't speak for Vince's reasoning, but I interpreted the blue meth as an ode to the main Pseudo cooking method during the rise of methamphetamine called "The Farmer Blue" Cook.This cook is a 1-step reduction of pseudo ephedrine to Methamphetamine, using Anhydrous Ammonia and believe it or not LITHIUM! It's a redox reaction (I believe) but was large in Indiana (where I'm from) because how readily available Anhydrous Ammonia is due to our Farmland. Lithium ion in solution caused the solution to turn a deep Royal blue, thus the name of that cooking style, and My interpretation as to why the meth in BB was blue.Source: I'm a Chemical Engineer from the former Meth capital of the U.S. and my Orgo teacher loved to use meth as an example.
*Another* Zelda character clone? Absolutely not.Pichu Bros.? Not only does that not exist, there's Plusle and Minun.MB? I'll be damned if the latest Metroid newcomer comes from OM. Purple Space Dragon or Metroid Prime first.
As I understand it, Gretsch has no American made instruments, outside of maybe a very small custom shop for high-profile clients. All of their high-end production models are manufactured in Japan.
My dad was a teacher. He once described one of his students to me as being built like a brick shithouse. I think that was meant to be complimentary. I was the same age as that girl. It was creepy. 
If you don't mind a slightly unhelpful answer: they're not. Fiancé/fiancée and brunet/brunette are both fairly commonly used as gender-specific terms, and I'd not be surprised if there are a few others too (though none are coming to mind right now). Of course you can still ask what it is about those that led to the masculine/feminine distinction being retained in English and it's a very legitimate question (which I'd answer for you if I had any compelling explanation, sadly I don't). 
You don't know what it's like to go out looking for a disabled park, find they're all full and have to resign to going home because you can't make it in from anywhere else.  I know your question came from a genuinely curious place, but you don't seem to appreciate how crucial those spaces are. When you need them you really need them.
There's actually something a lot worse. I'm on my phone so I CBA to recall the name but its a explosive, it increases metabolism by 1.5, you sweat buckets. Have to change sheets when sleeping as they get soaked. So dangerous that milligrams overdoses can happen
If you get Frontier, get your own modem/router combo. The free ones they provide are horrible.Buying your own will cost around $150, but will be much more reliable.

Once again, thank you so much!I found a premade adventure which I will use to start out.  I have another question (sorry!):When an adventure says "With a successful DC10 Wisdom (Perception) check, ________," am I supposed to prompt the players to roll the check or am I supposed to let them figure it out on their own?
I know it's not in those three locations, but Cafe Solstice in Capitol Hill is my go-to. In fact, I'm writing this from there as I speak. Good beers, good food, good coffee, good working space. For Ballard, the first thing that comes to mind is Ballard Coffee Works. Beer and coffee, but the seating situation is pretty bad unless you get there early. 
You don't love feminism when you bring a greasy attack like this. Also in any scholarly discussion of feminism the good ol' feminism you miss is often racist and class based and *modern* feminism is one that tries to be inclusive and multidimensional. Like you say you love feminism and equality, but you fire shots that are flatly gross. Fat idiots? Go fuck yourself. False rape accusation? Go fuck yourself is you think that's a goal of modern feminism. Like if you sincerely believe that feminism promotes false rape accusations you don't support feminism. Your entire post is just condescending bullshit.

when i was younger my orthodontist had an N64, super smash bros, and 1960'S-1980's #1 hits playing (think AC/DC and Def Leopard.) Also allowed his patients to submit professionally done photos of their "final product" smile. awesome office, awesome guy.
The hiring gripe is legitimate.  The other complaints are not.  When you do business in a community, you ought to be hiring from within that community when possible - it's the best way to run a city and economy.  Otherwise you end up in an untenable situation that takes money out of the local economy instead of recirculating it.Edit: a legitimate gripe doesn't justify looting.  It does justify and explain feelings of anger and resentment.  If a shop won't hire your kids but is hiring kids that live in a different neighborhood, that leads to resentment.
lallana was the player i was most excited for out of our signings. such a shame that he's barely featured. if he stays healthy BR HAS to start him every game. to do otherwise would make me lose all my faith in BR. 
What does your fiance do? Do you know this girl? What's her relation to your fiance?&gt; I thought being together as partners meant we shared everything.LOL, OK. If that's true, why were you concerned to not appear as though you were snooping?You're entitled to privacy, even in a relationship.
That is one thing that most people miss. They see a slice of reddit, a slice mostly of their own choosing.And they believe that is all of reddit. I used to suffer from this until I frequented some more obscure subs (Shout Out /r/dwarffortress!) that I realized exactly how different the article and content pools we drew from daily really were.  While /r/thebutton has garnered a moderate amount of external media, it certainly hasn't 'gone viral' to the degree that even some moderately successful youtoube videos have. Mainly because redditors don't often cross-pollinate their media source pools. Well, besides reaping likes off facebook from last night's /r/adviceanimals frontpagers. If this lasts much longer, either it will get a lot of exposure of everyone will move on. I guarantee there are people who spend 10 hours a day on the internet that don't know, nor ever will hear of, /r/thebutton. And I'm really quite fine with that. 
I know it would be either/or. But the real draw if Fleksy for me is the insanely awesome autocorrect it has. If I could have that + gesture typing, I would be fine giving up the other gesture features. I'm not saying everyone should feel that way; it's just my opinion. If they did implement gesture typing, it would have to be an optional feature so you could turn it off. 
I tend to stick to top loading packs to avoid zipper issues. I'm currently using a Jansport I got in 8th grade to carry to work. It got me through highschool, college, lots of hikes, and after a few years without much service it is being carried on my walk to work. I have fixed some loose stitches over the years but otherwise all is well for a fairly cheap pack. 
make millions here and suck ass cuz the support structure sucks and the coaches suck, or make millions there and then get a second contract because im lighting it up.its all relative man, of course it's a lot of money to us so it seems crazy. to them that's how their life is now.
Les protections très avancées de locataires et de squatteurs sont la raison principales pour laquelle des millions de logements restent en dehors du marche. La rareté fait augmenter les prix. Et voila pourquoi beaucoup sont sans-abris.En bref, on crée son propre enfer. Et comme la situation est humainement intenable, on ajoute plus de protection, ce qui fait encore plus peur aux propriétaires. Qui se braquent encore plus. Rinse, repeat.J'ai été bailleur a Paris pendant 12 ans. Plus jamais. On m'a fait des coups foireux inimaginables. Maintenant mes apparts sont sur airbnb ou loués a de la famille ou des amis proches.
I personally like a little bit of Guinness in mine. Not exactly the most helpful tip, but I just thought I would share. I make them like that at my work and have heard nothing but compliments.
You should seek out hardware diagnostic tools.  Rolling back the drivers is a good first step, but hardware always degrades very slowly and is a pain in the ass when it comes to troubleshooting as all the symptoms look very similar.There is a program that tests GPU &amp; CPU, a program that tests RAM that you boot off a CD with that you burn it to, and programs that can test hard drive integrity.  PSU can be stress tested, but if you're comfortable using a volt meter that is also a possibility, just be careful.  That covers all the hardware.Do you have an NVIDIA card?  If not it might be drivers, yeah.  You can always try reformatting too.  Try disabling anti-virus temporarily.  Try a virus scan.  Seems like that covers potential software conflicts if drivers were the only recent installation before the crashing began.When my PSU was going south I'm pretty sure it was just one game that was occasionally crashing, similar to your situation.Either way, good luck.
No, that's untrue.I was there.  I explained it in another comment, but I was a sophomore at USC at the time and worked nights for UPS in Vernon, which is just east of downtown.The LAPD did **not** just single out Koreatown.  The LAPD *abandoned the entire city.*  So, yes, there was no LAPD in Koreatown.  But Koreatown was not unique.  The Koreans were just as fucked as *everyone else in Los Angeles.*  Yes, it sucked for them and it sucked for everyone else.  I have a lot of respect for LA's Korean community, but they were in the same situation as everyone else.The LAPD hid out at Parker Center and didn't do shit for *anyone.*  Not the Koreans, not the Chinese, not the Japanese, not the Mexicans, not the blacks, not the whites, not fucking anyone.  The Koreans were not singled out.
Yep: now define *sexual morality*.  Still OK to force a girl to marry her rapist?  Make a man marry his brother's widow?Cut your own nuts off (which is weird, I distinctly remember a prohibition against having wrecked-up junk and being allowed in church) or get married if you are not man enough to do that?Where does your *morality* stand on getting your serving girl pregnant, or having multiple wives?  Or are we not to emulate the patriarchs?And what *does* the bible say about judging others?  (and by denying them rights, are you not judging them? Have you not weighed them and found them wanting?) Any wiggle room there you want to talk about?

2 months definitely seems too soon to come from relatively nothing. I realize it's only been five years since high school, but you should definitely give some shorter lengths to see how you do. I disagree with trying to run 16 miles when you've never run it before and your bone strength/muscles haven't been up to the task in a while. Do a 5K today, a 10K in two days, another 5K in two days, another 10K in two days. If you can get through that battery, you should be able to move further up. The thing is, even though you've been lifting, it's still a lot of stress on your bones, which is why training programs don't recommend a 10% gain in distance week over week.So, see where you're at first, then move up. Only you'll be able to determine that and you'll need to be as honest with yourself as possible.

Well I can't keep the finger off the trigger on my stick in any comfortable way. I also usually change group after a kill. However I have accidentally, not on purpose, changed group and not realized it. It happens. It might not happen to you, but it happens.Let's move away from the "how" and just focus on the "what happens" for a bit. If you, or I, get a 400 cr bounty from some accident, you are now blacklisted from RES hunting in all systems controlled by that faction for a week (unless the new high intensity RES sites are different you can't hunt in one while wanted).Do you feel that's a reasonable punishment for any 400 cr crime? Remember that some minor factions are quite large as well.
The Empire have a very sophisticated translating droid that analyzes speech patterns and deciphers the language from there. It's what allowed them to make contact with the Tribes.
Firstly read the reddit guide regarding how to post code so others can read it (hint look at formatting help button)OK you have the main menu.  The next step is to work out what you want the user to see when they press 1.  Code this section until it works the way you want.Then move onto what happens when they press 2 etc

Sometimes poop is way worse. Like, if I say "there's a bunch of shit on my desk" one assumes I have a messy desk. If I say "there's a bunch of poop on my desk", one assumes I have literal poop on my desk.
Third to last kid is right, though.  Compared to what we have now, it absolutely is a piece of junk.  Battery guzzler, pisspoor screen, pisspoor sound quality.  Only good thing about it was the durability.  Just because you're nostalgic for something doesn't mean it's not become a piece of junk as time goes on.  Because its only use now is nostalgic gaming.

I was getting about 6-10MB/s....Amusingly: I live in a college apartment building, and we had crappy old networking hardware. I was getting about 300-600KB/s. They replaced all of our network hardware the day before the game came out, and I still had 15 hours left on my download. They turned the new connection on and the download time went down to 2 hours.
I read through the Grand Jury documents. The defendant was absolutely allowed to present his side of the story; the prosecutor asked questions specifically designed to let Wilson tell his side of the story.
Best anime ever right here, my #1 favorite of all time. However, you really have put on your thinking cap when watching it, if you just go with the flow you might end up unsure of what's going on. Never expect sudden revelations explaining everything, BUT the answers are all there throughout the show, albeit open to interpretation. You've gotta figure it out and piece it together. A complex and deep plot, psychological and existential themes, and a dose of mindfuck, Lain is Lain. If you haven't, please comment in these daily threads, even if it's not much! Rewatches are always best when everyone's speaking their minds.

As a Sidenote, I think it is common courtesy to check a sidebar before posting in any sub. Mods do what they do out of the goodness of their heart and I imagine it would be incredibly frustrating to see your workload increased because people don't check the rules before posting. I don't think everyone should read every sidebar of every sub they visit, but if you're posting in a sub there are almost always rules for it and people should make sure to at least familiarize themselves with them

The Chicago Municipal Code sets specific requirements for living spaces.  Including requirements for minimum window area compared to dimensions of occupied space, relationship of windowless rooms to nearby windowed rooms --- especially in below grade rooms like your 'garden,'  number and location of exits to the outside (not just to other rooms), ceiling height, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.... They can get slightly complicated.  Recommend you talk with one of the several tenant organizations.  Be ready to supply accurate information on the things I've listed.
Not going to lie I wouldn't complain if Jnco came back in style.  Shit was comfortable and I loved the space but then again I would look stupid at the age of 26 even if they came back. 
You're still young. The more you have sex with different people with different tastes and ideas of sex, the more open you'll become to different things, and potentially develop more kinks and fetishes. 
I would love Mario Golf: World Tour for the 3DS! I never expect golf games to be fun, but I keep hearing how great it is and would love to be able to just open my system up on the train or on-the-go for a short match.Thanks for doing this btw!
Technique-wise the guns look pretty good and suitably Tau like. The faces could use a bit of Cadian Fleshtone wash to darken the features and add some depth.and I noticed some mold lines at a few points that could do with some trimming. I like the color scheme, the contrast and practicality of it really suits the Tau.Lore-wise I was under the impression that humans assimilated into the Tau Empire weren't allowed to use Fire Caste weapons and maintained their own weapons like las guns and such. Also since they are no longer loyal Imperial subjects you should probably remove the Imperial Aquila on their helmets and armor. The rule-of-cool of course trumps all of that and means that you have a very cool, very Tau unit.
Google Keyboard is good.. but I just switched to [Fleksy](http://fleksy.com/) and there's no going back. I was using Swype stlye keyboards and those are okay for one handed operation, but for all out speed, Fleksy can't be beat. It's autocorrect is the best I've used and it's very intelligent but it also doesn't get in the way. You can use the compact mode with a swipe left/right for space and up/down for changing/deleting words, or you can set it up like a standard keyboard with the spacebar, number row, delete keys, etc. It has improved my typing speed and accuracy a lot.
Oh I see, I read your comment wrong.  Just curious, if a black man had went to court and won the right to drink out of a "whites only" drinking fountain would that be an illegitimate win?
This was really cool to try.. Things like this honestly make computer science seem cool and like another major that I might be interested in.. But who knows.  I used to take art classes and I found that the best way to draw a good circle was to use your wrist and to move the paper as well. If you're practicing drawing circles then drawing a bunch really fast helps with that I think. 
Thanks! Yeah fighting games aren't for everyone, but we hope to make the new game fun for beginners with a depth that will be challenging for the more competitive player. I mean that's most every game developer's dream but I have to say it anyway  :)
My ex would always throw a fit if I liked anything, be it a comment or a picture I liked. If any females were involved, she would throw a fit. Meanwhile, if I brought up the 12 random guys who liked Selfie #40 I was a controlling piece of shit because they're "Just likes" it's not like she was trying to date them, they liked her pictures she didn't like theirs. She didn't see how that would be an issue.

You are allowed to request a bench trial as a defendant. Yet most defendants want the jury. The tired /r/serialpodcast insult "hope you are never on a jury" doesn't really jive with reality.

No-participation mode is an entirely community-created thing; before we start supporting it officially, we'd need to figure out a bunch of community and technical things.I tend to approach this particular problem primarily from a user education perspective, but maybe you're right and it'd be useful special-casing to do.  Anyways, it's not really a *bug*, but we'll keep thinking about it.

if the alternative is getting sued by the content owners (i.e the EPL) for breach of contract then I'm sure it makes sense to turn those customers away.  If they willingly sell to UK customers, the EPL is pretty unlikely to renew the contract when it next comes up.

[This is Jeb](http://i.imgur.com/laKCrDm.png) from the first time I ever got him to Mun. It was a happy day.In the beginning of KSP, there were only three Kerbals: Jeb, Bill, and Bob. Jeb was always the first one assigned to your ships, and the others would follow if you needed more crew. This means that everyone who's been playing KSP for a while has spent a *lot* of time with Jeb. Mostly blowing him up.The thing about Jeb is he literally has a different personality from everyone else. Throughout your missions, you have a little face cam that show your Kerbal's reactions. Jeb is *always* thrilled with whatever is going on. Unless death is *eminent*, you'll never see a hint of fear on Jeb.And that's why people love him. After all the countless times we've blown Jeb up, and slammed him into planets, and doomed him to orbit the sun for centuries, he's still [smiling like a madman](http://i.imgur.com/eDIkvJA.png).

Lucky you, I have to study Japanese by myself with 3 different textbooks as there's no Japanese module in my university xD I already know about 150 kanji, without counting the ones I learned on the Internet without writing them down on a flashcard, and basic grammar points, but the road before being able to hold an actual conversation with Japanese people is still long! Also I may suggest you the browser plugins Rikaichan (Firefox)/Rikaikun (Chrome) if you do not know them, they are excellent for learning kanjis, reading names, and such!頑張れ!

You can write a compiler in any language.  The first assemblers were written in machine code, and the first compilers were written in assembly language, but once you've got that done a fairly standard procedure is to write a minimal compiler in a different language and then use that compiler to compile your real compiler, which is written in the language you're compiling.  For example, GCC and compile C++ (amongst other things) and are written in C++, and GHC compiles Haskell and is written in Haskell.

This is really a matter of trade off. You must delay a couple of buildings momentarily to do this.

If they weren't different, then `_` itself would have to change meanings. E.g.    let x: Option&lt;String&gt; = ...;    match x {        Some(_) =&gt; {}        None =&gt; {}    }shouldn't move `x`, but if `_` were to behave like `_guard` (i.e. bind to the value) then it would be forced to move.
The NDP is also refusing to tax it and the Liberals have refused to tax it for the last 100 years even though banning it was just as bad of an idea back then as it is today, but you guys sure do love to put all the blame on conservatives.

I understand your question, I think people are missing the point.Like everyone stated there is a LOT under the hood going on, but little in regards to building a larger community which kind of sucks. I've gone to the local game shop and most play MtG and have no clue about Hex, or haven't seen anything yet so it's not even in their mind. Same thing with my Hearthstone friends, they think Naxxaramas and Blackrock are these awesome PvE aspects and the game is super deep, and won't give Hex a chance because they've only heard of it through what I tell them.We need youtube videos, ads, a commercial,  articles on game sites, SOMETHING more than currently is out to get more people to know and get hyped for what I think is a great game with an already growing community. I like Hearthstone a lot too but I think it could be usurped if only more people even streamers started trying it out. Especially the hearth 'pros'

As /u/juliancolton suggested, find a better angle. Personally instead of bringing the lens just downward, I would walk about 4-5 paces to the right, so you are shooting it down below, while also having a bit of the side of the plane in focus as well. This really boosts the "grandeur" feeling of the subject, as you are shooting from below, and to the side so it really sticks out as a big, metal plane, plus it makes for a very eye pleasing photograph with a clear, defined subject!Hope this helps!
Yeah. I followed her on vine for like a day or so. She posts vines at least once an hour and it got to be a little too much for me. A few of hers are really hilarious though.

He does a lot of self-plugging/promotion or whatever you want to call it in this thread.&gt;I'm an established Community Hunter&gt;good friends with a handful of RT employees.&gt;an RT Employee unfollowed me.&gt;  I actually applied and was interviewed for a position recently at the company
Python and Java and c are high level languages, designed with their own compilers.  At some point, someone made a compiler in the actual assembly language the computer understands, but that's horribly inefficient now that that's been done. 
I'm not ruling it out.  I am in a new city (Miami), which has a shady reputation and I don't have a relationship with any shop.  However, I researched the place and it was reputable.  I am no expert, but something did seem to wrong with the amp.  I watched him run all the tests.  If it was powering on, I would have known.
Depends of the matchup. Usually you want Chows, Bots, Musters, Technician. Sometimes keeping shredder is also good since it's the only real 4 drop. Keeping combos like Muster + Quartermaster is also good.Always keep in mind that usually board control is quite important on this deck because of Vigil and Drake. That's why I use double chow.
Can do, but by the time the Averages article comes out the PR thread will tend to get lost far down the page as it would be 4-5 days old unless it's promoted w/in the sub.
It was an FMV they added to the PS1 port. [It looked pretty awesome for the time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL_U-rPpZAk).Or maybe you mean the N64 demo, which looked... [I guess tolerable for an N64 game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPO7c_XmesU).
Right? I feel like this is a very strange demographic they're targeting. I looked up the brand and they're trying to market it as "just as good as milk with the health benefits of almonds" but like.. almond milk does that already?
Rick Mercer douchey? Seriously? Everyone I've ever spoken to that has interacted with him in any way mentions how genuine he is. No feedback on the other two but I find it hard to imagine that Brent Butt is looking for an asskicking somewhere.
Caps fans, let's not get our panties in such a wad so early. We're winning, calls are in our favor, there's actually nothing to complain about. Except the announcers, they suck all around.
1. i think i started watching about three days after TPP red started, back in 2014. it's been a wild year!2. ...[nervous sweating] video games? drawing?3. i'm from america.4. my favorite subject is japanese!5. chocolate chip cookie dough.6. a horse sized duck? i can probably outrun a horse sized duck (i hope).7. for some godforsaken reason, i have 5,542 100x100 icons. i've only used about 100 over the years, and i thought i only had about 3k until today. i don't know why i have 5k icons or where i even got them from.
For God sakes someone restrain that bear.ahh I see you know a thing or two about forced perspective you a fan of the lord of the rings films there bud?
I just realized that Hinata and Naruto have an entry, and Naruto and Sasuke have an entry, but no Naruto and Sakura (Hell, no Sakura and Sasuke either). As someone who witnessed the shipping wars first hand, that is fucking hilarious. 
I went to a catholic school. In 2nd grade I had a math teacher (who was a nun, mind you) tell us all that we did so bad on our math tests that our parents would shoot us when we got home. Why do teachers think statements like this are alright?
Go fuck yourself, grandma. Your confirmation bias is ridiculous. It's not cross dressing that makes these people violent. It's a combination of environment and genetics and much more complicated than, "men in dresses are violent lol."
Sweet, that makes 75 bullets, hopefully that will be enough.  With all of these dogs following me, I should give the party a dog themed name. Hmm.. what about "Ruff and Tumble"? That should work.  New party name: Ruff and Tumble (Lily, StuffedDogSprite, Bubby)  With my party in tow and my gun at the ready, I lead on towards the Dolphin's village.
Hmm, I had some habitual-eating tendencies as well. I ate whenever I felt like it, basically, and didn't keep track of/care what I ate. Intermittent Fasting really helped me curb that - have you given that a thought/try?I can tell you anything you would like to know about it, I did it for 3 months straight with relative ease and would recommend it to anyone.
When you use him you'll see why he is rated 99. If you have a chance to get him, you should, because none of the players from the upcoming TOTS will be better than him, but maybe his TOTS which I assume would be 98 would be very very close, but who knows, I may be wrong.
One thing about Rio is that the "less nice" and "nice" areas are often very close to each other. In some places there's literally a wall separating them. There's a bunch of smaller favelas around Ipanema and Copocabana, which is where all the tourists end up. And Rocinha, one of the largest favela in the city (and the location for the favela tracking shot in The Incredible Hulk), is right next to São Conrado, which is where the English football team stayed last year, so one of the nicer areas. I spent five months living in Tijuca last year. It's definitely an interesting city. :)
The physical laws respect causality and the integrity of information. If you shoot someone with a gun killing them, this event should be the same for all observers. We may disagree on times and distances, but we'll all agree that the even occurred.
Well I didn't downvote ya... id take a screenshot, but I dont really give a shit if you believe me. Realistically why do you care about fake internet points that hold no real value? Why even bring that up?And I dont have a defeatist view of the world at all. You dont even know me. In fact... I love my life and the world very much. I just have a realistic knowledge how politics work and I understand that money controls all of it. Campaign promises mean shit and the political landscape is very corrupt wherein if you have enough money, you can make about anything happen. If you really think you and I can change this country for the better by getting out and voting, you are a fool.... and THAT is sad - because you and people like you are blind to the fact that you will never change anything. So go out and work your 9-5, pay your taxes, do your voting, then come home and watch your netflix and keep being a cog in a well-oiled machine that keeps you the slave you are. Take it easy bud.

He said in an interview Carlisle was uptight and plays head games with younger players. I wouldn't doubt Carlisle is at the top of his most hated coaches. I don't think they liked each other much.As a Mavs fan, I can see the uptight comment making sense. I think Carlisle only smiles when he's making fun of reporters during press conferences. Lol
Boh, ho guidato varie volte a Napoli e provincia e non so perchè ma mi piace più che guidare al nord. Almeno lì ti aspetti qualsiasi cosa, dal motorino che si fa in mezzo al traffico la rotonda in contromano al tizio che spegne e parcheggia la macchina mentre è in fila
Honestly I would love 3 "free" basic skin recolors to go along with any of the higher tier skins. I dont like that i basically have to choose between 1 good skin or 2 *ok* skins and a recolor for some champions
Some of them probably do, but on that list it looks like Scotty Victor might do it for free.  This place does it for donations: http://honeybeekind.com/rescue-removal/  These people might do it for free or be able to point you to a free resource: https://www.facebook.com/CTXBeeRescue
Thanks!  I test road a bunch of bikes (street triple, 821 Monster, FZ-09), and this one was just so much fun to be on.  What was it that turned you away from it?
I'm sorry to bother you, but what is the context of the link? I cannot find it via a simple "goop from that guys irradiated skin" google search. It looks like there are maggots? Is the radiation (irradiation?) for medical purposes (cancer?)? Or was it to address the maggot problem? I don't want to bother you but I am very curious.
i got steam through a retail copy of half life 2 way back in the day... i've since lost/misplaced and can't find said copy. but i still have that and all the other games for a decade. plus lack of reselling means me and my friends all still have all the great co-op /multiplayer games to play whenever we so choose or get nostalgic.
Yeah, the CompletionPercentage_Controller triggers UFO when you hit 100%, which then starts up the two ambient UFOs (through ambient_UFOs script) and the UFO_EYE, which is the script which ensures that you meet the right conditions for the UFO above the mountain.Unfortunately, that looks like that's all there is.  Three UFOs (the sunken one looks to be just a landmark), and they seem to be represented in the mural.Sucks...
If that's true, you should be able to slow anything accelerated by this device by simply turning it off and waiting, even in a vacuum, even without a nearby gravity source.
I live in this town and can confirm, this isn't gonna be covered up very easily at all. Only thing that could have done it was if the story stayed local given the PD's political power in town, but now that it's out of their hands they really have no power in the matter. 
Interesting!  I just noticed it on a lunchbox my girlfriend got me and was curious.  Google was surprisingly no help, any sort of link you could provide?It made me think of how butthurt people were with the added hilt for the new movie.
I think it should, at least for some characters, I wouldn't want every character to be with someone else.That being said I think they should develop the relationship naturally, and not so..... high-schoolish like the ships right now (I get that Beacon is basically High school but i digress.) Like Arkos, they're developing it at a nice pace, and I like the couple.Eclipse (I think that's what SunXBlake is called) was kinda forced to me, but I think it's good enough to at least TRY to go somewhere. As for Iceberg... I hope to God it doesn't last long. If it does then at least give me SOME substance. 
It not really the NDP stepping up, most every party would do it.I think its a fair point about the influencing, especially seniors. I've never take the ride myself, and would be interested to learn about the experience. That being said, I think we have to accept and hope that voters have the willpower not to just vote for whoever spoke to them last.My motto is, call the party you like least; waste their time and gas!
Keep digging. Why do you think it's badass? What specifically do you like about the changes? What do you think the intent of the original design was? What would you do differently? One of the first things I always do when making a comparison is ask "why"?For example, the new battle sprites look great. The contrast is well-done and the details are well-executed. The models work especially well because they are the highlight of the scene. *Why?* In battle, all I'm focused on are my players and enemies; the background is intentionally insignificant. High levels of technical execution and design unity make for a good change.Compare this to how I listed my reasons for disliking the field characters in my other response to you.
I'd have liked her more if they hadn't shoehorned her romance with Chakotay in at the last second. They barely had any time to bond, yet he killed himself over her... 
You don't feel the need to cover it up all that well when you think you're winning.  It only becomes a pressing concern when you suddenly realize that the other side is going to hang you when they see what you've done. 
Amiibo: any please :) (i have link and Kirby)In Box or Out of Box: doesn't matter to me.Packaging: CanadianReason: i am a high school student who loves Nintendo with a passion. i want to get into amiibo collecting, but do not have a job, and school hour always cause me to miss pre-orders. i love amiibo because they add cool little bonuses to the game, but i have a hard time finding them, especially since Canada gets such little supply. thank you for holding this contest and giving everyone an opportunity. yo da real M.V.P
It depends on the type of bug. Most bugs that come with an Runescape update is either some balancing error or something along those lines. Hardly anything gamebreaking, and something which can be fixed in a week.
Viewing parties are a blast! I've been going to them for the past 6 years all over the area. I've won pucks, tickets, sticks, and a team signed jersey.
You might be able to make it work without the assumption of continuous differentiability, but I'm not sure. Weird stuff happens when you don't assume it (like partial derivatives not commuting). I'm ***guessing*** that your book/teacher actually means for f to be smooth or at least C^1 and is only not saying so explicitly, just because it would be mean of them not to at the level of early undergraduate math.
It's still obnoxious. Load single player, launch a friends only server, invite friends to server, friends load server, Launch job, load job lobby, invite friends, friends load your lobby, load job again, complete job, everyone kicked back out, load into free mode, start again all over. I don't know why they wouldn't add a "next mission" option for heists. &gt;50% of the time me and my friends spend doing heists is loading and setup.
Do we really, really need a quarterback. Hear me out. What if, we just never, ever, ever throw the ball. Except maybe some trick plays. We'll pound it into field goal range and boot one through like we always do - and score some on defense. That extra spot could be all kindsa nasty, extra blocker, extra back. The role of receivers changes.Let's just not have a QB, cuz fuck it go Browns!
&gt; drifting too far away from empirical evidence into ideologically biased assumptions,For all we know this might have been a valid criticism of the paper. These "Gender bias in X" papers often do get a bit ideological.To attribute this flaw to their gender though is completely out of line. It scares me that someone with attitudes like this is reviewing scientific papers.
I'll be sure to post it as soon as it's complete :3 even though it'll probably be December of this year haha!  I don't even have an idea for that one yet...
I had family do the same thing. I stutter the first consonant of each sentence when I get flustered. They imitate me and talk over me when I do it, even when I was excited I was announcing I got an internship in my field. It sucks, man. 
Calling a tipped wage a living wage is a joke. It's not a reliable source of income and you often won't make min. wage on slow nights.I do agree that Europeans should look up local tipping customs, and though tipping makes me profoundly uncomfortable and I seriously disagree with the way wait staff are paid, I do tip when visiting the US. But seriously. Tips do not and absolutely should not make a living wage. They're supposed to be an extra for good service, not a way for businesses to fuck over their staff.
So levelized cost  per MWh stored?  Or is the dynamic more complex than that?Although Aquion might have the edge depending on how crazy EPA regulation around grid scale storage gets.
&gt;but it does put fault on the victim based on her actions.I mean it blames the victim for becoming the girl who those guys decided to rape, as opposed to some other girl. It doesn't blame her for the rape occurring, or take the blame off of the rapists. &gt;All this sort of advice does is work to make the victim feel at fault and work to make people blame the victim because, again, she should have known better.I've never seen anyone actually be harsh on a rape victim and say that it was their responsibility to prevent the rape. That would just be super rude. Even when something is completely someones fault people usually aren't that harsh.I think the idea is that it will make other women more careful in the future. I don't think the mayor was trying to say anything about this case specifically, whose fault it was, or what the victim should have done. 
We just commissioned a local furniture maker for a desk in our office that we are redoing.  We love it.  Custom made to our space and (as of now) no one else owns one exactly like it. Very grateful for skilled artisans that live nearby! 
Some of the reverse gifs in this thread honestly mess with my head. I understand that it's reversed and I understand the physics and whatnot; just the thought that some things that look relatively normal regularly, can look so insanely odd and unreal backwards. It just blows my mind
I think I came across too brash to some people are you by any chance in the south I live in South Florida if you're nearby I'd love to do some projects
I'm a huge fan of habichuelas rosada, Puerto Rican pink beans. They were a big reason I eat beans now. I'll give you my quick and easy (as opposed to long and more traditional) recipe.You need 2 cans goya pink beans drained, frozen goya sofrito, small can goya tomato sauce, goya sazon, goya jamon  (basically ham bullion, can use cooked bacon or salt pork), garlic, few olives, adobo, and a starch like potato, sweet potato, or pumpkin. Add beans and sauce to saucepan, add 2 tablespoons sofrito, olives, and cook on medium heat until warm. Add the sazon, jamon, adobo (1/2 tsp) and 1 or 2 tomato sauce cans of water. This determines how thick or thin your sauce will be. Chop your starch to 1 inch cubes, add to pot, bring to a boil and simmer for 20 min or until starch is soft. Serve over rice. Delicious!If you want the traditional recipe, or I also have an amazing Cuban black bean recipe (with dried beans) I can post for you.
yeah, I'm going to just bow out, because you don't seem open to entertaining anything other than your view on everything.  But you will either be right or wrong in 17 hours (assuming that you count the start as the start time of the button), and then you will either be the eggy one, or not.
In a few thousand more hours you may see a tubby psycho midget, those are by far the most rare tubby. Joltzdude and morninafterkill haves videos on them
&gt; That's the sort of talk that makes people think that all you do is buy good gear and that makes you take good photos.actually, the point that it makes is that even with good gear, you kind of have to know how to use it -- they're *not* going to get good photos handed a professional camera, particularly not one set in manual.
It is important to realize what type of data you are dealing with. A paired T-test is useful if you are dealing with a measurement. For example you want to see if the same ants on day 1 are the same size on day 2. You would label and measure each ant on day 1 and again on day 2 and use a paired t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the measurement of the ants between the two days.
True, good point, /u/gamingrigthrowaway46 your monitor supports a fancy nvidia technology that you probably want.But damn the 290Xs are cheap. For that price you could only get a single 980. Tough choice. 
That's not true. If you're found guilty you usually will pay back whatever your profited + a fine.  And then you are held liable for civil action as well. However, many white collar crimes end in settlements because the prosecution knows the evidence they have may not hold up in a court. An since those cases are criminal they deserve the same scrutiny in court as anyone else does, that is, having the burden of proof on the prosecution.If it is a civil procedure, they can settle or the court can assign partial liability for the charges if the evidence is not strong enough. 
&gt; Sleep doesn't may not give people the "rush" of feeling like they're actively doing thingsI am going to venture  aguess and say you don't have kids.Sleeping is a huge rush.
I hope almost all of you watch the ADCL everyday on twitch because I am there every day talking in twitch chat and calling out their bot / top lane on a dialy basis for being bad.This is not new... Misfit relies too heavily on Alex and Crumbzz. Their bot lane simply isn't on par and neither is their top laner to even low level LCS teams. And against C9T even if Alex plays as best as he can it isn't enough because their bot / top lane are just not good enough even in comparison to low level LCS teams at the moment. Can this change in the future sure... a lot of things can change but right now this is where they are at.
Dude how did you find this. I just went through his videos which he has been posting for years. I still can't tell if this guy is legit and is deaf or has some kind of... condition, or if this is the most elaborate art comedy project I've ever seen.
Oh yeah chances are he'll be adopted within a few weeks. :/ I've never been in a 6th gen so I don't know how much their backseat varies from the 5th and 7th gens.
Ok it's only one goal, we'll nab it back. We've got to play them smartly, and keep the sticks down. We all kinda figured Ovi would score at some point so now that's over. Let's focus and peg them back
FYI: The game isn't cracked yet. There is a pirated version from a chinese group, but it seems to crash at certain points. Pretty impressive copy protection from Rockstar Games...
I haven't touched my PS4 for 3 months. Built a PC and haven't looked back...that is until Uncharted comes out.**You guys are really butthurt about someone playing pc and not their PS4 when there isn't any games for it.**
It would be pretty stupid if it did.It's a playoff game,they came far as the underdogs,and in the last game they are really behind.Plus he is 20 years old and got hit by MDJ in the throat moments ago.Not a smart play,but anyone considering Giannis a bad person/dirty player after that is not a smart person either.
Ok, makes sense. Now for the EM-Drive: What is the desk and what are my arms?"Shawyer claims that the EmDrive works only on radiation pressure. Light is both wave-like and particle-like. Though it has no mass, it does have momentum, and the fact that light exerts a very small force on the objects it interacts with is well documented."If Shawyer is right then light is my arms so then what is my desk? Space Time?If Space Time is the desk would there not be an infinite # of "desks" to push off of?
I thought we were getting a big update but instead we get a simple fix that was seriously long overdue? Air sweeper isn't enough to knock back this disappointment. 
So you won't go ask for a opinion on it and will use yours as the deciding factor. That's a special kind of homer.Thanks for the laugh delusional LAC fan. 
I'm not totally sure on this, but I think it also has something to do with coal burners, actual ones, often getting covered in black while handling coal, and because of any detritus coming from the smoke
I bought it. Seems pretty gewd in Crucible and it's fun to FINALLY have a Legendary AR.Gets more accurate the longer I shoot AND it gets more range when I Aim down sights.
This is essentially a standard deck, with sub par techs like world and temperance. You'd be better off with the priestess turbo style, that should cost the same.
was recently thinking that reddit dot com didn't express enough antisemitism/islamophobia on a regular basis so im glad that someone out there decided to spend babby's first programming project time on creating something that adds literally jack shit to the world.
I was about 19 and had started dating my current partner.  It should be noted that we took things extremely slow, and had not yet had sex.  Anyway, I felt super queasy and my period was late by a few days (which is not uncommon).  I worked myself into a tizzy, thinking that I must have come in contact with my roommate's jizz in the bathroom or something, and that I was going to have to explain to my new boyfriend that not only was I pregnant, but it was my roommate's baby.Yeah, it was the beginning of the stomach flu, and I'm an idiot.  My period came while I was riding home from the store where I bought the pregnancy test.  Seriously, who thinks that sperm is just floating around in the bathroom, waiting to infect you with zygotes.  Ugh.
Would sell Wilshere, because I personally don't like him and think he's a cunt who embarasses us all the time by acting like Rocky to players who would kick shit out of him. Chavvy little shit. Would sign some steady CB, realistically like Perrin from St Etienne because I've never really trusted Mertesacker.
No joke, I've been able to do this for a couple of months. Open up Google Now, press the microphone, press the music button. It listens and tells me the song in a couple of seconds. Not sure if this is Shazam software that was always baked in to Now or what but it's not a new feature.
Really? It does look flashier than it is, but I don't think they get much of a reaction around here. Except the people that think they're Porsches, I guess
Did you like Throne of the Crescent Moon? I'm reading his short story collection Engraved on the Eye right now and I'm really enjoying it but I'm curious if he can do longer stories as well.
I prefer Toyota/Honda/Hyundai.  My current favorite for low mileage is a Honda Fit - good gas mileage and lots of space.  If you are driving a ton of miles, you'd probably break even on a used Toyota Prius.The Hyundai doesn't last quite as long as either the Toyota or Honda but the parts are dirt cheap and they can be bought for very little which makes it great if you aren't going to drive much.I ride my bike or walk mostly, I just use a car if it's too far to bike, I've got stuff to transport or if I'm in an unavoidable hurry.  We are a one car family so mainly it's my wife doing the driving.
You're forgetting that this top laner was the one of best top laner that the west has seen during the height of his career, and that the jungler made a shitty CLG lineup with link and nien look pretty good, then held a CLG lineup in 1st with double before the team environment crashed. That this mid has played on stage, and certainly doesn't have an unclear character, everyone says he's a positive and kind guy. That tabzz is still really fucking good, and has won an LCS split, come second in another, and been to worlds. The only thing I agree with being "not superteam worthy" is krepo tbh.
2 links vs 1 E não estou a contar o nº de clicks :)E se não houver legenda? Na realidade, vou-te dizer porque deixei de sacar.

nice. I played malygos spell damage shaman the other day and it worked better than freeze mage.so much burst, the enemy mech mage didn't know what happened.
It could have been a sales tactic to get your friend over quicker. I am not saying it wasn't true, but it was convenient, so there was no reason to lie. So not indicative of honesty.Source: I used to be in sales, was very honest, but saw a lot of dishonest people pull the "quick, we're about to sign with someone else" stunt, and later turn out to be very dishonest people. Only in the long term can you tell if someone is honest or not.Tl;dr : The arguments logic is faulty.
They'd probably shriek "Misandrist!" at the computer and then threaten to rape it. I mean, you're expecting them to take responsibility for something here. They don't exactly have the best track record on that. Worth a try, at least.
I had to buy my own car in high school. I was probably the only person I knew who had to do that (including my sister... she had two cars bought for her).I ended up with a rusted out 1990 Pontiac Sunbird. The driver side door wouldn't open so I had to leave the window down and jump through it dukes of hazzard style. I mean, I didn't have to, but I did.Sucked in the winter though.
Yes, this. I didn't even think about it, I just instinctively did it as soon as I figured out the key bindings for vertical thrust. FA off makes it better, but I also prefer to dog fight with thrust forward / back instead of a throttle. 
Ah you mean the long, completely un-sourced, rant about how blacks are genetically inferior and have lower IQ's because of that. Calling people genetically inferior isn't something we are going to allow.
Oh they will. I bet more than half you guys bought something in early access or preordered. Remember that? Yeah, I certainly do.I guess I've hit that point where I've been here long enough to see the hypocrisy bleed through. Only took 5 months.
Well, according to this somewhat official looking [document](http://fas.org/man/dod-101/usaf/docs/afpam10-1403.htm) I was able to find, 23,450lbs/hr seems like a decent enough starting point. Converting that to gallons gets you 3,500 gallons per hour, and at $5 a gallon, you're only looking at $17,500 per hour in fuel. 
When playing a farming welfare Alchamist, what items do you build for yourself and when do you give away aghs?   My first game I had success going: phase -&gt; malestrom -&gt; aghs -&gt; armlet -&gt; aghs then building for myself as a carry. It just felt really wonky tho. Im not sure how to best fit in gifting someone an early aghs without gimping yourself too hard. Or if you build too many of your own items than the aghs just come late. 
My butt was concave until I was about 19.  Same with you, started my period at 12.  At 30, my body is still changing!  I've started lifting weights and am slowly getting a butt.Also, I noticed my body change every time I tried a new birth control pill.  Seriously, I probably would be a AA still if I hadn't tried about five different birth control pills. 
You know those people at work and it's like 11 and you're all "let's grab a snack" and they look at you like you're mad? Those people are mad. I am *starving.*
I don't post anything because this is a new account. I have before. But it didn't go anywhere. This sub shouldn't just for girls that like fashion as you just stated I meant that it should be for anyone who wants to up their game or just post for fit checks. 
Might as well apply it to both staves in some way if you apply it to the blowpipe, it seems like it should have came with the serpentine helm recolors honestly
Unfortunate is the right word for it. The only purpose of this for me is to game while people watch TV. Now if I want to use it, I'll have to take TV off my one... 
You/your parents have some influence on this though, at least in Germany. We had kids transferring up/down all the time, either because they were too smart for the lower level, or not able to keep up with the higher level. I've attended public school in both the US and Germany, and I actually preferred the German system.
After playing the game,  it's really a blast, but I wish something could be done about the frame rate. Once more npcs join the hub, the frame rate starts dipping, what was once 60 is now like,  40 ish. With only 7 people in the hub. Gameplay is super fun though and I enjoy most of the dialogue. Hope for a sequel. 
The tank not having vulnerability is going to do more for raid dps via healer dps than the dps loss of the dps jobs having to get behind her.  Some groups make the tank aim shiva away, but it ultimately makes the fight harder and is a dps loss.  Anybody who gets hit by the cleave is at fault for dying.
Black guy here.  I don't hate white people.  The majority of black people don't hate white people. But the narrative the media wants to display is the worst of black people and make you think it's the norm. 
Ya Sarin gas... name a middle east country that doesn't have this shit... so on that basis that would have given bush the right to invade just about every other country from Yemen to India... i know it really boiled down to having control of strategic positions in the area mainly to keep an eye on Iran  but it still didn't give him the right to invade like he did. Because of that Iraq was set back 20 years hell that country might not ever recover.
And how the fuck does that relate at all to the tweet in question? The only way it's relevant to mention that resisting potentially offensive "expressions, tropes, or stereotypes" can be useful to a society in a discussion about that tweet is if that tweet is somehow in the same vein as any of those things, which it isn't. The only reason the guy got fired is because it's PR and anything that offends anyone is a no go (unlike real life), not because it's actually bad at all. And it isn't. So the people who are offended by the tweet are not somehow vindicated because the same criticism that points out why they're full of shit here has also been used unsuccessfully against stereotypes etc that actually were bad for society.TL;DR: just because people who have crusaded against political correctness have been full of shit before doesn't mean the people doing it in this instance (basically just because a dude lost his job) are full of shit now.
&gt; If you reverse blood flow, the heart would be receiving blood last. The heart would then be surviving on what little (if any) oxygen your body has left for it. I don't think, in this hypothetical situation, that would be correct. The lungs are on their own circuit, if you will, as you can see [in this diagram](https://mcb.berkeley.edu/courses/mcb135e/Difficult%20Slides/Fetal%20Circulation%201.jpg). Blood that goes to the lungs imediately goes back to the heart, not to the brain. The flow is: right atrium -&gt; right ventricle -&gt; lungs (reoxygenation) -&gt; left atrium -&gt; left ventricle -&gt; rest of the body (deoxygenation) -&gt; right atrium. Reverse that and you'd still have blood going from the heart, to the lungs and them immediately back to the heart.
i feel annoyed, frustrated and defeated thinking of our law enforcementyou hear scary stories as a child growing up of all the corruption that happens in other countries but is it really any different here? 
i threw myself in the middle of some crazy shit. two stabbings, a riot, more fistfights and people fucking on the dance floor than i can count, and a truly insane amount of drugs and weapons confiscated from pat downs. I was sick the night a gun got pulled though, so I never had to deal with that.
Ernie Johnson is the man! This was so heartwarming to watch, painful at times, but inspirational mostly. I hope I can be half the father this guy is while still being amazing at my professional job. 
lol.  No it was not a PR stunt, he did it because [federal capital gains taxes are lower than income taxes are](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Taxes-Whats-New).  By the way he is not the only [CEO](http://time.com/2979379/ceos-who-make-1/) to do this.
It is probably in an area right above sante fe where there are alot of mountains and lakes and ponds i have marked a map but don't know how to comment it
Did we listen to a different podcast? I thought he discounted the lancet study and gave reasons... that the lancet study was the highest any reputable study had gotten so far, and then he explained why its generally not accepted as accurate due to the methodology. 
I meant a power of two that is a positive integer, rather than a power of two whose exponent is a positive integer. Sorry about that, I'll clarify in the OP.
Don't worry about it. You only see this in homeless people with mental health problems, which speaks a lot about my country. Not even homeless drug addicts get to this point. If you have a roof over your head, all the rest is probably taken care of and you have pretty much zero chance to acquire this infection. Even if you do, you will notice it right away and seek help.
Those were two separate statements.  One for the positioning and second as a suggestion to use positive reinforcement.  And yes, that's really nitpicky.  
I get what you're saying, and I agree with some aspects of it, but I think a world without all of that shit guys had to deal with is a better world. Plus they can still work hard and protect their family. That hasn't been taken away or changed. I think if you're interested in building character, there are limitless character building activities awaiting you. But guys don't want to and don't seek them out. I don't think the world is that different, but I haven't been around for all of it so I couldn't say for sure. I just know that every guy in my life has been a confused man child, and I never know what to do or say or what is reasonable to expect of them. It's kind of a cluster fuck out there. And yeah women don't need men, but that doesn't mean we don't like them. I'd like to have one around, except they're all too busy hiding from reality :(
I didn't get the point of this post for a second and I thought it just a reminder that spider crabs, like, exist, and have long legs and are terrible. I should probably get around to buying a wetsuit sometime.
I never really considered myself a music person before grooveshark. But it let me listen to a lot of bands that I would not have been otherwise exposed to. It helped me find what particular kind of music I enjoyed. It is such a shame that it is gone.
Yeah, we've noticed. My alliance has had issues with... ah... Let's just say a POS decided it was sick of us taking it for granted and called a sick day, during which some friendly neighbors secured our stuff for us.
Yeah buddy! That sucks, I remember hearing about that round-up. Fuck ResLife. They'd rather go after a couple naked Zahmbies than the Keenanites pelting us with frozen eggs. Fuck Keenan too.
Hmm, what do I have. Around 4000 floppies starting in the 40's.Not a lot of superhero stuff, especially from the forties and fifties, but some.a few big little books, some early mad comics/magazinesNot a lot of runs,  but some interesting stuff...
Sorry, I mostly use Steam to play like 2 games. How do Steam groups work? I'm assuming it's just like a big chat group where you can go play games together when you want?
As linked elsewhere [the close to 400 studies of student achievement demonstrate that there is not a strong or consistent relationship between student performance and school resources ... Simple resource policies hold little hope for improving student outcomes](http://epa.sagepub.com/content/19/2/141.short)
Because you didn't present it as your work, you presented it as someone else's. It's the misrepresentation that annoyed me and led to me downvoting your earlier post, not any objection to the music.Self-promotion is occasionally annoying but mostly fine. Pretending that you aren't self-promoting whilst you're doing it is not.
Thresh is a well-rounded support who has disengage, engage, and his lantern is worth highlighting as well. He's definitely the harder of the two but, in my opinion, much more fun and a bigger playmaker. You'll find that you can play Thresh very aggressively if you so choose. Leona has an all-in style of play that's reliant on follow-up, but with Thresh you aren't forced to go in if you land a hook. He's great at turning around an engage or disengaging completely. Also consider that his Flay counters Leona's Zenith Blade :^ ). Invest enough time in Thresh and I think you'll find him very rewarding.
So based on your numbers what percentage of the galaxy doors starfleet control? Bonus question would be how does that compare to the Romulans and Klingons?The first question should be easy, but I can't math as well as you. The second would be a completely separate question.
I've seen terrible posts here too. People get upset when their favorite team loses, and they lash out. It happens. You guys won, we lost. Let's all move on.
&gt;then people would actually read a tiny percent more about politics and make more of an informed decisionOne can dream...........My original post was sarcasm.  Too many people I've met have no idea exactly who they are voting for (meaning what the person stands for) and just vote for a party.
I have never been officially overweight and I have them in tons of places. There's nothing wrong with stretch marks themselves. It's when they're all over the place because you were a fat fuck for your entire life that becomes the problem.
I second this for the reason that you won't have to spend a lot of money on her while still fulfilling the gift obligation and putting some, even if slight, thought into it. Chances are she will complain no matter what you get her so no point in trying to find a "real" gift for her to enjoy (because she won't). If she likes books at all the thrift store is a great place to get $1 books as well. I gave my mother gift cards for birthdays and mother's day for the last few years because she is so hard to buy for, complains about everything, and/or won't use it or regifts it. This year I thought of something she might possibly enjoy and got it for her instead of a gift card, and my mind was put at ease with the mantra "if she doesn't like it, she can eat shit." Such a calming thing to say to yourself, believe it or not. PS the title of this thread is hilarious
The anorexia comments are so crazy.  My best friend's cousin died from anorexia.  She was 69 pounds when she died.  I've seen pictures of her -- it's heart breaking.  And it's really hard to equate that with OP's picture.  No one who has ever seen a REAL anorexic would ever mistake a fit person for one.
Not sure how what I said warranted that comment... There are tons of situations where a camera's sensor isn't going to pick up exactly what your eye is seeing - scenes with wide dynamic range for instance where you'd have to do bracketing+HDR to get something even approaching what your eyes are capable of. Low light would be another.
I had Alcacer for a Newcastle career mode of my own and he just becomes silly very quickly; By 2020 he was 89 rated with absolutely absurd stats all over, one of my favourite players that I've used in CM to date
I'd want Animal Crossing because I've always been really curious about this series but it's so different from anything else I've ever played and they don't have any demos so I've always been hesitant to take the plunge to see if I would like it.  Thanks for doing this!
Monte isn't a Korean fanboy. He likes good League of Legends. And Korea is where you find it.Also he himself rated EDG as the best team in the world recently. 
Add water, about %15 extra for your elevation to rice in a cold pot.  Rinse rice first if you feel you need a less gummy texture due to poor storage and handling.  Bring to a boil.  Boil for a minute, then cover and lower heat to the lowest possible simmer.  It takes just about 20 minutes, so don't check before 18 minutes. Once the rice has "acne" and no more bubbles come up from the little vents, remove from heat and let sit for at least 5 minutes.   Fluff and done.  
I found out after he died that my grandfather had cheated on my grandmother with a stripper when my mom was a teenager. They ultimately decided to stay together, but right before his death he had told my dad he was considering asking for a divorce. I like to think they were happy together most of the time, at least.
Those were all great games. But I don't know anyone who busts out their PS1 anymore to play those games beyond huge fans of those series. Though it's true that N64 games are generally more accessible for casual play and that PS1 games tended to be a bit grittier.
I'm like that,too. For instance, the last to weeks: I threw a 114' in disc, then a 105, a 111, a 122, and just yesterday a 108.Though, I'm self taught and have zero dicipline. So I attribute my pattern to that.

Wikipedia says:Hell Yes (sometimes known as Ghettochip Malfunction, or GameBoy Variations) is the first official remix album, second official, and third overall EP by American artist Beck. It features several songs from Beck's 2005 album, Guero. The prominent feature of the EP is the persistent use of sound effects and tones generated from 8-bit or 16-bit video game systems, giving the songs a somewhat '80s retro or chiptune feel. 
&gt;The reason why the discovery was such a surprise to the team, is it has been accepted by the overwhelming majority of the science community that nothing could move faster than the speed of light. The speed of light is considered a constant which can't be passed.Theoretical science has been having a rough few years.  &gt;After shooting laser beams into the EM Drive’s resonance chamber, where the light is resonated to increase its intensity, researchers found that some of the beams of light were moving faster than the speed of light constant: approximately 300,000,000 meters per second."
What if I don't get asked about my future at all because I'm a man and no one gives a shit? What if the only question about my future I get asked is how I'm going to treat my wife?

I read Fairy Tail in the manga, even before the anime came out, and I stopped reading it when there were like 8 episodes of the anime, because indeed, in the manga there was little to no development anymore. It just seemed so dragonball-esque to me where fights continued on for pages, where Natsu wins anyway. I don't know about this entire Jiggly Butt Gang tbh, I think the anime series surpassed me till where I've read.
In ST Voy message in a bottle, the romulans approach the promethius and have a dialogue with the doctor of voyager.  The doctor pretends to be a romulan crewmember.  Who does the Romulan officer on the other side of the comm identify himself as?  
:P I did that, I am forgetful and I know I had forgotten to claim MP3's in the past so once every other month or so I check to see if there are any I have sent unclaimed and resend the thingy. You are quite welcome!
In one of our quests we were teleported above a volcano. We rolled to attack the volcano witch had an A.C. of 40. We collectively rolled a 41. And now a running joke in our campaigns is the story of the bard, the bugbear, and the gnome, who successfully killed a volcano. 
I like to think that Ashura and Indra kept jumping between reincarnations until they found Naruto and Sasuke. They went from Hiruzen-Danzo to Jiraiya-Orochimaru (which may explain his love for the Rinnegan/Sharingan) to Kakashi-Obito, but none of them really fit the bill. Naruto and Sasuke, however were almost exactly like the brothers, so they stuck with them. This does, of course Indra and Ashura's chakras have some sort of sentience to them.

Wasn't sure if Rangers had any fans. It was quiet in there for most of the 1st! Can't wait to hear what it's like at VC. DC fans know how to bring it!  LETS GO CAPS! 
Thanks for posting this. As someone fighting depression posts like this help me. I don't want to do something like this to my family. I am sorry to see someone who did...
&gt;"we are still working on the plugin API" My question is what the hell does this even mean anymore? It's been *years*. Are they writing/rewriting and testing code for hours a day constantly? Or is it something the joke about at meetings, so since it's on the agenda they say they're "working on it."
Wow. She sounds like my family members. my grandmother, and all her children except for my mom. I've been dealing with the type of person she is my entire life. I can't tell you how many times I've had similar situations to what you having to deal with now. I used to be the one to give in sadly... until I became an adult, now I stand my ground and I think you should do the same. 
That's why my advice to everyone looking to go to law school is: "Dont go *unless it's free* (or close to)." Unless you're going to Yale or the like, the minimum upside of attending a more prestigious school is far outweighed by the ability to not have any student loans. 
Man, I'm glad we made our picks in like 3 seconds the last couple of drafts.  Teams take way too long to make picks they've had a few months to prepare for.
There are still fair companies out there. There was this video on youtube, I checked right now and couldn't find it, but ill summarize: Feminist is at a company's Q&amp;A Sesh, and she asked what the owner will do to address gender disparity. Owner answers with (paraphrase) "We will continue our standard practices of hiring by merit, not by gender." It really gives me hope that this world can be equal.

Hm... I'm not exactly sure what are you talking about, but I experienced something similar a few times:I was also underground, mining, and alone. Then I noticed a this slow, repeating wooden TICK / TOCK sound. It always creeps the hell out of me.I have tried looking for it in the OST, but I found nothing remotely similar. My only two remaining idea is some sort of clock objects in a very tiny and dark micro dungeon, or some sort of ambient sound effect separate from music like the humming in the spaceship.
It's funny how women need to take responsibility for who they choose to marry, but men don't need to take responsibility for who they choose to be.  Again, in this same scenario, marriage is infinitely better than cohabiting.  Now the jerk who doesn't help out, may owe her spousal support for career damage from her having to care for sick kids, being unavailable for overtime etc.
Listen, if Snyder supports something that should tell you everything you need to know. Not only are the only new taxes going to be regressive, this is the same governor and legislature that, after we threw the emergency financial manager act out at referendum, repassed it immediately and called it a ballot measure so we couldn't even democratically decide whether or not our democracies should be suspended. No alliance with fascists 
Same happened in my hometown, She ended up having another before graduation and when she walked across to get her diploma her oldest was yelling GO MOMMY! YAY MOMMY!
Guard up is almost mandatory for GL and lances.close to 100% of the time when we know the attack is going to take place, we do not have time to sheath-&gt;run-&gt;superdive without getting slaughtered... Even more if you are in the middle of an attack animation when the monster start doing its pre-movehopping out is also at most times not a choice due to the short distance...This is even more so on lvl 140 fights where monsters are on drugs and sometimes use their moves without a long telegraphed animation
Ideally Ancient Stormer/CritDamage/Blue Pen with another blue pen for the Rainbow slot. If you don't have Ancient Stormer, WW action speed for the first slot. Want the crit damage to stack with Focused Thunder, boosts action speed with AS/WW speed, and get back good action bar on shot with the two Blue pens/make up for Kirin not having any natural penetration
I know right? Oddly enough, when I luck out successfully submit a HIT and the Assigned HITs page loads the next one, it's been working for the most part.
Your argument basically is just "That's how they've done it", which doesn't actually counter the argument that Steam is a bad way of doing it if all you want is the DRM. Just because Steam IS the DRM doesn't mean it had to be that way. You don't need DRM to run locally in its own application that permanently sucks resources in the background. Starcraft II has DRM through Battlenet accounts and everything above the game is handled on Blizzard's side, and for the most part it seems to work pretty flawlessly in my experience. Steam is a DRM second. It's main use is for Valve to directly advertise at you to buy more video games every time you want to play a game that runs on it. I find it convenient as a client considering I have a lot of PC games and most of them run through it, but for anyone with a fairly small library I could easily see why it'd piss them off. 
So here were are.  Haven't been this few initial jobless claims since the height of the dot-com bubble.Since we are pretty much at full employment, everyone should be pretty happy now.Fed should be raising rates any day now since we now have a robust economy.
Been wondering about the armor of lockes team as well. Was kind of hoping escalation's glass horizons arc would show them going to reach to get pimped up by a dormant a.i or something but it's prob just ONI and their new tech geeks. 
It really doesn't take 7 years if you start when you're older.  It only seems that way because the people who do start coding that early in life don't get nearly as much out of it.  A year spent programming while you're in high school is way less valuable than a year in college when you're studying computer science, which in turn is less valuable than when you do it 8 hours a day for a living working on real products.  If you can get to the bare minimum skill level to get an entry level position, you will learn far more quickly on the job than someone who can spare maybe 2 hours a day in high school.Source: started coding in 2012, recently got an offer at a top tech company.  Definitely not a savant.
Just eat mostly fruits and veggies with a decent amount of protein and fats. I'm a ling distance runner so I'm in a similar situation. As long as you keep your protein intake anywhere from 10-30% and decent fat intake  from sources like nuts avocados and olive oil you should be good. As for carbs mostly fruits and veggies with whole grains. 
Reminds me of the Fender [Aerodyne Jazz bass](http://www.fender.com/basses/jazz-bass/aerodyne-jazz-bass/0254505506.html). They describe it as all-black, no pickguard, no inlays, stained fingerboard, and matching headstock.
Statistically, we can treat the population as normally distributed so long as N&gt;32.  We have N=124 so assuming survery/response biases  are not huge the sample size is sufficient.  Granted. that's a big assumption.
I was raised Presbyterian (a form of Calvinism), so I did believe in Calvin's elect. However, upon further study, prayer, and contemplation, I felt that that belief structure conflicted with what is said in the Bible, so I changed my beliefs to a non-Calvinistic viewpoint.To answer your other questions: No, I specifically chose my salvation.
The spawn function is a decorator. In terms of python, this means a function that takes a function as input and returns a function as output. The @ syntax runs a decorator on the function and replaces it by they decorators output.In code:    @spawn    def some_func(): passIs the same as:    def some_func(): pass    some_func = spawn(some_func)
I would ask him if he's allergic to something because he goes into sneezing fits all the time where he sneezes like 12 times in a row. He's a dwarf rabbit so it's really cute, but it must be annoying for him.
Yeah I went for a k95Never really thought of Mad Catz's Designing as my favourite, but I never disliked it, and just always thought if they up'd their game they'd sell a lot more. Like, when I bought my first mouse, I got a rat 3, and I only bought it cause when I was looking around in best buy it  caught my attention as different, and badass looking. I didn't give a shit about the specs(mainly cause I didn't actually know they mattered) but yeah. I guess that's just the way I see their company.
I'm thankful that Bernie can push Hillary more to the left than she would have been.  Hillary's pretty moderate, and with Bernie in the picture she'll have to make some changes.
1) would you say he would be under anesthesia for the proceedures? was the patiant you treated for maggot infestation on mouth roof under any kind of anesthetic?2) is it even remotely plausible that this patient actually had a proceedure done beyond whatever the doctors could do that night before he went back to the streets?
He's kinda an ambivert, but he's more of an introvert. We have pretty similar interests so I'd know what he'd like to do if he wanted to actually do anything besides processing that major breaking point. Thanks for the advice 
I don't think she would want us making our own because that would be an opportunity for us to sneak notes onto the sheets. These sheets weren't comprehensive though so you had to pay attention to pick up on hints as to which additional formulas you would need to put on your index card for the test. 
Yeah my girlfriends mother crashed her car coming around there. The Milton facing side of the round-about has a coarse patch of asphalt so when it's rainy its fairly dangerous. Can't understand why they haven't fixed it during late nights. 
I agree as well. The best part of this change was how her ultimate worked. I would have loved if they added a knock-up or slow in the area around where she lands. It would add more to her dragon identity.

He's so overly dramatic. He doesn't have that like sick suavness the video game or Liam Neeson had. Like when Neeson says "A legend Mister Wayne" the hair on the fucking back of my neck goes up.He is so lame on the show. ANYWAYS, back to why Batman never accepting being heir to the demon. It was badass. It should Batman was already better. He had a set of principles that never broke, never wavered. He was better the league. In Arrow, him joining is just lame. It shows he's weaker and hes back to killing. Batman never killing anyone (while stupid for a superhero) was looked to be so badass. Even if its a ruse and Oliver is just play acting it will still be bad. In the comics, animated movies and video games - Ra's was seen as this big bad who was fucking crazy. This Ra's isn't. 
&gt; He's been much more aggressiveBroadcasters can parrot that all they want, but it's not really true. His Swing% this year is 36.8%. For his career it's 36.3%.

My favorite part was when the genius weapons designer creates a bomb that couldn't be detonated remotely and has a digital timer that somehow gets stuck, and could only be re-activated by punching it really hard.Don't see any design flaws there!  They've got a ton of displays at their base showing the frozen countdown and are going "Oh no! It got stuck with 2 seconds left!!"Gee, maybe when you were installing the transmitter to show you how much time was left you should have added remote detonator so your friends won't have to throw their lives away.

Keep in mind that it's been awhile since we've seen a significant patch and that the builds they release to us are at least 2 weeks older than what they've got internally.I'm personally getting sick of people whining and crying about something that is in beta/alpha and don't stop and think "oh, it's beta/alpha. Maybe they already have a solution for my problem."
I still say other when it comes to community background even though i come from a protestant family.  I believe the 'community background' breeds tribalism and shouldnt be a thing. 
OP, I highly suggest this build rather than the /u/TheReelMVP's. /u/TheReelMVP's build uses a Mini ITX motherboard, which is tiny, meaning you won't be able to add another GPU in the future, should you so desire. You will also (almost) never need 16 gigabytes of RAM. Also, /u/TheReelMVP's build will give you a tiny computer. If you don't want such a small computer, choose this one, but this one does not contain any WiFi or Bluetooth, unlike the Gigabyte Mini ITX board above, so you'll either want to buy a USB network card or a PCI-E WiFi card. Also, if you want to save a bit of money, go with the i5-4690 as it'll give you roughly the same performance for cheaper.
It's because we (average dumb consumer) heard that cows were being fed dead cows etc, and it was leading to diseases that could be passed on to people.  I know fuck all about what chickens are supposed to eat.  I'm just trying to do the righ thing.

To address your point #2:Currently a big portion of Asian/Indian immigrants are highly skilled engineers/researchers who are highly educated. These are the immigrants who get H1B visas (look this up) to move to the US and raise their children. These are the immigrants more likely raise kids who become to be engineers and doctors. 
I've read much better and more coherent uses of non-linear plot. And he doesn't do a particularly good job of creating suspense or drive to continue the novel. Really the humor is just ubelievably good enough to compensate for what amounts to a decent book at best.
My question is fairly simple: did you intend to write Skylar White as something like an obstacle for Walter to defeat (bc she's a bitch/etc) or did you write her to be an empowering women? I'm sure you've heard of the Skylar White Effect(The Skyler White Effect: The cognitive dissonance that happens when a female character is presented by the narrative as absolutely correct in their judgment of a male character, and yet the viewers assume she’s the bitch.) http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/16/skyler_white_and_breaking_bad_stop_hating_tv_wives.html
I am not arguing churches must do charity from a legal perspective, only a PR perspective.&gt;and since their books can be kept secret there's no way to check.I disagree.  The community would still know if the church conducts charity or not.  Its not simply a matter of looking at the books.  The people who put the money on the plate are going to be told where it is going and if the church runs bake sales, soup kitchens, etc. the community would know about it.  Church charity is usually more community active than simply writing checks.  I suspect this is by design.  Churches dominate the low skilled high man hours type of charity work.  They aim for visability.  They want to appear to do a lot of charity work in public instead of writing checks behind the scenes.  I suspect the churches that do not conduct charity work are either silent about political and social issues, or are hated by the community.  
Haha I was the same kind of student, except I never brought a pillow. Always either did my homework in the class as it was assigned or read a book while the other kids were finishing the assignment. I'd've graduated with a 4.0 if it wasn't for that one teacher that wanted to "bring me down a peg" 
I've accepted that I will be happy no matter who we pick, but I am disappointed because we only get to pick 1 player today and then have to wait.  I wish the first day was 2 rounds.
Sure, but when it comes from somebody you know, you also know how to interpret it. If my friend said something terrible, I'd know he's joking. If it's a Reddit post, it's more likely than not to be genuine.
Imagine the rickroll prank, where after the first month of rickrolling, each link has (This is a rickroll) after it. Cutting off after April and redoing it next year is the only way they'll be able to keep a centralized, golden goose prank like this going.
I am considering this as they have options to adjust amount of monitors purchased and either a dual or triple mount. Right now the $230 for a dual mount+single monitor seems pretty sweet. Any opinions? Can anyone talk me into why I would want to shell out the extra +$200 for the triple monitor setup? Is it really worth it from dual -&gt; triple?From a pleb
On the other hand, you don't necessarily need a formal agreement to have cooperation through common interests, and avoiding formally cooperating dodges some of the easier lines of attack that would otherwise be convenient fodder; a way to blame anything and everything on (simultaneously) that damned interfering SNP *and* on a Labour party/leader too spineless to resist their demands.If they go for it without any official agreement but it just so happens that they tend to propose things that the SNP are inclined to support, then Labour can claim full credit for getting stuff done, while also saying that they're demonstrating either the ability to keep the Scots in line or a broad-based appeal (depending on exactly who they're directing that message to), and the SNP can tell *their* supporters that it happened because they pulled the debate that way.
That's awesome good for you.  My grandfather always tells me when he was in high school his math teacher made a deal with him that if the teacher passed him through class he would swear on a Bible to never go to College because he was such a poor student....Little does the teacher know he went to college, got tutored by his now wife all the way through, graduated, and then taught high school for over twenty years after!
I am an ELL resource teacher in an elementary school with a high Latino population. My co-teacher is a second grade (7-8 years old) classroom teacher. She has many bilingual students in her class, Spanish-speaking. When they don't follow directions the first time she says "Don't you speak english?!"
&gt; You meet one guy who is awesome and you become great friends, but you meet another awesome guy and have feelings for him. What gives?I wanna fuck the other guy and not the first guy. I think the other guy would be a good fit and I *don't* think the first guy would be a good boyfriend.
My dad and I sometimes get high together and doodle or color and stuff. It's a blast! I realize now in retrospect that we used to spend a lot of time drawing and coloring when I was a kid, and that he was probably high then too. Kids take a lot of patience... No wonder we always had awesome snacks after our epic art parties!

The comparsion didn't need lengthy repetition, most readers see the many levels, government propaganda to seal peace deals you don't plan to keep so you can Jews by the millions, yes, it is just those common charteristics but I think they are enough.
I have just started using puca  power. It is because of puca power that I see I can't keep up with the bots. I will routinely lose out on bulk trades and the like.
I just posted but I'll reply to you.Changing melee to a timer will slow down PvP and completely change the combat mechanics that have been used since the beginning. Adding things like shields or headshots are really cool, but PLEASE, do not change melee to include a cooldown timerIf the magic bar becomes a thing, make it just pertain to enchants, not spells. I like the simplicity of this game and that it doesn't include spells or a mana bar (hint hint WOW, LOL)
I was thinking about arguing with this guy in another thread but I checked his post history and found this. Now I'm going to invest my time in something else. You probably should do the same in the future. 
That's the problem with GTA V. Fun things cost a fucking ton of money. Fun things don't generate any money. It does feel like a grind to earn money, and with how garbage the online community is doing heists with randoms isnt viable.

I won't be going unfortunately but I didn't know Judge was going to be there, looks like Coheed and Cambria is going to be there which is pretty sweet! Have fun!
No problem at all! Hopefully in future seasons, production will interfere less and allow for more organic and honest confessionals. They have to focus more on it being a social experiment and less an entertainment pit. 
Ya know I didn't want to trade away the farm for him but I'm not going to lie I'm disappointed we didn't get him. I think it was just because of all the hype
That is one of my reasons, for sure. I just talk about the other reasons first and typically don't get to this one. The close friends I have disclosed this with, mostly breeders, agreed it was a concern. 
&gt; I'm convinced I play some fighter or FPS games better when I'm 2 beers in.This happened to me once.  I fired up Tekken 3 on the playstation while I was so drunk I couldn't even walk, set it to the hardest difficulty, and played damn near flawlessly - better than I ever did sober.
I didn't watch the interview, got no time for youtube links.  Not sure what she said and it's possible I jumped the gun.  But treating the idea as "ironic" because she hasn't always been a woman and somehow doesn't understand it is ridiculous; she's talking about events from after she transitioned and about society at large, no?  She may be disingenuous about what's happened, but she's not disingenuous because she didn't spend long enough as a woman.

I  come to this subreddit a lot, but this is the first story that genuinely broke my heart. I got tears in my eyes. My heart goes out to you, it really and truly does. I'm so so sorry. Don't blame yourself, unfortunately, accidents happen. Your little friend loved you so much and he would hate to see you so sad. If you need to talk, or just need a shoulder to cry on I know you have the support of everyone here, but feel free to pm me.
"You just lost a customer" means they will never shop there again for the rest of their life. So "No, I sold that stuff to a different customer" makes absolutely no sense as a rebuttal. 
They say they have no idea and just give it back? Seems weird for a company like mercedes.... Those reps are usually insanely knowledgeable about their product. If it's something that odd, I think you just have to find another dealer and explain the situation and hope for the best, sorry but not much else to be done.
I'm speaking in aggregates.  I agree it's not really falsifiable, so if you're a Popperian from an epistemological standpoint, I can't offer you much.My main evidence is that societal structures which attempt to change people's nature almost invariably fail catastrophically.  See, for instance, the Cultural Revolution.
i am totally here just for the sex toys haha. Question on the PvP element of your server, so can we raid a players base if its not properly defended? By raid i mean just gain entry by either breaking blocks or a door etc and steal stuff, not destroy base or summon a horde to trash it. Otherwise i am totally sold and me and my mate would love to play on it, the rest of your settings are perfect. Add me if you wish, TheyCallMeConor on steam. Be great to meet a few more people on 7 days.

this is fucking miserable. worst commentating. they didn't even mention the anger that av was showing, which is pretty rare. Get some fucking emotion into the game.I miss sam rosen.
BAHAH yaass! Exactly. Some of the lyrics to her songs make me shake my head. But goddamn do I find myself singing "I GOT THAT RED LIP CLASSIC THING THAT U LIIIKE" on my way to work lmao. Do you like the Audacious lippies? I reallllly want to try one but I'm hesitant. And blushes. I NEVER wear blush but I'm like *oh my god, those blushes are shiny.* I only have Ruby Woo and Viva Glam II so far but I use them both a lot, def more than most of my lippies lol. Sushi kiss is gorgggggg.
Thanks for the responses and sorry about the nsfw tag.  My main concern is about my previous DUI and losing my VA license, and if that would be a concern if I drive in VA on a Australian license.
I mean yeah but what other options do you have when you don't have a franchise qb? Select anything else with these 2 on the board and your fan base will burn your house down
True. Do you think I could submit intend for enroll for another school and do the spartan pathway later? USF hasn't got back to me on tuition yet and they are offering me a delayed decision deadline. 
Saw a car online at a big Toyota dealership the next state over. We negotiated a price, and they basically sold me the car. They were going to hold it for me until the weekend when I could drive down to sign the paperwork and pick it up. They called me a day later saying "OOPS - The guy that traded in that car came back and took it away before it was officially ours to sell." Nice.They actually told the truth, but it was a huge fuck up in their part to try to sell me a car that wasn't officially theirs yet. I was ready to take my business elsewhere, but they offered me a deal on a newer model that turned out to be amazing, and I used their fuck up as leverage to throw in so much shit. I doubt that would have worked at a small dealership, but at least they sort of made up for it.

Eh, I don't care about whether one way is more grammatically correct than another or not. And all of these jokes are kind of dumb.*However*, the Oxford comma keeps the rhythm of the list whenever I'm reading. Apples *pause* bananas *pause* and oranges. Instead of apples *pause* bananas and oranges. I've had someone explain that they saw the "and" as just as much of a pause, but since it's an actual word it doesn't really work for me. I've actually mentally tripped over a list while reading just because it didn't use the Oxford comma and while it was perfectly clear, the last two items just ran together in my head.

I just tried that because I didn't believe OP. While you're correct that you can right click an image and select copy from the bottom menu - I'm not sure exactly where this picture goes when you copy it. I just tried copying an image, then pasting into the project folder of a site I'm working on. It wouldn't allow me to do this (specifically, explorer acted as if nothing was in the clipboard with the paste menu grayed out). At that point I thought to myself "I guess you can only copy between metro apps" and I re-copied the picture in the photos app and tried to paste it into an email message - it failed again.
Circular Argument is also known as [Circular reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_reasoning)&gt;"circle in proving"; also known as circular logic) is a logical fallacy in which the reasoner begins with what they are trying to end with. The components of a circular argument are often logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.Examples:&gt;Wellington is in New Zealand. Therefore, Wellington is in New Zealandand&gt;"Whatever is less dense than water will float, because such objects won't sink in water"Our example:&gt;Marriage is only a union between one man and one woman&gt;There is a union between a man and man&gt;The union is not a marriageI think we have a valid [Modus tollens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens).EDIT: I apologize for the bad editing

The Access ns parking lot is great for practising parking because those are the spots you'll have to park in and they are very narrow. So good to get used to. But for roads if say maybe the spryfield sambro loop or even Larry uteuk to get used to roundabouts without going to the one down by the arm

By some estimates, In the event of a (non-abcd*) war between China and the United States, China would be able effectively fend off and defeat a U.S offensive.

I have absolutely no expectation that my tinfoil theory's true, I'm definitely stretching to fit everything together even if there isn't anything directly contradicting it.I agree with you about wanting her to play a larger role in the series if that's the case, though the same could be said of more than just her. There are several things that I suspect will be plot-critical later on that we know next to nothing about right now, the prime examples being the World of C and Sword of Akasha.

If you don't want to spring for both, you don't really have to, but it causes premature wear, uneven alignment, all sorts of issues. Without seeing them. I say you are not being jacked, but get them to show you, any shop worth it's salt will have no problem showing you proper tread depths, vs yours, and same with holes. For sidewall repair, anything past the tops of the tread knobs on the edge, can't be reliably repaired, it can, but no shop will take the liability on that one. For chunks and holes, sure the hole can be patched, but with a chunk missing, things can get caught, the wire can be exposed, and poor ride can occur. I would start being a tad more careful where you drive, and how you drive.

Orthodox and Coptic can both, 100%, definitively, form Personal Unions.  Any Christian can.  I've personally formed a union over Poland as Ethiopia and witnessed my friend form a union over Muscovy as Theodoro since the latest patch.  They only removed PUs for non-Christian religions.
It's funny everytime Zidane gets brought up someone will copy and paste the same bullshit they heard from someone else about him being overrated and inconsistent. Yea he didn't single handedly win his team every game he played but he always put in world class performances, was almost always the best player on the pitch, and thrived on the biggest stages. He was my idol growing up and one of the best of all time no doubt.

Yes, I have :)  I take measurements every few months, especially before I go bra shopping. My most recent measurements are 40" 37" 47" 49" 46" and the calculator came up with 38GG, but I believe I was overestimated by a few cup sizes, assuming that a Cacique 38F is equivalent to a UK 38F. The next cup size up in Cacique is a G, and that's too big for me. I forgot to add in the post that I was confident in my size, and I really want to know how it would translate to the different brands that people on this sub wear. Like if a brand runs smaller or bigger in the cups than what I'm used to, or if it is meant for narrow or wide roots. I just don't want to order something that doesn't fit or is the wrong shape.
People who hand out flyers/petitions, especially the ones at my university, slowing me down and being annoying as fuck trying to get my attention. Whenever I see these cunt-buckets I just shut down. I don't make eye contact, I don't acknowledge them at all. I just keep walking. They're like the untouchables in India, as soon as they have a flyer in their hand they basically become subhuman to me and I am filled with irrational hatred of their very being. Fuck those guys 
Nvidia's cooler is pretty decent. Still not nearly as good as an open air cooler, but certainly not bad.AMD's cooler is just too weak for the 290X. I don't think it's much worse than Nvidia's, but the 290X is a very power hungry card when compared to the extremely efficient Maxwell. Not easy to cool.Someone should do a test, slapping a reference Nvidia cooler on a 290X and a reference AMD cooler on a GTX 980. Would be interesting.
You don't think lives have been ruined and lost? You don't think the theft of billions of dollars hasn't resulted in tragedy? You don't think the fact that these unpayed players are largely minorites from poor communities, and that the people profiting from their unpayed labor are mostly older white males, bares any resemblance? I don't think you've thought about this much at all.

Everyone has freedom of speech, but obviously it takes money, or charm, or talent, or connections, or some combination of these, to get a "megaphone" and have your voice heard by lots of people.  So what do you want to do to fix this?  Do you want to create a world where no one has a megaphone but the government?  No thanks.  That's the worst option of all.
I (f33) was married for 10 years (to a man) while being polyamorous and dating women. Eventually we split for other reasons, and a few years later (in March this year) I married my wife. Since she became my primary partner, I've felt so much more "real" in my daily life, but have had fleeting moments when I find myself emotionally (if not sexually) attracted to guys. So I've recently felt like I'm Lesbian when it comes to sex, but bi when it comes to romance. Haven't found any asexual guys that would be down with that (tough cross section: poly &amp; asexual, in my small-ish community) 
Yeah, but that's cheating. (It only works because cloud to butt only runs when you first load a page, not for anything loaded with javascript afterwords).
Mosley never came close, he never even dropped him when he hurt him. Oscar wasn't in his prime but he still wasn't shot, he was completely shot when he fought Pacquiao though, same with Shane. Oscar got the split against Mayweather for being agressive rather than being effective.In their primes, there would be no destroying going on, it would be a tough fight for all involved. 
In middle school this chick kept messing with me on the bus. Got tired of it and I threw something at her. Get kicked off the bus and they call in a counselor to talk to me. Bus leaves and I have to stay for the late bus now. He sits next to me and straight up goes, "Don't worry, that nigger will get in trouble tomorrow."Fucking jaw dropped. I'm a minority myself and I had no idea how to respond so I just got up and walked around the school until it was time to leave. 
Already doing it! I was halfway through "The Gathering" when I posted and just finished up "Midnight on the Firing Line." It's gonna be a fun weekend. B5 and pounding away on my newbie C# project.

Tyler (our tech guy) has been working on that since the beginning and recently he came up with an idea that could make it work. As for the disclaimer, well, it's a disclaimer. I don't know about defeatist, but it's a disclaimer. It's not supposed to be a joke
Waiting till Sunday to watch Avengers 2 so I don't have to worry about the audience haha. As for tonight, sadly I don't know what I'm really gonna be doing. Maybe play a game with my best friend, who knows. 
to a guy who is insecure and whose only claim to power is his masculinity even the slightest thing like owning a pink loofah is just too much, let alone him not being the one to ask a girl out and she says yes. 
Jesus I don't get this level of misinformation, the info is right on their site.They use Transunion and Equifax. They create the score using the Vantagescore 3 model.There, settled.
Thank you titans now the media can make up bs rumors about some thing else other than eagles are willing to trade 50 players and then next 2 1st rounders and next 8 2nd rounders for Mariota. 
The backdrop behind them of a rowhouse that's merely boarded up is quite literally the most innocuous background any camera crew could hope to find in the shithole that is west Baltimore. 
MEH, WE NEED TO PLAY BETTER IN THE 2ND. WE ARE UP BUT THEY HAD MORE CONTROL THAN US IN THE 1ST. I WANT THEM TO HAVE TO PLAY OUR GAME, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND! 
I noticed when I started a new character, it was different flying with no "experience" stat compared to my other character that has a lot of hours and maxed out. But when I got that stat up I flew the same. I think it calms the control surfaces down somewhat as you increase...
I just think the history how how social democrats and liberals "Cooperate" with the rest of the left makes people a bit wary of them. You've heard Phil Ochs' *Love Me I'm a Liberal* right? 
Here, let's do it ourselves so the willfully stupid don't feel they've been slacking...ahem...AHEM:don't cut yourself on all that edge tips le fedora wow what a neckbeard oh m'lady if we evoluted from monkeys then why're there still monkeys you dumb atheist hurrhurr i stereotyped you so that makes you dumb and doesn't make me bigoted because jesus/allah/brahma SEZ SO durr...How did I do? XD
ROFL**‏@NOTSportsCenter 3m3 minutes ago****Titans draft Marcus Mariota, leaving them needing only a RB, FB, WR, WR, TE, LT, LG, C, RG, RT to form a playoff caliber offense #NFLDraft**

Oh shit, you're the guy who did Until Then with the SSBM sample I loved that! Even wrote some shit over it. I love the idea of taking samples from unique places- keep up the good work!
if you're interested, there will be a event held next week, called MSI (mid season invitationals). All the top teams from world wide from each region, korean, china, wild card, eu, na, and i 4got the last one will be playing against each other. it'll give you a good idea why league is so popular even if you don't understand the game. Its really the fans that makes esports such a success (new generations). You can watch it on twitch streaming platform and any other streaming platforms most likely anywhere, on your phone, computer laptop etc as long as you got a decent connection.if e-sports fan died out, then the players wouldn't be as popular similar to how a baseball stadium sometimes are almost empty and no one cares about watching it.
I think for now I'll be fine. I literally just started today (up to Dragons of the tower) so I have plenty of time. I have a lot of great chances to roll subs tomorrow and the day after, and in the event I get a better lead I'll switch to that.
Well, let's assume that's entirely true for a moment. We also need to consider the present situation where there are also people who can't find jobs, who really want jobs, but those jobs are presently filled by those people who don't want jobs.If we let those people who don't want jobs quit and live off their basic incomes, those jobs open up to be filled by those who really want jobs. This of course will obviously also improve productivity, as there's a big difference between the work of someone who hates their job, and the work of someone who likes their job.However, that again is assuming you're right, and [I just don't think it's reflective of the way people would really react if they could](https://medium.com/basic-income/if-we-no-longer-force-people-to-work-to-meet-their-basic-needs-won-t-they-stop-working-3996442b7585).
Giannis pretty much tackled Dunleavy after he released his 3 point shot. Pippen saw that dirty play and he got off his seat. Face went from smiling to I'm gonna kill this boy.
I smell a startup here!  [Did we just become cofounders?](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Step-Brothers-Did-we-just-become-best-friends.gif)
Usually this thing would lose all it's rotors above 350+ kph in a straight flight But if you dive down from high alt with your collective on 0 you can  reach your max speed and lose alot of altitude fast safely___Might also be insignificant but I managed to reach altitude over 32k meters / over 104k Feet with a F-15 [Pretty fascinating ...](http://i.imgur.com/0AqqORU.jpg)
That was absurd. People who were literally cheating at a professional level of play where money is on the line (how much more harmful to a game's image can you get than that?) were only *disqualified* from that *one* tournament. And this guy gets *banned* for taking some unflattering photos of players, with no faces of the players in question? That's some bullshit.
I'm not sure about that. It has been there for a while, and MalwareBytes hasn't detected anything.It was there before and after I ran [TronScript](/r/TronScript) on my machine, and [this virustotal scan](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/d04d14b202886dadf48f100d16c4963e2cf1e5e2bf678db885bb384f355da412/analysis/1430439628/) shows nothing. I thought it might me a system file of some sort, but I wasn't sure what it did.
I created a free, one-page game for this purpose, which uses a copy of Steve Jackson's Cthulhu Dice, available at most game shops for $5-$8.If you're interested, let me know! 
Its actually the opposite; dair animation ending/IASA frames are the same for finishing it in the air, but has less landlag when l-cancelled. Was 16 in Melee, now 12 in PM.
i don't believe they will have buy a box promo, sad...since this is the first time i've purchased 3 boxes from my LGS. 10% off the msrp makes me happy, and cheaper than most of the big places online (which are sold out).  
Clg has strong players in every role, its just when it comes crunchtime Link and (here comes the hate) aphro do not perform well in playoffs.    Btw i love aphro and i thinks hes top 3 support in Na all season til playoffs

&gt; If it's not used to evaluate the worth of a film, and only to show films are male-centric, then we're still left with the question of "so what?".To borrow your own question, so what? The Bechdel test doesn't purport to do more than illustrate a rough measure of male-centricty, and so I'm not sure what you're criticizing in pointing out that the test doesn't do more than what it purports to do.&gt;If male-centric films were a problem then the market will force films to changeWhy should we expect the market to correct any problems (or this specific problem) in film?
I loooove giovanni direct leave in weightless moisture conditioner. It has proteins in it so don't use it if your hair gets crunchy from protein, but I love it. It's a leave in and  it helps to define my curls so well and makes my hair so soft and nice.  It's a little more than $5 (i paid $6.99 at target) but still inexpensive and awesome! My hair type is... Well.. It depends on the day.  Some days it's wavy, like a 3a, some days it's 2b. It's fine,  but I have a lot of it.  I put on a quarter sized amount after I squeeze the water out of my hair,  and then the plop for about 35 minutes.  
Dave talking about gayness? Basically one big bone being tossed to shippers. ESPECIALLY John/Dave shippers.Edit: I take it back. He opened up a conversation about John/Roxy. It's cool.
Gearbox is all good. Previous owner did all the necessary things and put in some new gears. But I don't need a new hop up chamber? Just a bucking will do?
LOL I never said you didn't like them. You called them cheap to produce shovelware, and I said IF YOU HAD PLAYED THEM you would know that these games aren't shovelware.
So it's a reddit called Kappa. But can you use the [](#Kappa) there? [](#Kappa) srs question  I'm just kidding. It's awesome to see us voices actually speaking and not just riotong. hopefully this sub can help all who need.   
Good idea! I don't know much about the landscape implications of a huge body of water like that. Adding more streams / rivers makes sense - any suggestions for how many?
I bet at some point on that 9000 mile journey he woke up a little tired one morning, stumbled out of whatever bed he slept in, stubbed his toe and instinctively let out a hushed "ow fuck". Also I think this kid has some issues. 
To be honest I thought the spriting stuff was pretty interesting for the sub, considering what other posts it gets. What else would a fandom for a pixel-sort game do? Talk about the game, fan art..Really if more things came up on here the sub would feel a lot better, but we really have to wait for the game to come out before that. So for now, I think anything creative benefits us in our "dry hype period"

Unlike rockstar I only have the equivalent of 3 tickets I'm working on. Also I'm chair-ridden for the most part as I'm recovering from a gastritis flare up (basically just an annoyance more than anything)Do you have any antivirus programs running?
If you like Kubrick then check out [this.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xkq12a_the-making-of-the-shining_shortfilms) It's a documentary about the making of The Shining, shot by his daughter Vivian. It's really interesting, and shows the master himself at work. 
I'll confess I buy a lot of stuff on CD.  I usually reserve vinyl for albums I really want, or older obscure stuff.  But take the new Alabama Shakes album for instance.  I like them, but when I can snatch the new album on cd for 9 bucks vs 23 for vinyl, it's a no brainier.  I love vinyl more than cd, but I'm by no meAns a purist.  In fact, I think CDs will make a comeback; or maybe I'm a dreamer!
How would you compare Ecology to BMW, as much as I like Ecology there are only a few songs I go back to and BMW has just so many good songs and I feel like as a whole it has a much better vibe.
If you have 125 hours in dota, there are some ported heroes here http://dota2.gamepedia.com/HoN_hero_comparison?cookieSetup=true Also, Kane is getting a rework on his third skill to fulfill his role better. New patch will arrive on Tuesday
They will come out flying.  Av is going to perform more mystical coaching voodoo, you just wait....  Also Hank will give them that disapproving look that makes men ashamed and strive for excellence.
I didn't find any mention of 150 Octane being sent through lend lease.  I don't know about finding any concrete information about when they were withdrawn.  It does some were transferred to training duties, and converted. http://ram-home.com/ram-old/spitfire-9.html
I don't watch a lot tape so I'm not in the best position to answer this, but apparently he has accuracy issues and struggled running the pro-style offense at the senior bowl. He's got a good head on his shoulders and has a good work ethic though, so picking him up late and letting him learn under Brees wouldn't be a bad idea.
thenewboston? Ive said it before and ill say it again, he is not a good teacher at all. He is inconsistent, and awful at explaining non-trivial things. People get hooked on his tutorials because the first few are easy enough, then he gets to classes and objects and all the other abstract things in programming and he degrades to a "just do what i do and youll get it" kind of teacher.The best way I can recommend is a book. I still find them unmatched in terms of going through anything thoroughly. Tutorials are often made by people who do it on their free time, therefore they have little incentive to make a good one, whereas if you write a shitty book, it just wont sell, simple as that.
Hehe. I got my first 3 months for $1. Then I had issues with my account so I got a free month, and now I've got another 3 months for $1. First 7 months cost me $2 😂😂😂 
So? Fuck those neo-libs. If you want change, get off your ass and vote Bernie in the primaries, because the soccer moms who know only the name Clinton will not vote in the primaries, but the young, and the politically active who know and give two shits will. You are one of them. Help us get Bernie nominated, and help us inspire people to be the change they want to see.
