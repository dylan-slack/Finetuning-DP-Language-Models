After reading this, I wholeheartedly believe you should let her go. You and her simply aren't compatible. She's looking for a committment and you're bent on avoiding it. You should figure out your committment issues before getting into a committed relationship.  
Nihilum and LG are significantly better off in theory. I can't really think of a replacement for Ptr that would leave CLG in a better place than they were before. Cloud9 should be much better, but you never know.
Your 16 bars seems to focus on introducing yourself rather than a life you think is worth living. I understand if you introduced yourself in a few lines that made sense to the theme such as the line “I fear my life remains aimless, I traded paper for a lane switch.” That made sense to the theme because it could be used to tell the audience how you don’t have a life worth living (yet). But lines like “If you fight me, I'ma show hands and throw down on yo ass like the young motherfucking Sylvester Stallone has” has a place for introducing yourself, but not for the theme of a life worth living.
Trinus vr is amazing but it'd be cool to be able to just sit anywhere and play without turning the pc on, it seems like a waste not making fully functional games for gc.
It's not your fault don't think that. Hey if this helps it does then if it doesn't well. At least I can talk about it.I shot my dog. I had him for 10 years. I can home from partying and it was New Years so I was going to shoot off my .40 so...Well I was loading it outside and I shot it off accidentally. Right into my dog. Me having about 5-7 tequila shots into me though if I go to sleep I would wake up and he would be okay. Well if I called a vet when I shot him I could have saved him. Or at least from his pain. So I woke up saw a dead dog in my yard… i cried for hours. That old dog still had a few good years in him. That was my fault and you sitting on a little tiny mouse is more understandable than a man discharging a firearm into a shitzu. Don't feel to bad. 
I would be tempted to excuse myself to the bathroom every time (so you don't piss him off, because he's your boss), with disgusting details (for negative reinforcement purposes).

I'd recommend, if you have the time, to get an account with Citibank and get the Citibank Plus transaction account - they have no fees on currency conversion or transfers and charge no international atm withdrawal fees. Been using them recently for my overseas trips, pretty handy.

Definitely test a few.  I was told as a beginner I would be happy with a 10 ft sit-on. But I have some boating experience,  and ended up with a 12.5 ft sit-in.  I love the weight and the response time.  And I can go a lot further in it.  Splash splash!

On my Schalke save I'm using the same formation but retain possession short passing and work ball into box. Then against big teams and tough away games I go play narrower and exploit the flanks and against easier teams at home I go play wider. Whipped crosses, Close down More, Get stuck in on both. I have one DLP and BBM in my home tactic and a BWM and a DLP in my away tactic. Meyer I play Attacking Mid so he contributes more to the defensive side of things. One WB on my home tactic and 1 FB and 2 FBs on my away tactic. I had to get another good midfielder so I bought the two Romero's, bought Silva for the LB, luckily their front 4 are all great starters including the back ups so I haven't had to buy much there. 
As the great Alex James said, "A man with a Barbour jacket and a bottle of champagne is invincible" - get the Barbour! It compliments your build the best and it's just an awesome jacket

But that isn't what is going on. You keep saying throwing bricks or rocks. That is the least of Baltimore s problem. The violence isn't even against the police.

Honestly I don't have as much of a problem paying for Chroma's when they are for the base texture and not for a skin. The "Blucian" as I'll call it for now, is one I want to get, and will probably purchase at some point and feel the price is, while above what I would say is worth the value of it, what I will pay for this **one** in particular.However I do think it's worth looking into other ways of obtaining the Chroma's outside of RP purchases.
Yeah, but [60% boards,](http://i.imgur.com/gKoR38B.png) and the like, have layouts that are of normal size, just very minimal in all other aspects. What I mean is, all the keys are about the same size, and about the same distance from each other as larger, more regular keyboards; they just have fewer keys and lower profile casings etc.This keyboard looks like all the keys are smaller, and not spaced out to compensate for the size, meaning the whole layout is very compressed. Must be intended for mobile/portable use.
Sounds to me like unprofitable businesses are finding anything to blame but themselves for their failures.  Nah, can't be.  People who run businesses are all brilliant captains of industry incapable of failure, right?
I think the whole "American politics are crazy" thing came from the fact that they are relatively transparent and that we treat them half seriously and half as entertainment value and then export them to the rest of the world for the same purpose.  If you have a modicum of understanding of how the American system works and who some of the major personalities are, you can enjoy shows like the Daily Show.  I'm sure satirical political programming exists in other countries, but we've mastered the genre.  Plus its like sports-- we can banter about how bad our team's draft picks were and how congress/the president/the democrats/the republicans are taking us to hell in a hand basket over a few beers.because when I read about some of the political sleaze that goes on in other countries that I never hear about, I'm fascinated and amazed.
Someone was telling me a long story about an elderly man they knew who had recently gotten remarried after his wife died.  I was barely listening and said something like "when did she die?", to which they replied "2 years ago", to which I replied.. "oh that's cute".  Then realized I meant it was cute he got remarried or something.  Whatev I'm an ass and I don't listen.  
That means each of those teams will play two games back-to-back. This isn't a best of series like they normally do, it's seeing which team can gather the most wins throughout the tournament. At least, that's what I've gathered about it.

Happy to help. Do note that I didn't get to wear it as much as I wanted, so the leather MIGHT get softer after breaking it in more. But I'll have to wait for better weather to bring it out.
That's a pretty good edit. The もし increases the sense of "if," and the 見つけられたら makes the meaning something like "if I was able to find rum on the island," which is also more emotive than "if I found rum on the island."

The Dragonborn has the problem of being a PC, a character which is undefined apart from their destiny (i.e. the Main Quest).What could be said, however, is that the Dragonborn does face their destiny. They are not ignorant or avoiding of their purpose, and are up to the challenge.
Yeah. People try to make a defending argument, but they always end up sounding like poetic, pretentious bullshit. They jump though hoops to try and find ways to make it true, but it's just not.

Guys, please get help if you ever begin thinking suicidal thoughts.  I lost a great friend after we graduated boot camp to suicide, and I just wish he had asked for help.  That was 5 years ago, and I still think about it all the time, wishing I had been able to do something.  Let someone know that you're not okay.  Police officers routinely see the worst that society has to offer, and it's easy to lose yourself in the mess if you don't have the right coping mechanisms set up.  My academy has stressed a lot about stress management and officer suicides, and it's hard to think of how many officers turn their weapons on themselves.  
School is considered a social setting. So therefor OP has no reason to not introduce himself. And if she doesn't even know he exists, then it's even more reason to introduce himself.If he never introduces himself, he may never get the chance. They might not know the same people, or go to the same events, or anything. So what does he do in that case? Because by what you're saying, there is nothing he can do. So why not just introduce himself? If she finds it weird, then that's on her, unless, like I stated earlier, he makes it weird. If he just introduces himself, that's not weird, nor should it ever be considered weird.

&gt; Reika, I know you're getting dogpiled on this thread, but I'm gonna go ahead and point out that saying your machines are quieter than explosions is not really a great defense.My point was that they are quieter than many other vanilla sounds, not "ten times louder" like most people allege.
That's actually the problem, some people don't have that problem.I own a OPO alongside with 3 other friends.None of us have screen issues and they were all bought at separate times. However the touching feels different in one of the OPO's of my friends where if it's not your thumb pressing stuff sometimes it won't recognize the touch. Still it's not recurrent.So yeah, I believe they dealt all their cards but some of us apparently got a faulty cell phone...Still most people who have a working cell phone won't be here to say this every time for each faulty cell phone of other users..So yeah try to RMA first, you might get lucky.

And my point wasn't about which was better, sorry if it came across like that. My point was that you should include the different types of BC pipes in your calculation. In other words, it's true that all BC Pipes are 2 crafting steps each; but you'll probably need more than one type of pipe to complete any connection.Equally important is that every EIO conduit uses a base of Conduit Binder, which you can craft in large batches. In essence, you can subtract two steps from every EIO Conduit after the first time you make a Conduit.
Light armor is not required to heal effectively. Heavy armor healers can heal quite well, with very little threat to their own health pool, particularly when taking minor dmg themselves. 
&gt;Than what does it test?The presence of at least two named female characters who talk about something other than a man.&gt;Not only is this a loaded assertion (which I'd argue carries a good/bad judgement),Your inference is not my implication. If you have another term that you think is less loaded to describe uneven representation of populations in media, we could use that instead.&gt;it doesn't follow from the premise.What premise?

&gt;The genders aren't being mixed by this rule, they're being unmixed. Thing is, trans people are going to make people uncomfortable regardless of which locker room they use.Not unless they use their own pre-surgery or stick to the one they were assigned to at birth until they get surgery.&gt;The trans person will look way more out of place under the current system. It's shown pretty universally that allowing trans people to use facilities necessary for them to live as their gender generally leads to an increase in quality of life. But lower it for others?

I don't know how you read that from my comment, but anyway... It's very important to teach students foundational academic skills which will serve them in college and for the rest of their lives: math, english, etc. Teachers are responsible for not only teaching this stuff, but also for making the case that it is important, and that students will need it in their lives, so that they will use it and learn to improve their faculties independently. In other words, they learn how to learn. In order to be comprehensible, advanced subjects, i.e. life skills, require the above foundational knowledge.  
We live in a 3+2 bedroom house, where the +2 rooms will never ever be bedrooms except for when we have guests and then all the shit in them gets tossed in whatever available closet space we have!

Sleepaway Surprise, with a banana hidden inside.As much as I like the other movies and even the other ice cream more, this reference alone is my favorite.
&gt; without reason to believe otherwise.Maybe I would consider the idea more if Dragonball characters actually had feats somewhere near to where they are scaled to be, or in this case, a character statement or description how far away that sun was.&gt;There's a feat you don't like so you try to undermine it.No, I take consistent feats over unsupported fancalcs.&gt;You can't pick an choose on what you like best.Yes I can. It's called PIS and outliers.&gt;And you still haven't told me what you consider a feat. Tell me a feat.Beerus destroying a sun is a feat.

Terrible terrible logic. League of Legends is actually a lot more grindy then other mobas. Rune pages, the rate at which you get champions, and so on is actually a lot slower here then many other games. 
Jesus Christ, how fucking delusional do you have to be to miss the point of the movie that hard? It's as subtle as a sock to the jaw. At least the racists are getting downvoted this time around. That's refreshing to see. 
It's only rogue that has it.Tht isn't abuse, that's crazy smart thinking lol.  If Travis would have landed hits on him then he would have died and he had to go with six less pots to bring what he needed.  The fact of the matter is he took almost no hits in the 43 seconds it took for him to put it on and get it warmed up.  That is called strategy, maybe you should use it instead of relying on numbers all the time lad

That is freaking sick but looks expensive. It's most likely made by Garena. I like how GGG puts everything into game play rather than fancy cut scenes.
&gt;Please stop perpetuating the myth that acceleration, rotation, or curvilinear coordinates mean you have to bring in general relativity. Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.
Hmmm so in short terms, it's like a side thing where TPP members want to meet other people like a group chat kind of thing. That's a pretty good idea IMO. Some of us here (including myself) see TPP than just "oh we're only 1000+ random people". A lot of us got to know each other, joke with each other and learned from each other. I got to known a few good people I some day wouldn't mind getting to know better (if I had that type of time). So yeah it's like what we do here (in terms with sparking conversations with each other) but other at another place. I can see that. :)
True, though you can find papers about early childhood education, the study I heard of was on NPR and I've looked into it since, you can google it I'm sure =).
Jimmy was just on Rogan's podcast and said that he would basically just do the characters to his girlfriend, way before he ever brought them to the show.
This is similar to the concept of an [Explosively Formed Penetrator (EFP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator) which is a conventional explosive weapon that can punch through multiple inches of armor plate.Cool video.
Yes. I told her I liked her (and I was convinced she liked me back). She told me she isn't looking for anything serious. I stopped hanging out with her and a month later she suddenly became interested.It changed my perspective on dating a lot.
I'm happy (and proud!) to be even a small part of this community today.Might have to get my butt more active. Anyone who steps in for someone going through this stuff cannot by definition be bad in my book. :)
I came out at around 26/27. Was quite surprised that I "hadn't noticed" earlier. I think if you don't grow up with out, adult gays around you, it can take longer to figure out.
"I feel like she still is. She tried her best, did what she could. Then I grew up a little bit more, and she started coming home drunk more and more, then one day she just didn't come home at all. The sane part of me says yes. The Haylie part of me says, 'Tell her to fuck off, and then go paint some more.'"
"I hear babies cry,I watch them grow,They'll learn much more,Than I'll ever know.And I think to myself,What a wonderful world."\- Louis Armstrong
Within 4 hours, the best she could do is switch the color of her pants and top and pulling up the shoulder strap..........gurl u slo!But seriously, I like it. It looks more modern. the weirdly gray top always looked dull.Also: HOLY F Garnet your hands
then let them regret fucking up later in life when they're working a low paying job with no benefits and hard work. They'll sit there thinking "Damn I really fucked up".IMO there is no use in even trying to discipline/correct little shits that act like that.
I only play German things in any sort of WW2 game really. Happens with WoT, WoWS (when the kriegsmarine are released), WoWP (in beta when I actually played it), WT:GF, H&amp;G, etc. Just because I love their weaponry and vehicles. Would be easier to just go Russian as they're usually favoured in games like these but then I can't have MG 42's, Messerschmits, and Tigers, etc. So no deal
Uninformed statement? Yes. Dumbest thing you've ever heard? Guranteed not in the top 100. Be more understanding of your fellow flawed human. Hell, I bet even YOU don't know everything. 
honestly i know we need a defensive tackle and im not even worried about corner right know, but for the love of god trade down and pick up some lineman for brady. no theirs not alot of depth their this year but giving an ageing more wise Tom Brady more than a couple seconds in the pocket will be fucking huge for this offence, and i wont have to watch in fear as brady hits the ground 100 times a game.ps. Super Bowl 50 here we come
Localbitcoins.com is quick and easy if you don't feel like setting up a Circle account. But we are running a promo on VT IDs that will run you $125 total for you and your friend with free backup copies. [Details here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fakeid/comments/343d0m/21now_vermont_promo_started/)
Lol, its the same dilemma we always have with our friends, we all are from around thane in a group of 8 or so and half of them moved to mumbai - western, folks do not prefer much travelling especially on the weekend since they travel already for work during the week.
How do false starts happen at all when in the huddle, the QB can  just say "don't move until I say X"? Only time I would imagine it can happen is if they use silent counts.
So the Bible forbids immorality. Now there's a news flash!The problem is that you haven't bothered to establish that gay marriage is sexual immorality. Keep in mind that Jesus had absolutely nothing to say about the subject.
I'm stuck with a Revis and a Ridley jersey. No shame though I'll still rock those jerseys, two awesome players. At least I still have my McCourty jersey..
I read them in chronological order starting with Contact Harvest. I really liked reading in chronological order.  I hope to start reading escalation then catch up on the forerunner trilogy.  
I've always dripped mine and love it that way. I do coil a but higher than it seems most people do though, I like a single coil on ceramic right around .8 ohms. So not a real common configuration anymore.
Entirely possible. A little different for me though. I got a lot nicer, calmer after deconverting. There's something a bit nerve-wracking about eternal consequences that always put me on edge. And I hung out with a group that specifically defined Nice and Kind as completely different things. (did anyone else ever run across that? I'm pretty sure we were just justifying being assholes)
It's not contradictory. Snyder's rendition of Bruce Wayne died in that cave, but he will be back. Snyder has all but confirmed it. "So what I'm saying is, yes, they're dead -- and they went into it ready to die; so there's no sort of trick to it."http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/29/batman-team-addresses-that-twist-in-endgameAs for that panel. I think that's supposed to just be a father and his son, not Bruce and Damian. It's reflective of how Bruce was able to save the city. Damian didn't even appear in this arc, and its not clear where this sits in continuity, so it would be weird to hinge such an important hint in something that doesn't track well.
I had a chance to try the Pure Wand this morning. It felt really, really good!!!  The weight really works to your advantage, and the long handle made everything so much easier. The small end was very easy to use. The large end.... Took a lot of warm up time. That big round ball end felt freakin' gigantic going in!!!!  Definitely the maximum that I can handle currently. It took quite a few trues to get in. But boy did that large end do its magic once I finally got it in my ass.
Yes. After days of dealing with car accidents and children needing life-saving medical attention they should definitely take some moron with a dildo stuck up her ass VERY VERY seriously.
The addition of quick save helped this a lot. Sure, the no custom vehicles in missions thing is unfortunate, but at least you don't have to rage now because your Adder got destroyed falling off a bridge or w.e
While most athiests (especially in north america) will ridicule the beliefs that the religious will profess, I have yet to see a single atheist "dehumanize" their opposites. When and where have you seen Atheists claiming that the religious are subhuman? or undeserving of human rights? the only times and places that I can even think of that come close to your assertion are some of the dictatorships of the 20th century, and their actions were not motivated by atheism, but rather by the need to control their populations.   
They're honestly really cool, you get used to the "weirdness" of the design way faster than you might expect, and they really do sound very even and consistent across the whole bass.I'm not really a boutique "coffee table" bass kinda guy, but man, their [Super P basses](http://www.dingwallguitars.com/basses/super-p/super-p-gallery/) make me drool.
But we'd both pay $9.99 to see that.Isn't he doing stuff for CZW? Aren't they like extreme stuff, they should do a Punjabi Prison Match with CJ Parker.
It hasn't been confirmed yet, but I'm totally waiting for the Imperial Cutter. I may actually skip the Anaconda if a firefighting equivalent comes out by the time I get rich(Grinding like a mofo once finals are over).
Actually, I miss a lot of 4.* press and hold features that are gone now. And the left pull for notification, right pull for settings, but I guess they decided those features were too confusing.
Have they come out and made their endorsement yet?I mean, we know who they're backing, and always have backed, but you know - out of respect they could at least be plain about it.
The best way to improve your practicing is to understand why you're trying to practice. What are you trying to achieve with this exercise? Are you trying to improve your speed and rhythm? Are you trying to memorize the scales perfectly? Are you trying to make sure each note is articulated and played correctly?When you struggle in practice, take a moment to focus on one element of the exercise at a time. Just make sure you can play at that tempo. Then make sure you can hit the strings in the right sequence. Then fret the right notes. Then put it together. Yes it's muscle memory, but you need to figure out where the problem is one piece at a time. Take apart the toaster one part at a time to see why it won't heat up your bagel anymore.
Not sure if this the right subreddit or if anyone will answer, but here goes nothing. I am looking to get a cheap gaming mouse on Amazon for $35 or less, and have picked out a couple with very high reviews plus good features. This mouse will pretty much exclusively be used to play CSGO, and was wondering if anyone could give me an opinion considering I am pretty new
Got nothing to add just wanted to say that you are the reason I love Reddit, where I can view others opinions and see a different side of things that I couldn't see before. I find it very entertaining. 
Are you trying to tell me you lift 60lbs? Listen, I wasn't asking for advice from freaks of nature that can crush a house with their bare hands. Just regular folk.
Really like it! I was kind of surprised when my bf first asked me to do it, because I couldn't imagine it being very enjoyable for him - but apparently he likes it when he almost can't breathe? I think it feels so good, so I get a bit nervous that I'm getting a bit carried away when I start to grind (which usually escalates to me basically just thrusting myself against his mouth as hard as possible) but he'll always just push me off a bit if I get too into it, takes a few breathes, and then pushes me back on. I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him, facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that, haha.

Northern California, May - Sep, on the beach, 60°F, weekday, 11am  Most 'local' people are wearing sweaters, even most joggers are wearing shirts.  One can spot a Brit up to a 1/4 mile away.  They are wearing nothing but their brand-new swim suits which still has creases.  Drunk.  Not 'buzzed'; but obliterated.  Burnt to a crisp.  So much so that they literally glow.  Most of them are very un-Britishly friendly.  Many are eager to explain that, compared to their homeland, liquor is very cheap here.  It's funny on one hand; yet sad knowing that the rest of their 'holiday' will be spent nursing a 2nd degree burn.
Totally agree, this is a new place that I just discovered. Just a little far of a drive and havent had time to make the trip out there yet. But have stellar reviews as well which is a plus!
I think his recovery is perfect the way it is. I think it was in melee too. His is a much much better example of a glass cannon than melee fox. I think both the up b and side b allow for great mix ups overall but have definite weaknesses(length, end lag, no hitboxes on start up for up b etc) I don't think it needs to be messed with at all. I think fox's is one that should get a second look though, along with a few others 
IMO they failed on AOM on that point as well.. when i first logged in, I saw the new island on the map and went straight there. I started doing quests (starting with the ones from the docks) until they eventually just ended and didn't give me any more. It was a bizarre feeling like I was clearly missing something. Why wasn't i getting any continuation quests to other parts of the island that i hadn't been to?eventually i googled AOM to find a writeup on what all there is to do in the expansion and low and behold, there's a starter quest in freeport. As if i'm supposed to find that organically.. 
I'm am explicitly not saying one is better over another they both have different uses depending on data and power requirements.Yes over a mile IS best case, clear conditions, minimal interference, etc, BUT seeing around 4,000 feet average is doable, the antennas are only 100$ a piece, and are around the size of a nexus 7 maybe a half inch or so larger, don't remember, so no, not expensive equipment, just a simple antenna.Infact there is an xda post of someone who soldered the same antenna to their WiFi antenna inside their nexus 7 2012 and crushed a world record for farthest WiFi controlled drone flight including the own companies best results lol [Link for those interested](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1916898)And yes the video you're streaming to your TV is being streamed over WiFi.
This is going to be an awesome journey! I already took the before pic and can't wait to post some progress pics. Hopefully at the 2 month mark. Good luck!
My university's grad division is causing a similar type of language requirement debacle right now.  Grad students in my field are required to complete a foreign language requirement (either via undergrad diploma, or exam in the appropriate language department).  Foreign students however, cannot use their native language (say, Korean) to fulfil this requirement, nor can they use English (which for them, is a foreign language).  So essentially, grad division is requiring students from non-English speaking countries to be trilingual.  
So, in this case, since I just bought my True Blue membership (no loyalty points yet) - I can purchase a ticket on **May 4 @ 4PM** for the Chelsea vs. West Brom match - is that correct? 
On the 0 to 5 vs 5 to 0 thing:You could declare a variable equal to currentTime -q. Then another one equal to that -1. getAttr -t will give you the value of an attr at a certain time. So do two of those at the different times you established and subtract them from each other. If the result is positive the value is going down and vice versa. I'm writing this on my phone I hope it makes some kind of sense. I can write this out better tomorrow if you think it's the right idea. 
2045 is thirty years away. Thirty years ago was 1985. Back then current technology included encyclopedias, phone books, glove-compartment maps, 640 K RAM and phones stuck to the walls, with fifty foot cords on the handset if you wanted mobility. The year end top 100 looked like [this](http://www.oldradioshows.com/at100/1985.html). We were half an hour from complete nuclear destruction at all times. Terrorists were Irish and East German, and it looked like South Africa was going to be under apartheid forever. Things change.
[here is the thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2x6bil/taiwan_diamond_khazix_montage_double_jump/) he has some more montages like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhT1Hs6GKGM) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoxvI5QTrac)
For some reason it stuck out in my head a lot more when playing the GBA version. I'm not sure if there is added dialogue in it or not. But the dialogue definitely made it more obvious that Kefka had his eyes on Celes either way.

Actually I was looking for something specifically like this. You shouldn't be so hateful when it's Everyone's subreddit. And Obviously someone benefitted from this post Right Here. Have a good day.
I'm not sure if your GF would be thinking this, but make sure that she knows that none of the suicides were her fault or in any way related to any actions she may have done. I wanted to say that because one of my friends attempted to commit suicide (in my case, it was a happier story because she survived) a couple of weeks ago, and I had a *massive* breakdown and tons of guilty feelings because I wasn't there for her. It's important for someone to say that it's not your GF's fault, but don't bring it up unless she's mentioned that she's feeling that way because otherwise it may be unnecessary.   Best of luck with everything...I'm sorry your week has been so bad
Yup, that was the scariest part as a kid to me.... kinda like the [tunnel scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s62msrPjSVY) in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
Mostly it depends upon whether you were the one who wanted to file, or the one who wanted to stay.I'm happier now than I was say 6 months ago in my marriage.  But like someone else said.  I'm lonely, and that kind of sucks.  But life isn't all rainbows and sunshine, it's not a permanent situation unless I make it so.  In 31 days I'll be officially divorced, and then I can sit down and think about dating.
E-6 clear. Easy is pretty easy. Beat final form after using FCF. My escort fleet killed the wo-class and two DDs, and then a BB one-shot their BB, which more or less sealed the deal... Boss had 50 hp going into night. Overall it was far easier than E-5 from Winter, felt like the accuracy wasn't as bad in combined fleet. Never even failed it.Significantly less rage-inducing compared to E-5.
whatever man.Like me, don't like me.  I hope you watch the show when I make some episodes.Like it, hate it. I don't care. I am doing it all for her anyway.
Yeah I made an order on tuesday through a (supposedly) reliable vendor and still pending and not even a reply to my messages. Still cant manage to cancel order though which is pissing me off. Black bank you can cancel an order with ease and the funds go straight back to your wallet
I had this problem with my r3s. You might need to double lace your skates as you might by pulling them too tight around the arch of your foot and cutting off circulation. On my r3s i just skipped a hole where it started cramping and that helped. 
Ah, Ninjew, we feel the same.Wait! Nin*jew?*(Do you stalk victims with the cunning stealth of Woody Allen? Do your enemies live in clenched apprehension of being hit with a six-pointed Chinese throwing Star-of-David?)Sorry. I was sidetracked by hilarious images of Bernie Sanders taking on his opponents by dropping into a Ninja stance and making high-pitched karate noises.
What I'm afraid of is a potentially smaller bag of tricks for the bat. B-K, at first, makes Banjo look like he is the lead because he's the one walking around for most of the game, doing damage, etc. but Kazooie plays a huge part by running, shooting eggs, flying... they both shared equal parts of the game.With the Bat, we have flying/floating, sure, but what else? Biting? I fear the Chameleon will have much more to do and therefore hurt the Bat's spotlight (deciding to not pin names yet, just going to go with "Chameleon" and "Bat" in case our lives get flipped, turned upside down)

actually, the surface should not be considered "does everything the iPad does but better".it does a lot of the same things, worse. and then it does some other things that pc's do that iPads don't, but i mean at that point you're just buying a pc. 
I mean if the baron is free it makes closing the game safe actually 0_o only if they can't defend their base at all would you just push them in.  I always go for all inhibs unless we get an ACE or 4 dead or their carries dead for some time to end the game.
But they are both theories. That's how science works. New evidence could come to light that totally changes how we see the world. You have to accept that our theories are just the best idea we have right now. They may never change drastically - I'm not saying I don't believe in ether of them obviously. It's just important to accept that science is slow process of building knowledge and evidence on top of each other. Being blind to the possibility that you could be even slightly wrong doesn't allow for progress. It's hubris. 
Why is everyone so upset about this? Sure I can understand disagreeing with me but who really cares. I don't tip. I don't think about it. It's not something that I care about. I just go about my life not tipping. I didn't realise so many people take this stuff seriously. It's cool to see such passion. I just really don't give it that much thought and I don't really care about it. Sorry guys. 
Are you talking about Milton Friedman? If so, he advocated for a negative income tax, not as an endgame strategy, but as a temporary solution to more efficiently transition from a coercive welfare system toward a voluntary one.

They got really creative with some of them. And some of them really make me wonder how ESRB settled with an M reading and not an Ao if they still do that. It's good to take your time with games. I find that the more you binge play the quicker you get tired of it
Try out r/SSBM. It's a much, much better sub focused on Melee, although it is definitely less active, simply because there are fewer fans of competitive melee than there are of smash in general. 
Personally I don't like upgrade rings. I'm sentimental and will never part with the ring my husband gave me when he proposed. I don't care if we can afford a ring 4x better, that's my ring and it was such a special memory, so I cherish it. There are lab made diamonds now too, which are supposedly cheaper than natural diamonds. May be worth looking into also. 
I actually know someone who never used a condom because he thought he was sterile from all the pot he smoked. He's got 5 kids with his wife now, plus a couple with women before her. You'd think after the first...

From a legal/ethical perspective, that's not entirely true."You can use the serial numbers provided as a part of the download only if you legitimately purchased CS2, CS2 applications, Acrobat 7, or Audition 3."Source:https://helpx.adobe.com/x-productkb/policy-pricing/creative-suite-2-activation-end-life.html#how_to_installOn one hand, they probably don't really care- hence why it's on the honor system, on the other hand, it's clear that they intend for this to be for people who have purchased CS2.
It's only wrong because YOU deem the word 'colored' racist. People in the 50s used colored like we use black. A non derogatory term used to describe a black person.If you see it this way and listen to what she says. It's obviously a business decision and not racial.  Also.....they serve many areas where minorities live. 
I assume it was over 75% last week when it was released outside of the US.  Then it dropped below 75%.  But their rules say that once they give it Certified Fresh it has to drop below 70% to remove the Certified Fresh.
I'm one of those assholes that does the last one on the highways all the time, but I've noticed that everyone wants to do the middle one.It's like they get offended when you pass them and try to out asshole you. I'm not racing you, because driving side by side with someone at any speed is retardedly dangerous. You're compounding my already bad decision with an even worse one.
We're getting a second Dachschund in June and need some more name ideas. We're having trouble deciding on anything. I love seeing all of the names on this sub so I thought I'd see if any of y'all have any suggestions!
Heh, but Clancy's stories have come closer to truth than any of this feminist garbage. I mean seriously, we had passenger jets used as weapons against America, Iran has finally decided to become a major problem, and China is screwing around with territorial claims (in South East Asia not Russia...but still).
I'm about to try to put a dual triple twisted 28g in it, just worried about the positive posthole being a touch small. I'm sure it will fit, just be a pain setting and clipping it. The build in the pic works really really well but I got some of that pre twisted stuff and figured I'd try it in something other than my Doge. Don't have TC yet or that would be the next thing cause it does seem to heat up a bit when chain-vaping. 
After three games in the new patch, I've got to ask whether Octarine Core reducing the C/D of Hand of Midas is intended, and if it is, is it OP?Situationally, it seems like it's almost unstoppable, especially in pubs. Imagine the enemy Bristleback having a 6 minute Hand of Midas, an 18 minute Octarine Core, and then massively outlevelling everyone in the game.Also why isn't there a chatwheel for 'Wait, let me Mango!'?

I spent a year trying to find one locally. I would spare you that pain, my brother (or sister) - order one (or maybe two, in case in-laws or ninjas steal one) online.I prefer [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Kuhn-Rikon-Julienne-Peeler-Plastic/dp/B001UOLPMW) over the other one I linked.In any case, don't buy anything from OXO - makers of knives which are not full tang should be horse whipped and forced to listen to the Frozen soundtrack for a month.
the rabid ammounts of people who take everything as canon, TLT songs, fanart, theories and all. It feels like they HAVE to take it all as canon or they'll explode or something, also, the fact it seems like everyone's a jerk to each other, I'm not saying everyone should be 100% nice 100% of the time, but it still bothers me how people with differing opinions seem like they want to kill each other and drink their blood in a shotglass whilst feasting on their flesh cooked medium rare, it just bothers me.

I like how you describe your psychedelic trip as a journey... That's exactly how it is in experience. When someone else has freaked out during a trip it's comforting to know another has gone through the same thing and understands. It's crazy and probably sounds idiotic to people who haven't partaken, but I'm sure you get it.
If they had just chosen to spawn in a first world country they would've been much better off. I'm not even sure why people bother to try to level up in places other than a first world country.EDIT: Obligatory /r/outside
I was in Düsseldorf last year and there were signs everywhere in the U-Bahn with something to the effect of "Goldbären brauchen kein Schweinflesich." And the accompanying pictures had a gummy bear made out of pigskin. It was a pretty great campaign.I could be wrong about the American gummy bears being vegetarian, though. I remember reading that somewhere. I don't eat many gummy bears, but if I did I'd prefer they be Haribo. Alas.

I've been on both sides of the spectrum, salty and inducing the salt. I've always wanted to try breaking someone when they're like this. Just out right call him out on it, "get your fucking shit together or fuck off outside until you do have it together". He/she is acting like a child so treat them like a child.      Me and my practise partner have a pretty good relationship psychologically, we'll talk about our mental state particularly the vibe of the play if it's getting off kilter (I have a tendency to get vicious if I've been having a bad day).
i disagree with a lot of thatany good striker Bader cant consistently take down outclasses him on the feet, that would definitely be the case with Rumble, i dont know if you know this but Rumble has great Takedown defense; 85% and Davis couldnt do anything vs him, I doubt Cormier will be able to just lie on him, he might be able to take him down a couple times but its also going to be stand up fight and Cormier could actually win and would be a deserving champ unlike Bader imoout of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling, his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good, he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won, the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader
I wouldn't, I would leave. In fact that's what I did. I wasn't married yo my ex thankfully but he was pretty similar, especially the whole thing about making you feel like shit for sticking up for yourself. We were together nearly five years and leaving him was the best thing I have ever done. I don't even want to think about where I would be right now if I had stayed. 
I don't ride anymore but I used to a lot growing up. I lived in Bellvue which is about 20minutes west of Fort Collins, Old Town. There is a fantastic little state park there called Lory State Park (which is just on the other side of Horsetooth reservoir if you already know the area). It is very horse friendly and lots of places to unload ect. There are a small amount of bikers and hikers, weekends are busier of course. Pretty much any encounter I have had with folks there is great. Everyone knows the trails and trail etiquette and I've never had any issues. They do day passes or you can get a state park pass as well. I would highly recommend the area. Beautiful trails and not too far from town. 
Yea, he really makes use of the body as a canvas to his advantage. Too many tattoos are ruined because the artist didn't accommodate for the curves, but this one works so well.

Unfortunately you are quite correct with regards to no one implementing policy etc. I live in New Zealand and we have regular round table discussion on law, policy etc. involving law academics, psychologists, criminologists, then our government routinely ignores the advice it asked for. Year after year. 
Think about this. Hundreds of years ago some important European scholar/artist made that picture and made a design choice in making the horse look that way. Now I'm laughing at it on the shitter.
A work excuse.Maybe it's because patients cut me off before I get two words out when I go to discharge them to ask for one, maybe it's because some people obviously are just there for one, but 9/10 times I get aggravated when they ask for one.Not that there's anything wrong with them wanting or needing one, I think I just have issues

My older brother was a serious asshole to me. My revenge was to wipe boogers on the wall next to his bed. He wouldn't notice, but when my mom changed sheets on Sundays, she sure did. Big bro got his ass whooped so many times for that...
If you are being serious, then absolutely and humbly apologize.However, I get the distinct feeling that you're not. People need to be held accountable for the words that they put on the internet.

The amount of "I'd kick you too," "They're room, their right to kick you," and "Well it's your fault for ______" is just staggeringly stupid. If a person has the skill, their armor shouldn't matter. I'm tempted to make a low rank armor set and try to kill Dalamadur JUST to prove that.

They do make a decent living, it's just through tips. You're coming at this like you feel the American way is inferior, when in fact many people make more from tips than Europeans do through their wages. It's just a different way of doing things (better in some cases, worse in other), but feeling an air of superiority or indignant that you should learn/research a local custom before visiting a foreign country is just flat out ignorant.
&gt; I have grown up around firearms and have a homemade range in a field out back, i shoot a ton and have carried on my person around the house for the past 6 years or so.This does not make you prepared to use your gun defensively. It has almost zero bearing on how well you will fare in a real fight for your life. You need the stresses of training and the eye of a competent instructor to evaluate you and help you improve. I'm not saying you have to spend thousands of dollars at the top firearms schools in the nation, but just find a decent two day course in your area and sign up for that. It will do wonders for you.

I had an overlay-vision very similar to this last month. To my understanding, what I saw was "[Indra's Net](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra%27s_net)", and speaks to the interconnectivity of all things.

They work like any other comm, you do fps and ops to get them (and some weeklies). Once you hit the weekly cap you can't earn anymore for that week. Are you sure you're earning ult comms for whatever fp you're doing and not a different comm? And if you are earning ults are you checking the currency tab in your inventory to see if they're being added?

When you do that you still space after the period, also an em dash is better than an ellipsis for how you'd like that read. Unless you want people to think you trailed off like a Alzheimer patient and then said Night!

Very interesting graph, thanks! So then where there's overlap between, say splitter and changeup or slider and cutter, those are distinguished by speed?
I work on small accounts with a flat commission but I was taking advantage of the ability to upsell that none of the other salespeople in the company used or even knew about. My base commission is $500, which is high considering the volume that can be sold in a day, but I upsold the customer to $2000 more than the usual $200 upfront cost. That $2000 was all my profit. So that's about the commission from 5 sales. The company has since eliminated the up selling option because of that sale. 
Sure. Good point. But there's a big difference between the big, important coming out conversations with close friends and the casual "do you have a boyfriend" "no I date women" "cool" conversations... When I was coming out to important people and it was new and a big deal, I needed to hear that it was okay. But if I'm at a party and being introduced to someone and they find out and do the speech, that's when it gets annoying. I never meant that my friends and family weren't allowed to react like that during the initial coming out situation. That's normal. I'm just saying, you don't have to tell every single gay person you meet that it's okay they're gay...
To be honest mods can go both ways, as they can make players easier to spot in some environments but harder to spot in other ones. For example multicam shows up more in desert maps, but hides well in forest settings. Another example would be pmc skins, they make the player easier to spot due to a lack of camo, but also makes it harder to tell if they're enemy or friendly. 
A lot of the characters are very off in the dub.  Homura comes off as emotionless, which she is distinctly not in the Japanese track, and Kyoko sounds like Angelica Pickles, which is VERY off from her character in Japanese.  Madoka's voice actress comes off as more irritating than she does cute, and you can tell that's what she is trying for.  The only decent one is Sayaka, and that's still several levels below the quality of her Japanese counterpart.

Caesar is mentioned in the Bible but Christians weren't really seen as a significant movement in the Roman Empire until after the death of Christ during Paul's time.&gt; Mark 12:16-17 &gt; "They brought one. And He said to them, "Whose likeness and inscription is this?" And they said to Him, "Caesar's." And Jesus said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were amazed at Him."

Any human interaction can be seen as a form of teaching. When I was Pre-K I was taught to tie my shoes, I learned to read, etc. What you get out of school is a combination of what you put in, what others put in, and the materials or intelligence among those involved. Case in point - I hated math at a younger age, until I found a teacher that had a disposition that nothing you could say or do could make her mad. She LOVED algebra and she loved teaching. If I had had more teachers like her in my elementary math classes, I would probably have loved math previous to her. TL;DR - A good teacher, a good mentor, is a big deal at any age.

Honestly, not as much as I used to. I agree, he was (and still is, presumably) a great villain, but with everything else going on this season and with more formidable foes being introduced/reintroduced (Bill, the Shapeshifter, Giffany, Society of the Blind Eye), I kind of feel like Gideon's been shoved to the sidelines, which I find myself strangely okay with. I don't mind that he will return, but I'm not anxiously anticipating it either.

Apart from all the in-game mechanics, I want to test out the new client, I'm running a horrible crappy toaster and I can manage to run the current PoE at around 20 - 30 FPS. From what I've heard, the new client seems to be really promising and I want to make sure that it can run on crappy toasters too so people like me, don't have problems running PoE and find the best optimization to do so.Edit : Also, I forgot about removal of desync and the introduction of ping, I'm from India (which means horrible packet loss but I blame that on my ISP from sucking ass) so my ping is always 150 - 200 ms even while using Singapore gateway, this will, to some extent allow me to test out how lockstep mode feels with high ping (which maybe others won't be able to do?) and whether desync is still the more viable option for players with high ping. 
I thought it would be fun to add that for a player like Killua, who can run there in a flash and defeat the captain instead of wasting a card, it's the logical choice. I don't even know if they had a leave card, and I think those are expensive.
Sorry to hear about your trouble. I'd imagine most of us on /r/ Pokemon have similar stories. The GTS has been needing serious improvements since it was introduced. GameFreak seems to ignore the criticism when it comes to that aspect of online.

We would be swimming. He is not interested in public sex. I am more adventurous than he is.He has social anxiety and would not feel comfortable being around the owners of the airbnb in general, let alone using their bathroom and kitchen. He has to run water while he is using my bathroom at home, and he won't use my kitchen unless i am there. (also because to be polite to my mom - he is okay when she is not there.) and at his house, i can't be near when he is using his bathroom.I fully support his mental health difficulties and am sure lurkers who have mental health difficulties are happy to hear of someone being so supportive.
But the weird thing is is that she wasn't able to get the exact form down.  Her Pearl form had features of Pearl but did not look exactly like Pearl, and when she wanted to be more strong only one arm and one leg became buff...Maybe it was due to her regenerating too fast.
I've formatted the hard drive now. It's no biggie. I tried installing the newest windows 10 that came out two days ago or so. Might be fun. THey also released drivers for Win 10.

Loose Cannon is fun to play with, but I don't feel like I'm doing near as much damage (I can consistently land pills with stock).10% faster spin up hardly seems worth it with the -20% damage, especially with how often you're already spun up before you actually see someone.

One of the things that's easy to forget is the Stanford and UC Berkeley are here. No place else in the world are two of the best computer science schools close enough to loathe one another. Combine those with a liberal culture where it's OK to fail and people willing to take big financial risks, and you have a startup hub.There are easy-ish answers. There are popular answers. There are no easy-ish popular answers.

What I don't understand is why people are held responsible for their actions when drunk, except in consent. If some one drinks and drives, then they are held accountable. If you can't keep yourself from behind the wheel when you drink, dont drink. If you consent to random guys/gals when you're drunk, don't drink. What's wrong with that? Why the inconsistency? 
Seconded on the natural food sources.  I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.Best of luck!
Russians are professionnals to blur the line between "civilians" and military. But the moment you pick and handle military gear you aren't entirely a civilian imho. I'm not saying shooting them is ok, but arresting them when caught red handed is normal.
I had accidentally created this subrreddit for dnd attack wing althought i never started playing it.  I'm not sure how popular it is.  This subreddit was more of a mistake as http://www.reddit.com/r/dndattackwing makes a bit more sense.  However that subreddit doesn't have much either.
I haven't. I really want to learn how to do well on this guy, and I'm fairly successful early, but late game I end up not doing much. A large part of the problem is me going too ham in teamfights with a squishy mage-support build, but are there any other tips you could give me?
No. Just no. How you calculate DPS is not up for debate. If youre trying to argue the value of burst DPS versus Sustained DPS i can at least try and understand your arguement. But what you just said and used as your examples is completely irrelevant and does not change anything. DPS is calculated over the average length of a fight. Longer fight, lower DPS. Its that simple
The pearl-ex is done by hand whereas the UV is printed by my fancy printer.We try to line it up as best as possible, but there's usually some discrepecny. You'd of course have to be looking for it with and without UV to notice (hence why this is the first time in quite a while I recall seeing it brought up).Experimented with adding UV to the pearl-ex, but its not nearly as crisp and decided against it.For any faintness: its printed using a high-quality printer and gives *very* consistent results. Might be a subjective thing. All the reviews say its the best OH UV by a landslide and ther's not much I can do to improve it.Although the new blues have different UV, so there's that to look forward to ;)
Yay!  Edmunds originally had the old warranty info on their review, so I contacted them about correcting it.  http://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/321nlv/straight_as_from_edmondscom_almost/cqcftu8Props to insideevs.com for pulling through the correction.

www.mirillis.com is an advertisement to the website, which I assume you use to record with? The video had massive black bars all around it, so something was up with the video size.

I had a leak in a seal for the oil return line for turbo that went to the engine.  Pretty easy and cheap fix. You really need to clean the engine and find out where it is coming from.
I am a painter and otherwise artist and am considering a new venture, since I need to fund a few ceremonies this year. You've seen all those hand painted shoes with pop-culture-y things painted on them--what about pagan-y/polytheist-y/occult-y shoes? Would you be interested in hand painted shoes of that nature? If so, what would you want to wear on your feet? I've got an evil eye pair in the works and I'm curious as to what else might be of interest.Thoughts?
Yea, and it was horrible, 1 in every 100 dragoons managed to survive more than 10 seconds into a fight, and it fully solidified the lolDRG stigma transfering from FFXI to FFXIV.
Actually, if I look like hell this week it's because I just started a hardcore diet and exercise program :) Six days in, my brain no work as good... but it's feeling okay. I don't want to knock off Wingman's Weight, but feel free to cheer for me if I get smaller over the next few months!

I suspected this for a while.  It seems like they are counting upload, as well as download bandwidth.  Thanks for the reminder though, I'm going to monitor my traffic in May to figure this out as I'm always 5-10gb away from going over every month.
And able-ist. Rapunzel's tears cure the Prince's blindness. Why? Is there something *wrong* with blind people? Can we not appreciate diversity of human bodies?And sexist. Rapunzel is known for her hair, implying that women are defined by their appearance and nothing else. She is also saved by, you guessed it, a MALE. Because women need the help of MEN to have any kind of success in life. 
The only way I know how is to modify the save file so that you ruler was actually born at some point in the future. Because the game doesn't check if the ruler should be alive, it is impossible for him to die until that date. Also, it doesn't check for regency except upon succession, so when the date your ruler is born on occurs you won't get a regency.However, I have no idea how to actually modify a save file.
Nah, it's more so some of these light- to middleweights can fight at a more natural weight. Bump welter down to 165, middle to 175, light heavy to 185, and cruiser at 195.
I only wish you could put the drawer on the left and the mirror on the right. I looked at the instructions and it doesn't look possible. :/Edit: I mean drawer on right, mirror on left. 
Well the huge problem was that you had to get out without being called an appeaser and a Neville Chamberlin.  Nixon called it a dignified peace, but could not deliver.
Yeah. Demons are really tough and heavily armored, and heal incredibly fast most anything short of death or dismemberment. You can kill them without wards, but it's really difficult. A lion or grizzly bear would have a decent shot at injuring/killing one, and if they fed on demon meat, they would take some of that power for themselves.
Unfortunately, not a lot. At the local level there is a huge gap in coverage on the real issues concerning citizens.

But she was however being watched, Gelos had found a perch atop one of the book cases and was watching with clear interest after putting down his book on some of the forests of Remnant, searching for a possibility of locating his own home village.**His grin widens as he moves to the side of the case as the purple haired girl approaches, jumping down in a flip, quickly getting to his feet with a goofy smile only a foot away.* "Hiya Amethyst!"

Albums are a whooooole other story! So many fire albums.
Vaping may not be the healthiest hobby (not enough research yet to really confirm or deny) but I can tell you it's a lot better for you than smoking and the mucousy cough is something that happens to all smoked after they quit it's just trying to clean all the extra tar and gunk in your lungs out, it's the beginning of your lungs healing themselves 
I mained Sona for a *long* while (and still play her on occasion), but she sucks to play that often because her kit is so boring and it's pretty hard to make big plays with her because her abilities are so cut-and-dry (which definitely works in some cases). Annie can make plays and peel for her ADC, whereas Sona's peel is limited to mashing buttons and running out of mana.Also, people get really whiny when you don't use DJ Sona even though I have all of her skins and I think Guqin is prettiest.
&gt;the sun radiates 1000 watts per square meter to the earths surface, and doesn't vaporize usThere are 1 million square millimeters in a square meter, so 1000W/m^2 works out to only 0.001W/mm^2. So no, that doesn't vaporize us, but the 1W/mm^2 laser is a thousand times more powerful per unit area.
I hope you aren't being serious and you understand that most if not all of the people acting "hysterical" in the BIGBANG MV threads were hamming it up due to a combination of BIGBANG releasing their first songs in 3 years and wanting to be funny.
I honestly value Boris as a better offensive player than Nic, and I don't think it's close. Defensively, Nic is a better player on the perimeter, but I don't think he can guard any big body like Boris does.

Texas Method is primarily a strength training program, the goal is to get your lift numbers up. More strength equals more muscle, control your caloric intake and you'll look like you lift. Going heavy on the deadlifts will really get your back developed.
Coast Capital isn't the be-all and end-all though. We  had a bad experience with them, left, and won't be back. I realise your mileage has varied, but they don't work for everybody.
After "beating" the game in beta, I've restarted upon the 1.0 release and pledged I won't lose Jeb (or any Kerbals) in the cold dark abyss. However, a mishap led to a lack of a possible revert, and so Jeb went far from gently into that good night.On a brighter note, Jeb reappeared in my Kerbal inventory sort of randomly, so he's again free to rage against the dying of his light.
I guess, but there were 2 posts mocking any criticism of the GDQs, so I wanted to provide input on that. Talking about stuff shouldn't make it worse, even if it doesn't make it better either.
Isn't that the point though? We live in a rape culture BECAUSE there are a lot of people who make jokes about men who will "without a doubt" get raped in prison (and those who really do), thinking it's funny or they're obviously a pussy if they're getting raped in the first place. Just as it pertains to a woman or a transgender person getting raped or being joked about getting raped. Rape culture is applicable to EVERYONE or ANYONE who has been raped or sexually assaulted in any way, not just women alone.
The Grand National is slightly different: there are quite high fences (not very common in other championships) and there are many more horse than usual.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfNpAewK4m4Some of the horses that fall down may be quite scared.
That being one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen, my poor brain went one step further and answered the question about how hams have sex :( 
Not true.  You have it wrong.Tree on my house due to hurricane.  I paid to get things fixed out of pocket and collect from insurance later.   Same with when a main water pipe burst in the joint.  I have not wrecked a car so i do not know but i know if it was toataled i would go get a new car and not sit around waiting for insurance.  Same if my shit was all stole,  I would replace out of my pocket what i needed and collect from ins later.

CoE interacts the way it does with waste 6 piece bonus in order to prevent any double dipping from its particular huge bonus. You'll notice that if you run wind shear and have 40% lightning from ammy and bracers, that will apply at all other times while CoE is on the other elements. 
dont use the green bottle either. It's extra strength or something and it will dry off the top layer of skin on your balls until it all comes off like dandruff the next time you itch your balls.
Kifflom!

Honestly, its like expecting a massive political machine in Japan to actually give a shit, and frankly, I'm not holding my breath. My guess,another 50 years and maybe another Murayama gets elected.
I'm not really sure either. Just making fun of Australians in a non specific way. The Loop Zoop thing is from a thread about a year ago, it was pretty funny. 
I would definitely say go for it. But you have to do it right, and clearly spell out your intentions. I'm honestly sick of the amount of times a girl has told me that they've wanted my number, but that the guy has to do the chasing. No, I think that's BS in this day and age. If you want something, go get it. PS: Totally hypocritical as I have the hardest time talking to women due to low self esteemed issues and countless times being rejected.

I'm not saying he was a good coach for you or that he is even a good NBA coach, he is clearly a better college coach.  I am says no the deck is stacked against in the NBA if you don't have players. Antonie Walker wasn't a bad player, but he was in his early 20s and was the best player on the roster.  How are you supposed to beat Jordan Bulls, Shaquille/Kobe Lakers, and Spurs with a roster like that.My only point is it has nothing to do with college coaches and everything to do wthat th players.

I was pretty pumped because we had a great film director working alongside a great game director, this could have been an amazing game with two amazing creative minds working on it. It's a shame, especially for Del Toro since it's his second attempt at working on a game and once again the project is canned. I'd love to see a game with his name on it, and I thought Silent Hills would be perfect for him, but it seems he just can't get get going in the games industry.

Very mixed feelings.  I just quit three weeks ago (hard as shit to do) and I'll admit that I thought it made me some super edgy streetwear god but its honestly terrible for you and so expensive.  Plus everyone outside of cities that are fashion conscious are going to think you're gross.  It's hard to feel cool when girls are curving you over cigarettes.  It's definitely an aesthetic thing but I feel like all these young kids who worship Ian Connor don't really understand how shitty it gets after a while.  Now that I quit I have so much more money to buy clothes.

Dude, I'm sorry, but you're embarrassing yourself by posting this.  Everything /u/greentoof said is completely accurate.

&gt; You'll also have to tell me how recently American society rejected rock and roll as the devils music, because the rest of the world considers it to be an American invention.You talk like a person who is barely 20 (well, even if you're 30 honestly you might not remember) if you even have to ask about the history of Rock and Roll in America and how it was perceived.
It was interesting, really good. But very sugary! I kind of splurged because I had a medical procedure the other day, and on top of it, my time of the month. But yeah, I don't like it enough to want to eat it more. I'm back to watching my food now.
I agree it is good to see this and a great year for cameras, I love how great the pictures and videos are now on small camera, my point is they are putting way too much effort in stuff that we would use once and never use again, we would mostly use the front camera for selfies. again not bad over done compared to how bad the speakers or the system skin usually are.

100k is a 10% deposit on a million dollar loan. It's why the grants are shit, the govt gives you say $7,000, but that instantly lets you borrow $35,000-$105,000 (5-30% deposit) more than you would have if not for the grant. Disclaimer: I've used the grant but didn't let it increase my budget because I'm not a moron. Loans are already too easy to get anyway. Recently was upgrading from unit to house and the bank was like "y u no want $2million dollah?!?" We only applied for less than half a mill which is already stupid but we can afford easily. 
It's different kinds of nihilism, INTPs' is more existential I feel since we're always trying to contextualize everything in a very deterministic manner.INTJ nihilism would more tied to their pragmatism(or lack thereof) I feel. Like they feel genuine disdain for people.

For what it's worth, I really liked it. I'm impressed. Even if it was a little anvilicious. Nice to see Dave confronting himself about the shit he used to pull.eta2: I really, really, really like this update. Though it doesn't progress the plot much, it's great that we're getting a moment where characters can just resolve all these fucking issues through communication rather than w/e alternative. It reminds me of the scene where all the Alpha kids were chatting on their sacrificial slabs. Things are really getting addressed. Actual attention. Fuck, I'm so primed for the next several convos.

I understand where you're coming from and I want to clarify that I'm more talking about legislation against smoking outdoors as opposed to people who simply complain.The point I was trying to make was that I feel people are generally less tolerant of smoking then they are of something like car exhaust, which is equally dangerous and unpleasant.  I think that when talking about restricting social rights and freedoms, only the danger to other people should be taken into account.I don't agree with the line of thinking of "I'm willing do put up with the danger of X activity, because I do it or sympathize with it, but think that the equally dangerous activity of Y should be illegal, because I don't sympathize or agree with the choices of people who do that."

Druid / Monk &gt; Pally &gt; Disc Priest &gt; Resto ShamanThe versatility of Druid and weaving of spells for Mistweaver really get me going. I've recently started trying Pally again and it feels far more interesting than when I last played it, maybe it's because I'm used to raid healing but I adore the ability to keep chucking out strong single-target spells.I tried Shammy and Priest in MoP, ended up choosing their respective DPS specs instead.

The first few episodes are particularly childish but once it hits a groove it gets really fun. I've re-watched it several times and still enjoy it a lot. 
My thoughts exactly. They should focus on what is already achieved (and this is amazing, I'm a Gear VR owner and it's a great device) than some fake photorealistic multiplayer game with whole body input incorporated. I know we hate Microsoft for their false advertising (Project Natal) but I don't see much of a difference here.
Well the problem, without getting into politics, is that a two party system monopolizes the view points and issues that can get tackled. Factor in the necessity to be extremely conservative on order to get the tea party votes you need to get the republican nomination and fairly left to get the democratic nomination there really isn't any place for a seriously moderate candidate, which most of America would enjoy.  
probably the longer wheelbase, the fact that the longest wheel base on the baffle (26in) is shorter than the prophecy's wheelbase (27.5) might be a reason why. Are you using the same wheels that your were using on your baffle?
I don't see what's so insensitive about saying "women". It was a young woman who was raped, and it is women who are most vulnerable to these types of assault. Being upset about that seems a little too nitpicky and "assholeish" to me.

Funny, we're talking about people dying and stuff, and the game's about a guy coping with someone's death! XDHaha so true!

I normally have someone dying, though sometimes I build up for suicides that don't actually happen!

Okay, but it took Moustakas about a full calendar year to do it and he still occasionally pulls the ball into the shift.  Not that Howard shouldn't have it figured out by now, but I think saying it's easy is kinda bullshit.

Nah, you're right. It wasn't just him, just saying I distinctly remember it.The Bork rush was mega-bad. It makes sense in a tank meta (just for the passive % Current HP+120% attack speed from Q), but that didn't even exist at the time.Then they changed it from BT/Bork rush on every ADC that isn't Ashe, to IE rush on every ADC regardless, and people realized she pumps out a shit ton of damage with an IE+Q.

And not to be an ass, but you have a role in this as well. An inspector's job is to highlight the state of the home in the condition it's in, no matter the condition, good or bad. Just like he might point out places of water damage inside the attic or on the ceiling, it's *your job* to investigate further if the roof condition is of an acceptable state to you. He pointed out the efflorescence, it's up to you to decide if that's important to you &amp; to investigate further. He did his job, he pointed out the efflorescence. It was up to you to act on the information he provided &amp; do further investigation if warranted by you.

STEM jobs are paid more not because they're harder than teaching, i agree. But because they create more wealth. A team of people can create a piece of software or develop a product and generate millions or billions in revenue. Companies see a return on their investment and pay handsomely for it.Teachers, not so much.

I was thrilled when you mentioned that UofU study about distracted driving. Great school.I'm not aware of anything sketching going on with the Mormons in Las Vegas.

Understandable that they might run into trouble along the way given it was called "the wild west" at the time.

Hmm, sounds cool, but brings me back to the point made on the thread, having the explosion as cold damage could provide a easy freeze/shatter effect making the mechanic overly strong?
&gt;Angelici insistió con que los clubes no pueden tener la responsabilidad absoluta de erradicar a los barras y pidió otra vez que el Estado asuma toda la responsabilidad. "Tiene la concreta posibilidad de aplicar el derecho de admisión, pero tiene que explicar por qué. Nos comprometimos con Berni a trabajar juntos y usar las herramientas legales que tenemos a mano".&gt;En este punto, el juez en lo civil José Luis Bournissen, quien dispuso que Boca reincorporara como socio activo a Rafael Di Zeo, aclaró que no es su competencia resolver el tema del derecho de admisión y remarcó que debe ser el Estado quien se ocupe.Nadie quiere admitir responsabilidad ni hacerse cargo
Huh that's not a method I knew about. I'm almost entirely self taught as a blacksmith, everything I know comes from the internet, books, and trial and error. I'm about to start formal training in chicago though
I "dumped" a friend for the same reason. A good friend and former professor passed away and it hit me hard. I asked her if we could meet for beers so I could toast Prof. Blackburn's life. At the pub, I realized she never ever even asked about my prof.... or my life in general. She was yacking the whole time about some guy in her class. After that it hit me that she took 0 interest iny life
Well. I was kinda tripping out when I wrote that, but luckily I can translate a good majority of BO me's philosophies. The eyes are the windows to the soul. The eyebrows are the drapes. Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside, your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings/ what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged, just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and "knit" when you are feeling anxious or judged, but if you keep them flat or slightly arched, you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS. BO me was actually talking about shaving them off. This would equate to *no emotions* being reflected off. So 0% judgement. Let me know if you need me to elaborate more. 
We know what Blake needs to work on - adding another pitch, working in his offspeed stuff more, and fielding. Strasburg has everything a great pitcher needs, he just doesn't put it together consistently.
As much as I sympathize, when you say that you had to take care of your kid for 3 days, it's not single parenting. It demeans the insane level of work that single parents have to do, and the hurdles that we have to jump. 
It doesn't matter where there is or isn't, the key is that it is beyond the realm of accessible truth-judgements. We can talk about facts regarding the real world. Regarding the afterlife, we cannot-- especially because it can't be proven, as you suggest.
Off the top of my head:Sit with your back against something, maybe with your legs crossed. Use music that will keep you awake but won't interfere too much.Drink something caffeinated beforehand.
PPP is the proper GDP to use when averaging purchasing power across the globe. Putting Ghana at 124B PPP for adjustments due to working refugee's and growth. Our military is small. So to make up for that we'd like to use newer equipment. Instead of creating a larger military with older equipment.
I had some friends that were in really tight financial situations for a while and had to lift their groceries. Just letting you know that the Hartman's downtown doesn't have an electronic sensor on the doors, if it ever gets tough. The food bank is a good option but sometimes it's not enough. 
&gt;Just ask yourself: how many of the guys in your town would be ok with it if their immediate boss was Pakistani? How many would not feel weird if their daughter brought an Albanian or a Romanian to be married? I feel like the majority of white Greeks feel people of color (blacks and south asians specifically) are inferior until proven differently.I personally know Greek couples with Albanians and Romanians. But this only proves my point, because those two ethnicity are not looked down upon as they where 20 years ago since they are mostly "middle class" now.My home town has a Pakistani public library in full view, and a lot of stores for such a small town.  Is there all roses? Obviously not, I was the first to admit there is a barbaric practices happening. Is it based on the color of your skin? Nope.  
Did he say where he lived?  I took the 7 train to and from Times Square from and to Jackson Heights (back in the day) but the train from Times Square to Yankee Stadium didn't have a number.  That is so cool, dude!
I'm afraid all I can give you is support. I also have issues with my father, thought not in the same area. All the same, I can relate to how hurtful being objectified is. To get it from someone who is (supposed to!) being your father must be even worse... here are hugs *hug*
So after reading the replies so far it seems there is no difference and people just use Yahoo or ESPN because it is what their league has always used? Interesting :) 
How the fuck am I supposed to respond to this? The "There's the door" comment is stupid as hell, no idea when anyone ever makes it. All it's saying is "I'm too stupid to defend my side of the argument, better just tell the other person to leave"
I was calling it as a joke, Who would really think there was a skull of ali baba in Destiny? Had to laugh at being corrected though.And we call Sharks, Skanks rather than Shanks ; -)
It was Irish dance, but it's the same kind of rigorous physical training you need. Coincidentally they were lovely people outside of dance, but they turned into massive cunts as soon as they stepped into the studio.
I'm not sure what his top feats are. You can check out his respect thread if you want to know that. I'm planning on finishing the series up and I know that some of his feats include spoilers. But it is said he can control *any* vector, and as far as I know this has remained true. So he should be able to stop Juggernaut. 
Had a thing with a Giants fan earlier in the year. Never doing that again. Whatever. I knew more about baseball than he did anyway... I need someone more on my level.
Bullshit.  Guys get accused and they automatically belive the accuser.  I think the majority of accusers, aka the victim, are believed with little to no proof which is why you are seeing more and more cases of false accusations.  Not saying that there are not people w who don't want to come forward, but in the end, you have to make the effort to come forth before you complain about the lack of action.  
Was the van driver african american? If so its an extremely important detail since whites and white cops seem to be the current target of much of the outrage.Now that we know [definitively](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/justice-department-finds-that-ferguson-officer-did-not-violate-michael/article_06cfab32-5fb1-59dc-bf47-5711ae36cd8a.html) Officer Wilson was right about Mike Brown this looks like another case of a conclusion drawn a bit too early. Even Eric Holder has admitted the "hands up don't shoot" narrative was wrong now.
So I know you've already got a reason for your pact but I'd consider this:Cooking is fundamentally a form of chemistry, and in D&amp;D chemistry is basically alchemy, and alchemy is a type of magic.Your character is not just a cook, he's *avante garde*, he wants to push the boundaries of cooking, so he made a contract. A contract with an entity that knows many great and terrible recipes. As an adventurer he scours the globe for rare and exotic ingredients.

Huh, I assume there's two ways to interpret "I was adopted." One is how you did, and that's him justifying the comparison Jeff drew, and the other is the one I made, which was that he was doing his normal Dan thing and just correcting Jeff in a condescending manner. There's no way to know which it was, so let's call it an impasse.
Ya me too, i heard he dumped fusion multiple times, him and meteos double killed tsm mid once and other than that he was pretty average, also Lan &gt; Scrims
Thanks for that Ben Affleck. For a lot of people, I think reading things like this can make them reevaluate how they compose their stance on things.Also, I'm a huge fan.
This turns a 1 circle fight into a 2 circle fight. It only allows you to get 1 pass at your enemy in a circle as you bottom out after one loop. After your initial circle is completed you will be in seperate circles getting passes at each other. Wether or not this is an advantage for you depends on the ship matchup
Haha nice Bullock add. This is a nice mash up of current, 08' and 05' Suns teams. Interesting on the Shaq choice. It seems real but at age 36, shaq played 30 minutes/game, 17.8 PPG and 8.4 Rebounds for us and lead the entire NBA in FG% at 61%, beating out Dwight howard, Yao Ming, Pau Gasol and even Amare.This is a very electric team you have here, only hope Shaq doesnt slow them down too much!
I have a bf but I'll answer anyway!I am pretty easily pleased... I do not like muscles I like guys with smiling eyes.One funny thing is that I don't like blondes I'm not sure why this is. I feel like a massive jerk whenever I think about this lol.
Nah. It will come back strong. A lot of people are getting tired of western games... including me. I know Kojima will come back with a bang. He wanted to revive Japanese games and I think he wont stop now.
All with you there.  Give James a chance.   He has nice banter, and if you're an infiltrator or engineer his Carnage attack causes MASSIVE BURSTS with your moves.
You forgot in The Library the Master Chief meets a dead marine (can't remember his name) who was also chosen as a reclaimer by 343. You should have to find a dead marine body and pay your respects to it. I believe there are a couple in the misson with health near them. Pay respects to the one closest to the Activation Index as it's stated that he got really far.  Also as something for the entire series try and have whatever weapon Chief has in cutscenes equipped. If he doesn't have a weapon equipped in a cutscene then go wild. 
There was definitely a plan in place imo. Adnan and Jay spoke briefly on the phone the night before. They spent the morning of the 13th together doing (?) I have come across theories that they could have been looking for a gun for Adnan to use in the murder. The Nisha call (Adnan made sure to put Jay on the phone even though he didn't know Nisha) and short visit to Cathy's house seem like an attempt at an alibi. Adnan was back at school in time for track. Imo it all went too smoothly for it to have been unplanned. On how close they were-I'd say they were probably just getting to know each other. Jay was older and more streetwise than Adnan, Adnan was a wannabe thug trying to impress him. Adnan flattered Jay's gangster image by asking him to help him, but I doubt Jay actually thought he'd go through with it. 
Good! I've been worried about you! DON'T FORGET TO GET TESTED FOR OTHER TICK BORNE ILLNESSES! Seriously, **don't forget that shit.** I was diagnosed with Babesiosis, even though the doctor said we didn't have that in our area!How long are you going to be on antibiotics to start? Which antibiotic were you prescribed? Be aware that you may get worse on antibiotics. It's called a Jarisch-Herxeimer reaction. Prepare yourself just in case! Welcome to the Lyme Disease club. Thankfully, it was caught early so it should be cured easily. I would like to recommend you watch Under Our Skin. It's a documentary about Lyme Disease. It may be too scary for you right now, though. :(

Actually, I think the really advanced kid can be more challenging than the kid who is behind. The reality is we know what to do with kids who are behind. I literally have a plethora of interventions for kids who are behind. It's tough for the kid who is ahead because it takes a lot of personalizing his/her education. Also, these guys often have more significant behavior issues because they're bored out of their minds.  
Modern Warfare 2 was the first COD on PC to introduce paid DLC.World at War was the last COD on PC where all the additional content came free.There was a lot less "extra" content back then when it was a free addition, but I always saw it as a nice "Sorry, about all the bugs at launch. Here's a new map or 2."Now every year its... "Sorry our launch is our worst one yet... More money please :-D"
My gym teacher openly makes fuj of the "special" kids in my class. On many occasions I've told him he is a useless prick who has yet to and will never amount to anything. I'm a disrespectful teenager.

I.. I just don't get it. If they actually are that bad then that's a HUGE mistake by EA. They have a massive opportunity here to make bank by creating a 98+ Winston/Mariota and adding new promo packs to find their collectibles in. I mean, this should be the biggest promo since the Super Bowl
Varies. I wear it out to a number of types of things - some parties, anything kinda sexy (like Burlesque), etc. It really depends on the company I think will be there. Also, recently went to my mom's re-wedding, and wore a kilt, so...Edit: btw, it was fun to see the dancer's reactions when they realized I had a kilt. Lots of winks and knowing looks :D

He's going to get the max and if Portland doesn't give him it, then there's going to be a lot of other teams knocking on his door. If I was running a team though, I wouldn't want him for the max though for the reasons /u/DesertHomebody listed. But if Dragic is going to get 20mil, then I'm damn sure Lillard should, too.
1. You can find answers to the most common questions or issues at http://wiki.openttd.org/. Feel free to ask questions here, or on the official support forums at http://tt-forums.net/. 2. You need a vehicle (train, truck, etc.) fitted to goods that will transfer them from the sawmill to a building in the town that receives them. Unfortunately those buildings aren't obvious. Build a station (train or truck, for example) and as you hover near the area you build, pay attention to the Acceptance section. As you move around you'll see it change from "None" to anything that can be transported by your vehicle to that area, such as "Mail", "Food", Goods", etc.  
My only motivation was annoyance at having to read her mind.  Nothing more.  Or maybe I've been too used to the relationship subreddit where people are required to state their age and gender right off the bat to avoid situations like this, but still, it should be common sense to specify your gender if  it applies to your question.  OP could have been a gay guy that had been an only child and never been roommates with a guy, it's not that far-fetched.  Furthermore I don't see why I can't be a dick AND raise a concern at the same time.  Yeesh, too many idiots think you can't do both at the same time, and just write off anything you say because it was stated in an "impolite" fashion. 
Maybe I'm an idiot, but I am lost on what actually happened. Did he get the tattoo, then get sunburned and is sad it's going to "be gone in one day"? Or did he get sunburned and then tattoo himself thinking it would go away? Or does this have nothing to do with the tattoo's at all?
I have two mindsets after Ottawa is out. First and foremost I cheer for players I want to see lift the cup that haven't yet for example Ovi. Second, I actually cheer against the Canadian teams. I want my boys to be the ones to bring the cup back to Canada. Calgary winning the cup would impact me as much as the rangers winning it.

Well here's the point.  Nicola, and the NEC/Conference/Cabinet haven't written that manifesto yet, nor will they probably until at least the end of this year.  Certainly after the dust settles from the current hostilities and candidates have been selected.So saying "this will/won't be in the SNP manifesto next year" is complete speculation - even Nicola doesn't know what will be in it because she's not written it yet.  Surely she will have a great many ideas, but she doesn't decide the manifesto in a vacuum, there's people to be consulted, conference will probably make some policy etc....
I replied yesterday in my thread with my values of my shadowless cards, I'm still interested in Shiny Raikou and Latios ex. Let me know what you're thinking.
We all love to bitch about these people and give these big stories about how someone proved them wrong. The fact is though that the vast majority of the time they are right. And you asked them to do their job, which includes that statistical prediction. 
Sure people with a tolerance who smoke regularly can probably drive fine after smoking.But take someone who has never smoked, let them rip the bong a few times and tell them to drive down to the store and see what happens. 
Google is your friend! Go to Start, type in "event logger". Then you have to navigate somewhere like "applications" i think... then look for big red fatal errors. Go to the source code tab and search that stuff in google for the fixes. 
But like you said, it's very different in America. Very different culture. It's a big deal here, and in some circles you won't get invited out to dinner again if you don't tip appropriately.
Did you pay for it or did your dad pay for it? If you payed for it, just go return it to REI and tell your dad that you don't like it and want to try something else.
Shit on me all you want, I still think that's a super lame and super weird thing to do. Just smile and make eye contact. No one does it these days and girls find it pleasantly refreshing. 
What's more incongruous is the photo of Gerry tying his shoelaces. What kind of political metaphor/statement is that? "You need a competent representative; someone who doesn't depend on velcro"! or "I'm just like you, I also wear shoes!"
The same that allow Pacquiao and Mayweather to make 100 mil for one fight, yet many Americans make 7 dollars an hour. Fucked up priorities. EDIT: Real answer though, an NFL team has to be dozens of players, but a fight only has to pay out to two. There's just going to be more money between people when there's less hands in the pot. Also, no cap on how much money they can get paid (salary cap in NFL). 
This is actually pretty funny, the only place where I hear about this is reddit, 50% it's racist Europeans in /r/europe and the other half it's racist Americans telling me how bad I have it with all the gypsies around me.

Weird, I am using 1080p wallpapers in mine and they look normal.How did you save the wallpapers? Did you download them from your computer and transfered to Vita or downloaded them from the Vita browser?
Even under throwaways, if they want to tie you to a post you made, they will. Throwaways are still tied to an IP address. A subpoena would easily reveal how many user names match that IP and suddenly all your throwaways are tied to you anyway. 
Yes we can! I come from a family of rednecks with good hearts. (I'm from Alabama.) This guy was just the worst kind of asshole. Racist, homophobic, sexist, you name it. The only good thing is that he was the straw that broke the camels back and I held myself to MUCH higher standards after that and now I'm happily married to an amazing man :). Sorry about that generalization! 
I think Roose is more of a pragmatist and devoid of empathy. I don't really think he's necessarily "evil", he just does what he has to do. I don't think he took pleasure in the Red Wedding, he just realized it was do or die and the only way on the winning team was to betray the Starks.Ramsay on the other hand is downright sadistic (e.g. actually derives pleasure from others' pain and suffering) and a complete monster. 
I ordered it on Redbubble. They have a ton of car related stickers, and the quality is pretty damn nice. The shipping was miserable though, if I'm honest. 
Just tell her she will care once its her child. And of course they have criminal records, the odds are stacked against them and African Americans tend too get higher charges (not that some of them aren't actual criminals). 
You have Knights of the Old Republic I&amp;II, which are excellent wRPGs. The second one is probably the better of the two, but only with the restorted content mod.Battlefront II, even though the multiplayer on PC is a ghost town, is still a hell of a fun time with galactic conquest and the single player, even as it is basically bot matches.Star Wars: Republic Commando is one of my personal favorites. It's a first person shooter about a squad of elite clone troopers undertaking dangerous missions. 
Nope, not missing anything. That was my thoughts exactly though. How would I have known he had a girlfriend if he was asking for photos? I'm not sure if he just thought I was ok with sending photos regardless. 
Most Americans do. However, the average media that depicts American geographical knowledge tends to do it for humor and targets unintelligent participants for the questions to display America in a negative light. Granted, I'm sure there are actual stats saying Americans are worse at geography but most people base their views of TV shows or Youtube channels asking Americans for their geographic knowledge. If its filmed in Cali, you're cherry picking.

Isn't it appropriate to apply it to hominoidea though? Reptile, I understand, is one that doesn't work biologically anymore since we've been able to sequence DNA and determine relation/ancestry. My point is if apes are all belonging to hominoidea except for humans,  why not lop off the last detail and use it as a short form so we don't have to keep saying hominoidea?
Guaranteeing my left nut that she'll end up talking about Iran's "links" with ISIS on a wild tangent. The republicans will gobble it up. Some articles will be published. Some will praise the wicked witch in France. Others will call her out on her bullshit. It will have no effect on this administration's conduct with Iran. And that'll be the end of it.
I don't think you're in the minority, but the problem with that is that good speakers with something to say are not the easiest to find. If it can be managed then great, but generally that'll be hard. The advantage of the video format, and Sycamore certainly works like this, is that the video is the smaller part of it. It works as the conversation starter and guider. You aren't going to a talk or a lecture on faith, but are having a meal with a conversation about it.
I went to syntra for 3 years while working as a hvac technician. It can become a drag going to classes but if you are determined enough it will work out. try contacting CVO, syntra and even vdab for more info.
The theme of being lost and trying to get home/some place while drunk and sick, driving a car from the back seat (like that bond movie I guess only less cool and more nauseous). All the while driving in the dankest, and most convoluted of industrial sections. (happens a lot when I need to be up early the next day)Being in my own house (from now or my old one when younger) and finding new rooms and sections. Some huge all, a bit off and rather creepy. Back to school high school or grammar school…sounds clichéd as hell, but late papers, missing home work. And since I went to catholic school uniforms. But I am my own age and size in an over sized uniforms going to school with normal sized 3rd graders. (happened last night)I have an odd feeling…Billy Madison gifs are coming.

Oh god yeah. They have no help or support and will tell you anything to get you to sign up. I am currently doing it atm and by god wish I wasn't. Worst idea ever. The cert IV in uni taught me much much more. and I will be doing that as soon as i finish this one.
Exactly. It's like people don't see what's going down. They're just bringing back slavery. There might not be physical chains, but with high debt, high costs of living, low wages and long hours it's the same difference and only getting worse. If you don't make it to the top, you'll end up be groveling at the bottom while being told to be thankful that you have some cereal in your morning bowl so that you can work another 12 hour day for some more.
I hooked up with a Vancouverianite a year or so ago. She was nice and sweet and pretty good in bed. But it was a hassle to get to her place, so we never saw each other again.

Well, the character already says something related to the lack of mana, which has been enough of a pointer for me to press my mana flask. The player can figure out the rest himself.Your point about people using the low-cost lvl 1 gems in endgame is actually very important, many people seem to overlook that!
Well, trying doesn't mean they came close.  Tampa Bay likely answered, listened, and said no.  Not a "substantial talk" but still an attempt by Philly.

Also agree that this is not a good picture.  For online dating you want to present yourself as approachable and happy.  This photo might be good if used for another purpose.
No, but the option is near mandatory. People get motion sick from low FoV at a computer for example. It works mostly fine on console releases because you can be sitting quite far, but a tiny FoV on a larger monitor up close can cause problems.This isn't even about what 'looks better', this is something very critical for a PC FPS.
We ordered a "pre-production" copy of [Twenty Yard Shamble](twentyyardshamblegame.com) from the Game Crafter to test out the quality. We did and [unboxing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE0W_BBnuh8) when it arrived. I was really worried about the box, because of some things I heard, but I the box was fine, and I was impressed with the quality of the components. 
The outer brake pads were installed on the inside and vice versa. The outers have 2 dimples which ate into the pistons. Needless to say we had to install a new caliper. 
Out of all of the new items, the glimmer cape seems the most imbalanced to me right now. Item seems to be unbelievably powerful. Slark with silver's edge is also amazing.  CM top tier support. 
I'm not trying to defend Winston, but, "back room" of a "sketchy apartment" just sounds like a bullshit way to make a college kid's apartment sound sinister.
I find the hardest part of that is that people can't estimate their bodyfat composition worth shit. Bodyfat doesn't matter. It is the overall physique.
That's creepy o3o. I love the Navajo culture but I never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc. I did, however, forget one bit. Apparently, up until my grandmother moved. She called my mother several times in hysterics, saying that "Yenaldlooshi is outside" or she'd leave messages saying "I'm not safe here, I have to leave. I will talk to you soon"I don't remember that, I had to ask my mom about it. My mom doesn't even like to talk about it. I do remember that apparently, several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same, large black dog over the course of several weeks.

Yeah... that's not an ad hominem. Seriously,  I was just pointing out that people don't take your argument seriously when you use loaded terms. I suppose I should have phrased it better. I don't even disagree with you.

Yeah, sorry bros, but I'm not willing to try to get someone fired for doing something political, even if I strongly disagree and disprove of what they did.  We don't want to become the monster we're trying to fight against.

I'm probably in the minority here, but I think he should.My one regret from TH7 was maxing it completely instead of moving on when my walls were done.  Once you get to TH9 the bottleneck to completely maxing for 99% of players is loot.  IMO, as long as your farming troops are maxed you should move on once you can no longer dump excess resources right away.Hulk has a pretty good video on smartly rushing THs for very active players. 
The pad has broken away from the backing plate eating your rotor up probably going to need a new rotor, they don't cost much and new pads all the way around isn't going to cost much for parts and this can all be fixed in your driveway much cheaper then a mechanic.
Just try to adjust your stance, or initiating the slide later into your setup carve than you normally would.The baffle has a smaller wheelbase, but your feet where probably closer to being over the baseplates and providing more direct force to initiate a slide. Just keep playing around with it. It's you, not the board. I can assure you that.

This is literally my sister. She has sucked my cock so many times and got me so hard. Please send her to this address.123 Happy SeaAtlantic OceanP.S she is a stripper, you can bank her all you want for $50. She owes me a lot of money, so she has to earn her money some how right?
I wonder if they had any Officer Wilson or Moses Walker signs, two black men unjustly murdered. Instead of the Mumia and Mike Brown signs I saw, what two upstanding citizens to honor.
Pretty garbage it is the reason I bought a PS4 they constantly have crashing servers and what not. The reason I said I didn't know if it was coming to PC was because when it was first announced it was not I believe a petition made that possible. That being said do not be hopeful for it to be released at the same time since no release date has been set yet and ubisoft focuses on their console games first.
First thanks for this, and didn't realize the tourny gives out gems too. I was saving cards mainly for crafting/deck building seeing from your response I just need the high cards with the WWs, and the fact I can just farm the cards again I'll be dumping most of the cards.The tournament I joined and am fluctuating between the low to mid 30s for ranking which is higher than I expected, so will be playing more of that. I lost about 20K in gold since I didn't see it cost money per search but it's so easy to come by I'm not worried.That makes sense with Dr. Donut. There have been times I needed a certain field creature but they were either in the discard or deep in the deck. I'll start leveling him now. Then hopefully obtain Hunson at some point.I concur on it just being a game. :) Thanks again on all this and will be making some changes now.
Apparently the Eagles have offered the Titans 2 1st's, Fletcher Cox, and some other picks and we still are denying it.Edit: [OMG it's more than that. How the hell are we not taking this trade. Wtf.](https://twitter.com/rapsheet/status/593927074840096768)Edit 2: Seriously what the fuck guys. Surely we won't pass on this. Guys. Guys help.Edit 3: Guuuuuuuuuuuuys...........Edit 4: I'm gonna be pretty salty for a while.
Its a cool visualisation but it is not accurate. I think its just timetable data. The Werribee line services all run via the Altona loop which is incorrect.
As dumb as it sounds I'm pretty proud I made it through high school without getting pregnant, doing any kinds of drugs, drinking at all, or having a rep with the dean. I've never had detention, too. I dunno, I guess it makes me feel good because not many people can say the same.
Well you're definitely going to need the Sun's coordinates. From looking at your label and usage of linspace I guess it is at r=21.6 and whatever theta corresponds to down. From there you'll need the direction vector from the sun to each point (X_arrow - X_sun? might as well convert to Cartesian here since you'll want it in the next step), and do a dot product manually using the U, V components. Once you have the value at each, normalize them to the 0,1 range and use a cmap to set the color of each arrow.That's the gist... Most of those things should be google-able, but let me know if you want a link to anything in particular.
I know this will probably get buried, but as someone who is starting into the development field, what were your biggest struggles/hurdles at various points in the development stages? What did you do to overcome these? I am doing what I can to gain any and all insight humanly possible since currently this is starting as a solo project that may or may not gain a few team members in the long run.With that said that also leads to one other question I would love answered, being that you were a part of a team for Deus Ex, how did you manage to avoid personality conflicts to keep the workflow going?
I'm right in that boat with yah. I'll start looking around as well and let you know if I find anything. I know there is a Naperville (sadly not super close to the city) team that gets together for pick up games and summer tournaments. Want to say they are called the Naperville Apaches or something.  
I had this discussion with a friend. I think its 100% necessary for at least one and I think the second depends on who you are trying to farm the aghs for. If it is timing dependent I think you can go something like Boots midas and straight into an aghs.
"The good cleric and I have important information for the order....the two gentlemen were stranded on the road and we assisted them...as for myself, i have very few posessions...a few of which are for the order to inspect...i do carry a few weapons for my own protection and all."I willingly allow the guards to search me
Tens of thousands of people installed their own without harm.Electricity is only dangerous if you don't follow the electrical code.Its very simple stuff that you can pick up if you're handy and can read.Do have a licensed electrician install the crossover switch as most municipalities require that.
I've heard of them before and hadn't really thought of looking. I actually like what that offer. Would one long 14000K Reef Spectrum light the length of my tank be sufficient for a standard 55 gallon? The lighting is the only thing that's really causing me some strife. 
I don't know why noone has mentioned doing Frontline, What i do is usually queue for Frontline (Slaughter) while I level my DoH/DoL classes, so far I've easily capped Poetics for the past 3 weeks, it only takes 5/10 min and the queue runs at around once every 40 min. Easy tomes for everyone, and it's fun too. 
I feel like they just need to change the primary shot caller completely over to Aphro. If your shot caller chokes in playoffs there's a real problem there.
I actually go to the US very often. I always go to a currency exchange bureau. There's one near my house that charges no extra fees. It's a hundred times cheaper than exchanging currency at ANY bank. 
It's possible. There are definitely a lot of different factors that come into play. But biologically that's at least a really rough explanation of what the body is doing in that situation.
Well I mean that likely wouldn't have had an impact. It's the mother that you need to be concerned about. She and a child share blood. When she ingests something the child gets the effects from it. So mother does pot, baby gets AA effects. Dad does drugs and alcohol well it could have some effects I suppose. I am not the most well informed, but if it had an impact it would be through a different mode of action than what I am suggesting. 
finding items was a GODDAM CHORE. 99.999% of items you picked up were 100% useless, and the small amount that WERE useful you likely couldnt use them. So to actually get gear, you had to sell good items on the AH and use gold to buy the ones you actually needed. It takes all the magic out of having items drop for you. Also, WoW items have locked stats. the stats are the same for every item of the same ilvl. D3 has ranges of stats, so the same item acan come out 10000 different ways. 
If you are only 3 miles, they will for SURE deliver.I am actually a smidgen over 5 miles 5.5 miles =) but I talked to the owner and they have been delivering to me for years now
I just got out of that industry, and these gatekeepers are called to death.  Big problem is that most fleets have a registration via the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) which keeps a publicly available database containing contact info.  It's picked over and basically scorched earth due to the huge outbound TM efforts of big players like Fleetmatics.  Research for the proper contact person is very important and you'll have better luck not calling a main number.  Direct dials or asking to be connected to service, safety or maintenance dept's can help.  Asking for a title (esp Owner) got me nowhere.  
&gt;he can be just as critical of the Grumps as any other person hereI'll be honest, coming from a former main sub troll, a lot of those are probably sarcastic and an effort to parody your complaints.
I'm sure lawyers probably have different terms for different things, but in colloquial usage it's mostly just the same word and you get the meaning from context. In the case of deposit paid to a landlord on taking up residence in their property (what the strayans are referring to as a "bond"), you'll often hear the term "security deposit".
I agree, the artist did a great job! If there are more it might be hard to get the same guy though, I'm currently in New Zealand and not sure if/when I'll be back once I leave.
One of the first videos in this forum, I posted it, the audio shows what I have always failed to hear in other videos (I'm from Mexico) the sound of guns going on around  urban areas is terrifying and a whole different animal from guns going off in open space.
Aw, someone's been beaten. You have nothing left to say because you know you're wrong. And the insane amount of down votes you've accumulated agreeAlso, I'm sorry you're such a shitty baseball player that you can't change your swing. You being the level of athlete that Ryan Howard is is nothing to be proud of or argue for. You're both terrible at baseball and I'm genuinely sorry about that.
The story prior to Calliope's reveal is intended to make you think UU and uu are trolls. If you already know that there's green LE-looking peeps with UU and uu's symbols and outfits, the Cherub reveal isn't a reveal.Maybe you don't care; that's fine. But people like livebloggers ha(d) to avoid the Bandcamp page to avoid getting spoiled on that particular twist.

Also, she's Iron Man with shards of the weapon near her heart. Surely it will 'hear' her 'song' much clearer and make her stronger. Oh boy am I looking forward to more of this!
I'm a big fan of Dozla. He might even be my favorite in Sacred Stones. His big belly laugh, his upbeat and hammy demeanor rivaling even L'Arachel herself, his Berserker class, the works. The problem is, I usually have Ross and/or Garcia trained to be stronger than him when I get him, so the niche of dedicated axeman is almost always filled. I still like to use him from time to time, and his growths aren't even bad, it's just that he's usually outclassed.

Actually at the Air Force Academy, your first jump is free fall (not static) with no AFF instructors to help you. One of the few places in the world that does that. 
The worst thing is debating with confrontational personalities who avoid addressing context by trying to establish personal superiority by proxy.It's lull, and I wouldn't care because otherwise they are good friends. But one of the examples that comes to mind is otherwise a very stressful person paradoxed between an alpha personality and martyrdom that I just suddenly don't care any more because they just become unhealthy to be around.I'm conflicted because I never engage in the self worth proxy arguments, it's not integral. Sure the individual might see it as 'they are winning,' but honestly I'm just bored... it's too easy to attack someone personally.
Yoga women who have built an insufferably feminized girl power movement that's obsessed with weight loss and how my butt looks in yoga pants can't believe that guys would like to get back to the basics that make sense to them.  Why am I not surprised?  I haven't set foot in a yoga studio in 5 years because most of the female teachers are wannabes and the environment is insufferably imbalanced.   Men need to cut the entire mainstream yoga movement loose.  You had your chance to build a gender-balanced movement -- and you failed.  It's all about selling shit now -- because let's face it, if a woman can't shop to it, she loses interest fast.   So guys should just opt out - without apology.  Next!  
Title seems a bit misleading.  It sounds like the "Racist Memes" just supported a larger narrative of racial discrimination in the workplace, for which he was fired.  Not to mention the $100 mil lawsuit for racial discrimination.&gt; That discovery, along with being denied promotions and getting meager salary raises, King said, led her to file a $100 million discrimination lawsuit against AT&amp;T, the Associated Press reports.

Evidence that supports both sides.But based solely on the edit, I can't imagine Mike not winning. In the coming episodes Tyler will be built up as a threat to add some suspense. I doubt anyone here will swallow that line.

i just bought a canon pixma with ink for under  $100 and scanned a lot of my documents using the autofeed tray on the top. It took about 5-10 seconds per page (no duplex) but within a few hours I made a huge dent. Plus its wireless and is google cloudprint and airplay ready! I would definitely recommend if you have the extra cash for it
They can still govern on a vote by vote basis. Every mp voting independently without being forced into line with the party. That actually sounds more democratic anyway.
I'm not too surprised they went this way. They have that blackout series of jerseys that are the same exact color scheme made by Nike. I almost bought one a couple years ago but they didn't have my size at the store I was in. That and the numbers were not the traditional style. I think these look awesome and menacing! I hate the raiders but but they have some sexy uniforms and these remind me of those. 
That's not how it would work though. There's a large difference between a case not having enough evidence to charge a rapist and a case proving that a woman made a false rape report. We're saying that if its proven that the man or woman making the rape case lied, then they'd be severely punished. 
I'm glad I'm not the only one! You are totally right, my thought process became "Why bother with this furniture when I can just lay out on the floor..."
umm, just because you have no use for an object doesn't make it useless. The single function of a duck press is to press a duck, which it does a great job of. It presses ducks better than pretty much anything. So in that regard it's highly functional and useful. You'll need to come up with something that doesn't work, or has no purpose if you want to convince OP.
If I had to guess, I would imagine it's the three methyl groups converting to carbon dioxide and water and the boron oxidizing? That would explain why there's liquid left over and the oxidizing boron would tint the flames green. It's sort of like when you put certain metals over a bunsen burner, the flame changes colors? But the metal is part of the fuel.
It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.There are 5814 offenders52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole numberThere are 245,532,000 whites in AmericaThere are 41,600,000 blacks in AmericaWe can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 20131 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.
Why do mining tools break so fast? And why can't we repair mining tools now? I just started playing the game again after about a year and it has grown and improved in every way except for this. I just don't understand how having to take 10+ pickaxes for a long mining trip improved the game. Is there anything later on in the game that I don't know about that fixes this problem?
Meh. Part of my profession is creating photos, the second part of it is selling prints &amp; other add ons. They are two separate services entirely.

Varför krångla till det? Abort är ett helt normalt kirugiskt ingrepp, och om det strider mot någons moral att utföra abort så har jag full förståelse för att man väljer ett annat yrke. Det är ingen som är tvingad till att göra abort, problemet är löst.Vi kanske ska tillåta att poliser vägrar att utvisa illegala invandrare eller att försvarsanstälda vägrar skuta på fienden? En viltvårdare som inte avlivar skadade djur? Det är totalt idiotiskt, vill du inte utföra vissa arbetsuppgifter, välj ett annat jobb. Hur svårt är det?
Visible donations are good. Not only for the free PR (yeah, that's a given) but also to trigger other people to donate. Everybody has fans, even Ubisoft, and this may make other people give money. 
I was thinking about the same strategy, but I just feel more comfortable hitting perfect with Mr.3 than DJ Sanji. So every step is the same as you, except on stage 4 I use Mr.3's special to delay one turn, and use three weak combos twice to clear mobs. In the mean time heavy hitters' orbs are not changed and ready for Mihawk.
a. Your expansion on your point is still nonsense. As I said, nothing stops a culture from initially telling stories verbally and then later deciding to write it down. This is the kind of point that you would never try to make if you were viewing this situation objectively, because it makes no sense.b. Projection is not a mental illness.c. The purpose of my post was to try to indicate to you that your posts show considerable pro-Christian bias, moreso than the guy you are calling biased. From an atheist's perspective it's quite  straightforwardly visible.d. You clearly did not read my link, as evidenced by your lack of understanding of (b). Presumably you dismissed it out of hand. I interpret this as you filtering out unwelcome information, further evidence of bias. e. I'm not "upset". However, if you are, then calling me upset may be further projection on your part. 
I suppose that's a good point. I haven't rally read up on the topic and I would wager most people haven't but having Valve's name plastered all over a topic that could potentially be negative isn't exactly the kind of publicity they should be aiming for at the moment. Their best play is to lay low, In my opinion, and they seem to not really care much for that tactic.
They mailed them out as part of the pre-season marketing.  They made season recap trailers and hid some easter eggs in there.  One was an email for Diane@yahoo.com.  You emailed her, she asked for an address and a Community themed quote, and a couple weeks later these Frisbees were mailed out with the quote on the mailing lable.Not me, but [here's a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/2z1x0i/did_you_get_a_gift_from_diane/) another recipient had made at the time.
When I was working at a PC repair shop we had a guy come in angry that a computer that he built blew up using parts he bought from the shop. When we opened up the case we noticed the paste was everywhere all over the mobo. He argued that it was our fault for almost an hour before he left with his destroyed computer in hand. 
I guess when the window is so narrow you can pass a single book through it (spine-wise), the tensile strength increases exponentially. Plus it's hard to break it with a rock from the outside. As someone who worked in construction in my teens, I can imagine how many WTFs the contractor putting that sliver in was at.  
Ok, I don't think you meant to reply to me, but I can address your point, albeit with anecdotal evidence. My husband is an analyst. He needs to access proprietary data from his company all the time (working from home, on a trip and someone has an emergency need for a specific quick point). Others who would need to access the type of data located on a distant server could work in the medical, law enforcement and governmental sectors, with legally protected or prohibited information. And when you have a job that deals with that type of data/information, using publicly accessible computers is often discouraged. Hell, I'm strongly discouraged from logging into my employee account because I have access to a shit-ton of personal information about my clients, and I don't need a VPN. 
Heard a Principal say: "The world needs strippers, she is where they evolve from."Kid was in grade 9 at time. Last I heard, pregnant with two kids already with two random dads.
&gt;An alternative to Chroma packs that should please everyone.&gt;How about making TSM-packs.Are you that ignorant to think that everyone are TSM fans?
I know!  I'm glad I got my name in when I did, she's seriously amazing.  Knight Enchanter actually.  The spirits are more to represent her connection to the fade in general and the constant temptation of the demons in her dreams and now in life too.  They turned out a bit more ghoulish than spirit/demony but that's alright.
Only on the higher end of the spectrum (extreme OC) where you would need a giant heatsink to provide a comparable cooling capacity. Otherwise, low-profile coolers like the Silverstone NT06 or Zalman CNPS8900 would do the job without much hassle.Take a look here for great low-profile coolers http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/low-profile-heat-sink-mini-itx,3639.html
No she isn't. Isis is not one of Adam's 6 gods(Shu/Heru/Amon/Zehuti/Aton/Mehen). He owned the amulet but he only wielded her power once while he searched for the amulet and it was for a very short time other than that the only person to wield it long term was Adrianna(He gave her the amulet). She is not in his normal power set and having her power would be a huge power up.
I'm not condoning scumbags taking advantage of drunk people who can't say no... But if a person consistently puts themselves in the position to be taken advantage over and over again without complaint; they're responsible for their own situation too. I'm not blaming the rape victim here. I'm talking about when someone goes to a party every weekend and gets taken advantage of, only to keep going back every single weekend to get taken advantage of. That's basically consent. 
&gt; places that cater to the working remotely crowd.Not really going to find that here.  Yes, places have free wi-fi, but most restrict the bandwidth on their customer side, since you're sharing the pipe with their systems.  So you'll see dropouts pretty much everywhere if you're doing bandwidth intensive work.Like someone else said you're better off upping your data plan for a month and using your phone as a hotspot.Also, businesses here don't really like folks that just sit around their place all day sucking up a table, and spending only a few bucks on a couple beers or coffee.
It's in game and therefore more widely accessed (yes I know many think that's a bad thing; they don't have to use it), and it's far, far simpler to go through the mechanics of creating and joining a group.  If it's designed right, it may even allow group leaders to inspect prospective teammates more readily and make more informed decisions about teaming up. 
I used stage builder to spell the words "I'm really feeling it" and made Shulk yell "I'm really feeling it" on that stage in training for ten minutes. Time well spent B)
Okay, so he's pulling the cop over for not having a seatbelt on? What a fucking joke. Cop should give him a ticket for using his phone and reckless driving. 
I'm sorry to hear about your GSD.  This is a concern for me and I'm not against neutering Monti when he's older.  That said:I'm somewhat familiar with testicular cancer in dogs but by no means an expert.  However, I'm not sure that it is enough to warrant neutering at a young age.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the most common treatment castration(neuter) and isn't that often the only treatment needed?  
I agree replacing a player can work for some teams and break others, I honestly do think it was just unfortunate luck on his part because I can see that he is a good player from watching the games.
If by pedant you mean "someone who understands the difference between the licence fee and tax" then yes I am. You however, evidently do not, and if you wish to make a critical comment on something, perhaps you should check if the activity that you are criticising (state TV paid for by tax in this instance), actually happens at all. (Hint, it doesn't). Also, quango? Is this a joke account? I'm really hoping it is. 
What i found most sinister about ASP is that it made doing the wrong thing very, very easy. You want a database for a website? no problem!! Just set it up in MS Access and off you go. 5 minutes of boilerplate and 20 minutes in access and you had a reasonably functional database driven site...for a little while, at least.I think myspace's problems were actually more centered around their culture than their code. They seemed to not really understand what users *needed*, and instead kept throwing them things they wanted, even to the detriment of the site's usability and usefulness.

Where are you hearing this? I recall the news that it "wasn't quantum" years ago, but everything I read about simply stated that it wasn't a full quantum computer; it most certainly houses qubits, and the methodology behind it is adiabatic wavefunction collapse. I don't completely understand how that can be used for computation, but I know Google is already using it to improve their search algorithms...using methods previously developed in adiabatic quantum computing theory. So it may not be a full "quantum computer" by some peoples' definitions, but they do advertise that these 512 qubits *are* addressable, they do charge *ten million dollars* for the thing, and it does perform algorithms based in quantum information theory. IMHO, that makes it pretty quantum, no? (Plus read the documentation on how the thing works; Josephson Junction coupling is still very much a quantum mechanical operation...)
To be fair, they had great reasons at the time.  Chrome was exponentially faster than Firefox in its youth and people still expect that to be true today even if it is not.  My biggest appreciation is that Chrome helped spur on a few great changes.
Truth.  My armory has like a grand whopping 8 m9s.  The officers and the medics have to fight over them.  My battalion has more Paladins than pistols.  To the point where my "sidearm" as a 240 gunner has always been an m4.  Granted, we have a complete asspile of crew serves, but we wouldn't be bringing those out for civil unrest unless shit was REALLY bad.
haha If you look carefully there's a cross dressing one, 3 sqn call sign on the tail but 11 sqn colours still on it....not pretty but a bit of a oddity. its the call sign of the old 3 sqn 100 year anniversary jet so I dont know what's happened to that one...
You're right, I just have other priorities right now, career wise.I plan to do more or less what you describe once my long-term career becomes lucrative enough that I don't need a 60-hour a week dayjob.
That's how I found them actually when I started listening to the Dead earlier this year it got me into the more Americana/Blues/Country jam bands, helped me find String Cheese Incident too
It wouldn't necessarily be rape if you were sober enough to be capable of making a decision but if the person was just waiting for you to get drunk enough so that you would finally make thedecision in their favour I would personally consider them a bad person.
It's not a sport, they're just SUPER delusional. So all the repsonses you'll get will reflect that delusion. They're just guys who are good at a video game. 
When I was a scrub and played Brawl, I dropped the idea of maining Olimar because I assumed he sucked, despite being a die-hard Pikmin fan and being super hyped that he was in the game.Now that I'm a bit more seasoned, and look back at the Brawl Tier lists, all I have left is regrets...
I ran a cold based cc rig until I geared up.   Ray of Frost/Blizzard/hydras/black hole/energy armor/teleport.    I took the low cost versions of Ray and Blizzard to make resources a non-issue.   Mammoth Hydra because they're amazing.   Black Hole Massive for an engage/general CC and Teleport Safe Passage just in case shit gets hairy.   Of course, you can vary the runes a bit, but these worked well for me.   It's not the most amazing game play, but it'll keep you alive until you can get Tal's or Delrasha. 
Oh yeah, Hume was as agnostic as it gets. Pardon my inappropriate vocabulary. He didn't even believe with certainty that the sun would come up the next morning :D

I ask him what he needs, and what I can do for him. If he wants to talk, or cry he knows I am here. It can be hard to gauge because he gets frustrated but some days are worse than others. 
I should have sent this to my ex last year! He only brushes his teeth maybe once every two days, claiming that he doesn't have time to do it more often.
Possibly literally. Having been married to a narcissist who's special brand of abuse started with stuff like this but eventually turned full gas-lighting I can say from experience it can lead to anxiety and depression. Run. Run fast. OP deserves a partner who views you as a team not someone who sees her as their assistant/mommy. 
&gt; and I don't remember it having an overarching plotIt kind of does. Trying not to spoil much here, but there is definitely a loose overarching plot which ties everything together somewhere in the backdrop. It's more prominent after the other recurring characters (whom I will not name for fear of spoiling it) start showing up.
Yes. That's why I said cheapest reliable and safe one. Forgot to add long-lasting. You want a car that'll keep working with minimal maintenance for a long time.  I'm not against some extras but they're exactly that: extras.
Odysseus' Bow is a very bad item if built in anything but the last slot.  The item scales off of your total physical power, which is power from items and your base inhand damage + level scaling.  It only does any damage if you already have a large amount of physical power.  Similarily, you would not build Polynomicon as first item.
Yes. The phone call is just a courtesy and a cool media moment. A way to introduce the player to the team. You cannot say no if you are drafted. If you are drafted and do not play, you do not get to just go to another team or enter free agency. If the team doesn't cut or trade the player and just sits on his contract, there is not much a player can do. So, if you don't answer the phone, too bad. If they want you, they have you. 
I think quite a few people start big, I started with my left side and did from under my armpit down to my hip bone and really after that I was pumped to do my next one. 
No. They said they MIGHT do amiibo support, but it won't be Smash Bros. They're game isn't out yet, and they're a non-nintendo exclusive developer. You're kind of naive for thinking they could have a chance as of right now to be in Smash over another Rareware conceived character like King K. Rool or even Banjo-Kazooie.
Welp, those bastards over at /r/AustinGuns have almost burned through 200 rounds of M2 ball in a month. Bring more if you come out. Still waiting on my next CMP delivery. 
And they still compiled no data. They can make these statements all they want, but they compiled no data, showed no numbers and I have no way to verify their conclusions without doing the same amount of research they supposedly did. 
Because throwing money at a problem with money just makes a bigger problem. We can use the cracks that show in the bad times to show us what we need to reinforce.
Yes this is quite understandable, I looked at your logs they are very nice. But they are also incredibly fast. I am not trying to take away from your play, you are clearly quite good, but compare your logs to say - mine. Shayanwe - illidan. I have like 95%+ on every fight we've done on mythic, but I hardly get top 10 rankings, my gear is slightly worse than yours but not by much, but our fight lengths are horrible because I raid with horrible people. If you played echo/unleash/SET as well as you can play EM/PE/LM, then you would do slightly more damage, the numbers don't lie. If you aren't comfortable playing that style, then who cares - you clearly already perform well enough. It's just that if you are really trying to min-max you would take the better talents.
I filled out the online form with all the family numbers on my account.  Let's see what I get.  A few bucks?  My number is like 12 years old so I probably had one of those charges at some point.
Yeah what you just said is bullshit. Because the Puszu Yellowstar botlane were not a strong botlane. And they still went to worlds championship in season 3, and they still went far (they placed 3rd/4th, losing to Royal club in the semifinals)
To those who live in the UK, *(I'm an American but I visited England around about the year 2000)* why does your hamburger taste different?Of all things I expected a McDonalds hamburger to taste the same, is it still the case that it tastes different?Just a different way the beef is fed?
&gt; As Open Hypergamy becomes more institutionalized and made a societal norm by the Feminine Imperative, and as more men become Red Pill aware (by effort or consequences) because of it, the more necessary it will become for a feminine-primary social order to legislate and mandate men comply with it.A war is brewing, and it's clear who fired the first shots. Who launches the finishing volley remains to be seen, but I think we all have a pretty good idea how this will all go down.
"I'm black, have 2 priors, and have a lawyer who I've paid 13k" A gaffot's wet dream.  Heap on the well wishes.  Hell, I'd let him fuck my wife. What a hero.  
You dislike all cops? So it's cool for you to make sweeping generalizations about all cops based on the highly publicized behavior of a few, but it's wrong for cops to make sweeping generalizations about black men based on the actions of "a few"?Maybe making sweeping generalizations is the problem 
A lot of times, it's a pain in the ass for the company to pull out just one adapter, so it's easier and cheaper for them to send out a whole new unit.And, like you said, they want to maintain a good reputation and keep people talking about them.My policy is to always inform a company of a defect or problem, because more often than not, they like to fix it for you.  You won't get what you don't ask for.
Just going to say that we should probably consult a lawyer before doing something like this. I'm sure there are regulations concerning a business funding a political campaign. 
"But I mean, even if we were to pull out today, and if they would come take our base, they would have two bases in the middle of a box canyon. Whoopdee-fucking-doo."
I'd assume it'd look very similar to a map of farms in California, to be honest. I agree agriculture is the much bigger factor, but since Jerry Brown mandated cuts for cities in particular, I thought it'd be interested to see which cities were more wasteful. Especially considering one of the biggest complaints to the mandatory cuts were that some cities were already conserving and it'd be hard to cut more, whereas others were very wasteful and easier for them to cut the 20-25% (? I think) required.
I have a decent amount of cost. I can throw up Skuld and Muse, but probably not much else. Nothing amazing, at 120 right now. I'm going to try and get a Valk when she comes around in a few days to beef up the LZL team. 
A certain product (ad-free) was given for free, but now they want to charge people for having it.  They're forcing a decision that's lose-lose for the consumer: downgrade a product you already possess, or pay.Seems like they were building clientele prior to converting to a paid app.  This surprise ultimatum is like, a trojan horse ransom or something. Don't give in to these extortionists.Aren't your principles worth more than $1?What they should have done is some combination of the following:* Plan ahead. If struggling financially, make known publicly that continued freeness will not be possible if current trends continue, and politely request donations long in advance.* Offer the option to remain on the current version for free without support. Of course people are not entitled to services or future updates, but they are entitled to keep what they already have.* Develop premium features.
Thanks.  They have one with the 9.5mm actuator which is no longer flush with the the box.  It kind of kills the look and function.I just ordered 9 different small tactiles .... hopefully one of them will work out.  
he apparently went even with bjerg 4 times and got dumpstered twice. But C9 is looking for a mid that can beat bjergsen, not just go even. C9 and TSM have sights beyond just NA, people need to understand that
Honestly, anything that feels different from madden right now would be better in my opinion. Different gameplay is what I'm after. 2k servers do absolutely blow and nba 2k14/15 had major issues
Yeah, I'm one of those people with a hoodie all the time when its 100+ degrees outside, otherwise I'd freeze in the grocery stores and shit. Movie theaters are especially bad.
I've noticed often in theaters they have crap AC or just don't run it enough and a theater can get pretty toasty. I imagine if they don't crank the AC for these showings it could get mighty smelly. 
So the current tune is stock?If so, check your intake tubes for any leaks. With the engine running at idle, run an unlit propane torch over all of your intake tubes, throttle body gasket, etc. Listen for any change in engine running condition, it will be noticeable if it sucks in the propane.As well, if you have a noid light kit, watch your injector activation, make sure they aren't dropping out.If the tune is not stock, watch the mapping for any dead spots. If you can monitor injector pulse width, watch for a drop corresponding to the hiccup.
In some rules it's counted as a double yakuman.On Tenhou it isn't treated specially other than in name, and [being allowed to yell this at your screen.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06o5NbF1n6E)
Ahhh, what kind of layers were you wearing? That seems like a lot of clothing to pack haha, my pack is already pretty heavy xDOh nice! I live in LA, we should meet up! I have a group of friends who go hiking and stuff, you could totally join. :) Where in the area are you moving?
&gt; implementing the Game of Life and cellular automation in a political frameworkI think you're going to have to explain what you mean by this a bit better.
Used to have this in World of Warcraft. Triple EXP for characters depending on how long they had been inactive up to X amount of levels, was really nice :)
Vince Mcmahon intefers in Brock and Undertakers match and makes it a triple threat then him and taker proceed to demolish Brock. For the finish Vince F5s Brock then Undertaker lies down and allows Vince to pin him to end the streak. All of a sudden Eric Bischoffs music hits, him and Paul Heyman come out to challenge Vince. They have a street brawl that lasts for hours ending the event.
I was always impressed how something seen in an early first season episode, and then never gets mentioned again, suddenly shows up again in thefourth season, and makes complete sense! When you wrote that first script, how and did you plan out what could happen if it went on for 5 years? Or was it just luck?
&gt;Reddit is such a stupid platform for actual 2 sided discussion because of the way it works (upvote/downvote system).What other system would you propose?
You rock! I'm currently using selenium with java, branching out toward JavaScript and python. Just for fun really, I like having options.... I'll start really digging into this book first chance I get! 
My point is that it is necessary to tell the colorscheme which version you want. It is not necessary to set background to do so.Doesn't it make more sense for the colorscheme to provide a function to switch instead of piggybacking on vim settings? (Does the colorscheme even automatically detect that the value of 'background' has changed?)
You cannot get the best gear available.  It is a tier below top raid gear and a tier below on arena gear.  So, technically to be the best gear you still need to do the right things.  But everyone has their own opinions and their pay shop has never effected me but then I'm used to real P2W games that the only way to get the best gear, buffs, etc is to actually pay for them from their shops or you can't compete.  
Even if that's the case, let's assume you install the parts, run the stage 2 map, engine kabooms. They'd be able to tell the last time it was reset. You wouldn't be able to put miles on it before taking it there.For the record, I've seen in a ton of other places a space or probably binary slot in the ECU which tells if the tune was ever changed from factory. No first hand experience though.
I don't think it was cheating, but I also don't think it was good. And it clearly shook her to the core. At this point, I think that y'all just need couples therapy. She needs outside perspective to see how self-destructive she's being. 
Tens of thousands of people installed their own without harm.Electricity is only dangerous if you don't follow the electrical code.Its very simple stuff that you can pick up if you're handy and can read.Do have a licensed electrician install the crossover switch as most municipalities require that.
It's more about moving the stuff from the truck to my new apartment. I'm on the fourth floor. There is an elevator, but my couch won't fit in it. They would have to move it via the stairs.Come to think of it, the only thing keeping me from moving the stuff myself is my couch. I just don't want to deal with it.
Well, create a body for the method like you would normally have to, then move the method instantiation into the body instead of as a parameter like you currently have right now.
Very nice list indeed. The math that was done for collected company said that 22 was the bare minimum, so maybe just up the Knight to a 3. I would cut the valorous stance and the elsbeth for 4x collected company if I were to add it.
The Marvel one sounds really... rough.. but I'd love to hear some elaboration on it from people who did it.I would love to do this Star Wars thing.. I always wanted to see the older films in the theater.
Which one are you referring to? If it is [this](http://imgur.com/a/TTIyj/all) then it is from [dBrandINC](https://dbrand.com/) which is just a skin not a case or cover.
Nah it should be by a certain math problem that would equal to that, sort of like a code, that way it can be a useful calculator until that exact problem comes up, but at that point you should already know the answer to it.
In the defense of many abbathurs,The stab has a fairly longish cooldown, and a long range. Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.When you get a shield, get a non-minion blocked angle and just take a step or two closer so the stab can fire then back off again and stay back for at least 4 seconds. It doesn't take to many stabs to get them low enough that you can 'assassinate' them with your abilities.Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds). If you see an opening to close to half range and minions are blocking the stab dart in, let abba do a spike from behind the safety of minions then run away before the enemy can run around to you. Spike isn't minion blocked like stab is.

Why should there be clearly defined objective criteria? That would be incredibly boring and would take all the debate and mystery out of the award. I think it's fine as is, with each voter deciding on their own criteria.
That thing hits like a ton of bricks, so I might only take a few, been saving something good for tonight!! Will do! Next toke is for Uncle Jesse and the one after that is for Gordon.

Both look good (lucky you!) I think I personally prefer the bangs, but maybe you could go for a lighter bang? Not everyone can rock the blunt, straight across bang look (and you certainly can) but if you are looking for a compromise you could try some side-swept bangs and see how you feel, 
Doesn't seem like I get much of anything until I do +140mg. I know this is because of such a high tolerance but it doesn't make sense you're saying I'm wasting it. It's a waste UNLESS I do that much it feels. Shouldn't higher tolerance = higher dose? Or are you saying the body stop metabolizing it past a certain point or something? If you're saying I'm wasting it because of how high of a tolerance I have, requiring me to do more to feel the same as I would a lower dose with a lower tolerance, yes I understand how it works in that sense and plan on taking a tolerance break soon. 
Perhaps he meant monstrous on a more human scale? Perhaps his kill count is less but the pain and suffering he's caused so many people, directly and indirectly, is pretty staggering.
You can't make an assumption everywhere is the same as where you live. I can very much agree with the stealth of being fast and silent where I live and it  would be an odd day you met any wildlife on the road, maybe a hedgehog but they don't move whatever is coming. 
That's good and all but don't give silly advice some people might take your post as "successfull" you still haven't played enough and as long as you keep theoretically keep working on your game you can do well but be ready to move down when disaster hits. 
I don't know about you, but I generally take them out of the box, open them, put garbage inside, and walk them out to the dumpster before throwing them away.
My employer is rolling our email over to Google and set up training sessions.  Today's session takeaway: Trash folders are not for archiving your emails (Google has a 30-day limit).  Can't wait for the complaints when users start hitting the 30-day threshhold.
You may be depressed, in which case reading philosophy will be less helpful to you than visiting a therapist or psychiatrist. If you must attempt a philosophical solution, the Stoics allegedly help people who are depressed or otherwise have a negative view of life.
This is 100% not typical from my experience here so far. There will always be SJW's anywhere. Seattle's culture tends to attract them, but they're easy to ignore, and so far this is first I've seen these posters or witnessed stupid "trigger" bullshit at all. I have yet to experience it in real life.
Haha, I'm trying my best to give you the benefit of the doubt but you're not making it easy.It's not "I thought Shirin's edit". It's that the editors have repeatedly promised us of an uprising by the good people, and that the editors have deliberately made the good guys super-good, and the bad guys evil caricatures. There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as "Don't worry, Rupert will pull through", but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero. When you have a shitty bootlist, making the audience hate the bootlist as much as possible is not the way to go.
Just as a general tip for anyone, you should create a separate Google identity for your YouTube channel.  I had a website long before I had a YouTube channel, so for me it was a no-brainer to create a Google account for my site.  So when I started doing YouTube reviews, I just used that Google account.  Of course, if you started making YT videos and uploading them using your personal YT account, then it's kind of too late...
I don't care if cops get busted for victimless crimes.Show me some evidence that cops are held to account when there are victims and I'll agree with you.  This shit?  It's meaningless.
Fantasia terrified me as a kid.  I ran out of the theater screaming.  But to be fair, it does have a giant devil on a mountain commanding legions of ghostly undead.
&gt; His SOLE job is to be politically correct and not cause any controversyThat isnt even close to being true. His job was to promote the rockets. Team twitter handles have been posting jokes and ribbing with other teams since long before this too.
that's called anecdotal unproveable evidence that anyone can pull out of their assdo you and you're boyfriend work the same exact amount of hours in the same exact position and take the same exact amount of time off? there are so much other factors. I also doubt it was exactly 75 percent, because that  wouldnt make sense. the 75 percent stat is just how much the average woman earns versus the average man.
It's not so much forcing me to be something I'm not. The issue is trying to balance the two. It feels like I don't have much time anymore for self-searching.
She they of posed with the many black leaders in the city? Some of these black teens are giving no fucks who they attack or represent in these riots!! Police are out of control but these kids are worse.

My neighbor has a 2.5 H4 Subaru engine in his Vanagon. Every time it starts up it sounds VW, but at the same time it doesn't. I'd love to get one of those.
Nothing, really. I eat everything I used to eat before I had braces, although there are certain things (like croutons) which are too hard, so I cut them out completely. Anything I'm not sure about, I just cut into smaller chunks. For example, carrots. I wouldn't bite into them whole, I'd cut them up and eat them. It can be a bit frustrating, but at least you don't need to cut anything out.

Of course not :) There is no USB charging capability.There is a charging port on the battery cover, you need to have a 9 volt 2 amp wall charger to use it.
Yeah, so if the sentence is confusing or not entirely clear, you always have the option to rewrite it.  I guess Oxford commas aren't as confusing if the list goes on for more than three items--otherwise it could be misconstrued. that's why I like dashes! 
Well... Older trucks can snap in half, some trucks don't have straight frame rails front to back, which means uneven load, which means more of a chance of falling off. So yeah, lift points are still pretty important.
It's best player available. The best teams always draft BPA. If Gurley is there, he will absolutely be BPA. Some analysts are saying he's legitimately the single best player in the draft, period.

While multi-nationals evade tax with impunity, the government splashes around industry subsidies and spends big on shiny weapons, how about some choices for you to exercise your democratic rights on:2015: Here's 26 government services, pick the one you want to lose.2016: Here's 25 government services, pick the one you want to lose.2017: Here's 24 government services, pick the one you want to lose.etc.It's so exciting. I wonder what the last service will be?
When I ask my roommate to please not fiddle with his e-cig while driving, I get called an asshole.  Sorry, I'm not comfortable while you unscrew a compartment on the thing, then root around the car for your misplaced liquid or battery, all on the highway while driving with one knee.  "If I saw someone coming, I'd drop everything!" and "But I haven't gotten into an accident yet!".  You haven't been in an accident because you're a lucky bastard and no, you won't see anyone approaching because you never check your mirrors, never use a turn signal and oh yeah *are staring at your e-cig*.Commutes are never more than 20 minutes long anyway,  but nope I'm the douche for suggesting that maybe he can live without nicotine for a third of an hour./rant sorry, I'd rather be in a car with a texting driver than my roommate.
Everything I recognize is pretty dope. That means I probably need to check out all the stuff I don't recognize. :) thanks for the recommendations. P.S. still think your crazy if you don't respect the Tip. ;)
Doing quite well myself. I have a friend of mine over talking about making a new comic series (that's not TPP related). Other then that, job searching, walking around and enjoying the day.
Might as well try... I should win because I freaking love Fire Emblem (at least as a reason for Ike.) It's one of my favorite game series' ever. For Wii Fit... er, my friends always make jokes about me and her because I actually use the Wii Fit game. There ya go. XD
Also, I'd like to think that most of it is exaggeration for humor sake. A lot of us have a really good time listening to this music, watching these videos and coming up with hilarious over the top reactions. It's like a way of telling the chef we loved the food- and for an industry where the requisite for music videos is heavy eyeliner, I think it's pretty appropriate lol
Vince.  Love your work.  Thank you so much!I noticed you used a lot of local businesses from around the ABQ metro.  (I was watching with my gf at the time and stood up and shouted when I saw the Heights Lock and Key van in Walt's driveway.)  What was the reaction of the community to the production? What is your reaction to the way that you've put a whole new brand on the area?
They can't just perfectly slot into character tropes otherwise they'd be a bit too generic and boring,  they need to develop throughout the course of the show.
I mean it's kinda like saying "rapists gonna rape". Which is true. The government can do everything in its power to try to find a rapist after he commits rape and punish him, but if someone has never been reported for rape before, there's nothing they can really do to protect you from being his first victim. 
As for Israel-Palestine conflict, the only similarity I see there is that they are neighbors and they are both emotionally and politically in conflict. The biggest difference is that their core issue was originally caused by the third party.&gt; In relation to the conservative government in Korea - do you think Korea-Japan relations was better under Roh or Kim? Or was it already bad when Lee came to power?I cannot say I'm familiar with Korean politics, but I don't really think it's the parties. I believe this wave of conflict started by Roh at his last year. Lee escalated it and Park literally ruined every hope existed. Realistically speaking, Park should be replaced with someone asap who can actually at least pretend to be neutral enough not to provoke either side.
Ayoze Perez. Shame we didn't pick him up for 2mil euros (I think it was) that Newcastle did. I think for a young striker he has potential. Will probably cost nearer to £10mil now to get him off Newcastle, but still he could be a very good striker in the future. Much better than any of our 3 back ups. Though he would come in as a 3rd place striker, we definitely need a senior striker whose proven and doesn't break every 4.5 games too be the main man. 
Sure, I'll admit I was wrong if that's what is important to you. I'll just be grateful to be given just a little more time. The shit WILL hit the fan eventually. It sucks for you though because when it does, you'll probably still be laughing and calling us crazy until it's too late.
My fave is Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles with Sonic Generations and Sonic Adventure 2 as runners up.My worst (and my most hated video game of all time) is Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood with Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Heroes as runners up.One game that most people hate but I adore is Sonic and the Black Knight. One that I hear lots of praise for but absolutely cannot stand is Shadow the Hedgehog.
Add at least 3 more wraps to that coil. (9-10 wraps total) Make a second one the same. Should be right around .5 ohm total.To keep around .7 you'll want about 14 wraps per coil.
This was pretty much my only complaint about the chromas. Back in the day, a recolor felt like it had a lot more work put into it than just simply opening up the uncolored texture in photoshop and pressing the "bucket fill" option.I think they are a cool idea, but Id prefer they be sold separately rather than together. Even if all 3 would cost more than the current 590 or what ever it is, Id still prefer them being liek 300 each.Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.
I've got the GP-Evo NXT054. Don't know if my knuckles are as pronounced  - but any solid (1 pc) knuckle glove I've work does have a hot spot if I make an exaggerated fist. To date that includes (older) A* GP Pro, Held Phantom IIs, and Racer R-Safe.The RS TaiChi gloves don't suffer from the same hot spot issue for me. I do wish they had the 3-4 finger bridge. On the up side they do have the latest version of the Knox SPS.FWIW RS TaiChi run quite small. I'm wearing XXXL vs the XXL I wear in A* 
Being naturally more logical, intelligent, and better at STEM than the female of the species.  Too bad the rest of the world insists on providing them with endless privileges as a reward for being inferior to those such as I.
Ya, I only realized it when I think when scrolling through the difficulty setting while playing as Spaz and the super buff Spaz had bows on their ears. That was the only indication that I found of Spas being a girl, so I might be wrong.Edit: found [this](http://www.dopefish.com/images/spazfish.jpg) showing the difficulty levels

So if I have partially upgraded fatebringer for example, then I ascend it using etheric light, it won't be at 365?? It'll be at like 347 or something and will attain 365 attack damage when I upgrade the final node?
Hey there.I see you've recognised that you have gone down a path that you aren't entirely convinced is right for you, and you want help getting back to where you used to be. You've come to a good place.The over time escalation into weird and intense porn, the upselling porn overtones into relationships, and feeling like a different person seems to have occurred to all of us. You are not alone in this.For me personally, keeping long form journals to write whatever I am feeling is a great way to stay accountable. So has reading that other people are involved in this journey too. Joining up to the monthly accountability streaks normally stickied at the top of the page has been very helpful. Theres a badge link on the side to get the flair next to your name, it works well!Good luck, keep fighting.
Not necessarily bots, tools like that can alert you whenever there's a certain profit to be found somewhere on the TP, and then a player sees that and can choose to go for it. I use it myself too from time to time, but I wouldn't go for rice wine because it isn't gonna sell.
True that, but the Python community is much larger than the VBScript one, so there's more support. Also, for the audience of this book, people would be on Windows, Mac and Linux and I wanted something that could work on multiple platforms.
Actually the worst thing that can happen is having scars all down your arm and knowing that at any given moment someone could be judging you for it.Trust me, I have them.
I really like **Warhammer 40K: Conquest** but there are not a lot of players.  I don't think it has caught on nearly as well as some of Fantasy Flight's other LCGs.  
You mean a goatee? [This](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/20100000/Gilligan-Ginger-gilligans-island-20161414-640-480.jpg) is Gilligan with a goat.

&gt;I know EA and Microsoft have exclusive licenses to Porsche and FerrariKunos has Ferrari also, so I don't think that one's exclusive, or at least not anymore.
I doubt Hinami is realistically stronger then other ghouls. Sure she has some really strong Kagune, but once Kakuja stage is reached is doesn't really matter as they basically have the same vibe of the "lol look at all my kagune". So pre-Kakuja she is probably stronger then normal, but Kakuja wise she would almost be on a level field.Also as others have said, there is the issue of RC count. Kakuja obviously don't really have the issue of maintaining the Kakuja as they have tons of RC from cannibalizing and such, but Hinami who doesn't have so much RC stores could probably only hold it out for a short amount of time.
Yeah, I was hoping to avoid stuff like smoothies, but it's becoming more apparent that it may be necessary due to time constraints. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and savory smoothies are pretty gross in my opinion, so I'm kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.
The sum of the difference (2,168) and the Chimborazo's height (6,384) doesn't need to be larger or the same as Everest's height. It could take any value. The difference (2,168) isn't the relative difference in sea level but happens to be close. Draw a schematic out. Either way, Chimborazo is further away from the Earth's centre.

One of the most memorable video game songs ever.  *This was a triumph  I'm making a note here: huge success  It's hard to overstate my satisfaction*  
Very likely not, I really hope Overkill actually implements an action logging system or something, if they just banned haphazardly for modified game files then that would defeat the purpose of not using VACThey'll most likely rely on something like player reporting where if someone draws enough attention to themselves then Overkill will look into it, which is what they do already if people sends enough emails to them about someone
You say that but at the same time he's been on an shitily managed team his entire career in LCS. I'm not the biggest pob fanboy but i think on a well managed team he still can be one of the best mids in NA. People used to think Krepo was a bad support on EG too, just because a team is managed and coached poorly doesn't mean the players are bad.
I've wound up sending in a customer service ticket to SE. I understand no physical disc, but they send you the early access code - could this include a download of the current content? It would be more sub money for SE, so I could see this being possible. There just isn't a clear explanation. At the same time, I will not be surprised if you are 100% correct. Thank you for your input!
A chest freezer or a freezer that is not frost free would keep meat better, longer than a frost free model. A chest type freezer maintains a pretty constant temperature but a frost free  freezer goes through a defrost cycle where the temperatures rise while defrosting. This is where you end up with freezer burn on foods.
I found this ink and it's either my dad's or grandpa's. No idea how old, but probably &gt;10 yrs at least. My dad used fountain pens in University and he also did calligraphy art so it could be either dip or fountain!Anyway, I was wondering if it IS Pelikan ink (as I described in the album, I did some googling and the logo doesn't look exactly like ones I've seen online, but I don't know much about the brand so maybe they change it up?). Also, if it's for fountain pens or dip pens.Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post it! I thought of /r/whatisthisthing but figured you guys would be more likely to recognize this sort of thing.**Edit:** [Here's an album of an ink swatch](http://imgur.com/a/LmNjx) (I had no pens to use, sorry)
wut.Im assuming Kauai, first and are you talking about Hawaii Island? The east side of the island is pretty darn lush, west side is much dryer but still..
i'll check those out.  found this http://www.darthvaper13.com/store/p9/DarthMag_Box_Mod_.html while looking around.  pretty bad ass, i'll shell out the coin for this. 
Sorry this is pretty nitpicky but its the second time I've seen the line misquoted in this thread. It actually goes "tastes like splenda, gets drunk like scotch"
 you can see the host getting like, this women is dumb as fuck! saudi are cutting prices for only one reason everybody. its called "syria" and geopolitics. who's the people behind syria? yes iran and russia. syria is a big issue to saudis. and that is for many reasons including "morally" they are basically sunnis. and minority shia are genociding them. as simple as that. 
Because artys fartsy hipsters think an image can only be "good" or "art" if reduced from glorious 20+megapixel original RAW image that an SLR takes to a shitty .2 megapixel overly compressed jpg with a childish border that was coded up by some software engineer in 30 minutes over at Instagram headquarters.Ahh... "art".This makes me want to slap a hipster.
I'm outraged at criminals forcing cops to shoot them so often. I'm also outraged at people that would sooner defend violent criminals than defend a cop just doing his job. This excludes the minority of times the cop is in the wrong. 
Every few years I have variations on an old dream involving my father getting government permission to kill me. My mother in the dream usually says something like "I'm so sorry, I wish I could help you, but he's filled out all the correct paperwork". It terrifies me a little every time.
What other episode was this brought up in? I was under the impression that pearl saw the monster off screen and the first time it was mentioned was today. 
they did the same thing with Urf Warwick skinso I guess Riot will have to find some event that is has happened for a long time(extinction in the URF example) and make something related to that
Good analysis.  I do not think nefarian will see competitive play though, the variance is too great.  It isn't like shredder where you have a general sense you will get a ~2/2.  You get awful, good in 1 circumstance, in another situation this would be good, meh, and Holy cow this wins me the game.  You do not get the filter like thoughtsteal, and more than likely, the spell itself will not win you the game.  Now Ysera's card is always good (not always the best), but always good.  If you are comparing the two,   80% of the time I prefer ysera.  Chrommagus is tricky.  I think certain decks will want to play Chrommagus, but in general, the other two are better, because you get immediate effect.

This. I am pretty sure it's not the first time or person. The poor older have l teacher has probably been abused by some students regularly for a long time.
No...I just really miss controller arc gl where i got my first penta kill.His ult having power damage scaling and no will scaling (which you could get to huge massive levels), and the removal of inverted shield boost killed all my fun on him.I called him my little triple bubble trouble.  Ran two shield items, Oa and Grodd, and would just ult into a team fight, throw up both shields, and watch my adc get focused by 5 people and not die.
Hey I'd pick myself over Grimscale Oracle and Silverback Patriarch. At least Magma Rager can force a ping or threaten to trade with yeti. Not something grimscale or silverback can do.
The only reason I stayed was because it was both 100% disgusting and 100% fascinating. Too many friends in the health care business to be grossed out by this anymore.
&gt; it stops you form storing nuclear energy (though you also argued it is easy to curtail nuclear) Which is bad financially, but curtailment is better than accepting negative exports.  &gt; that wind generates most of its power at night.Also, it's quite active in the spring when temperatures are mild.  The less correlated with demand, the more storage is needed and the more likely it is that you will have to export that power when storage is full.
But shisha doesn't combust fully. After you take the coal off, there is still shisa there. Somewhat charred, yes, but not completely. It's not just purely combustion, as vaporization is a factor in it too.I'm not trying to say there is no combustion at all, there is. However, to say that there is only combustion would not be 100% correct.
I think Pearl's lip sync from episode 9 would have looked a lot better if the camera was on her the whole time. Cutting that lip sync into just clips of her here and there really did her take on that song no favors. 
No one  entering the draft  after Collins should be treated the same as Collins. I don't see how Roger Goodell is such a busy person that he can't hear these arguments case-by-case. There is absolutely no reason for "precidence"  to be  the justification for screwing someone when  occurrences like this are so rare. 
What rap needs is a more in-depth analysis of the benefits of money and going to clubs.  Tell us how your personal wealth is well above the statistical mean and elaborate on it's contributions to your lifestyle.  People need to know that comfortable financial circumstances not only lead to an increased acceptability to women, but that it can also enhance your popularity and social standing.  Social/political overtones are unnecessary and will only cloud the core theme.I'm dismayed that rap music has failed to deliver this message adequately to our nation's youth.
Yea it's on my top 5 list of careers for sure. Honestly not sure where I wanna go, but again, my city's PD or county sheriff will be in the future for me. Good luck!
I've never even watched one of their videos (before this one), but this makes me incredibly sad. She's not even 30 yet, she has never really lived a life, and she's near death. Absolutely heartbreaking. And her sister is still denying that they overeat....
no problem! I'll add it by saying I am a Lakers fan, but the fact that Billy D is going to OKC makes them #2 just because of how highly I value Billy. Not even Coach K has guys like Mike, Miller, Horford, Noah,Brewer, Parsons, &amp; Beal all playing in the 2015 playoffs...Good luck next year I'll be rooting for y'all 
I should set up a cool app that reminds everyone to skip Mondays. With one tap, people opt out of working/buying on that day. See how it grows, maybe it could reach millions over enough time.Not only would this make a statement, but a 4-day work week has been proven way more healthy &amp; productive. It's a win/win.
&gt;I didn't even read past the first sentence.But you bothered to reply.&gt;Now fuck off. I'm not responding to you again.Two replies in and this, LOL. Like I said earlier, you are too sensitive. Did I ever say I disagreed with you on all of this?You get irrationally angry at people over insignificant things and would rather the person or the tone rather than the content. You make wild assumptions about other people based and put words in other people's mouths.I sincerely hope you don't treat people like this in your real life, because we need more kindness and understanding in the world, not more violent outbursts.
There are people who still use drugs despite the risk of death, the only question is the efficacy of the deterrent - how many people actually don't do drugs because they're afraid of strangers killing them. 
And since there are 8 unique cards on the sheet it would have been funny to put the whole thing on table and be like yeah that's my team SR zombie style.
Im in what I'm assuming a room in the white house with fancy presidential decor and my whole vision is like a sepia tone. Everything is just a little bit skewed and distorted, like a salvador dali painting. As soon as I recognize the room again, paper-think presidents start creeping towards me from impossible places. I've got Abe Lincoln, arms stretched towards me, coming out of a drawer. Andy Jackson is emerging from behind a painting. They never do get to touch me but it's a terrifying couple of seconds until I wake up.

This follows my train of thought. Look at is a new job, you should be paid what the position is worth regardless of what your past position paid you.Best of luck.
Lol learned to stay away from that sub or what?In all honesty you look pretty good. You're lacking in a few areas but on the bright side you're 18 so you have a ton of room to grow.As far as drugs go i think you should consult a coach who can guide you and be a second eye, obviously your body handles gear really well. Besides the gyno and non existent traps I would say you have a good shot at going into a teen show and placing. As far as the national level I'm not sure, those guys are insane Regardless I wish you the best of luck and as always be safe

I am from new york, sir. I do not lie :-p. I think it's hot. I don't like bodies that are wayyy too ripped. You have the perfect amount of abs/cuts that I find quite attractive.
I agree.  It's a little insane that public servants can be such assholes.  And it's terrible that you were treated so poorly when you wanted news about your apartment being on fire!  Jesus christ.  Some people are just bullies, and they often become cops.
Exactly; it had some coral growth and many smaller fish living around it but it was poorly located so I guess never took off. And I've seen stranger mating duels in nightclubs at 2am :)

I'm in a pinch. I have Dick and the Cutch owner is in last place and looking to sell, wants to Dickerson and Myers for him. I'm worried if the steals don't come back for Cutch that him and Dickerson could be close to equal value, let alone if Myers can keep this up 
im not anti cop, but i had an experience where someone I know went in for a formal talk with PD and ended up getting arrested and charged for something he didnt do. Its not the first or last time its happened. Sometimes the prosecutors just want a conviction, not actual justice. 
Im just curious and maybe you could show some insight how were they all so gullible and stupid. It's as if it was a mental disease that was contagious. 
The idea being that if it works, it can be made better... Another article I read mentioned that they are working on a second improved model that should increase the thrust by five orders of magnitude... 
I'm old enough to remember when Mario was jumping over barrels and Pac-Man was all the rage, so yeah, I've done my share of time in arcades, but that was different. You went into the arcade knowing you were paying per game, and the only thing another quarter would do was let you continue your game. It didn't buy you upgrades.
No problem, feel free to PM me, your first breakup is rough, but it's good. You're learning real life stuff here. You're going to come out of this with way more adult in you than what you had before.
Jesus I couldn't live that way.When I want caffeine I go for an iced black coffee with 1 pump sweetener (compared to the 4 they usually put in a small) or sometimes just black. 
In the January of 2013, I heard this song. Wondering what it was, I searched everywhere for it until I came across a Brony song, Avast FLuttershy's Ass(not what you think). From there I kept hearing Brony songs until I got the balls to actually watch an episode in the September of 2013.You?DT
You already did the change of variable by substituting lambda into the g(v) and b(v) equations. Now there's no dv and you should be able to use the differential element d(lambda).At least that's my take on this.
I focus on cardio; I would love to do weight and strength training again, but I make (literally) zero growth hormone, and it's tough to make any progress without it. I hit the gym 4-5 times a week, and I either swim for an hour (I try to hit 2000 meters in a hour; I'm slow but I keep my heart rate in the 140s, which is reasonable for my age) or I play racquetball for an hour (well...we hit the ball back and forth; it keeps us moving more than if we played by the rules.)I'm considering giving aqua aerobics a try, and possibly Zumba. Zumba appeals to me, but there's only one class a week at the gym I can make it to. Eventually I'll give it a try. Perhaps Yoga, too.But for now...swimming is my main thing. I'm really digging it.
I completely agree with the Ginger and Katya moments. I've felt both of those things at some point in my life, and to know I'm not alone is so reassuring.
It's one of those shades that I know everyone loves and I want to try it someday but I don't think I'd wear it that much so it's usually toward the bottom of my priority list.
Playing it around this weekend especially Sunday will for sure get you to rank 3 or so fast. The rep literally will go by ranking you quick along with turning in your bounties. Idk about how much time you got but if you can spend a day on this you can get all your characters to level 4 on Sunday and Monday.Let's not also forget you have to glimmer farm to be able to buy those expensive gears and weapons after you're ranked.
Damn, fuck that. I've worked at Office Depot and Toys R Us, and at both places, we wouldn't clock out until we were walking out the door. I don't understand why some places nickel-and-dime and then force people to stay behind like that. 
Thanks. The kiddo pressed the home button while playing skylanders trap team and that icon came on and would not go away. I forced shut down and he is back playing but some skylanders figures are acting weird now.
To me it seemed like marrow was kinda inexperinced with mech. There was no constant blueflame hellion harassment like you see all good mech players do. Also everytime he was harassed where his army wasn't present he would moved all his army to deal with and then he would be attack on the other side.
Actually, after looking it over, I agree with you. Lilina has that speed issue, and Lugh vs Raigh basically comes down to how lucky Lugh is with the RNG. Good thing dark magic isn't unreasonably heavy too.
Watch them play 1 game and there is no speculation or discussion needed. Fanboys will be fanboys but the skills of those 2 players are not even close. 
Another fun fact - it was the only Serie A season ever in which the referees were chosen at random, rather than chosen by referee selection committee. Hmmm...
Afraid the other answer is not correct. Insurance in almost all US states follows your vehicle. Once you allow someone to drive your vehicle, you are assuming liability if they are in an accident. (Which is why, for example, insurance companies can deny damages caused when a car is stolen.) If your vehicle was in an accident and your insurance company had to pay out either to you or the other vehicle/property that was damaged - regardless of who was driving - that is a claim on your policy. If the driver of your car wasn't at fault, hopefully there will be no surcharge. If he/she was at fault, you will lose any "No Claim" discounts you have and may also see a surcharge if the claim exceeds whatever threshold your company has set. 
I'd add that all of them most spend at least an hour or two a day training.  These guys are in peak physical training which certainly requires a near daily regiment.
I don't dislike supes, I find him boring.And Zorro wore a costume, the shadow wore a costume, the phantom wore a costume......From the comics that are there I don't see much super influence.

It's an average. The more of a color, the more it weighs. That's why countries like China, Australia, and New Zealand are red, blue, and blue, respectively, because the color of the stars on their flag (and the Union Jack on the latter two) are not significantly colored compared to the main color.
Feeling pretty good today.  I really like how my hair is looking.Planning on going to dinner with my partner tonight at a burger place.  My first time out this week after work. This pleases me a lot and I'm somehow perversely looking forward to 20 minutes of makeup for a 30 minute meal. :PNeed to buy a electric shaver for like, 5-oclock shadow touchups when I need to put makeup on late in the day.Going to Avengers on Saturday with a bunch of friends who didn't know...  until I told them today.  Because hell if I'm gonna boymode on the weekend.  Reactions were generally of the "okay thanks for the heads up" variety.  Now I'm semi-nervous about whether they'll be nervous around me.I hate my arm hair. So much. Abdomen hair, you can go too.Today's the third day in a row that the scale read "1" on the first digit.10 boymode days left before full-time.  Only minorly freaking out about wardrobe and presentation.

If you want to engage her. Let her send  several, by night time respond with something like: "lol, what am I your photo album?"This will start a conversation, keep the conversation short, and simple. mainly say this if you are avilable to do something with her in upcoming days, and you are trying to make plans."I've taken better pictures with  a ( *Insert inanimate object* ) [ *Insert laughing emojii*]"or if you want to be passive: "That's nice."I'd go for the middle choice.  by default, and I use the last one if I know I got the juice to say shit like that.
In the one you've linked to, the guy's making a joke because all genitals are censored in movies, tv, porn are blurred out or pixilated because of strange censorship rules. I think you're missing the joke there.

Ah, nice. I guess there's no point trying to prevent people from screwing around with the file system now that the 360 is on its last leg (and that it's been open for so long) so they figured might as well make it easier on everyone. Also making hundreds of 1GB files would probably no be very efficient.
Refresher orb is really goof for some hereos (thinking warlock, Tide) but I can't imagine it doing much for others like Bristleback or Timbersaw.Every item doesn't need to be built by every hero.
We toured a psychotic amount and eventually people cared a little bit. I'm not sure we were trying to get noticed so much as we just really like playing shows and wanted to do it as much as we could. I will tell Carpark to check this AMA!

&gt;Conservation groups and scientists worry that China’s push to boost its harvest of krill -- a shrimp-like creature **used for aquaculture feed and human supplements** [...] The krill is quickly frozen and into processed into pellets for aquaculture and livestock operations, fish bait, and high-value “nutraceuticals” such as omega-3 dietary supplements.And then a classic quote from Prince Philip (Queen Elizabeth's husband)&gt;If it has four legs and is not a chair, has wings and is not an aeroplane, or swims and is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it. 
Well.... in theory yeah. Even the other way around it would work. One entrance and two exits.... whatever that would be good for.Let's just wait and see :P

Something like 68% of young Republicans support gay marraige and leglization. Soon we'll finally be socially liberal and fiscally conservative! I'm so happy!
Father willingly gave up marriage to live the life God set out for him, no possibility for marriage period. This is no different than any other person willingly giving up what they would think comes from the same type of unity they want to live the life they know God asks of them.
You know what I've heard helps headaches? Orgasms!! Also posting nude pics of yourself on social media websites. If only there were some way for you to combine the two...
I did this exact thing to one of my students a few weeks ago. It'd be one thing if they were just talking, but talking and lying/being an asshole to their classmates kinda pushed me into stronger territory.
None of these were RSD releases actually. We don't actually have a record store in my city yet, were getting one in June though which I can't wait for!These were all bought online throughout the years and recently. 
hahah! this is 100% absolutely true.For those too lazy to watch the clip, it's the Brofessor&gt; You're stuck in purgatory, every season you're cutting and gaining the same 10 lbs. It's like a caterpillar going into a cocoon and coming out as a caterpillar again. The herds of basic bitches you pray on can't even see cuts. To them, as long as you don't have a gut, you have abs. And you might think veins make you looked jacked but to girls you just look like a squeezed ball sack. The only people who care about being 6% body fat are dudes. And the only thing that really matters to dudes is, who's bigger. So if you wanna win this summer, don't cut the fat. Cut the bullshit. And cut to the chase. #SummerBULK2015
I would have loved if someone had bought me a book on pregnancy that outlined what was happening each week with baby and my body. Maybe that's not what you're going for since she's "high-risk" but alot of these books also include sections on dealing with lose. 
I may be able to help! I used to have problems with a bump appearing on my nose ring. I was advised by my piercer to crush up bayer aspirin and put a little water on it in order to make it into a paste. Then I put that paste on my ring for about 15 mins and washed it off with distilled water. Worked great!Edit: I'd recommend doing it once or twice a day 'till your bump goes away
When I heard that Levi's came out with those jeans, I was so excited. I'm a 41-29-44. They would have been perfect. Then the all too familiar reality hit me in the face that they don't make inseams longer than 34". And then I cried. 
Are you interested in the Mutual Funds or ETFs? Only the mutual funds have the idea of Admiral's shares, ETFs are only 1 class (with the same expense ratio as the Admirals normally). The admiral class minimum of most of their big funds is $10k, but for some smaller ones it is higher.
Did you grind or not? Just asking, since units in Fe8 can be very different depending if you grind. In Fe9, I'd say Ike, Oscar, Marcia, Nephenee, Kieran, Stefan (if you can get him), Gatrie, Rolf if you want a bow user, Reyson for dancer, Jill, and Elincia (because Elincia is love, Elincia is life no bias promise).

"How can global warming be true, if it was so old here last winter?" Yeah...that's like saying "Hey, people in Africa aren't really dying of starvation because I just ate a big meal and I'm stuffed."  WUT?
You just have to add "and best season" to your comment and it is usually the MVP. Best player on the best team with the best season in the NBA. If all of that fits, they are the MVP 100% of the time.
I set my campaigns up by very narrow segments of audience. I choose one type of targeting (my go-tos are 1. Job Title 2. Job Function + Seniority 3. Skills + Seniority and 4. Groups + seniority). Then I run different offers to see what the audience is willing to respond to (blog posts, guides, ebooks, webinars, demo request).Sorry for the incredibly late reply here!
The operative term is 'talk'.  Civil debate is a good, healthy thing.  Hating on people because they do not think like  you do is not.  So many haters these days.  Not you, I mean in general.
It's pretty shocking how corrupt Indonesia is. Their highest judge was recently prosecuted for corruption. Their anti-corruption court is rife with corruption. The whole system is a joke - no one should be executed under such a system because no one can possibly know if anyone has got a fair trial. Indonesia should suspend ALL executions until they sort out their shit.
As a future teacher (1 more year) I've heard that one of the best places to get discouraged form teaching is the teacher's lounge. Usually because teachers go there to get away from the kids and often times complain about them. Surrounding yourself with people who don't like kids will make you not like kids. So I think it's bad for a different reason in that these teachers will begin disliking teaching more and more and will hurt students views to learning before they quit. You have to love kids and teaching otherwise you're doing a disservice to the students.
This is ridiculous. This is why we have stupid and ridiculous conflicts. World War 2 was a war. It was not a means to put more money into the pockets of businessmen. 
I checked your profile to see if this was you or your spouse, tbh this is one of the most naturally beautiful girls I've seen(besides my wife of course) in a long time. Such a perfectly pleasant, playful, sexy smile. Thank you for sharing!

This. If a third party received enough votes the last election (they did not), they'd be eligible to receive up to $90ish million in campaign funds.On the other hand, the Democrats and the Republicans are set to spend over a billion dollars per candidate.There is a reason that Obama et al have eschewed using public funds in their campaigns: they want to have a chance to win.
Lol no, but maybe I did lose it to toxocariasis. I simply think a parent should not shit in a cat litter box regardless if it is the kids week to clean out or not. ) - Aw crap, I just lost the other one. 
As much as a I love the 1st round, I want to see the Cowboys trade back, get a high 2nd and 4th, use that 4th and late 2nd to get a mid 2nd, pick a CB, DT and grab an RB in the 3rd.

Hey, do you know what it is that makes you feel such hatred towards these things? Does the violence make your thoughts go in an unwanted direction? And when you say these things make them bad people, do you mean you think your friends are bad people for enjoying the shows/games, or that the people who make them are bad? It sounds like it could easily be a depression thing tbh.

We are really really bad at taking hints and apparently numbers, we're so used to having to ask for them we don't realise when it's the other way around. 
I'm honestly surprised you can vape nana cream on the OCC without dry hits.wash em off in alcohol then rinse it out really well in hot water. I would say you should just pop a new coil in and it's not worth the trouble, but that's me..
I'm not really disputing that they could have maintained a better communication channel with us. But I feel like the perspective on why they should be doing that is somewhat skewed. It sounds like Scott thinks it should have been done to prevent people going bananas, when people shouldn't have went bananas in the first place. Damage control instead of discourse.Perhaps I'm just reading his statements wrong.
I cultivate a view that I live in a kind and loving universe.  By accepting that, I accept that deserved or not, good things will happen for me.  It allows a lacksidasical certainty of outcome.
I don't know what went wrong with the keyboard. It would seem you should get Lenovo to exchange it for a working model.You don't mention if you have the Touch or Non-touch model.I have a Non-touch with 1080p screen. I have yet to turn the brightness past 75%. In a semi-darkened room I rarely go above 50%. If your T450s cannot get bright I'd have Lenovo exchange it for one that works.I have a T430, T420, T510 and a T61. The only one of these that has a terrible screen is the T420. There is an XPS at work (I think), I suppose I could compare the two side by side. 
Constant shouting of EU! EU! EU! EU! at sporting events, or any large gathering basically. Choreographed performances of Ode to Joy with flypasts and troops from EU battlegroups before sporting events or any large gathering basically. Unusual veneration of the founding fathers; Schuman, Gasperi, Monnet, Spaak, Spinelli.I may have confused some stereotypes here.
You don't trade out a trait line, you just don't specialise in it. If a ranger traits in Marksmanship, Skirmishing and Beast Mastery, they aren't trading out Nature Magic or Wilderness Survival, they are just not specialising in those traits.The only thing which locked you into specific specilisations rather than choosing what you want was the reveal that you only choose three trait lines to specialise in. It ended up having nothing to do with elite specialisations.Honestly, when you look at the proposed trait lines, they are seem similar to elite specialisations anyway - longbows will build Marksmanship, Traps and Shortbows will build Skirmishing, Spirits will take Nature Magic etc. Locking down the staff to the Druid trait line seems like less of a limitation when you consider than most players running an existing weapon are heavily encouraged to trait that weapon anyway.

I came out to my parents when I was 20 and for the next 10 years or so, we had off and on contact. I didn't go searching for a parental figure, but looking back, I realize that I related to many of my managers as parental figures. [I'm an engineer working in product development organizations.] Frankly, many of those managers helped me grow up. Sometimes I was sort of "adopted" a bit by my partner's parents as well.Now I am in my 50's and a manager. I wouldn't say I play a "parental" role in some people's lives, but I am on the mentor side more often than on the "being mentored" side.One thing I have noticed throughout my career is that there are a lot of people, straight and gay, who seem to be seeking parental approval (as I did) in vain. Unfortunately, having a messed up relationship with your parents is not exclusive to being gay/lesbian, but it sure seems more common amongst us.
Right there with you. National merit scholar now failing classes. Gpa from 3.7 to 2.5. Depression is a bitch. You just have to find what works for you study wise. For me, empty classrooms help. Space and isolation. You have to be strict about setting study days. It's incredibly difficult and I'm nowhere near succeeding, but it's given me some improvement.  Do it for yourself, not your family. 
The Strait isn't international waters.  Its entirety is either in Oman's territorial waters, or Iran's.  It is however defined as a ["Transit Passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_passage)" by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  There are a few other spots that also have this sort of classification, such as the Dover Strait or the Strait of Malacca.The thing is that Iran is merely a signatory, and the United States hasn't signed that UN Convention at all-- so both sides use their status to suggest they can act abnormally.  Iran claims they can dick around if they want, and the US has warned everyone that they *will* dick around if others do.
No offense, but dude is a playa. For a 13 year old boy, he's got confidence coming out his pores. I don't know how he does it, I'm totally envious that I wasn't like that at 13! Basketball, friends, bonfires, video games at friends houses.... dude has it all.
I was diagnosed with ADD and my parents got told the same thing. I'm currently working as a commercial pilot while working on my masters degree. I think I've done fairly well until I look at the remaining balance on my student loans. Nothing like a mountain of debt to bring you quickly back to reality.
I highly doubt that anyone would be able to. I'm no internet security expert by any means, but if finding an IP address of someone connected to tor is practically impossible, I don't think anyone could figure that out. 
I mean those are pretty much par for the course and in-line with what most girls wear.  You wouldn't really standout as immodestly dressed. Showing your midriff like the girl in the picture is too much though
I was just wondering what went wrong. Maybe I was indeed creepy. But I was friendly and nice and respectful. Even asked how she was doing and if she was enjoying the date. But she left in such a hurry. So maybe I did something wrong..but I didn't. I was just being myself and there is nothing wrong with that. Maybe she thought my hair was too curly. It could have been anything honestly. I was just wondering what exactly is creepy? Sitting too close to her or something? I didn't touch her, only shook her hand with a smile. Asked how she was and how her day was going. Said thank you for showing up. I was nice to her. I'm trying to figure out what I did wrong. But again maybe I didn't do anything wrong and it was just bad luck. I've just been unlucky. I've had successful dates in the past. So yeah.
In the city just register as a Democrat regardless of political affiliation. That will enable you to vote in the elections that matter (at the local level).
While these two are probably most associated with the Contemporary "movement", I'd also add in Arnold Schoenberg and Nijinsky, of perhaps a little bit of a mid-point. And some Jackson Pollock for fun.
I have literally never heard of men making false rape claims against women. Even if they do, the percentage should be minuscle and *no one* would believe them. If you'd like to enlighten me and show how much that happens or if any woman ever got arrested for a false rape claim, I'd be glad and include them, but I did not find anything on the matter. As far as I know, women are the main cause of false rape claims.
Ugh I have to find a new job soon. I can only work st the school 1 more semester. I forget if it's a state law or a federal law (or a school rule) they had to enact a few years ago, but apparently people would go to my little 2 year tech school for 8+ years and do work study so they didn't have to work real jobs.I'm only here for 1 more year, but I don't wanna go back to retail before I get my degree :(
Totally agree about the Avalon, but my kid does have a lead foot (like me) so I understand the concern.  I am hoping that maybe the hassle of a car search will be enough to convince him.  The Avalon was actually my mother-in-law's (she purchased new) so we know the complete history.  Plus, it's a freaking boat.I have seen a couple of those Scions and thought they looked neat.  A lot like a Honda Element--actually found one of those in our price range but there was something majorly wrong with it.
Couldn't say I'm afraid. I'm pretty sure I've beard you can use xbox controllers though. I've got one myself. Might give it a try tonight and get back to you :)

Most academically awesome class I've ever taken is german. I love the idea of learning a new language. Most fun class I've ever taken is film appreciation. It was pretty much a blowoff academically, but I love watching movies and I think I'm much more knowledgeable about them now. 
I live in one of the bike theft capitals in America. So bad that it's one of two cities that Kryptonite doesn't guarantee their locks. What you do here is register your bike with the police department so if it's stolen and found, then they know who it belongs to and that it's yours. Sure it makes it significantly harder if they file off the serial number but it's better than nothing. Maybe if you really care enough about your bike you can microchip it like you can your pet.

Anbeav, I have a serious confession:today turned from a splurge into a full blown binge day. I honestly cannot express how ashamed I feel right now to write this. I stole food from the common fridge. I feel terrible, physically and mentally. Actually I think I'm having a panic attack now. I've suddenly plunged into darkness, why the hell did I do this to myself?? I've gone over 4000 calories for sure and the sugar content must be through the roof. I'm bloated and what's worse: that hopeless depressive feeling has overwhelmed me. It's 1 am in the morning and I should be asleep.Geezus fucking Christ what's happening, why??? This is like the end of March when I binged at home, except I did it the last day at halls of residence.I'm at a loss for what to do.One side of me thinks that the IF thing I was doing pushed me into a slightly starving cycle. Will never try IF that way again.

ok, so most of the answers here refer to [basically] rhythm. But I find I always wake up a bit before the alarm, regardless of what time I have it set, and just lie there staring at the clock for a few minutes. Is that more what you were referring to OP? Otherwise, yeah, circadian rhythm.

You have to give them the benefit of the doubt because a lot of them are honest people doing their best to protect you; if you don't trust cops then who do you trust, the drug dealers that come up with all sorts of claims against them so they can get off on technicalities? Where do you stop distrusting the police? Would you have them all fired and the PD shut down? Who is going to enforce the law and keep you safe then?You say Reddit likes to defend cops but every single day for the last month there have been posts of police abuse claims. At the end of the day those guys are doing the job no one else wants to do; until proven otherwise I will take their word over a criminal's or someone with priors.Everyone is innocent until proven guilty.
So is there just gonna be nothing with Zoe Barnes Murder anymore or Peter Russo or heck even Rachels demise.  Honestly I hate the fact characters like Tom or Christina arent there to somehow question what is going on.  IMO the best parts were season 1 and the beginning of season 2 when Luke was trying to figure out something, the murder mystery stuff was very interesting and I just hope that it comes full circle by the time its all said and done.

Dreams where I cheat. I forget in the dream that I have a girlfriend, then emotionally cheat and start to physically cheat on them. Partway though I go "oh shit what the fuck am I doing what is wrong with me". Then, I proceed to feel awful and freak out for a few dream days. In some dreams, I tell my SO that I cheated, she is devastated, I'm feeling like I deserve to die. Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.I rarely dream, but when I do, it is incredibly convincing. Since I dream so little, this dream makes up a solid 5-10% of my dreams and I always wake up believing it happened, and not realizing it was a dream for a few minutes.

honestly i don't understand these fucking posts. If this was any other professional sport underperforming players would be instantly benched. If a player does not play as well as the standards set by his peers, he shouldn't be a paid professional. Fnatic will do what they think will give them the best chance to win worlds as an organization.
You're the one inserting the "he wanted to martyr himself" part into the story.  Self-harm isn't that unusual especially among the mentally ill and drug abusers.  Not saying the story checks out but it's not impossible either.
Wisdom-based Spellcasters synergize well with Gunslinger, as you get more Grit per day based on your Wisdom score.  A Battle Spirit Shaman/Gunslinger combination can be very potent, as you'll have Battle Spirit hexes, spells, and lots of Grit.At 8th level, the main Battle spirit hex will grant you an extra AoO that stacks with Combat Reflexes, and at 8th level will grant you Weapon Specialization in a chosen weapon as a bonus feat.  They also get a Hex that can cause a -4 penalty to AC and CMD with only a partial Will save - even if they succeed, they still take the penalty for one round.  They also gain access to a swift-action Bane, as well as an aura that grants a +2 Morale Bonus to hit and damage.
Well the other thing is that so far Blizzard hasn't introduced copies of the characters that came back to Draenor with us.I think Blizzard said that they died this time around, like AU Maraad had died already in this timeline which is why he's not around
I pretty much only go to see rock bands. Lately I only go to see Brand New. Been outdoor a few times not really my thing. I really enjoy going to the Tabernacle in ATL. I dislike stadium style. Been to Earthlink in ATL once I really liked it but it was rather small. probably the best BN show I have seen was there.How is Ryan Adams live? I have seen him live on TV alot but it just isn't the same.Speaking of Ryan Adams does anyone have a link to that thing he did with Elton John on CMT a long time ago? it was awesome. [here is a song from it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXNgLhfBNjs)
You're trying to give yourself a pat on the back morally by saying the US lost because of X factor done to the country and civilian population. Undeniable, yea it is, the affect of Agent Orange was horrendous, I knew a us Air Mechanic who took off the canisters and his bones became so brittle they would break just by turning a screw driver.Were discussing the military outcome between the United States and the NVA until 1973. its fall two years later, political fiasco, the us military was barley even there at that point. Not to mention the ARVN would have held out if the US didnt fuck them over by not sending any supplies over ( that whole 722 million aide deal with ford)
That's entirely impossible since you can see multiple X's on the radar during the clip (indicating a teammate died there recently) and there's also a friendly tag in the back right between the first and second enemy sitting down.Watch the middle-right of the clip. You can literally see his teammates respawning.
Nils: "Ey, wer von euch ist denn der Blaue?"Ede: "Ich."Nils: "Mhm..."Ede: "Wieso?"Nils: "Na, ich wunder mich, dass du dich nicht aufregst über den Roten"Aus dem Beach Spikers Beef. Imo einer der besten Sprüche von Nils überhaupt.
Even if we paid male CEO's 30% less to put it in line they'd still all be making stupid amounts of money on the backs of people who don't earn enough.  The system is broken, making it a gender based issue is merely deflecting from any real problems.

For backpacks, I'm about the same size as you and bought an Osprey Tempest 40 last summer. It has frame and proper hipbelt which makes it much more comfortable to carry than some which have belts that just hold the bag to your body but don't put the weight on your hips 
Also, when complaining about their children to other people, all I can think of is you only have yourself to blame for that! Not everything is controllable, but be a good parent and raise them properly, and your kids' actions and attitudes will reflect that. 
I *really* don't think controversy made Thorin famous. He succeeded because he's an excellent interviewer, and Grilled put him in the spotlight in this community.IMO, these thinly veiled jabs he's been spamming the :&gt; face with are just cheap pandering, and he can do better as a journalist.Not that I don't get cheap pandering. I just disagree that it's what makes him famous.
I'm stating a fact. It's the hook, but it's probably the most boring issue the podast covered. If you think it's the point of the podcast you got tricked. 
Stand your ground laws only exist in about half the states, and in a lot of states it is difficult or impossible to open or conceal carry. But of course, breaking the law is better than being dead or violated.
I have been a collector that started exactly 1 month. Since I never actually knew about rarity I lost many chances to get the unicorns. Now I just want to find the remaining 11 unicorn amiibos I need to complete my collection. I am mostly doing this for my younger brother (Huge Nintendo and SSB fan) because I am about to leave to college soon and I want to give him all of the SSB4 series amiibos as a good bye gift for him.  Even if I don't win, thanks for giving me a chance to give my brother a goodbye gift he will never forget and good luck to the co-winner.

Bliss was fine - I can't really complain about it. I did notice that the maintainer (and this was an unofficial build too) stopped updating it about ten days ago.I actually don't mind Touchwiz that much - the Lollipop version seems to be pretty smooth and speed seems a little snappier than Bliss was (again, likely because it was unofficial).I've rooted this ROM as well so with Titanium I can freeze any system apps that look to be causing any problems but so far so good.Keep in mind I get bored easily and could change my mind next week and try something else. :)
This is how it works, in fact the familiar timer also doesn't go down while you're in the cache. I can't confirm for every familiar but I know both Light Familiars and Muspahs work in this way.
Thanks you read my mind with that last sentence. I'd have to throw DD-WRT on there and figure out how to configure the VLAN which I have a feeling will make this customer regret ever wanting wireless internet for the customers in the first place, haha.For curiosity's sake though, and keeping in mind that they have the verizon modem/router and a 16 port gigabit switch...You're saying to setup the verizon as modem only, plug it into a 3 port business class router that supports vlan, use a port on that router to go out to the 16 port switch for the business wired network.Then, inside the router, configure a vlan just for wireless. Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Thanks!
Championed, lobbied for, influenced....why are you picking this apart? What did you do for it? If you promoted it and worked hard at it, I would say you influenced it. 
it seems like you can bump ships easly and cause them to spin  not so badly if inertial dampeners are on and thrusters are on. before i could fly into a small ship almost  die and it would slowly drift away. after the patch i can tap the ship and it moves very easly.
I'm running this rom now: http://forum.xda-developers.com/tmobile-g2/development/rom-tmo-lp-extreme-v1-0-4-16-15-t3084681It's stock Lollipop (5.0.2), with the bloatware removed and has Viper4Android built into the rom. It's stable, and the battery life has been really good.
If you’re just starting out, then consider playing around with a single Activity or a single Fragment until you have figured out the basics; no need to complicate things at the start.If you have added a TextView, with an id of "@+id/my_first_text_view", then in your code, you can set the text thus:    TextView myTextView = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.my_first_text_view);    myTextView.setText("Hello, World");
He was suggesting (very clearly) that he wants it to be free; as if he and every one else as players deserve it. There's no way to argue that that is the case any more than there is an argument to sell them.Plus, his demeanour to the whole idea was crass. I'm not against 'voting with your wallet'. I'm against his perspective overall on Chromas.
i didnt state it would help every time. I know if this ever gets implemented there still will be 15 second instalocks, but maybe they may reconsider such as what the person above said. Ever since I got into hotness 4 out of 6 matches have an instalocker anyways so maybe this will make them at least think about it so I most likely should have to dodge queue less since I refuse to play with them.
The tire thing concerns me a bit. Every two weeks isn't that much of an inconvenience but the tire may weaken quicker at the puncture site. Eventually, it could blow out on you. If the tire is not repairable, buy new tires. At least two if four is too much money for you. Stock tires last between 20-40k miles depending on how you drive. 
making "skins" a store purchase instead of being able to get in game. is stupid. You already pay 15 bucks a month in one of the few major mmos left that requires a monthly subscription and yet they have stuff like "skins" and all you can buy too? sighs.
The announcer has a point though. Stras's body language is horrible once he gets in a jam. Maybe he will harness the anger but it looks like he's bitching in the dugout or blaming his teammates on tv. Also the announcer admitted he was envious of Stras's talent.
Thanks for this, bc I will likely miss at least the first hr.  Fucking work!  I knew I wouldn't miss the Lions pick, just was wondering if I'd have time to grab dinner beforehand.
Lol, no, that's just his nickname. His name is Baz for short, Basil for formal, and Bastard for trouble (just kidding on the last one, if he pulls an unsmart maneuver, my response is usually just "Dog!!!" or some other percussable monosyllable).
I like straight up, it's easier to re adjust. And I hate cheap sniping, the way I see it, you should have to hit a head shot for a one hit kill. I'm a bit frustrated because I could have gotten a better perk than FR. 
I was lucky enough to be there for the game.  They had prepared a video to play and it was a really nice moment that resulted in a long, loud, and strong standing ovation from the entire stadium which is where the tearing up shots are from.  The only thing that kind of sucked was that afterword some fans would still boo hard when he got the ball.  They couldn't give it up for one night and respect or recognize how much Vince did for the Raptors and how he was quintessential in legitimizing the team when it started.  His number will be retired without a question.
Pick one favorite and get it to 50 to unlock everything.  After that if you want to level them concurrently, you certainly could.As far as additional skills for your MNK, LNC to 22 for Invigorate is fine for now, but you'll eventually want to get it to 34 for Blood for Blood.  As the other poster said LNC sadly is the most boring class before 26.  Just keep Heavy Thrust buff up and Impulse Drive spam.  If you start going crazy and need some kind of variety, you could cross-class Fracture from MRD.
Wow, it's terrible. I was waiting for this to come out, but all the bad things the iPhone users were saying are true. I think I may just go third party on this
I think myself and the rest of the class immediately thought that right after she said it lol. I wanted to say "honey, it sounds like you're not mature enough to be having sex if you can't say "put a rubber on"". It's kind of funny though, every woman I've ever had sex with has insisted at least once that I don't need to wear a rubber, even when they're not on the pill. Good thing I'm not stupid enough to do that. 
Just that. The Rubicon is a very capable rig as far as rigs come stock, but they aren't cheap. In my opinion, if you can wait, an upgraded Sport is much more cost efficient than a Rubi. But, atleast for me, that meant waiting while I saved for mods. My sport is now much more capable than a stock Rubi. Many individuals won't need what I have. You have to plan out what kind of capability you need and how soon you need it.Also, don't discount a stock sport. The diffs suck, but any stock JK can do pretty well.
Soujorn Grips from Dead Orbit are great too. 49 discipline 48 strength, hand cannon loader, and faster melee speed which can save you in those melee fights

Fair enough, I still think it should have been made apparent that was the intention.  Nowhere did it talk about an introductory period or even a trial, so I just feel misled.
I'm a nurse tech.1. Despite what movies show you, defibrillating a heart that has stopped beating is useless, and will not save the person.2. CPR is horribly ineffective and has a very slim chance of saving the person's life by itself (we do it because it's better than sitting there staring at them).

There's no real easy way to tell, especially not with this resolution. The entire screen is being taken up by whatever editor that is. Match up the bottom panel with the text on the left and you'll see that's all editor, which could be any OS.
If you're 180 cut you're plenty strong. Most certainly *not* worth messing your body up with steroids over.Too much obsession with size IMO.. I mean go for it if that's your thing, I just want to be fit and strong enough to enjoy life.
Typically, artists will put the files (MIDIs, acapellas, whatever) for their songs and that's how people remix them. At least, that's how they do it easily. I'm no producer so I'm just talking about it from what I've seen on the subreddit. If the artists don't share it people can still make remixes, although I'm sure it's harder.
Good night, sweet prince.EDIT: To the people downvoting me, it's s Shakespeare reference.  It's said as a sign of respect when the main character passes away in Hamlet.
Cases are extremely personal so I won't go too much into it.  Get what makes you happy!  The H440 is super sexy.  I just like folks to know all the options :D
He's not OP in the sense that everything he does is easy, it's just that a lot of what he does is safe (hard to punish. I don't think he's OP as hell, but it's pretty hard when you fight somebody thats half-decent with him.
&gt; but the description you made above probably fits more in line for NeoFAG.We aren't overrun with hair-trigger trannies who determine what can and can't be said (for fear of *triggering* language), so there goes that theory.
Shakespeare was called the people's bars for a reason. He made things that were popular. Some of his characters are admittedly a bit simplistic. Buuuuut Shakespeare also had a mastery of language, allegory and implying stuff. That's why he's the best. There are so many layers to his writing, so many things you can pick out language wise or character wise. 
His ult change really didn't do much for him. His problem has always been that he's easy to kite; this does nothing to fix that.Like yea I'd say it's better than before, but it doesn't address his biggest problem.
Other than the shinigami, Death Note seems absolutely perfect for movie adaptation as far as Anime go, if they can fuck that up you can't really trust them to get anything right.
Clearing up some earlier reviews that I hadn't yet gotten to posting. This one I had reviewed some time ago and was just sitting in my notes.**Nose**: medicinal - like bandaids and polysporin, caramel, sweaty socks, rotten egg and burnouts**Palate**: rubbing alcohol, spoiled honeydew?**Finish**: 2-stroke exhaust, grass, thank goodness it's short!Certainly not one I can recommend at all. For me this one had way too many off notes to be enjoyed what-so-ever. **40**/100
AJ literally said that the angle ended shortly after the promo. She talked about being disappointed that they didn't do anything with it (The question was: "Why wasn't there a followup"). Which is why even she didn't get much more promo time after all that. And she didn't even continue "winning and winning", her winning percentage in 2013 was around 30-35%. Which is awful for a champion.Meltzer also stated that Nikki has gone off script on AJ before (and vice versa), and alluded to the fact that there's heat there.http://www.cagesideseats.com/2011/9/4/2404611/catfight-bella-twins-go-on-twitter-rant-over-perceived-insults-in
He's booked in for tomorrow! :) The receptionist was very kind and understanding of my situation.Unfortunately when I spoke to the receptionist at TM'Z she was.. kind of rude when I was trying to explain my problems, and basically told me to wait until the 13th or bring him in for emergency after 9pm. :(

I used to work at a university and one of the professors in the department had a deer ass mounted on her office wall behind her desk. I later found out the story was that she asked her husband for some quirky taxidermy for her birthday (she studies material culture), so she probably meant something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/WmjXAsU.jpg) but he got her the deer ass instead. Not sure if he did it as a joke or didn't actually know what she meant.

What?If a business owner offers wedding catering as a service within his business, he is required to provide that service to any customer regardless of what their marriage/wedding ceremony looks like. If he refuses, he should be charged a fine, not go to jail. If he does not offer wedding catering as a service, then of course he would not be required to cater a wedding.Edit: grammatical error
That is literally the most disgusting thing I've ever fucking seen in my life. And I rented all the Faces of Death videos when I was 13 and I've been on Reddit for two years. Fuck. Can't get it outta my mind. And I didn't even watch it for more than two seconds before backing out.
That "antsy" feeling is how we often feel when our friend wants to come over to watch a movie because we happened to mention it in passing. Especially if our friend decides to bring one of his friends who wants to see the movie, but we have like nothing in common except this friend and movie.For us, it's relaxing to do our own thing without anybody around to tell us how to do it better, or making us feel like we're performing, or worried that they might not like what we're doing.
You need way more fuel than that (or a much smaller payload) to go to the Mun and back.Install [KER](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/18230) and consult [the ΔV map](http://imgur.com/9xvAsIT).Note that it only takes ~3500m/s to reach LKO now rather than the 4400m/s it used to take in old aero, but all non-atmospheric figures are identical.
I cannot put into words how much I love programming. So many avenues to go down, so many ways to innovate, and the very real possibility of changing the world just by doing it a lot. I work at a web development company and do independent game design in my off time, and rarely feel burnt out. If I could add an extra day to the week to program, I would do it twice.
Motivation well um 'just do it' probably doesn't work haha. Just envision your goal down the road. Don't fall into the trap of 'it has to be tonight' or 'tomorrow' just think about how reaching your goal will make you feel. I mean heck my right knee has been killing me for a few days now, but I can't wait to get out and walk. Probably not motivating enough without a banner... and confetti. Definitely need confetti.
It wouldn't be good for the economy, but massive economic slump is a bit of a stretch.First, the crops which get cut will be the least important ones.  Almonds are getting a lot of flak, but they're high price products and will continue being produced.  Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.  It's quite possible that people will eat fewer of the vegetables California specializes in, and more of some other vegetables, when the price changes.
yes.  I've had a serious fight with my parents last year, and basically they know that I no longer respect anything they have to say anymore.  Just ignore whatever they have to say, but you still have to do what is right for you even if that means taking the exam and doing the same thing your parents told you to do.  Don't mess with your life to express your anger, there are other ways to do that.

Found another one mods!  Get 'em!Seriously though, I don't think it was necessary to delete your comment. There was a thread that talked about the change from Sunspear to Dorne. 
Another serial non-completer here (though I did beat Batman Arkham Asylum today), seeing you describe that list as big made me feel bad about my own 200+ game backlog.I think the key is to remember to have fun. If you're just not enjoying a game X amount of hours in, it may not be for you. Don't feel bad about quitting it early, even if it's meant to be a good game. Give it a fair try though. I did that a while back with Mirror's Edge.
is this going to be like the kinnect all over again? Use it or dont use it, no one cares about you that much to listen into your conversation. And if they did your house would be bugged already so you're screwed either way.
You don't have to do all that. I think a little more would be involved with FA but TFA is great. You can just order whatever with no hassle. Ecigexpress sells FA stuff in bulk. Also on the percentage thing...if you have a recipe that is good at 18% and decide to scale it back to 14% respectively, your going to just end up with a recipe that has less overall flavor and may not be as enjoyable. I wouldn't go that route. Just make the juice the way it is supposed to be in your original recipe without scaling. There is a massive profit margin selling juice anyway, especially if you are just selling to friends etc because you basically have no overhead.
Source? Google it. I'm not spending the time to look it up because you're too lazy to research something that doesn't fit your narrative.&gt;no person can force a bank to offer a mortgageReally? Actually the government can and did. So again you're wrong. No person can force another to take out a mortgage though. As to your last point I said *you* absolve people of their responsibility. If you enter into a 30 year contract without taking the time to understand the risks involved, or hire someone who can explain it to you, then you are taking on a level of risk you should be willing to accept. You're saying it's not these peoples fault.  Well who else is at fault for getting a mortgage they can't afford? Who else decided to buy a house with no money down on an ARM? When you buy a house you can't afford, just like anything else, you run the risk of losing your home. Period.

The callers for this crime should be tried with attempted murder and put in jail for as long as the law allows. Doing that could get someone killed, and will most likely kill their dogs too if they try to defend their owner even if no one else is hurt. The people that do this are disgusting.
My friend back on the Xbox bought a $20 shark card. He spent it all on cars, then kept selling the cars. He eventually lost all of his money because he couldn't decide on a car. Biggest waste of money ever. The only people who buy shark cards are the stupid ones who don't know what to do with all the money, then end up buying more.
I doubt it would have been that extreme. Souls games already had different state-of-beings that affected not only your stats, but your movements as well (i.e. soul form, hollowing and low equipment load, heavy equipment load) aside from an aesthetically altered state-of-being, which given this studios ability to design brilliant- looking monsters, a roleplaying element was all it needed to be, perhaps with a slower moveset and adjustments to stats that would hinder/enhance certain approaches to combat. There are hundreds of different ways to make it work, and I am not buying the fact they couldn't.

Not that salty. Both are elite at their respective positions. JJ Watt is just an animal, but can't be upset with a top 5 talent from a draft class ever.
It does not perform like a quad core. Hyperthreading greatly reduces time spent switching between threads. It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.So this is one of the many factors that improve this CPU's performance compared to an older processor (or an AMD processor) but it unfortunately is not the same as having 4 cores-- ever 
All very good points. I agree that RDA probably wins again. I just have a hard time overlooking the fact that Khabib has already been out for over a year and just injured himself again. We're looking at a minimum of 13 months between fights and if it's his ACL again maybe upwards of 18 months. If he was already Champion people would probably be calling for an interim belt. 
Oh, I did get my codes in the end (say thanks to Alex for me). Just wanna say I'm loving this game so far, thanks a bunch to every one at Lunarch! Edit: I am now aware Elyot is Alex. Thanks again!
I think you're underselling the requirements of this job.  I'm not saying it's highly skilled, but it does require some skills.  It's not low skilled at all 
Developers have said that the game is being made regardless of funds they receive. Kickstarters for implementing additional things they couldn't otherwise, such as multi-platform release and amiibo. Also they have a working model that they've shown off today, so no.
Jurassic Park.  Yes, I'm excited as heck to watch the new one in June, but Malcolm, Grant, Ellie, and Hammond will always hold a place in my heart.  I know so many fun facts about the production of that movie :D
I think people have scripts that just watch that page and buy them instantly.  I've seen a few go up for sale only a couple days after they were sold, for $300 over the original price.  Pretty disgusting IMO.
Damn, don't you hate when one little Freudian slip gets you exposed!J.K., I believe you when you say this incident was a simple mistake and really want to hear the rest of the story.
You are being treated unfairly and manipulated.  You shouldn't be put in this situation.  Honestly, I would inform him any threats to his safety, no matter how they are conveyed, will be conveyed to the police for a welfare check.  Please find a friend or a counselor in which to confide.

It really doesn't sound as if what you have there is a valid will. An end of life document generally deals with what happens up until the point you die, a will is what is needed after that point. If it doesn't count as a will, she essentially died intestate and this http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/intestate-succession-california.html basically outlines what the rules are.P.S. Were there 2 witnesses?

You should not use EDR to get to z3000.Its just not efficient. I would advise you to use 89 in 45, so you , with the help of pluto and thusia, get some gold
I don't know much about coaching, but from what I have heard Scott Brooks is a shitty coach when it comes to game day coaching, in game substitutions, drawing up plays etc.  I don't know, but a lot of NBA media was talking about how he wasn't going to get them over the hump like 3 years ago.  I don't think he is bad, just that he wasn't going to get the job done.

Years ago I took a s&amp;w 642 in for a trigger job. Bring it down to 10# I said. It was too heavy for my wife at the time to shoot. I pick it up the next week and the gunsmith laughs and asks me how heavy I thought the trigger was? 15#? 20#? He says "I have no idea, my trigger scale only goes to 24# and it maxed out without breaking the trigger."Good times

Any idea if/how FFP regulations affect the worth of British players? I recall seeing somewhere that it benefits clubs to bring in British players in some way
Hey, I also have a Subaru Forester!  Mine's from 2001, although I only bought it in 2007.  It's been a decent car, but doesn't get great mileage (around 21 mpg) - luckily, I have a very short commute so I still only need to fill up about once a month.
It took them a year to catch it after he told them at least once a week via phone and e-mail and finance ended up taking away all of his pay for the next two months and then another six months for only half to be returned?  Because that's how I am used to finance errors like that ending.
All of those features like follow me etc are features of the pixhawk. So that thing can basically do everything the iris can.There are failsafes within the software to minimize risk of fly-aways. Geofence comes to mind. You also have control over what the copter will do in different failure scenarios, but it is up to you to set it up correctly.
nope. I'm saying that my BSc. in physics doesn't qualify me to judge the science, but a long history with people who believe all kinds of bullshit qualifies me to say that this story has all kinds of red flags.   It could still be true, but this is a perfect example of "extrordinary claims require extrordinary evidence."
It's the get told you are confused by everybody who will then refuse to date you or try to get you to deny your own sexuality because somehow they know better and want to define what is a very personal matter that they know nothing about of all worlds?
[Easier to get the guys in charge moving than to do something he has no idea about. Aside from telling everyone who knows each other in real life to take off the girls's VR gear. But his focusing on the GMs hit first.]
I have no 5* weapons other than one I crafted from two 4* Rune Axes. It's like slicking through butter at this point for me, too. I suspect though as content gets tougher, people like myself will hit a pay wall whereas people with the 5*s won't.
But you know, this is as valid a watch as anything. I'm rather sick of these high flying attitudes about watches - snooty "Ooo, well, this is a ROLEX, chap" bullshit. If you're stupid enough to spend that much to know the time... - yeah, I'm a bit pissed off at humanity right now. 
Yeh man was very happy with the amount of gems I used. No way near as much as I thought. Also I have loads of pirate penguins and sea stallions and have levelled up loads of units with the fodder and green turtles to boot!! Such a great event!!!

don't know about no parole, but i have no idea why women do not call the cops when some dude they just met sends them a pic of his junk. i'm dead serious, they should text back "joe smith, is that a pic of your d?" "yeah" "thanks for confessing, the police will be over shortly."
yea sure!  http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/26/us-usa-california-firebomb-idUSKBN0NH02320150426Not saying we're having riots though or that I'm against the national guard being there.
Why don't you look for yourself instead of acting like a child that needs to be spoon fed? You're obviously not ready to act 21+ bud, give it a few years though ok? 
The comment you just replied to was not even in response to Hibbity. So, you're correct, that wasn't talking about feelings. I don't even see any username similar to Ash.
That seems like a really easy way to get in trouble. I'm the kind of kid that would have opened and read the note as soon as I left the class, and then everyone would have known about it.
I'm with ya.  I don't like walking face first into a Stubborn Denial unless you have to.  You can afford to trade Anafenza.  If they slam out a monster like Stormbreath, Surrak, or Sarkhan, you can deal with it on your turn.  If they just slam out more smaller creatures, you can just keep building the board while trading, hoping to get some of your resilient guys online.  You really can't really afford to Abzan Charm for cards on an empty board, that just leaves you dead in 2 turns.  Raksha Deathdealer doesn't actually do anything on this board.  Fleecemane can trade, but has slightly more late game value than Anafenza unless you get a board established.
Oh yes I remember this in test client games. I ended a game with a silver edge on alch that showed as a blade of alacrity.I'm surprised it wasn't noticed by enough others to be fixed for main client.
Do you think though, that in some odd form of destiny the earth does enough rotations around the sun so it makes like a daisy petal pattern, thus encircling the sun at least once in the lifetime of the universe?  [8]
He sounds exactly like a physics professor I had. I heard him start to speak and I expected him to talk about Gauss's Law because their accent and speech patterns are so similar.
Thing is though, that reference is so easily misunderstood if you don't understand the context, which happens alot with social media, viewed in a vacuum the text or the emoji can be understood as many different things, most of them offensive in some capacity.
I was once present in a parent teacher conference between my mom and my 2nd grade teacher who told my mom that i was too stupid to do 2nd grade level work. She says this to my face as apparently i was to stupid to understand her.  In case you are wondering the work she was referring to was coloring which i have always hated.

Its just a super efficent ion drive and untill an ion drive becomes usable for mars transit it doesn't matter until he gets cheap access to orbit mastered. At which point if this is better then the more proven ion engines for interplanetary travel then they can use them. The plasma engine may get off the drawing board for the MCT by that time as well. Ether that or Musk just thinks EmDrive means Elon Musk drive which is a drive that propels itself by accelerating charged "elon musks" in the opposite direction. And he doesn't want to be used as fuel.
&gt; and a strong, nationalistic anti-Japan traditionwell yes that's what I'm saying.  Korea's virulent anti-Japan nationalism is at the heart of the problems between the two nations.  and this is not something Japan can change, it's a sickness that South Korea must address internally.&gt; it's own economic sphere and free access to SE Asia's sea lanes and resources. Germany got the same thing after the war, a EU with Germany as the leader.  Prosperity through democracy and free trade with military backing by America.The funny thing is that China is now going down the route of self-destruction that Germany and Japan followed by militarizing and containing itself against the rest of Asia and America.  
aha, I meant that if you say that someone calling race a factor sounds like they're calling it a direct factor instead of a correlative thing that has roots in hundreds of years of history, that you're legitimizing that sort of belief. I don't like shying away from explicitly and repeatedly saying that there ARE differences between races, but that they are caused by inequality rather than causing them, and that they aren't innate but they are forced upon them by systematic influences, and that it is just so horrible to judge people that way, and I shouldn't say that you were, but rather that it felt like you were allowing too much power to people who try to skew such statements in unreasonable ways.
The thing is when you go back that far people aren't really fighting "the concept of imperialism" they're fighting to keep foreign occupiers out. For all we know she would have jumped at the chance to be an imperial leader be subjugate other nations. Who wouldn't? 
Even if episiotomies are standard procedure at that hospital, the way he went about it was wrong.  Episiotomies are generally done when the perineum is stretched and the baby is crowning, not when the head isn't close at all and the skin is thick.  They're also usually not done in a dozen hacking cuts.  That doctor could not have possibly seen how big the baby's head was after being there for two minutes and didn't do this after making a judgment call.  The video was horrifying.
Yes but he's talking about it being more demeaning for a man to call the cops, my point is it is not. Also thanks lots of downvotes and it's always worse when no one even tells you why
So this week was p good.  The annual PT eval I had Tuesday went well, and yesterday we were allowed to wear jeans to show support for Sexual Assault Awareness month, and then today is Earth Day.  Tomorrow I'll hopefully go see the new Avengers movie with my friends, and then hopefully the internet is fixed for this weekend unlike last weekend to relax with some video games.  So how were all of your weeks, and do you have any plans for this weekend (like seeing the new avengers movie)? [:D](http://imgur.com/0CRFw14)
I was almost certain [this comment of mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/nrl/comments/33srmi/round_8_storm_vs_sea_eagles_discussion_thread/cqo3l7i) was going to make it. I've been trying to get my whole family in the Big Hits, I got dad in last week, my sisters photo of the TV at the SFS made it, I was hoping I could get Mum and Nanna too, then I'd only have the wife and kid to go.
"Evolution is just a theory" - they are obviously lacking in the scientific method and the definition of theory.Bitch,gravity is "just a theory" too, but I don't see you jumping off a building. 
Jack was the main antagonist for the first five acts of Homestuck. There was an entire intermission that Hussie admits existed entirely to flesh out Jack's character through Slick. The idea that he's not a main character is as ludicrous as the idea that Karkat isn't a main character.
As much as I love Breaking Bad I have to congratulate you on making Better call Saul a true master piece that stands on its own.  The little crumbs/easter eggs you drop for Breaking Bad fans are great, but the series really does shine all on its own.My question is, while Mike is kinda Saul's guy, he was also very much Gus Fring's guy.  Are we going to get to see Gus in Better Call Saul?
I did that from 997 to 1247. Leveled her up 10 levels every few ascensions, it worked fine.It took me a while (and a lot of souls in Solomon) to get over the fact that I was getting fewer HS per run though. I know souls per run don't matter, but that's still something that always made leveling Iris hard to me.
This isn't exactly the same, but it drives me up the wall when my boyfriend claims anything about computers is common sense. Maybe if you work in IT and have studied it, buy not for someone who only knows the extreme basics...
This is true. From what I understand, the best thing to look for is organic eggs. The different labels don't have much regulation. But the organic eggs are under USDA guidelines.
I'm still upset Konami pulled this OST off Amazon before I could buy it. I bought all the other Yamaoka SH scores except this one and then it disappeared.
Cheers mate, trading Heeney now is actually a really solid idea I hadn't considered, especially since Kraks will gain cash too. Didn't even consider that, fantastic idea.

The other day I was talking to a younger black man and he claimed that it's impossible for black people to be racist. His reasoning was that racism means one race feeling superior to another race, and because black people have it so bad they can't possibly see themselves as superior to another race. They could be prejudiced, just not racist. A couple other black people agreed with him. 
There is a huge difference between giving a shot to a person and to an animal.  First, humans have very small Subcutaneous space, as such the only injects that are given that way are generally insulin.  Give a person an injection between the skin and muscle with your average 25  or 22 gauge needle and you are asking to be punched in the face.  Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.  So no, injections sound the same, but can be different depending on the species.  RN's are excellent at poking people, but without instructions shouldn't be poking any other species.
This would have never happened if you freaks had a bullet to the brain like I wanted. Take your bloody apology and shove it up your human shitting ass. 
This isn't "oh my God!" terrible, but it still irks me, over a decade later.My husband and I had our first child when we were both twenty. Not teenage parents, but we were young, broke, students. My husband's best friend asked if he could stay the weekend with us, when our son was a little over a year old. Of course, we said sure. He ate almost all the food in the house, and drank an entire gallon of milk. And come on... he knew we were broke, and didn't offer to replace any it. I'm not one to begrudge a guest hospitality, but the amount of food he ate at our house was a couple weeks worth of grocery budget! It hurt!
If that offer from the Eagles is legitimate, I think it would actually be in the Titans' best interest to take it. A rebuilding team can use as much young talent as possible. 
You're correct. Also, exchanges spend a considerable amount of their budget doing what they can to ensure that those doing these types of illegal trading are held accountable. 
And make cops who support the politician super hard to get rid of, especially if they break laws. Again, there are sacrifices to both systems. However, punish the people who are setting policy, not the grunts. At the end of the day, the policy setters are the guilty party for not firing the guilty workers, and as I've mentioned, policy setters generally ARE political appointees. Not tryna say you're wrong, but the spoils system has already happened in the US. And we've turned away from it. Your idea is just not feasible in modern day america. 
Yeah, I love the day of festival after the EX Battle goes down.  I got a ton of materials from the Cactuar.Did you get the portal app working?  I have found it amazing for adamantite.  It is a little cumbersome to trade for serial codes, and then go back and forth between the apps, but that's how I have been upgrading my rank 4 items.
What's your take on Esper Mentor? That also seems highly appealing to me,  and gives a great base for moving in to any UWx Delver or most control decks as the meta shifts. 
The spacer that Thermo-Tech has http://ttwindows.com/why-thermo-tech/warm-edge-technology looks remarkably similar to what Polaris is using http://polariswindows.com/performance.htmlYou have recommended Polaris a bunch and I am possibly going with them (well a contractor who prefers them). Have they changed their spacer recently to a cheaper one or is this somehow different? 
Here's what happened guys:He got arrested gently by well trained heroes.  Then slammed his head into a bolt, breaking his neck of course.  He then fell to the floor handcuffed so he couldn't catch his fall.  He landed hard on his throat, crushing it.  Police did nothing wrong, and there's nothing to see here, move along.
I don't know *too* much about comp, but I think it has quite a good use in 6's as an off-class, seeing as there are 3 projectile-based classes on your average team. It would be good to have pyro punish overextenders or protect the combo from bombing.
From my experience, a lot of enemies that seem to take less damage than normal from physical attacks at that level are vulnerable to either Fire or Volt. The Soldier Bee in particular is vulnerable to Volt. Hopefully that knowledge will up your damage per turn.
That's not really the same as Britain at all. You do of course get people referring to art college etc when talking about a university course, but for the vast majority of people, college = 6th form. The distinction is about age, not vocational vs academic subjects.
There are other solutions to this problem. you can get a car, or a bike, or a gun, or take public transportation. or call a cab. But no you definitively right. Everyone should just waltz around without a care, and expect everyone to solve their problems for them.
Chris Hayes: "LOOK AT ALL THESE WHITE RIOTERS!"*shows video full of latinos*Still very interesting. It doesn't really bother me though. If white people rioting constantly and destroying shit was a legit problem across the country, I'd be asking the same questions.This hasn't changed anything.In fact, he's reinforcing the position of people like me who are critical of urban black culture.
I have been paying attention to this A LOT lately, as I am about to venture into buying on the West coast, in an area that is a designated flood zone. (on top of being in a Tsunami hazard zone) The overall opinion seems to be that the east coast and Florida/LA are the biggest risks to rising sea levels (we get Tsunamis, earthquakes) There is a lot of discussion on when the RE market will catch up to reality. Not yet, apparently, if Florida's recovery is any indication.But as has been pointed out, FEMA's new guidelines are BRUTAL in some areas, and can even restrict how much work is done on a property (50% of the appraised value) if the property is deemed in a flood zone. That aside, I read one news story of a commercial owner that saw a jump of insurance rates from $3500 a year to $50,000 (I think it was the Gulf coast).The only thing you can do is a lot of research and weigh the risk.
Good info. Lemon balm does wonders for me in the anxiety/anger department. Have never supplemented rosemary consistently enough to notice much but I do use the essential oil at night to keep my sinuses open. 
Oh absolutely, I agree with you. But they were being taxed in how they had only one source to buy tea from, which was taxed heavily when importing into the colonies. Basically, they either didn't buy tea or paid taxes without representation through it.
Thanks to this Friday being the first of May, and the first of May being a Staatsfeiertag (or "Tag der Arbeit" for you northern plebs), I am finally able to post. You see, other than some very strange people here I actually am feeling very *very* tired at 2AM. I usually go to sleep a lot earlier. You know what this means? I actually wake up early becuse of my education. But today/tomorrow, I can finally stay at my PC and post on the OreGaIru episode threads. Finally! I thought I never could, with the bastard fansubbers always releasing it when I sleep. Can you imagine that? Having read all the novels beforehand and then not being able to reap the karma. It worked so well with Akame, why not again? But enough about my karma, more about me! Do you know me? What is your opinion of me? Why do you think I have a flair and does it fit me? Anything. It's late and I am getting lonely. Post help.
Thank you very much!I had a lot of fun making it and ended up with over 100 different manipulated elements by the time I was done with it.The instruments/patches that Akira Yamaoka uses for some of the songs are just perfect. Especially in SH2. It gives way to some very soft and pleasantly creepy sounds.I have to admit SH1 didn't quite groove with me as well as the later soundtracks. Luckily it's been over ten years and it's all prety easily accessible.
It cant, I think these NZ analysts are projecting their own preference of "domestic club participation = national team eligibility", but clearly 1 pro team wont suffice in Argentina...a majority sure, but they will still need their overseas players
That is a huge difference, 200k rape or sexual assault victims in 2005 (assuming women are half the population of 295m) is thats .1%but the womens survey says that 16.6% or 24,485,000 women.Those are massively different numbers. That means unreported rapes would have to be 160 times reported rapes
Probably not real. Looks like a modern design, and most modern pistols use an aluminum or polymer frame, neither of which would rust. The slide however, which would be made of steel, would be rusted. I'd guess from just this one pic that it's a pot metal replica of a gun. 
What basically happened is that they started out against it, but then they turned to thinking about all the people screaming about it and how much they really don't like the people who screamed about it, so they ended up doing a 180 because they're against the people who screamed.  Kinda sad, to be honest.  And I'm someone who largely agrees with TB's initial impression: I like the idea of good mods getting paid for it, but there are just too many issues for it to be practical, from curation to updates breaking mods to fraud (and how do you prove ownership?) and just goes on.  I wasn't one of those people screaming murder over it, but I am also very much against it because of those issues.  I actually think that I am likely in the majority on that, but I cannot prove it.

I'm not the previous commenter, but I'll give it a shot.  Presumably, these ancient Jewish judicial codes (if they had any validity) were ordered by God.  I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?As for "Hate the sin. Love the sinner", it's like saying "I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity."  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.  Even if hatred of gays wasn't the intent, these statements still encourage it.
What research? I've had Prime before, I know how it works. I'd also like to believe that Reddit isn't strictly for teenagers who like to share memes and this novel took me more time to format correctly than it did to type.
Leviticus also forbids haircuts, shaving, eating or even *touching* most kinds of animals, and selling land. And yet I hardly ever hear about Leviticus from bearded long-hair vegetarians...
Check bikepedia. Go by the color schemeFrankly though its a very low end hybrid model that was made from 93 to 07 and retailed for about $300. Its not old enough to be vintage or nice enough to be worth anything.
No, I get it completely. I just think it's insidious that this is aimed at men, and basically calls any man who isn't self-sacrificing a bad man. My point is, I can be a good man, a good person, independently of how much I sacrifice for others.My value shouldn't be tied to how much I put others above myself.
65% of eligible voters stay at home because the last half-century has proven - time and again - that it doesn't matter who is in office.Why the hell should anyone vote when the end result is the same.
It's a good clone, and I love that it's stainless steel.If the Aeolus was a bit shorter (without the heat sink fins), and the AFC system a bit wider to allow for more adjustability, it'd be PERFECT. Just tried it out and I'm really enjoying it!The one I bought was from ebay but it's mostly the same as the 88vapes one I'd say, just marginally more expensive.
I guess at what point do I no longer have a choice.For instance right now, I can choose to follow the states law, or not. Not following the law was alot easier for me when I didnt have children and had more to lose. So its either follow the law or lose everything, putting me between a rock and a hard place. We could extrapolate that to something like, I follow your rules because you have all the food, or I starve to death.
Working on adding support for mods for ***half a decade*** seems a bit much. At this point, it kinda feels like they're just like "I swear guys, we are working on it", and then they turn  around and laugh at how we believe them.
We're not admissions counselors. There's a whole staff of them in the admissions office, talk to them, they will have much better insight on your chances than a bunch of magic internet people with anecdotal evidence.
In addition to the solution to the mooring issue, imagine how dockable supers would completely change how intel is generated. We currently have massive contact lists and spreadsheets making it a trivial matter of knowing when enemy supers have logged in. Endings space coffins by allowing docking would up the challenge for hunters and actually require active intel (versus watchlist intel)
It was a tactic shitty salespeople do to try to get more money out of naive people. But once he showed up with (basically) a lawyer in his pocket they had to suck it up and make him happy because otherwise they would have been in deep shit with the law.
Well considering he wasn't built up, he basically had to go down like a bitch to fit in a two hour movie.  So they just popped his eyes out.  Take what he did with a grain of salt, standard movie villain shit.
Yes. Great point. This certainly goes for those not yet on a PS4. I always, always add the PS3 and Vita games, even though I no longer own either one. BUT, the time may come where i may again be faced with them in my hands. It hurts nothing or no one to just add them to your library.
No, but I've seen direct footage of gameplay, and most of the characters have their views obscenely obscured by massive weapons (See, Reaper's shotguns covering almost two thirds of his view), which coupled with tiny FoV (given away by the huge, up close hands) will greatly diminish the enjoyment me or my friends can get out of Overwatch. Which sucks, because I was looking forward to it.
as far as rappers spitting bars he was never the best but for the rolling and smoking chill vibes MOTM was really a goat level album, the ONLY song I didn't like on it was Make Her Say and a bunch of people I know thought i was weird cause they loved the song.

When I was an awkward 15 year old I invested way too much of myself into a "relationship" with a catfish. My stupid ass didn't want to believe my friends who recognized one of her pictures as a porn star, or look any further into why no two pictures looked the same...I was just so willing to believe I had landed some kind of jackpot beauty queen who was actually into me that I ignored all the red flags, then later learned that she was actually a girl, but just 11 years old when we started talking. That's right, I got catfished by a child.Oh the joys of growing up in the age of the internet.
Buying within a couple weeks of a new product launch is usually not a bad idea. Either you can get the new hotness, or you can get the old hotness at a discount. 
well some people don't mesh.I have hung out with people before and we just didn't seem to be speaking on the same terms and always was misinterpreting each other.perhaps I experience this more than most with people.No I do not WANT or PREFER her to be a sex worker.But I would not disown her for choosing that if thats what she truly wanted of her own free will.  
To be honest with you I haven't noticed any increase in price, I just bought a decent one about two months ago with a disc diffused perc for $70 out the door. Check out dhgate.com they sell all kinds of bongs for cheap, of course their not name brand or anything but it doesn't sound like that's what your after. Shipping can take a while as well but it's worth the price 
&gt;I suspect that the counter argument is that monogamous marriage limits that possibility since it lowers the number of people with the influence to force such a marriage. I was thinking specifically of arranged marriages, (although to be fair I didn't specify) so I'm not sure that holds up.  The coercion doesn't have to come from someone actually involved in the marriage&gt;Another argument would be that polygamy is much harder to untangle if and when it does go bad.I don't buy that either, but I can see why others might - you can say that it makes for somewhat more complicated divorce proceedings, but I think that the threat of complicated divorce proceedings aren't high on an abuser's list of potential threats.  Loss of economic support, loss of access to children, loss of social status - all of these are equally possible in monogamous and polygamous marriages.
Is it bad that this is really the first year that I am really interested in the draft (normally I pay attention, but I figure they are gonna draft who they are gonna draft regardless), only because I am morbidly curious to see whether it's a normal draft, or they trade Rivers and this whole train goes leaping off the rails?Secondarily I'm interested to see if the Eagles get involved in any shenanigans.
i played for over a year before realizing u can change squad mid-play rather than just on spawn after death.  i actually used to suicide to join a squad in a more strategic position!  now as well as joining a squad who are in a good position,  I can get behind enemy, let a teammate spawn, then change squad and let another squad spawn (maybe changing back to my main squad then) - you can really swing a game by using squad-changes strategically and smartly!
My mom does that too, ugh, I'm so tired of hearing how lazy I am and what a bad mother I am. She is desperate to feel needed so of course that is why she says and does this stuff. These next 2 weeks can't go by fast enough.

I thought I uploaded it as an album.

We just like to be excited and vocal about stuff that we like, like all fandoms (e.g. sports, Western pop, Harry Potter, GoT). Life's too short to not enjoy the little things. Sometime it's nice to just emmerse yourself in naive joy and let that feeling take over. Are we literally "ded" and "not breathing"? Obviously not but that doesn't make that feeling of unapologetic joy in that one second you actually experience the feeling any less genuine. In a world that tells us to be cynical and ironic about everything, I find this momentary escape in music (but really all fandoms work like that) and unapologetic outlet of emotions incredibly refreshing.
Hi everyone, I just made a subreddit called /r/AnimeDisplay where you can post your anime collection. I didn’t see any active ones that did the same thing so I decided to make it myself. If you’re interested feel free to post yours there. Remember that all collections are beautiful, no matter how small. ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
I'm not sure if you heard Thoorin talk then(he talks alot and deviates soo...). Not specifically about Dignitas, but how he often times has power rankings, and actual team ranking. Listening to his spiel, even if he did care about relegation matches, he would maybe give you the benefit and say Kiwi had a huge power rating after his relegation performances, but him and his overall team historically are quite in the gutter still.What would matter to Thoorin is if his short term power ranking boost continued into the next split, and helped his team improve their standings. Until then it's all about "what if's" or special matches that don't even account for at least 1/2 of that player's total game contribution.

I don't see how they can really limit it when only one orb can destroy a whole planet with a single touch, As we have seen in Guardians of the Galaxy. All six together at that point just seems like overkill. All he would have to do is even just land anywhere on earth and we'd be fucked.
I actually think everyone *knows* that what TRP advocates is true.  But TRP just openly fucking admits it, everyone else, at least publically, likes living in a SJW dreamworld where unicorns, faeries, and hobbits exist.  
As a social media person, "pushing the envelope" is fine, but crossing the envelope is not. If, **as an official extension/liaison of a brand**, you post something that violates the standard of social decorum for a business, and that makes the business look bad, you will not have a job at the end of the day.You can post whatever you want on your own time and on your own twitter feed. Nobody is stopping you from doing this. Be offensive if you want. But as brand representative or voice, (if you expect to remain employed) you follow the rules and project a positive image at all times. 
No. Inflation already happened, and minimum wage has not been increased to keep up. Every year, people are being paid less. Raising the minimum wage would be correcting for the inflation that happened, and could not cause it.Since inflation is not necessarily a bad thing, not raising the minimum wage in an attempt to not increase inflation will just cause harm, and no good could come of it.
I was there when a huge crowd was waiting for a mish to get off of the plane. He was the last one off. Some dude walks off of the plane and asks the mish's girlfriend if she is waiting on a missionary from the orient. She smiles big and says yes. He tells her that he is in the back of the plane making out with a stewardess. I burst out laughing when the girl started crying.
This is the first day in a while I've felt healthy, stable and really joyful. I say that because this last week I wrapped up a major fundraiser for my organization (record donations!) and final project for a graduate course on the same day.... Great right? By Sunday I was vomiting into a bucket doubled over with a 48 hour stomach flu. It is only now today that I was able to get out and get a cup of coffee and a sandwich, get a book on order and I feel freaking fantastic! Thanks for asking.

I had just met this guy and started talking to him to make small conversation. It went like this.Me: hey so what are you majoring in school?Him: I'm in philosophy, I really enjoy it because of how new the subject is.Me: Umm isn't it really old? What about Socrates?Him: Well except for him, its all 20th century really. I also love it for its alignment with science, science and philosophy go together so well.At that point I didn't want to start arguing with this guy I just met so I changed the subject. But I couldn't believe someone with that knowledge about philosophy was majoring in philosophy
Parental guilt is the thing that makes you do everything you can to make sure they're one of the "most". Your biggest fear is that you do something and they turn out to not be okay.
That's probably a good guess. I think that she genuinely cannot see it and cannot help it, at this point. They need therapy for her to get outside perspective on how self-destructive all of this is. 
Sadly it suffers from the T32 disease, in a Tier less than 5, but the RP of a Tier 5. It makes no sense to me, I was shocked when I saw the AD-2 at 220k
I know this guy who has mean, hard facial features but he is a social rockstar. He can start a conversation with anyone, anywhere. His trick is being really bubbly and silly. He has no ego at all to the point of self deprecation. Always acting like a ham. Center of attention.  He is a very real, honest, nice guy but can also be catty like a girl some times. Total lady killer. Has the most beautiful girlfriends i have ever seen. Also makes a good wingman. I meet people every time we go out. That being said, he is the only person like this that i have ever met. You cannot be him. I don't think you have it in you.
I'm actually pretty sure the internet in general did that. A lot of sex-positive feminists were unhappy, and that's not a group with a lot of GG overlap.&gt;  only GG points to it as an example of What's Wrong With Game Reviews, as opposed to a review that they disagreed with. Fair
I dunno.  I don't think anything they said actually addressed the concerns of the people who are against it.  It was just "well, it would be nice to make money!".That's not really...in depth.
You're not entirely wrong. In California you can drive from San Francisco to L.A. on either Highway 101 or Interstate 5. Technically you stay on the same road the entire time. Driving would take you 6-7 hours while a flight would be a bit over an hour.

He got pinned between the rail of the basket, from where he was operating the machine, and a low steel girder overhang in the ceiling, said Des Peres Police Lt. Ernie Brockman. Brockman said this was the usual parking place for the lift.

So don't ever expect anything and just request to hang out. Be able to receive a no without losing composure. From then, on you can hopefully find your way.
It doesn't work that way though, parents will complain and raise hell to the principal, and they'll *make* you change it.  It's not in the teachers favor at all anymore. It's in the students.
Also, a whole lot of the images circulated as Krokodil-gone-wrong evidence had nothing to do with Krokodil. Some of them were diabetic or had other ailments from one thing or another. It's a nasty fucking drug, but if it just ate away peoples' skin all willy nilly then no one would ever do it a second time. Unfortunately this sort of urban legend stuff happens all the time and is somewhat dangerous. People say, "Krokodil is a flesh eating bacteria that will put holes in you!" then they find out that nah, it ain't nearly that bad so everything else they say about it is probably bullshit. Then they end up with holes in their body, albeit not nearly at the scale as those pictures, because it's still a nasty drug. 
An example of a felony i like to use is supplying alcohol to minors. If you have ever in your adult life handed a beer to someone under 21, let your kid take a sip of your beer, let your little brother come to your house party, etc... you've committed a felony (in my state). It isn't just drugs and violence that can make you a felon.
Come with me to NG land, where I work 68 hours a week plus a 1h30min per way commute in my civilian construction job and then when we magically have a weekend I have to go to drill and scrub a cannon I almost never fire while half my active duty friends have a normal weekend almost every week.Granted, I did choose this lifestyle so my bitching is rather masturbatory, as is yours. Felt good. Thanks.
I like that reasoning. It's really similar to something I originally planned for him - meaning to get the basis of a great machine and just work your way towards that. Makes a lot more sense to me but he just wants to game and for the least amount of money as possible.
I never claimed that the Democrats intend to overturn Roe v Wade. They wrap themselves in Roe v Wade while seeking to go much further. I think I'm being pretty reasonable here. Planned Parenthood is an extreme organization led by someone who is in favor of elective late term abortion, and its founder Margaret Sanger was even more extreme. Abortion's simply not going away as an issue. Not in either of our lifetimes. Gay marriage can mostly go away, if both sides can respect each other's right to disagree. Even that will never fully go away as an issue.

My hate has nothing to do with routine being thrown off, it's that NO part can be automated until 'blend'. On hot drinkd (or iced lattes) you can be prepping milk or syrups for the next beverages while shots are pulling and milk is steaming. This = cranking out drinks.Fraps require every step manually and cannot be prepped the same way; the most we can do w/2 blenders is try to batch blend (against the rules) or line up cups with the frap roast and/or milk in it and wait an age for a clean pitcher to open up.It's a ridiculous amount of stuff to do for one milkshake-y drink that's 70% ice.

You are taking about two different issues here.1) there should have been damage to reputation of banks. In my opinion there was to an extent, although most of it was mitigated as being "banks were being greedy". This is a different situation, as the investment bank is making public its position on a huge investment issue. If they, with all of their educated employees , get it wrong, then they aren't worth much as an investment Bank are they? A loud public declaration like this is betting that they will be right, and will be able to claim kudos in the investment world for predicting the trend.  2) of course people are still investing in stocks you mutton chop. 2008 didn't change a thing about stocks being one of the best returning asset classes. 
Yeah, I saw that after I left the comment, but my phone crapped out on me and wouldn't let me edit. Still, it's doubtful the B1G would take you guys (sadly).

Hmmm well he doesn't seem all that bright anyway. Waiting 10 minutes, even if he was *sure* they were empty threats, is just plain negligent. It's truly horrifying to know someone like that is in charge of all those people, criminals or not. Especially as, from what you've said, they seem to have carte blanche to run the place however the hell they want. Was Bob's crime particularly abhorrent? I'm just wondering if that was the reason for his poor treatment. Was there no CCTV footage to support your telling of what happened? Are you bound by some sort of contract that prevents you from speaking out, like to the press for example? 
Sure nothing wrong with believing. Keep going and hopefully you won't get these monsters again. It's just kind of annoying to see threads like this every other day. People think they've found something out when they didn't and immediatly make a post. Same thing with the ydcb praying thing at the moment or around christmas with the Ellia summoning. So annoying to have the front page plastered with posts like "Oh my god the prayer works, look at my nat 5*. Anyway no problem dude, nice talking.
If your tickets are Club level (200s) there is a TON of museum type stuff on the concourse behind home plate.  If you're in a suite, you can usually get in, though a few of the ushers are incredibly strict about "not 200, get out."
Idk. I have memories back to 1995.   I can understand how you feel, that a 90s kid would be born 1985+ or something like that. But I remember the late 90s so I consider myself a 90s kid. And nothing you say will ever change mind. Cheers :)

I don't like this idea, too much pressure of 'must log in every day', it becomes a chore and a hassle. Letting quests stack up and doing them when I feel like it feels a lot better. It also incentivizes people to actually play, rather than just log in, get rewarded, and quit.Not a fan of the whole 'daily login' idea, it feels like a lame skinner Box technique and doesn't ensure the game is actually played which should be the goal.
This trip floats a brief stretch of Brushkana river. You can put in directly on the highway, or hike up the creek for a few miles for more splashy fun. There are lots of exposed rocks and rapids here, but none more technical than class II+. Very low consequences. Once the Brushkana hits Monahan Creek the pace drops very quickly, although it picks up a bit once Monahan Creek joins the Nenana. Approximately 1.5 miles after joining the Nenana there is a 4-wheel trail on river left that leads back to the Denali Highway (1.75 miles). Or you can continue along the Nenana to where it rejoins the highway (~7-8 river miles).
Then why not share the link in the post you just made? I can accuse you of being just as lazy - lazier, actually, considering it's common sense and your informal obligation to share a link under these circumstances in the first place.But that's fine, I'll trust some random dude on Reddit who can barely write in complete sentences, citing a (possibly non-existent) source on YouTube instead of the CDC.

I have a pretty noticeable scar just to the left of my sternum. I was a little drunk and I tried to hop a fence to get into the pool for my apartment complex. I forgot the key in my apartment. There was a piece of metal that jutted out from the fence and I scraped my chest on it. I put on some butterfly bandages and I figured that I'd just go into the ER the next day to get it stitched up. I went in and they told me that the wound had already healed too much for them to be able to give me stitches.[NSFW chest wound](http://imgur.com/S9yYudh)[Scar](http://imgur.com/byA0U70)

Nah you misunderstand me. I don't feel superior. I just don't give a shit. I don't tip 20% because I don't feel like I should. I don't give much thought to it. Clearly some of you guys take tipping seriously and care about it a lot. I just don't. I'm not trying to insult your country. I just don't give a fuck about tips. Sorry. 
This thought is the one thing that's keeping me going so thanks for the reminder. &lt;3 I've been so terribly nervous over the whole ordeal that I have to sit there and think "You know, maybe I'm actually pretty likable and people care about me and I'm just my own worst enemy."
Holy shit you people. It's not hacking, it's a fucking mod. People join a server that is hosting the rape mod, then they fucking bitch that they got raped. If you had taken to take 5 seconds to learn about what was going on by googling "GTA 5 rape", you might have a clue of what is happening here.You can filter out modded servers using the filter.
And you're still only one guy, so after a point more countertops doesn't speed things up anymore. At that point, either you can get faster, or you can get more people to work on it at the same time. But if it's a job that those people can't coordinate on efficiently, that won't help.The analogy holds!
It sounds like they are trying to steal as much money from people who really want the chromas before opening them up as a mastery bonus and refunding the RP people already spent as credit. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth that they would test something that Heroes of the Storm offers for free, just to see how much they can steal from their fan base. 
That title is absurd. All the findings (apparently) say is that it MIGHT be LESS EFFECTIVE. Nowhere does it say that going to the gym will have the REVERSE effect. What utterly irresponsible "journalism."
&gt; It isn't right to address the evil of rape by killing an innocent person.Nor is it right to address the evil of rape by forcing a woman to jeopardize her life, health and sanity to breed the offspring of her rapist.
I'm not sure someone who's poor would realistically invest in a business. They have a lot more to lose and little experience in investment compared to someone who has more means to make the investment.A good majority of your argument from what I found is that if a hierarchy becomes abusive THEN it should be abolished. History has determined any hierarchies eventually become corrupt. Ancoms argue all hirearchies should be abolished before they take place. Instead of working *for* someone, we should work *with* someone. Mutual Aid has improved conditions for people without the use of capital.

I liked last year in the FIBA World Cup, when the US was getting ready to play Slovenia.  A European reporter asked DeMarcus Cousins if he could even find Slovenia on a map, and Cousins goes, "Can you find Alabama on ours?"
no. also check out [crashz' Viewmodel Generator map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365126929) to see what more you can change about your viewmodel and find what you like.
Remember that it takes them 5.5 years until they make that pay, too. Starting pay is a lot less, and they're responsible for purchasing their own guns and uniforms. The overtime is there, but it's not like if you want to make $100k a year it'll just be handed to you - it's a lot of time spent at work and away from home.
It was originally Undertaker on the poster, he got injured and Edge cashed in MITB to take the title off him. When they swapped Edge for Taker on the poster, they left Taker's gloves/hands with the belt.
This is one time I'd absolutely do a clean install. I said this a week or two ago in another thread, but a lot of other shit on your PC depends on the motherboard: your USB drivers, SATA controller(s), chipset, etc. I'd reinstall Windows; that's a lot of drivers and shit for Windows to recognize and change at once.
"Well, fuck i thought it would work out with the bears but if they really want to trade me for a 6th to the jets ill just win a super bowl with them". 
I'm pretty sure many of them are exaggerating.Some people are also really sensitive. I've yet to actually cry over a group, but I've probably commented that I did. Sometimes it's just trying to convey the adrenaline and excitement. I do squeal sometimes though...
Yes it is. Religion, backwardness and the oppression of women are adaptive. Guatemala has a higher birth date than Sweden. Women don't choose guys who do the dishes. 
Spoiler: even if the Titans are ready to take an offer, they're going to keep asking for more until the last second, because... maybe they'll get more.
The titanic would be about a ship emerging from the depths to save stranded people and eventually everyone calms down and parties and then goes back to port
I regretted buying that 5lb box of fruit tootsie rolls for my birthday, doesn't mean I'm going to go back and tell amazon they need to give me my money back after I've eaten the whole box.
&gt; I think you have grossly misunderstood what a medical journal is.Medical journals are not scientific publications. They are only slightly more than a news source.
Ha.  That's Claudine Lafond and her husband Honsa.  They live in Sydney, Australia (like me) and I know them a bit.  They are two of the most lovely people you are likely ever to meet.Having said that, instagram yoga is a pet peeve for me.  Just goes to show that lovely people can do things that you disagree with.
&gt;Today the collision center called my adjuster and said I was being charged $125/day and I was already up to $2790.What did your adjuster say? You're paying your insurance company let them deal with it.
According to the book, which did many interviews with players and staff on the team, he was very difficult to work with and quite the grump in the locker room. The media certainly hated him too, going so far to boycott coverage of a book he released. That has nothing to do with his hight IQ, both on and off the court (which I agree with).
Actually the whole charge is pretty suss. In NSW, the waiting time is regulated to "94.4c per minute ($56.68 per hour) while vehicle speed is less than 26 km/h."So even 9 hours waiting ($510.12) is more than half the total charge. That's AUD. 
My friend started streaming and her mother was one of her first followers- two months later she has an average of 50-100 viewers a night. You can do it, it's just the beginning! 
If you turn on your tap and get nice tasting water, you oughtn't to buy similar tasting water at the store.But taste was the distinction that another user made, and you dismissed as selfish.Taste is the only substantial thing differentiating Coke from shitty tasting tap water, too. It's not nutritious. People buy it for the taste.
Thank you for your concern but I've already hung out a lot with Lucy. I maintain above a 3.5 gpa and as long as i keep good grades and motivated to complete my goals in life I don't see much of a problem. Also I thanks to Lucy i no longer feel depressed with my life and the world, which is something I appreciate deeply, I simply was wondering what would be fun do with my friend this summer, or maybe some things people in this sub have done with their friends that have been spectacular, I didn't expect to be told not to do it. Also I am literally a few months away from 18, so i guess in a few months it'll be okay? That doesn't seem to make much sense to me, but to each his own.

Tennessee always needs more boobs, whether they heat or not.  I wish you a safe four days until you are home!   How about a cool boss/coworker that could spot you money, or get you out of the cold?
Do you have a good friend that can come over to keep the mood light and help you with this project? Otherwise, you could always turbo scan it all to get the physical copies gone and then cull through the digital stuff at a later point in time when you aren't as emotionally invested. Just some thoughts.
I bought a pathfinder a decade ago.   I went to the 3 main dealers in my area.  they all said they weren't making any money off them.. could only take $500 or so off price.   Went out in the country a couple hours away.  Told the dealer that I wouldn't be back but if he wanted to make $1000 for an hours work I would pay him $1000 more than invoice minus incentives.  He sold me the truck for $5000 less than the other dealers.  3 of my coworkers later bought vehicles off of him.  He said he wouldn't sell it to a local for that price because then others would hear and expect the same deal.
Something I haven't seen anyone mention?  Blood Moon decks.  They'll turn your Tron lands into Mountains, but unlike most Tron deck threats, having 5 "Mountains" is pretty reasonable (especially since a lot of decks get slowed down by their own Blood Moon).  Having a threat that can still win the game or help you find your answers through a Blood Moon isn't a small thing.
http://justairsoftammo.com carries a few well known brands and is just beginning to start up. I placed an order with them and was very pleased with the shipment and delivery time (also shipping is free :D)Killer awesome for me because on top of free shipping, they beat the major stores' prices on my $50 order by about $5.
Plat is the top 10% of players, so if you perform worse than a plat, don't feel bad.Everyone has had your issues, and everyone who farms better than you has improved said issues. The improvement will come with time.
depends on play, and area. We have several areas with 30% ROR @ $55. Obviously our portfolio is reduced greatly, but we're currently in the process of wringing the service companies to death to cut costs by a few million per well.The mania will pass, but the industry will become very profitable at levels not imaginable a few years ago as the pace slows and the vast amounts of science done over the last 8 years can be evaluated.Count on it.
As far as you are aware..and you  aren't. For a while I was reselling items purchased at Targets (I had to go to several). I spent a bunch of money at target.
I think both of them danced around the real issue at hand. Nobody with a gunshot wound to the chest is gonna get denied treatment at any hospital in America. Every single person has *access* to healthcare. The issue here is the cost of that healthcare (both why it's so much and who is burdened with it). Even a moderately well off middle to upper middle class family can be financially ruined in very short order simply by the breadwinner getting cancer. Or maybe they have a heart defect and need a transplant. Or maybe their in a car accident and need extensive surgeries, physical therapy, and long term care. That's what's wrong with our system. 
One benefit to living on an island is we can select the members of our community. It'd be interesting to see if this is preferable to meeting similar people in cities based on special interests.

I wouldn't say throughout my life, but in the past 10 years I've had the same kind of dream at least once a month.I skipped class a lot in college, so this dream is of me back in high school, but having missed half the year. I don't know where I'm supposed to be, nor do I know how to get into my locker anymore. It's such a damn creepy dream and I hate having it since it is about one of my biggest regrets in life.
Garnet's Universe should *not* be treated as canon. It was specifically just a fantasy of Steven's.Attack the Light is debatably canon. According to /u/Joseph_Stalin_ the game was specifically written so as to not conflict with the show in any manner.
Wow, I never thought of that. In past, I have slept in my car once in a parking lot when I had a little too much. No doubt the key was in because I preferred music and phone getting charged. Engine was off though.Anyway, I got my lesson, and will probably never be in that kind of situation again.
Because they get a tax break for training new employees. They want people to quit, so they can hire new ones and get more tax breaks. The government wants employers to train people. It doesn't take much training to work at McDonald's, though, (and not much of it transfers to other jobs) so they are easily replaced.
That link is purple for me - I learned about this lady a while ago - my ex's roommate named her cat Boudica. However, unlike her namesake, the cat is lazy, affectionate, and is obsessed with this one particular box. As a joke, I ended up calling her Buddha half the time.
One of my colleagues has his Bachelors and absolutely refuses to believe you can get educated outside a brick and mortar school establishment. I'm an astronomy hobbyist, and to him everything I know about it is wrong because my degree isn't in astronomy.  Needless to say I was happy when our shifts changed. 
It's really just PPV, ticket sales and sponsorships or a projection of those. When a fight is this big, everyone wants in and they are charging $99 which is the highest amount for a Sports PPV ever.When you have an event like that, sponsors want in more and ticket buyers will pay top dollar to get into the building. Tickets were insanely high.

Is it really? She should have been finishing her childhood and finding out who she is, what she can be passionate about, what she'll do with her life. What kind of person she might want to spend it with. If she didn't want to abort it, fine, but adoption would have been more than understandable. She cut a lot of her options and growing room off at the knees.
It seems to be a hit-or-miss blend for most people, as far as reviews I've seen go. I'll have to try it in a cob and see if the narrower bowl treats it well. I think my biggest problem is that short of Dunhill blends I'm having issues keeping latakia lit, regardless of drying time. Is there a secret to this blend that seems to work for you?
Ive been a part of about 40 farm-wars now, and only twice did my clan not get what they wanted. One was a japanese clan who we had no way of communicating with, and the other was a clan from Spain who agreed to the deal, but switched back at the last minute.Still 38/40 is a 95% success rate. I've never understood Jr's issues with getting compliance, as I've never had an issue with it. Even in Jr2, I am the one who created the clan, so I was there for the first war, and our enemy was more than happy to comply. But seems it's has really gone downhill since I left. Of course, I cannot speak for all the clans, just for my own personal experience from being in 2.0, 2.5, the one war in Jr2, leading farm wars in my old clan "Templar Knights", and succesfully helping 2.4 and 2.6 get compliance from Korean clans.

It's specifically how often you are sitting up in the sky playing Clouds Simulator 2015 that kills it for me. If I accept an invite, and find out the heist is full, I am typically forced to find a new lobby and spend the next 30-60 seconds staring into the abyss. Why? Why can't I just jump back into the lobby I was originally in?The only solution to playing this game with *any* form of expediency is to only play in invite-only sessions. If you want to do heists with your friends, just invite them to the session and when each mission is finished you just jump back together almost instantly. But to be quite honest, this is how the online should be from the start, not just for solo/invite only sessions.
When I was student teaching, the cooperating (regular) teacher and I would joke that one 6th grade boy probably had dead bodies hidden in his basement. And that he would be the type to carry severed fingers around in his pockets. I'm not sorry.

Yay, my first appearance in Friday Free Talk thread! Just wanted to say that I will be absent during this weekend (there are big holidays in Russia) and won't be able to post [WT!] compilation on Sunday as usual; but I'll do that on Monday for sure.Also, new Path of Exile is freaking awesome. That's the main reason why I'm still awake.Have fun during the holidays!
Oh wow. Thank you so much. As you say, most true crime novels I've read (can't put down a book once I start) have been poorly written or poorly edited. So having someone else's opinion is great. I've never read In Cold Blood but I'm definitely going to, now. I've been listening to a podcast called Criminal which isn't specifically about murder but crimes and crime related topics. I really like the editing of it. I've listed to most of TAL and Radiolab so I needed something new. Again, thank you!
Nay, you must choose to not press. However, by making this decision, you are not excluding yourself from the ability to press. That is one of the many beauties of being a non-presser. You can choose one of two mutually exclusive options without actually excluding the other. Stay Pure.
This is also a good explanation for abusive relationships, people do come to believe that they deserve nothing more. And accept their Fate because they no longer see it as a fight worth fighting.
We ended up doing winner takes all Wheel of Goon. Had every one lying on the ground, surrounding the bag with their mouth open. "Host" would jump over them onto the bag.Managed to get to round 3 before it all ended badly and the host tripped....
That's kinda how I feel about it, too. And I know the bit you're talking about!  Wow. I didn't know Wilmore stole it. I usually flip over to Jimmy Fallon until @ Midnight comes on. 
Oh, shit, yeah. Doc, I'm gunna have to post-pone my next visit(OOC: Woo hopefully I'm not springing this one you/if I am that it's okay ehehe sorry) I'm, uh...on a little vacation with Princess. So, the next two days worth of visits are gunna have to wait...shoulda' told you this sooner, but the whole idea of a trip was kinda sprung on me, y'know? Anywho, hope it's okay.
She's very much out of her element since she's very close to powerless at this point. The powerful men she had direct control over are dead, and she's realized she didn't have enough control over Tommen and now has essentially none. She's grasping for what control she can, but she's not a deep enough thinker to have a perfect plan immediately. So she's reeling and very much off-kilter. But people are nuts if they think she won't come back and clean house. Writing her off as a non-threat gives her the time to become a threat. 
Ballsy but deeply unstable as a Government and they'd be unable to get anything done. Minority Governments need to offer concessions for votes. The idea that the SNP will suffer if they take down Labour assumes Labour are popular in Scotland. 22% projected vote share is not popularity. Labour will get by until a point but every vote will be on a knife edge. They'll lose a lot and only a small number are confidence and even then it would take a back bench rebellion to sink them. Maybe they'll start doing positive popular things but I won't be holding my breath. Labour's arrogance is breathtaking.
This is the kind of insightful comment I was looking for. I was totally thinking about Ian Connor. Like I hate to admit it, but he just looks cool with a ciggie. 
Bro, everyone on social media, anti and pro Israel people, are accusing you of lying about your law school. YOU seem to have trouble grasping the concept that your a Cooley student. Not cool-ey, not Michigan Law, just Cooley. 
Yeah, but you knew you were hurt and from the sounds of it, you were biking alone. If you had been with people the topic of your f'd up shoulder would've came up basically right away. The video is basically 3 and a half minutes where she could've easily had that realization that she was hurt but it never happened. 3:30 is a long time after you've been hurt.
No mention of any payment, the words "Fuck you, pay me" come to mind. If this is just a hobbyist gig clearly state so, however since you want to monetize you should at LEAST offer revenue sharing. Good luck.

I'm not Catholic, yet I will not follow the ancestor worshipping rites. Respecting them is OK, but making offerings is not cool in my book.Theological decisions should generally be made on correctness, not political expediency. 
Would he ask for an increase? Only playing 13 games, being 34 after a successful career and being settled means he possibly saw staying on at victory better than getting a move for some extra cash.On wages in general we did just lose Leijer who I doubt was on low wages and Coe originally signed a 3 year deal so we have probably been overpaying him (will need a replacement so probably spending the same or more at GK). If we have conceded to losing Georgievski our defender wages will be down from this season and if Muscat is prepared to give more responsibility to Murnane we will be saving money on our fullbacks.
Are you setting it? NARS Radiant Creamy is well, *very* creamy lol so it needs either ample time to set or a setting powder to speed it up.I recommend a BB to apply it, or a fluffy concealer brush.I know so many people love it but this is why I never recommend it for under the eyes lol.
Agreed, I kinda mocked it, didn't even watch it until days after original air time and, I hate to say, but I cried like a baby multiple times.in the past 5-10 years I went from being a rather closed-minded person who felt gay was a sexual addiction and transexuality was just odd and wrong, but, when you SEE the reality...talk to these people.  For fuck's sake, how can one NOT empathize?!I mean, honest to God, I think the interview was SO much better than ANYONE expected and those who, like myself initially, passed on watching it, please, PLEASE CHRIST go watch it...

Pretty much anyone can look like that, as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort consistently. For most of my life I thought muscular people were just born that way, had I known it was something you could control I'd have done something sooner.
WHY DO YOU GUYS ALWAYS WANT TO SUB JIMMY OUT???? WHY?????????Jordan played like 45 minutes a game in the playoffs. Let Jimmy do his damn thing. 20+pt lead because jimmy is in, get it to a 40 pt lead and we can talk about subs.
Holly Chock. The dudes from Weird Science grew up to be wealthy entrepreneurs that decided to create a space age robot chick with tits as big as her head after they deduced that normal women didn't do it for them anymore. She likes reptiles, rope burn, barbiturates, go go dancing, contortion, Kraftwerk, sticking her hands where they don't belong, and taking advantage of dumb men. Carol Doda, Sweet Gwendoline, Courtney Love, Quorra and Medusa's lovething.
Aftershaves and Pre-shaves are more personal preference than anything. If I were you, I would watch some Youtube videos of well-known people shaving. Check out Michael Freedberg, Mad Scientist of Wetshaving, Mantic59, PaulHFilms.If you don't know what anything you just bought is, then it's good to watch these people as a reference. After you shave, rinse your face with cold water and rub the alum over your face(it'll sting if you got irritation, I'm sorry, but that's the nature of the beast) and then rinse it off and put on some face lotion or...if no face lotion....a couple drops of extra virgin olive oil(tons of vitamin A and E, sucks in the moisture, great stuff).
We had clear. Then sprint bought them and destroyed them. Not they won't even offer it in the area. We told them we lived in douglasville and boom it worked fine in kennwsaw. 
Oh lol yeah..probably a bit overkill. But it fits with such a pristine build.. one of those crappy computer stick mics wouldn't have done the setup justice. Anyway I'm leaning towards no window..especially now that I realize dust is a factor. It hadn't occurred to me before. And I do some recording so noise is the enemy.. no window should make it a bit quieter. My current build has a mesh screen in the side panel and blue LEDs and stuff inside.. I think next time I'll go for a more understated clean look that the Define R4/5 does so well. Not to mention I'm running a GTX650 so there's nothing in there worth showing off lol.
I appreciate the words of confidence, but I lost patience a while ago. I get frustrated with games much more easy then most, and trying to get the gated content was just aggravating. I've been playing in between schoolwork so getting angry at a game isn't favorable. I don't *like* cheating, it just seems like a poor design choice to have the best unlocks in a game behind a challenge of luck more than skill. 
Nah, LVT had the advantage all game, but NoT were running I think it was 3-4 necrobooks, on a LD, Brood, Tusk and someone else, they also had a Shadow Shaman, they ended up base racing at the end, but LVT learnt the hard way that you can't outpush 4 necrobooks, Serpent Wards and a Spirit Bear
I couldn't have lost the currency. Earlier this morning I didn't have enough arcane lore pages to get the boon, and I haven't done my campaign dailies yet today, and yet I now have the boon and I still have my 18 arcane lore pages. I know what you are saying, but I wouldn't still have the arcane lore if I had spent them.
preface: i stopped watching around that point cause i couldnt listen to it anymore, so my view on the subject may be incomplete.i get where youre coming from, but realistically speaking, you have to prefilter problems like that. e.g. a scientist cant let criticism from every 4th grader influence how s/he does his or her job. sure there might be a gem hidden in the ginormous pile of shit, but its not worth it diving into the lake, and getting excrement all over you, especially since theres no guarantuee youll find it.so you have to prefilter by expertise, cause more expertise means you spew less shit.
I remember reading the Duracell truck was actually built as a disaster relief truck. The orange box in the bed is full of batteries and flashlights they give out to victims. It has a functional snorkel air intake too. But yeah it's for looks too, the wheels are 1 of 1 customs. 
Seriously? The test requires female characters to talk to each other, which means there have to be multiple female characters and they have to have a conversation with each other. Anything without a lot of characters in it, or where the plot doesn't require much talking would fail, even if it has a strong female lead.Run Lola Run comes to mind. I'm sure there are lots of others.
Thanks for the reply, but what I was trying to ask is exactly HOW do I make that mock up 3D models with these measurements... I can't figure a way to make the grid go in thousandth inches, wich would be much easier to place holes in the case.Forgot to mention I have Blender, 123Design and 3DSMAX on my PC...Sorry I feel so dumb... It is kinda voodoo for me how people make these .stl of precise object such as phone cases...
To be fair though, this is an oversimplification. You can boost your metabolism temporarily by eating more calories than normal and you can stunt it by doing the opposite. It's not quite "starvation mode" but people who cut calories too much can feel tired, hungry, and then binge, making their diet counter-productive.

I will check it out. That is one good thing that has come out of this she and i have become very snuggly and she follows me around the house now. So we have become closer. Before she was less snuggly with us. It hurt me how hard she took losing her cat friend. I still hope they all become close again. Although I'd hate to give up my new found snuggles.
I agree, or anyone that buys into it. I've read about the whole starvation mode, but that seems to only apply when you're very grossly underweight. I've never really had an issue with eating, so I'm not sure why people can't control it. Lack of motivation, coupled with an intense hatred for themselves for being overweight, coupled with easy routes to exercise (you don't need a gym, go walk/run/do push-ups/ and just be active for a start), and I don't see why you can't do it.

I hope to the almighty Pen-Pen that your race doesn't eventually take over the world, lest we be faced with your shit taste in penguins. I hope you choke on your next digital mackerel.

&gt;There are ways to help treat it and people with a willingness to treat it will be cured with timeSource? Because that's a pretty big statement to make.
Oh :( damn I didn't realize plumbers needed to apply somewhere also. Do you have a name/website I can look at? I also ordered my transcript already :) should be here in a couple weeks. I've actually gotten into University of Toronto's second year then dropped out because I hated the experience so much, was by far the worst experience of my life. Anyhow, think I should put that on my resume somehow when I apply to JAC? Getting into U of T is a pretty decent achievement.Both jobs appeal to me in different ways, I enjoy  helpdesk because I can talk to others most of the day. Electrician's/plumbing just appeals to me since it's hands on and I can "complete" something very real. I'm mostly worried about getting used to the intense manual labour. Has that been difficult for you to adjust to?Also thanks for these helpful replies!
It isn't as much a paradox as it is absurd, but yes, you understand me perfectly well. Having been dragged into church on numerous occasions, and having a predemonantly religious family, I can attest to this.This is my go-to argument for keeping religion out of politics, because then you get dickcunts like Scientology getting tax exempt status.Who are we to tell them no when "religious purposes" is such an arbitrary distinction that we can't quantify it?
I imagine this is all just has to do with tolerance.  If you gradually increase your dose then I imagine your tolerance would match it to stop the dose from being strong enough to damage dopamine receptors.  Again, once you build a tolerance then higher doses won't effect you as much and so the nuerotoxic properties would need an even higher dose to present themselves.  Seems pretty straight forward.
Frozen fruit is also, well, frozen, which means ice crystals have punctured the cell walls and pulped the flesh up, making it easier for the flavor and sugars to be pulled out. Even when I buy fresh fruit, if I'm adding it to a beer whole or in chunks (as opposed to puree) I always freeze it first. I rarely bother pasteurizing or trying to sanitize anything, though.
Nice!  Thats one of my most favorite things to do, and I get so annoyed when someone ends up in front of me doing 40 to get on the damn highway!  hahaha
Free Comic Book Day is Saturday. Both locations of The Comic Book Shoppe (Clyde &amp; Bank Street) have activities going all day for it as well as the free comics. 
If you are going to try new champs, at least have the decency to look at the skill set of the champion. Better yet, go read a guide, look up what pro players build on that champion, find videos from pro players' stream, do some theory craft, think about what skills you will max first/what items you will build. Don't go into a match completely unprepared. You can also try the champion in custom match(there are almost always some all blind all mid custom games hosting)/dominion/play against your friends in custom games/play on pbe. 
Video starts and I'm slamming on my imaginary brake because HE WAS ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD! Don't know how /u/krautcop drives that way. It's wrong, I tell you. 
Chameleon Twist was criminally underappreciated. A new game with elements of it and Banjo-Kazooie is like the perfect combination for a modern take on N64-era platformers.
Just be careful about food. I justified moving out as being cheaper because splitting the rent 4 ways and no expensive-ass meal plan meant a big chunk of savings. However, with house-mates never keeping the kitchen clean, and not having a lot of confidence or experience cooking even basic meals, I wound up eating out ALL THE TIME. This wound up costing me way more than I saved in having no meal plan.I suggest learning to like washing dishes, and finding 2 or 3 go-to recipes that you can make for the week. (My preference is my man-mash: lentils, rice, ground turkey, black beans, salsa, whateverthefuck).That was my big regret. Oh and I lost a few friends by living with them. Some of it was my fault, some it was theirs
Please, please, please be in Civil War! Look, I love The Winter Soldier, it's one of the best to come from Marvel Studios, but I feel that Sharon Carter was horrendously underused, considering the relationship her and Cap had in the comics.
Your comment makes me laugh because I am celiac so I am also gluten free - involuntarily - and red velvet gluten free cupcakes are delicious... especially while doing paddle board yoga. On a serious note; paddle boarding yoga... don't knock it till you try it. Perhaps your humour is a bit judgmental and assumes its a stereotypical activity. Any activity is good activity my friend. Yoga and paddle boarding, separately or simultaneously it is very challenging and enjoyable. 
I think it's classic case of directors tone leaking too much to their characters. Sorkin has the same problem sometimes. If the Directors voice is more prominent than the character it makes every character seem the sameAnd yeah, it's probably naive to think you could do a better movie in a post, the director also has a lot of things to consider and constraints from the studio etc, but that's also a little bit of the downfall of big studio movies
I updated to the latest version, the one with "Ok OnePlus", other than this feature everything else works like a charm. The feel has been great, it is smooth and responsive. Surprisingly, the battery has been great in CM12s than CM11s. In 11s the max SoT I got was 5.45 hours, but yesterday I got 8 hours of SoT in 12s. And consistently getting SoT between 6-7 hours. Everything is stock, I just installed greenify in both the version, the Google Play Services bug seems to have been fixed. Overall I am happy with CM12s update.
I realize that I was scrambled in my original post, so I'm not upset about all of the downvotes. I get that I was far from elegant. What I meant to ask was whether or not Criminology was ultimately fruitless, and how career Criminologists cope with the public at large. 
Not sure if you'd be interested since it has a 0 in attack, but i have a female HA shiny Snivy HP fire, spread 31/0/31/31/31/31 with its [thread](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/comments/33stfa/daily_checking_and_discussion_thread_for_25_april/cqo9zsj&amp;usd=2&amp;usg=ALhdy28T6zkEUQE16To4dTxAI9Yhjt2CSg) while it is on the Daily check thread a user gave me these 2 eggs that matched my TSV, as such i'm OT. i would be interested in the shiny HA female Amaura EDIT: crap no the Snivy is 31/0/31/30/31/30

Yah everything thugswagyolo420 said. The way you act, the vibe you have (that will be determined by how you think and emotuons you have in your body) the way the interactions are. How fun they are.  Is more of a bonus than your appearance. Also girls like a realy wide range of appearances. Some like pudgy tummies  more than abs. Some like clean shaven some like full beards some like long as beards or twisty tiled mustaches. a percentage of girls like most every appearance so don't reject yourself before she does. You and people may think you look average but you may be a 10, physically, in her eyes. You never know. But also don't worry about looks. It is  only one of many facets in girls attraction. If you have everything thigswafyolo420 said, and an awesome life style (once your older). You could blow someone who only has look going for him out of the watter. Hope that helps. Sorry for typos, I'm on Moble and don't have time to edit this. 
STill don't understand why they didn't decide to have it in Orlando... SO MUCH TO DO especially with the new Orlando Eyes recent opening.#westorlando
I do not do paleo, it's too expensive to buy high quality meat in my area. Any sort of lunch meat/processed meats make my brain go crazy, so I usually stick to fresh fish and some dairy for protein. I have spoken with a dietitian who suggested based off my height, weight and activity level that I eat around 1800 calories on days I CF and 1700 on days I don't. Some days are better than others!
Whoever wrote the article couldn't spell corps or provide any specifics about what they did during their one-week sightseeing excursion.  Outfuckingstanding. 
Agency! Fuck, that word has been on the tip of my tongue for DAYS. That was like a brain sneeze just now. Wow.Thank you for asking, I hadn't succinctly written it out before. From what I've heard of the pagan faiths, I think there are a lot of ideas that jive with my way of thinking about the world.

I had a few chats with him before the account deletion, as seen here: http://imgur.com/a/ohSM4 then, I messaged Spycrabs and he danced around the question, not answering. Then, as seen here http://www.reddit.com/r/april30th2015/comments/34gf2w/i_honestly_think_usavethespycrabs_is_telling_the/cquf8t5?context=3 /u/20150501 answered all the questions.

Right, what I mean is get the customers you need first, then order the product. Like you said, pre-order. Set a threshold that says "if we can get x many people to commit to it, we will buy and then ship out, otherwise, your order will be cancelled, and we will not do the bulk buy."What I mean to say is it's only profitable for you if you can get enough units sold, or get a high enough price, and it's only worth it to your (potential) buyers, if you can give them the lower price, which means you might benefit from a system like what MassDrop does. Get the customers to commit to a pre-order, then if you get enough demand, the order goes through.
I jumped in on this sale as well as the last.  Shipping was a  lot faster this go around.  I bought your 2 new flavors, loops is great reminds me of fruit loops.  Puffs was ok reminded me of dry coco puffs. My favorite is orange dreamsicle 
No. If an MtF lady needs to pee, I say let her pee wherever she feels safest. Better than making her go into a male bathroom where god knows what awful thing might happen to her, away from the public eye.
This is like the most harmless way for them to get a little extra channel money, and is completely ignorable, and it doesn't even fucking take away from any of the scheduled content, and yet people are actually fucking bitching about this. I could see, I could maybe understand if they did a 30 minute video of this and put it up in place of Bloodborne, but no, it's just a quick little ad of them being their goofy selves talking about a sponsor. This is literally just the same thing as the podcast except there's video to it instead of audio. If you can skip the ad there, you can do it on youtube.Ugh, people.
I catch maybe 1-2 minor mistakes a day my very experienced captains make. They're rarely, if ever, anything major. They catch... Uh. *More* of my mistakes than I catch their mistakes.It's easy to mishear an ATIS or mistranspose a number. That's why there's two people in the cockpit.  
Are you guys looking toward mythic progress? I'm a 686 Arms warrior looking to try and find a guild that isn't conflicting with another raid times I'm currently invested in my alt.

It was mentioned somewhere that "riding rough" is commonly used as a police tactic to rough criminals up a bit before they get to the station by slamming over speedbumps and such. They know it's a problem and deal with it when they know about it happening.  The sad part is, The black community will not accept this as an answer and will kill more innocent white people just because they "feel" mistreated.
&gt;5.The two identical images displayed to each eye create depth perception.They're not identical images, that's why there is depth and also why it takes a lot of CPU/GPU cycles to render in stereo.
I say Max, Katya, fame and Jaidynn have all shown aspects of it.Max helped others in the challenges and put others first which the other three never really did, and most of the other contestants outside of the show seem to really like her. That one comment changed a lot of people's minds about her though as well as the editing.Katya and Jaidynn have been genuinely friendly to everyone. But I don't think they put anyone else first. And with Jaidynn it seemed as if more people were bringing her up.Fame was supportive of Katya and is really sweet. However I wouldn't say she was very congenial during the spoof challenge, mostly towards Pearl.I think it'll be Fame vs Katya though if Katya is eliminated early anyway.
People blame the picks, Link, and the shot-calling, but even with those problems, CLG should not have gotten 3-0'd by the 6 seed.  If a team consistently performs poorly in playoff series over the course of years, it's time to stop looking for unique symptoms in each loss.  Look for a root cause.

my 5yo boy is freaked out by playing with the soundtracks though hah. Have to use the sand timer.I have also found it works better playing together as one player together, with him rolling and me helping manage the dice. But he starts to crack under pressure, and wanted to stop after the first gong, he feels uncomfortable with the feeling of dread from not making it back in time!
I don't think you'll be in danger walking around with kids or running at night, but it's not a neighborhood I'd target if I were a family with kids. Have you looked at the Winchell neighborhood, or other places off of Oakland Drive?
In the “City of God,” St. Augustine tells the story of a pirate captured by Alexander the Great. The Emperor angrily demanded of him, “How dare you molest the seas?” To which the pirate replied, “How dare you molest the whole world? Because I do it with a small boat, I am called a pirate and a thief. You, with a great navy, molest the world and are called an emperor.”
Moss’s drive was a masterclass of precision and stamina, but not without incident. ‘I remember we were coming dead straight into a humpback bridge,’ he says. ‘Jenks had it down as flat-out, which we had done in practice. But then we were only doing 80mph and now we were at 170mph. We took off for 80 yards, and it wouldn’t stop.‘I thought, I must not turn the wheel in mid-air. Any deviation would have been disastrous.’Soot-faced and panda-eyed from their goggles, they made it to the finish 32 minutes ahead of their Mercedes team-mate Juan Manuel FangioThats so crazy.  Good looking on the link 
I wouldn't exactly call it "oddly silent", but I'm in that group for most of the time. Unless I'm in a silly mood and type in "Have fun, or else!" or replying to a glhf with "Or else! :P", I stay silent. I have a vow for online games to stay silent, because I get caught up in stupid arguments easily.Though I don't know why, but I ran into 10 games today (pretty much quit after that) where people ignored bombers (never spotting them in some games); I swore at this point people got dumber for some reason. The bombers just freely bombed the entire team with no consequences. And after the 5th match, I figuratively flipped the table and typed "ignored bombers, gg". And I normally don't type in angry thoughts like that.

I have one if those. Learns a new word: uses the shit out if it. Just like the radio tends to ruin just about any song. When they learned the word facetious was the worst! 
From just Heap, not sure. He would always give both gloves and wristbands out. Very few players even bothered at all, the guy was for sure the most generous visiting player I've seen. We would usually get 1-2 gloves a game when my brothers were young. We made it into a game and had a strategy to get them. Michael Vick gave what I would assume was his very last Falcons game ball to the same brother. We considered putting it on ebay or donating it to the humane society when the dog fighting stuff happened shortly afterwards.

I feel like this would make Annie easier to play. For those players that tend to auto between spell rotations, Annie won't ever be out of Q/W/R range with this change since her current AA range makes it difficult to stick to people as they run away and Annie makes that awkward stop to auto.But... This might only be me. I play a lot of Zyra and auto attacking at least once is crucial for her. Transitioning from that makes my playing Annie awkward.
Yes, but people were always just going to vote for who they liked the most. Maybe they intended it to be literally the most congenial, but I don't think it has ever actually been voted that way. 
You so crafty! I'd offer help, but I'm a terrible crafter, so instead I'm just gonna sit here and be impressed by your ambition :DEDIT: OH HAY mah res crashed, what do you want your fancy new tag to be?
Race and faction are not even nearly mutually exclusive, nor have they ever been in any of the games. That's not evidence that the lore is fucked up at all. That's your misunderstanding.
Thats a grey area really. You would have to determine if one person was incapable of consenting whilst the other was. This is so hard to do unfortunately.
If you have some money, Bulgaria is a great place to live. Nice weather, nice nature, delicious food, very safe and not overcrowded! Violence isn't an issue. Corruption doesn't really impact most people.

How is being stuck in a partisan system where there is an illusion of democracy but no matter what you vote it ends in one of two parties that are fundamentally on the same team our fault? We don't deserve this. The current and previous powers have worked damn hard to ensure that the status quo benefits them with no regard for us. 
You also can't rule out random chance. Some things just happen because of bizarre circumstances in the physics engine, like the guy who posted the video of the two planes crashing the other day.
&gt; I think you have a good point with quality over quantity, thats why I'm preferring FH videos nowadays.You mean the guys that have added 2 new shows in the past couple weeks?
I've heard from a few people that it's a front. I've never actually been there, so it's just a rumor as far as I'm concerned. Maybe I'll go get a buzz....... 
It gets posted every time, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/28wlcn/spoilers_all_preacok_theories/) thread is a decent list of old pre-ACOK theories, some of which are oddly true / close to.Some which have been proven* Varys will attempt to put a Targ on the throne again* The Night's Watch will ally themselves with Mance Rayder to fight the OthersAnd some which weren't* Jon will fuck Cat and have a child with her* Tywin will defeat Stannis and Renly and will force all POWs to join the Night's Watch to help against the Others
They play it on a station called Sprout, basically a poor man's nick jr. Suddenlink dropped Nickelodeon from our lineup a year ago so it's the kid's only option
Yes, but I'm not sure if there'll be much overlap given that I expect most players will be creating new characters for this HoF. I might have a few references to it but I don't want to mess with the happy endings the surviving characters achieved, so this'll be more like a side-story than a continuation.
As a big Green Party supporter I'm going with Bernie this election. Bernie has been an independent for awhile and shares a lot of Green values. But he's running as a Democrat so as not to be a spoiler. I think this is our only real chance of getting a Green-like president. Of course in a perfect world we wouldn't be locked into the two party system but I know so Bernie people afraid to vote third party so as not to "throw away their vote". I really think Bernie is the best compromise of this. He's a far left Green-like candidate throwing in with the Democrats so as to actually have a chance. I can respect that and will support him the whole way.Read his website so as to see what he stands for. https://berniesanders.com/issues/He's also the only real chance at beating Hillary too.Edit: Fixed Barry/Bernie autocorrect.
I actually loved that the ugly dress wasn't a challenge, because it showcased what the queens actually think of as ugly, rather than having them make something ugly out of provided materials.  For what it's worth, I thought Katya's dress was everything an ugly dress should be (I love Katya, but I'm not a stan), and that, combined with her performance, should have given her the win.  
Ah, sorry if you didn't. Law school is a horrible nightmare (IMHO) and in no way representative of the practice of law, unless you want to be an appellate attorney for some reason. 
As you said, it's a systemic failure. Institutions, not just a white supremacist here and there are the ones that failed this community. Get rid of a politician, another one will be propped up by the establishment. Where were these heartbroken redditors that love the city of Baltimore so much when wells Fargo was doling out sub prime mortgages to these families? Records even show that they called them mud people. How much more damage did that do to families? How about the fact that the poverty and unemployment rate are sky high? No one talks about it till people start fucking shit up. And once you see people rioting, here come the great white reddit circle jerk not too far behind saying stupid shit like "MLK didn't die for this". Paraphrasing the great man, if people have a stake in their society they will protect that society. If they have no stake in it they will unconsciously want to destroy it.
Pinta by 1492. Its a local juice company, some people may have heard of his other line, Oishi Jusu. Its a pineapple upside downcake without the cherry. Its absolutely amazing and I can't get enough of it, especially at $15 for a 30ml that I can go pick up at literally any time.
I'm not sure if it bothers me because they are expected or if I only started seeing them over the past fiver years or so, but does anyone else just cringe at having a ceremony for promotion to the Amn ranks?
Yes in college. And my major required me to take a bunch of elective bullshit classes so I usually skipped those because they weren't anything that I felt like I had to learn.
Do you have any iron deficiency caused by your UC? That could be causing the fatigue. I had terrible fatigue when working out prior to diagnosis, but now that my iron level is a bit higher, I don't experience it. In fact, now I am able to run and go spinning, both quite intensely.
Yeah, going with this guy...  And hindsight being 20/20 I'm backing Octavian against Antony and Lepidus too.Plus being a Legionary is just cooler than being a hoplite.  
When I began working in a largely populated factory I started noticing the weird ways people deal with their fatness while pissing. Some have to lean on the wall in a weird way and get their gut in the pisser so they're not too far back. The best is seeing a person use the wall to lean on and their forearm to lift up their belly and they just piss hoping they are making it in. Its really disturbing, I can't imagine getting to that point and still shoving your mouth full of food and not exercising. 
Picked up cross stitching. If anybody told me I'd do this two weeks ago, I'd have laughed at them. Of all the tons of potential hobbies I was considering, cross stitching was the last one on the list. No, it wasn't even on the list. It was such a weird impulse idea. Yet I bought the supplies, and now I'm cross-stitching my first Pikachu (certaintly won't be the last).
They used to be called [plotting boards](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1600&amp;bih=786&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=command+plotting+board&amp;oq=command+plotting+board&amp;gs_l=img.3...15013.15834.0.16019.8.7.0.0.0.1.114.533.0j5.5.0.msedr...0...1c.1.64.img..8.0.0.Rh2KUicOuxI).

Maybe the [corsair m45](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/raptor-m45-gaming-mouse)? I haven't used one myself but it uses the same 3310 sensor in the Zowie mice, Steelseries Rival, etc that many seem to like and seems to hit most of the other points depending on your definition of moderately heavy.
Yeah, I did wonder about that but I couldn't bring myself to think Deirdre would be that mercenary!  I mean it's one thing not bowing out but she's actually spoken publicly about it arguing his innocence.  Her reputation is on the line surely?
I wish I could just vent, my week(past 2 years) has been exhausting and so hard for me, and I feel that if I vent on here someone will some how figure out who I am and then the people I know will find out about what I am having to go through . If there is anyone on here that would be kind enough to just listen to me vent and offer some advice to me it would mean so much.

Good on you man. I've been seeing subtle improvements across the board for me with treating sleep apnea - my memory and focus have improved, I'm not bounding out of bed but I'm more stable mood-wise, even if it's a bit of a slump lately, I'm less irritable and reactive etc. Anyway, point being, if it does end up coming back w/ positive results, I'm happy to discuss with you dude. Kinda sucks wearing a thing at night mostly used by really old fat heavy smokers, but then again I have friends who are paediatric nurses who have worked with children of normal weight who have it. Also, fingers crossed for some good changes! Good to ehar you're being proactive man. We should celebrate your health with a drink after the next bike ride, for your health.
Yea, what I had been doing was talk about the distillery then try a whiskey or two.   Then I switched to the distillery and one whiskey... now I'm thinking separate vids for the distillery then quick vids for the whiskeys
Yeah, my imaginary perfect reddit would definitely involve uninvolved top mods whose only job is to counteract the inevitable problem caused by the fact that the people who want to become mods are the last people who you'd want in that role, by kicking out the most moddest mods whenever they go full mod, and inspiring the fear of God into the rest.
Tangent: I have only heard bad things about Endomondo training plans.Back on topic, she is wrong. Dead wrong, and not a runner. When you tell her that, be dressed for running, I suggest a strong tempo run right after you tell her in-order to get to a safe distance :)I ran mostly 5 days (instead of 6) this training cycle, and I was disappointed in my Boston time. I cycled for the 6th easy day instead of running. The more you run, the faster you are. And the more you get to eat! :)

This is what pride means. Seems like the word you are looking for is arrogance.&gt; **pride (prīd)** noun&gt; &gt; 1. A feeling or deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements, the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated, or from qualities or possessions that are widely admired.

Because clearly it it's a reasonable possibility that the military would take over Texas. He is uncertain and there is a chance it it's true.Rand was pandering again to the crazies. The right response was: "must is nonsense, the military is not going to duo that."Or maybe you think the military might be planning this.
This just popped up on my dashboard again and it's so goddamn stupid. As flippantflippery said, there should be a means for homeless women and women below the poverty line to have access to free feminine hygene products, but the cost of providing nearly half of the population with free pads would be beyond possible. Sorry, you have to pay for food, because food costs to produce and transport. Same with pads and tampons. Besides, you get what you pay for. I gladly pay a little extra for a good quality brand rather then go for the cheapest economy range store ones, because they work better, are more reliable and are more comfortable. God knows what sort of thing you could expect for free.
You're right. It doesn't feel like the weight being taken off your chest. It feels like a punch in the chest. But you know something? A punch in the chest can be a good thing. Cause a punch in the chest means you're still standing. It sucks in the moment, but in a while, you're gonna be okay with it. Cause that's all it is. A little punch in the chest. If you can't move onwards and upwards, do you really have any business trying to not get rejected in the first place?

The difference between Normal Scepter of God vs Cruel Act 1-2, and Cruel Scepter vs Merciless Act 1-2 is insane. If you solo the entire Scepter plus Dom, the next 2 acts in the next difficulty are a borefest, it finally picks up back at Sewers, and then from Sewers to Scepter the difficulty spike just, well... spikes quite high.

How are they calculating the amount of fans for each sport? I honestly find it hard to believe most of these sports beat the NFL in viewership. Also, while the the sports themselves might be more popular because they're spread around multiple countries, this also means that each sport has multiple professional leagues with their own profits. For football, there's really just the NFL. One league, 16 games, and fans watch every one. I'd be surprised if the NFL weren't the most profitable sports league.

Dunno who's downvoting you, you clearly know more about the cap implications than I do haha. I guess I could go play on Over the Cap and see what's up. I probably will after the draft is over, just to see what other moves we might make.As for Scandrick, I'm probably the one taking the hardest line on him. I just don't agree with holding out when you have four years left on your contract. You ain't Revis, and you picked safety over a chance at big money. Sorry you're playing well now, but if I'm playing poker, fold, and the last card would have hit my hand, I don't get to say "wait, let me back in, I would have won that money." It's not a perfect analogy since his hard work got him here, not luck, but he ultimately placed his bet on safe money rather than on his work ethic and talent, which he clearly does have.
Were the Romans much worse than the British? Jesus always seemed to take his pacifism to a pretty radical place. isn't the goal to emulate him as closely as possible? Or am I missing something?
&gt; Back when money was tighter (I only had $700,000 in the bank but at least my house was paid off), I had this older truck – a 1984 Nissan compact pickup. Master of the humblebrag strikes again.
Vince, thanks for doing an AMA. I was a fan of breaking bad since day 1 - I saw a promo and WW reminded me of my college organic chemistry professor (he had us do a summer research project on discovering methods how to steam distill a chemical from a plant - we later found out that this particular chemical is similar enough to THC that he could run the distillation with THC, thus quickly making hash in the course of a few minutes). I HAD to watch.My question is this:You're given 5 billion dollars and the only stipulation is that you have to create something for TV or film that will be great. What is it?

You've fallen into the trap of thinking we are all the same. We're not. White people commit far less crimes than black people. Whites are more intelligent and more responsible.
I don't live there, nor do I have any kind of numbers. I'm just going off what I remember when I visited and word from acquaintances, which is why I'd 'a lot' rather than most. Definitely remember seeing a lot of high end vehicles in some dingy looking areas.
[Cannabis smoking increases lane weaving and impaired cognitive function. Critical-tracking tests, reaction times, divided-attention tasks, and lane-position variability all show cannabis-induced impairment.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23220273 ) It is, by far, much less dangerous than drunk driving, and impairment is much less predictable than with alcohol. However, it is undoubtedly worse to drive high, than sober.
My hypothesis: Journalism realizes that their ship is sinking. They try to use their positions to prove that they are able to bend whatever "truth" there might be in any shape or direction possible. There is no objectivity, right? Guess that's just healthy business instinct. The real money lies in PR and political spin doctoring and social media astroturfing, not in "journalism".
I have the exact same problem as you. My boyfriend always tells me that I don't relax enough and that I daze off and stop being into it. He also tells me to try masturbating and I have but I seriously don't enjoy it. I also get sensitive after a few minutes and I just don't get turned on. You're not alone!

We are dancing to "No Ones Gonna Love You More Than I Do" by Band Of Horses. It's a little questionable bc some people think it's a break up song and some people think it's a love song. But it's a love song to us so we are going with it.

Well glad to know there is a market out there! I just felt for so long that there was o mucj i wnated to experience but didnt have anyone to talk to about it and considered paying for it myself. But after talking on forums and meeting people through reddit i have found there are many many people like me, male and female. So i figured i could become a provider of the service i wanted. Seemed to make sense.
My default face is kind of angry, "don't fuck with me" type of expression. It's cool when i walk and everyone goes out of my way, but it's more difficult to connect with someone because people genuinely think i'm mad at them, or that i want to fight them.
Oddly enough, i had family that was in that worked in the white house and he told me that everyone had to either look down or go into a room when she was walking through the corridors.
One chick my friend introduced her to me. She was the most stunning girl that ever spoke to me (still is), but her personality does not make her somebody who I would like to date.
I used to work for the Red Cross. After finding out I could look up any person who has ever donated, I decided to find you, and I did. Creepy, right?
From what i recall after primary you get placed in one of three high schools, based on your grades. The best high school allows you to advance to uni to study stuff like medicine. The middle one is more for average paying jobs, while the last one is pretty bad. I used to live in Switzerland which has the same system but I moved to a different country after primary.
Well there are 3 reasons why humans started to bury their dead:- Sanitation: Dead bodies are disgusting to us because they can spread disease- Predation prevention: Dead bodies will attract predators to the camp, endangering the living members- Religious: Since early humans didn't just dump someone in a hole to bury them (they were laid down in a particular way, often accompanied with tools/weapons/artifacts), it is believed that they had the primitive belief in an afterlife, so there was a ceremony associated with burying the dead, potentially also burying those valuable assets thinking they would need it later.

Bill Gates, so I can impersonate him and benefit financially from it somehow. I know I wouldn't be able to just write a check to myself, but I think if I'm able to steal some valuables that he wouldn't miss, it could work out.
What a load of shit.  They, with Zenimax, were going to take 75% of the money spent on mods and leave the modders with only 25%, after doing none of the work on it, and not being able to maintain the compatibility of the mods over the long run since they would do no work on it.edit.  Zenimax owns Bethesda.  Also, Valve was totally trying to take advantage of modders and customers.  I'm noticing people here are defending valve like console peasants defending consoles, DLCs and whatever else.

Geography.That said, there are some areas of the Big Eye that are just as lush, or even more so, than Kaua'i.  In terms of geographic area covered in "lush,"  Hawai'i may have more than Kaua'i.
That's why I find it offensive. They would be trying to put the crimes of ancestors I don't even know if I have on me because of skin color.I believe most white guys don't care about the word cracker because they either don't know what the connotation is or they don't want to have to defend themselves against a pretty rude insult.I know we're not on the playground anymore. But all most of us want is equal respect. If I can't use use negro fag retard as descriptors, people shouldn't use cracker.Honky though, IDGAF about.
He said "these films", which makes me believe that he's referring to the whole sequel trilogy, meaning he'll have to wait until 2019 to be able to collect.
Does that study account for population ratios? Because there are several times over more Caucasians then African Americans... Of course there's more poor white people in "absolute" numbers. There's more white people by far...
I'm saying the people screaming racist on a moments notice are being aggressive. Them being so aggressive towards someone and calling them racist, usually cause they are white, is kind of racist. 
I realize that. It's too bad it's a haven for semi-legal activity.I just wish there were more used media shops around still. Sometimes digital doesn't have what one's looking for...
In HS I had a teacher tell my parents that I was a disgrace to the honors system, and if he had it his way then I wouldn't be allowed to continue in it. 
Hey guys, I've been a lurker here for a long time, but I'm going to try and make an effort to comment from now on!How are you guys doing lately? Anything interesting happened/coming up?I haven't had too much, but I started working out regularly a month ago, and I'm glad my hard work is yielding results.Outside of that, nothing much has been going on. Just usual keeping my grades up and all. I started Amagami SS on Monday, and I'm really loving it! Kaoru is best girl, so far, but Ai is also a top contender. Honestly, every girl is great.Have a nice weekend!
You're right, and I should have been clearer that I meant crust *with cornmeal* not made exclusively from it. When I made a couple deep-dish pizzas recently from Tony Gemignani's book, it was mostly flour with a little cornmeal, lard instead of butter, and then rolled out on much more cornmeal. Gave it a lovely flaky almost pie-crust texture very similar to the crust I had when I ate at Lou Malnatti's. Dammit now I want pizza.And you're right, I totally forgot about the cracker-crust pizza. Gotta get one of those things that look like a mini lawn aerator to poke all the air out of your dough. I haven't tried that style yet.

The stock market is full businesses who generate profits for the shareholder, the Amazon.com marketplace is full of consumer goods. Steam is more analogous to the latter. Maybe you could ask gaben for a share of his company?
That's a B2 unit, Superflower is the OEM.Newegg's tier list is utter rubbish, Superflower makes arguably higher-quality units than Seasonic. 744W of the 750W can be delivered over the 12V rail, which is very good.
Xyz Monsters you could make include:* Constellar Ptolemy M7* Gauntlet Launcher* Inzektor Exa-Beetle* Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis* Number 21: Frozen Lady Justice* Number 25: Force Focus* Number 39: Utopia Beyond* Photon Strike Bounzer* Pilgrim Reaper* Sword Breaker* Gaia Dragon, the Thunder Charger (using one of the above monsters as Xyz Material)Of these, I believe M7, Bounzer, and Gaia Dragon are some of the more commonly used ones.

I hate Rebornica's canon, period. I find it so unappealing. It's literally the opposite of why FNaF appeals to me, yet people take it as canon like Scott told Rebornica to make it or something.

Except that physically demanding respect shows that you need other people's respect and approval.  Why would you *need* respect?It's a display of sensitivity, insecurity, and lack of humility, not confidence.  It shows that you take yourself and what others say about you way too seriously.  It shows that you're affected by what they said.  You want to justify it by some caveman ooga-booga mentality where you glorify yourself into some lion, but how about you go back in time a little bit farther when you were just some moss on a rock, you insignificant little creature?
Much more now that it's not effecting me so much. I used to be up all night unable to sleep for 48+ hours on 50-100mg doses. Now I take 170mg in the morning and I'm asleep by midnight that night. Edit: I'd say I get 5-7 hours of sleep a night as opposed to the 0-3 hours I used to get. I still don't eat much though, 2 meals a day at the most but usually just 1 small meal.
Why the assumption? There is no way to play ANY game off steam that's been VAC banned so it's pretty pointless to kick players for this. I'm not going to use my main steam account because I have multiple accounts linked to the one I'm using now. I only pity the server owners because there will be less players on their server.
Quick note: radiance gives enemies 17% miss, it doesn't give you evasion. That means for example that it won't work against magic immune enemies, whereas evasion would.
if we can get Irving with a third round pick how about we maybe at a different position of draft need? I know a Beasley/Fowler/Dupree and Irvin combination would be crazy but how would you guys feel if we draft maybe Cooper?
Yeah #antisjw is good. I suggested months earlier just put "SJW" before a hashtag of any field or hobby. Like #SJWcomics, #SJWscifi, #SJWsports, #SJWtech, #SJWanimeIts like the batsignal, flash the hashtag and people will come to your aid if you are being attacked by SJWs.
Ah. Well, sometimes just him listening can be enough. Just so long as he doesn't tell you to snap out of it or anything like that. Maybe you can also research support groups in your area. Try and find as many resources as you can.
Ok. Op is wrong. All I do is offer opinions on what I like and don't like.I didn't like the idea of Reigns being champ. But I like everything he has done since Wrestlemania. So... why am I bad?

You really think it's as easy as that? Lol if it was then this wouldn't be a problem. The fact is, the only thing that can help is the only thing that we can't do anything about. The people themselves, as long as that won't change no amount of education or welfare will help.

Sitting at the watchtower study the day the generations teaching was changed in 1995.  I realized they ran out of time as opposed to having come up with some new understanding.I understand that these videos are valuable, but only for the jw who already is questioning.

Don't get me wrong, people are definitely free to voice their opinions. To be honest, I'm not that happy that the BFs have hopped on the lootcrate bandwagon either. I'm just annoyed at all of the uncivil comments on the Youtube video.
Having lived in AB my entire life,  even the notion of the NDP becoming the official opposition is astonishing.  You have to step back and go wow at the whole show.  
The balance between story and characters depends on the goals of the show. Art and music can add to a show, but cannot carry it by themselves. It is very uncommon for art and music to drag a show down, since they are usually inoffensive. 
I haven't been able to watch complete games so I don't know how our bullpen has been doing since the Subway Series. Has it been something to worry about?
You can cut his minutes and still start him. Aminu/Dirk starts then when Dirk sits bring in Parsons for no drop in offense. Parsons can still get his minutes. Don't you agree Aminu/Parsons &gt; Aminu/Dirk &gt; Parsons&gt;Dirk? Not in overall talent, just in fit. Defense is still under rated in the NBA which is why I think you guys easily get Aminu back. Just my thoughts anyways.

When I got the determination to learn bound headstand, it took me probably around 5 months of practice before I felt super solid to do them away from a wall. Keep practicing every day! Work on stacking your hips over your shoulders in the little 'egg' shape with knees tucked in and don't be in a rush to get your legs up.   I started practicing handstand at the same time as headstand and still have not mastered it, and it has been about 2 years now!
&gt;invariably the number of Brits killed is the leading number.That's a universal phenomenon, not exclusive to the English speaking world. Partly due to the possibility of those victims being related to the viewers. So there is an inherent interest in how many UK citizens died in a plane crash, as some of their viewership will be related to the UK citizens on that flight. 
They're entitled to their opinions as much as you or the next person. I hate how when Christianity is questioned people turn up with pitchforks. I was raised Christian but this issue made me stop believing, not in God but in the people that believe in him/her/it.I hated how people believe in this unquestionably incomprehensible being and then dare to preach their opinion of their gestures towards man. We barely understand our solar system but we believe we can delve into the mind of a being who created all of existence?
That is a pretty damn cool looking ship, I'm surprised they're not pushing  that for 1.3 instead of another Imperial ship, after they gave us the Fed dropship...
&gt; I don't want to hear about gender inequality among the wealthy elite.followed by&gt; So this is golden, absolutely golden. This comment right here is a treasure of unseen proportions, and the upvote count is a wonderful representation of reddit.Why? Because if this situation were reversed - women CEOs being paid 68c on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, everybody would be yapping on about gender inequality and how it's still unfair that they get paid less. I'm baffled.Edit: The point of this post was to show Reddit's dichotomy, I have no idea if the claim being made in the original article is any more valid or invalid than the reverse claim that women make 77c on the dollar.  It certainly seems that the sample size of women is much smaller (obviously due to the lack of female CEOs) which could mean that outliers are influencing the average more, but again, my point was to show how hypocritical the top comment was.

The deck is about summoning dragons that live in space. That should sell you on it being fun. If not, then it can summon some massive monsters fairly easily, and if that sounds like fun then try it out.There are some consistency issues, though. With the right cards in hand, you can make some great plays, but the deck lacks draw power (Galactic Chartiy exists, but it's not great). Beckoning Light is a pretty good card in the deck, as are any cards that let you get Knight back in hand. It's one of my favorite archetypes, though, simply because of how satisfying it is to spam Rank 8s and then use Number 62's effect to gain 200x all the Rank on board. I was playing against my friend's Gimmick Puppets the other day and 62 got to 9K in two of our three duels. So much fun.
Bill Flores is super conservative. Of course he doesn't support gay marriage. Hell, just a few weeks ago when he was talking to students in the MSC he said he doesn't believe that human activities are causing climate change. If you think Flores is too conservative then register to vote in the next election (early voting takes place in the MSC)

She's not better, she's just rarer. The dark counterparts of the special gods tend to be six stars.She really isn't that usable without REM. Ideally, you still want to focus on having Dark subs but farmable Dark attackers are pretty nonexistent. You'll be stuck running a nuke based team with High Dark Ninja to bring your HP to 1, Devil Fish to follow up, and then comboing off of that for a x16 multiplier. You should easily be able to beat most early bosses with this cheese but your low HP will leave very little room for error.

No employer can legally enforce a policy that violates the law. If Washington state laws really mandates breaks (I'm not sure if it does, but the document sure makes it seem so) then this agreement has no standing.I would contact [the Restaurant Opportunity Center Seattle Local]( http://rocunited.org/seattle/) and let them know what's going on. They can certainly point you in the right direction. I bet they have local experience with something similar.
And I was saying that this is true depending on the culture. At least in more "machismo" oriented cultures, this is true. The same goes for Italian culture. Does this apply to every case? No. But it's enough of a pattern that it's true for a lot of people. But, and here's a big but: depression is still diagnosed at much MUCH higher rates in women. 
That's just the reality of the situation. If the Sanders campaign loses this election, it will probably be because Clinton outspends him like crazy. In fact, the way that money tends to decide elections is the only thing standing between this country and a Sanders presidency, in my opinion.If he and Clinton and the eventual Republican nominee all had equal campaign budgets, then we wouldn't have anything to worry about.
No one is arguing with you on that part... Clothes still have genders ... You can wear what you want. Idk why your so vent out of shape arguing with yourself 
Huh that sucks mine was more out of being oblivious though not straight up being an asshole. I don't know if I would want anyone in my life that was such a cunt let alone want them to ask me out? 
Fair enough. Maybe they'll nerf Malzahar too then, because the only counterplay available is either be Gangplank, use cleanse, or not be close enough. Pretty much the same counterplay Annie's stun has.But seriously though. Like I've said twice now, I don't think Annie doesn't need nerfs. I'd be okay with the Veigar box treatment on Tibbers. I just don't think her AA range should be nerfed. 
Exactly, either use the resto staff with heavy armor, or use light armor with another weapon, pref destro staff if you are against resto. You could use sword and shield for simply CCing and defensive actions but you would be quite weak yourself with no real mana regen.

Welp, I've got Energy Beam Emmission (http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Energy_Beam_Emission) which pretty much lets me use lasers, offensively or defensively.

(http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/Gravity_Bomb_Generation) I think that I could make it up to Goku, my gravity bombs should help me a lot in the ladder, as they have LOADS of destructive potential. My lasers should also give me some better attacks, and flaming blood...hope someone tries to cut me. Anyway, Goku would probably beat me, my lasers wouldn't do jack to him and he's probably fast enough to phase past my bombs, and one-shot with an energy blast. At least I made it far.
I have a new rifle and new brass but don't know where my lands are. Using a piece of brass I can waste - I cut a notch out of the neck which holds the bullet but allows for easy set-back, seat a bullet quite long, and then chamber the mock round. Using a comparator I can find out exactly where the chamber reaches 6.5 mm and set my rounds for the proper jump.

[Make this](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lemon-curd-recipe.html) - I limit the lemon juice to 1/3 a cup and just the rind of the 2 lemons it takes to do that. It's un. real.
I know this is not a popular opinion here, but I'd rather we beat them when they still have their best players, versus getting easy wins against lesser versions of them.We won't know how good we are, until we beat them at our best when they are at their best.
I feel like dramatic TV shows have absolutely ruined on-screen female friendships for me. Every single time it was just the two of them, I was thinking "ugh are they really going to bang?"I'm genuinely surprised that it hasn't happened yet because it seems like a very CW route to take.
At the current point in the manga, the show would have finished s2 and statted s3..... [manga spoilers]( /s "we are further away from the basement that we were at the end of s1")
If Nenshi has provincial political aspirations, he needs to step down as mayor, or wait until someone else is elected mayor in his place. He should NOT be so involved right now.This "prediction" is completely irresponsible since many of his supporters may see this online and go with his judgement.

There was a thread a little bit ago saying this thing is currently on life support- any actual sources?http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplehate/comments/34e3uo/monster_youtube_sisters_update_tammy_is_on_life/Edit- I found a gofundme [site](http://imgur.com/Z3cBG7E)
I actually have this similar problem and posted about it awhile back in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1iawaa/nightmares_and_vivid_dreaming_on_keto/) post.  I got a few good answers.  I did some further research and actually found that [HGH](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1biwpj/update_anyone_else_having_weird_dreams/c971vlz), which is increased as insulin is decreased, can cause nighmares and vivid dreams. Edit:  For clarifying punctuation.
This is definitely not true for all credit cards. At least for Discover, they will let you charge above the limit once. As in: Im at $1950 on a $2000 limit, I charge $100, my balance hits $2050, and if I try to charge *anything* again it will be declined. 
Sylvans (kinda suck with them TBH), Yang Zing (yay getting destroyed), Shaddolsworn, Monarchs, and I'm *trying* to make Normal Pendulums work but there's not really much to go with right now. That's about it at the moment. 
I feel that! His style has definitely changed but you gotta remember his life is completely different now, he isn't sleeping couch to couch anymore, so I'm not surprised it changed. And he is still reppin savemoney so I like to think that signing to a label isn't going to change him that much. Also his verse in Family is one of my favorites
Same issue on XB1, tried loading an OP4 Siren and it said that I didn't have the content and my level would be set to 72. I'm not sure what's going on with it, but it's actually kinda nice to see that's it's not just me experiencing the issue.
Yes, but if you're in America Motorola will give you a new device. I'm in Sweden so I had to wait 1 month for a service center to swap the battery for me. If I had known that it would take me that long I'd probably buy a new battery and hatch.

The only way the injectors meter fuel is by the amount of time they are open so more fuel pressure would cause more fuel to be injected in the same amount of time. So yes you increasing the pressure caused it to to run rich and even if the fuel pressure is lower than recommended but the afr is good I'd say you're set. Was this a turbo engine stock because if not that could be why the fuel pressure is different than recommended. 
Hopefully it's closer to mine 1$ worth of bitcoin for 1.50$ a month in electricity or something...or the consumers would catch on quick and no one would use them.

If you have a Microcenter nearby, you can get a $40 discount on a mobo if you buy a 4690K at the same time.  The MSI Z97 PC Mate is a great choice for single GPU (the 4x second slot will do Crossfire, it's not ideal, but it cannot do SLI) - very good capability for the price, particularly after the $40 off.  That would shave $60 off your build.I'd also consider a cheap liquid cooler instead of a fan unit - you can pick up 120mm/140mm units for around $40 AR fairly frequently.  If you're not overclocking and want to save, the stock cooler will probably be fine, if you're overclocking it might be nice to move up.

White devils are the real niggers.

Reddit is completely functional with its default theme, so I think it's fair for them to charge a small amount for the ability to change the theme - consider how much it costs to run the servers for a site like reddit every month.
so i'm at a new bar for the game. great place good beer on tap lots of huge tvs and the games on a lot of em. my only beef is they're playing sound to the nfl  draft instead. deal breaker for me
Investment fraud can mean a lot of things.  Ponzi schemes.  Insider trading.  Boiler rooms.  These frauds aren't blown off like you're saying.  Stephen Richards spent 7 years in jail just for changing the date on sales invoices by a couple days.If you're referring to investment practices during the credit crisis, sure, there were few consequences for unethical behavior.  The difference there was that their behavior generally wasn't illegal, just unethical.
I may have to look into Summoner Monk and Queen Dragun Djinn. Her effects are pretty good for the deck, and between protector and summoner monk you could spam the Rank 4 pretty easy. Not as easy as other decks, mind.And Dark Armed Dragon seems like a good tech too. I may look into removing other stuff to put these things in. I'm still using a lot of the techs from the Konami video like Carboneddon and Kinka Byo/Beast-Eyes Pendulum Dragon that I rarely get to take advantage of (well, I find myself using Carboneddon more than Kinka Byo).Thanks for the tips.
Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.
I don't know man. I was number 532 and like I said, shipped yesterday. You might not be far away. Although technically my package is still at "pre-shipment info sent to USPS".
And let's not pretend that an _adult_ can't decide for themselves what to and not to put in their bodies. But you would know better, right? Because you're the authority on everything.
&gt; Ou condamner les nazis en ignorant les injustices du traité de Versailles.Wilson, le président américain de l'époque, avait prédit une montée du nationalisme allemand et une nouvelle guerre suite à la signature de ce traité.

...what else do you want? The show has been over for over ten years, there's no new content to discuss, what kind of posts would be worthy of your oh-so-esteemed approval?

Would the DF1 Emu be legal to release if AV booted up their own version of DF1 again?Wouldn't it be viewed as direct competition in the same manner as "private" Warcraft servers, making the host (you) liable for a whole bunch of legal mumbojumbo?
Uh, there's a difference between saying something like that and actually believing it. People say all kinds of stupid shit they know they would never do.
You really can't unless you are a very experienced player with good card draw.The fact is that for climbing ladder for newer/average players, you will most likely need both key legendaries or Naxx/A few BRM cards.

But of the millions of other planets don't have life and circle round stars. One in a million sounds like a miracle, but two in a million would be even better.
You got it backwards. I don't invalidate your belief based on where you live, where you live is evidence for why you hold that belief. People who live in places separate from diversity of income or background tend to have views that don't look kindly on those of low income. They often don't understand how things don't simply boil down to personal responsibility.Furthermore my understanding of the situation is based on the numbers arrested, first hand accounts, and not just what pictures I see. 
My Aunty had kids in (1993) and (1995) . Both of them she was forced into having a c-sec 'because they were too big' they didn't even let her try. And she was such a low risk pregnancy. I'm really glad it's changed :) 
Most people use a self made spread sheet to keep track, but if you didn't, you should be safe waiting at 27-28months from card open date since you have to meet the min spend within 3 months from the open date. 
Yes, this is solid too. Not that we want to think of our babies as pawns in some political game, but there's something to trying to build bridges as a new parent. None of us can do this alone. I think I addressed it in my last response, but I don't let my parents baby-sit my son. My brother will occasionally baby-sit but his son's only a year older than mine; it's asking a lot. If not for my in-laws, we would find ourselves in a bind. It may not be as useful now as it may be in later years, but this is the time that's setting the stage for your relations as parent and their with you as the grandparents of your baby. 
I think the MMA Beat is just enough Luke Thomas for me (though I do follow &amp; enjoy his work on Twitter). He strikes me as just a bit too much of a blowhard (no offense, Luke!).
My mother had moved into a new house. There was a for sale sign still outside, they had literally just moved in. My brother comes walking out of his room in his boxers, and there was a couple of ladies just walking around looking. 
Ha!  You are so right.  My husband drives like an old man and the car was his mom's before that, so I don't understand why the car is having any trouble.  Thankfully my son isn't at all worried about swag.  I mean, he's not beating down the door to drive an El Camino, but the difference between a Camry and Avalon to him is nil :)
Admittedly that may have been a typo or a bad copy/paste on my part as I don't see it in the actual application or on their site any more, but the project itself looks a lot like Ruby and I'm always interested in new languages. Sorry for any confusion!
Yeah it's strange and awesome because literally 20 minutes ago I was watching an interview on another youtube channel as this song just dropped a few days ago and was just watching it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0Xi489hv3E
Wow, thats impressive, lots of interesting data in there. Im doing a similar project currently, but this is way above what Im making though. Keep up the awesome work!
Yes! pretty sure the episode where Soul and Black Star try to take on Kid for the first time will always give me a little laugh [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GsbZp0LRCA)
There are no unicorns or snowflakes, but more advanced RPers understand that a woman's ability to fight her own natural instincts (hypergamy) is on a spectrum. Everything is on a spectrum. However as a general rule hypergamy is ingrained in all women to some degree. That's why AWALT is still a good general rule.
The apps are the only way i use Swagbucks beings i don't like doing surveys. If they do this for all of the apps I'll probably just stop using SB all together honestly or maybe just do SBTV on one phone since it seems to give more and go by quicker.
Guy made a neutral comment and OP jumped down his throat with the rage of a dorito and mountain dew filled adolescent. Just pointing out facts. Hope everyone here dies anyway. Fucking scum.
It's called out-group homogeneity bias: you see the uniqueness of those in your group, but not that of those outside of your group. Almost all people commit this fallacy and it's certainly not limited to white people or even the issue of race.The USA has 50 states which are very different and we can see that, but Europe is just Europe to us.Reddit has many different subreddits and we know that, but Tumblr is just Tumblr.My favorite music style has many different, unique artists, but everyone else's is all the same.Etc.
Nobody is crying. The game simply has pay to win elements. Take a chill pill. Relax or something. Go get laid. I dunno. You are getting entirely too worked up by people stating the obvious.
&gt;You can tell a cop hes a piece of shit and legally he can do nothing about itGo ahead and try that and see how quickly you get arrested on trumped up charges of "assaulting a police officer" or a lone charge of "resisting arrest". Depends on how shitty your police force is ofc, but try that shit in New Orleans (or any other major city I would assume) and chances are your ass will end up in the lockup.
Animal Crossing Please!I only recently got a 3DS(Managed to hold out the 6+ Month wait from it's announcement) and the only game I own is Smash. While my friends have been pretty generous in lending me games, I do feel pretty bad about mooching off them so much. I really like games like Harvest Moon and I heard Animal Crossing is really similar.Plus I'd like to see how convenient digital titles. A few of my friends converted to digital for it's convenient-ness and I was wondering if I should do the same.Thanks for the giveaway man!

There is a difference between not being able to make something happen and lying through your teeth about intending to do it. I don't disagree with being frustrated with the online issues, but accusing Ed Boone of "lying through his teeth" seems a little dramatic.
It was Elvis for a while; possibly right up until the mid-90s.Not too long ago U2 played sold-out shows in two dozen countries on 5 continents in the span of less than two years, so they are a serious contender.
When I was a kid I saw a specialist because I had a difficult time learning. They also said I would likely never finish high school.  One more year until I finish my masters degree. Sometimes it just takes a little self motivation for kids to really dedicate themselves to their studies. 
I think you can safely purchase most of your larger items like cribs, dressers, car seat if your family hasn't already talked of gifting you those things. If someone does throw you a shower you could add some large bonus items like a stroller or glider, things you may not need immediately but would be nice along with all the little things baby needs (clothes, diapers, toys, etc).I feel like having the physical nursery done asap is important to me but the diaper creams and toys can wait for a shower. I should add that they may want to throw a shower once baby is born to meet your little person since you're a decent distance away. Maybe slide it into casual conversation thatYour family has been asking for registry items or something and throw in that they are getting a few small things and see if your friends bite. 
We agree completely, you just made it personal and alluded to my needing "old school parenting". If you said that to my face I'd show you some old-school conflict resolution along with a healthy dose of respect for strangers.  Just because you're behind a keyboard doesn't mean you can act like a fucktard.Just to be clear, I agree with what she did and agree that zero tolerance = zero thinking. 
Lol. Ham remains deluded in thinking clothes can make her look good. Size 20 is well past that point. Nothing can hide your rolls and blobs and white only makes it worse.
I'm somewhere in the 90's right now, although the mixed up order thing has caused me to miss a few episodes here and there. I'll catch 'em next time 'roud though.
https://www.plos.org/publications/journals/Public Library Of Science (PLOS) is a family of open (as in not behind paywall) journals. They're all editorially independent. Some are harder to get your paper published in than equivalent impact factor traditional journals (e.g. Plos Genetics is harder to publish in than Genes and Development according to a number of people I know who submit and publish in both.)PLOSone gets shit on for being a dumping ground for incomplete and sometimes low quality work, but at the same time there are some really valuable resources buried in there too.
What? What are you talking about? We never "need to wait"...when people stop caring the button will go to 0 seconds. It is absolutely finite as long as admins don't fuck with it, you can't dispute that
There's a rebuttal for that, from a pretty reliable source, too. http://www.theonion.com/articles/evangelical-scientists-refute-gravity-with-new-int,1778/
This girl is so inspiring, she's nothing short of heroic. And here I am NOT in college because I'm afraid of doing group projects, or afraid that I will be too dumb foe the course work. Ridiculous
You are allowed to be on the pitch, as long as part of both feet is either on or behind the touch line.. The ball doesn't have to be released behind your head, it has to be **delivered** from behind and over the head.Page 48 of 2014/15 FIFA Laws of the Game:&gt; At the moment of delivering the ball, the thrower:&gt;&gt; * faces the field of play&gt; * **has part of each foot either on the touch line or on the ground outside the touch line**&gt; * holds the ball with both hands&gt; * **delivers the ball from behind and over his head**&gt; * delivers the ball from the point where it left the field of play

I use extra virgin olive oil and have had wonderful results with it.  I generally massage it in and then let it sit for 20 minutes with a shower cap on.  I smell like a well-dressed salad until I rinse it out, but damn, does my hair get silky smooth!  (For shampoo and conditioner, I use the aveeno sulfate-free ones.  I use the conditioner only after the oil, but both on days I don't do oil.) And, with the oil it goes into these perfect and well-defined ringlets instead of a wavy, frizzy blob.  I don't take the time often, but when I do it's well worth it.  I have heard good things about coconut oil for hair but have never tried it myself.  I have heard of hair texture changing as you age, but going from straight to curly must be a huge adjustment.  My sister's is doing that a bit; she's gone from straight to increasing waviness in the past 3 or 4 years (she's 35 now) even though she's let it get longer and longer.  Bodies, eh? :S
Who gave him that diagnosis? Usually diagnosis takes a few referrals and seeing a developmental pediatrician and gathering information from lots of sources so the diagnosis shouldn't be a complete surprise by that point.It is a bit concerning how your diagnosis seems to have come about. You may want to get a second opinion or make sure that you sit down together with a specialist and really talk through the diagnosis. It shouldn't be one appt with one parent.  
Nobody has said Bring It On?  The first one, that is.  Cheerleaders?  Rebellious teenagers?  I can't be alone here.Or Head Over Heals?  I know what I'm watching tomorrow.
Can you put the downloaded songs onto an iPod or do you have to listen through the Spotify app? Will you lose access to the downloaded songs after the premium is cancelled? Sorry for all the questions.
Sometimes I wish I was more socially outgoing. Then I realize that my standard for grades/research would inevitably have to decrease if I did so, or some other aspect of my life. Which sucks because those are definitely higher priority for me, hard to find a balance.
But male circumcision has at least some medical benefits, and it doesn't cause the man extreme pain or almost kill them.And before you ask, yes I'm circumcised
Damnnnn that's almost *worse* than bringing it up. Like every time you see that person, both of you silently remember all the shit that happened.. Fuck, i'm probably making it worse :( Sorry! And yes that's a good idea. Thank God for less drunk bystanders. 
It kind of breaks down at certain ages. A 12 year old would have to date a 13 year old. A 21 year old could date a 17(.5) year old, which would be kind of weird. I was a senior in college when I was 21, and I definitely could not have gotten away with dating a high school junior.
Cab or get someone to drive you. Even through the anesthetic I was very sore and glad my wife was with me. I honestly would have wound up calling someone to get me if I didn't have her with me. 
I was looking into them when I thought I was staying in Tokyo, but it was so expensive I didn't look again. Oakhouse is like Sakura House, right? I prefer something more private, I'll take a better look. :)Thank you!
LOL @ A NOVA CONDESCENDING UPON ANOTHER NOVA.Yeah, I think any decent player would be getting 3k+ pistol rounds nearly every round if they were playing Nova 3s such as yourself. I don't think your aim is as good as you think it is, m8.
There's gonna be a voice that says in you head, "Nah...I'll just have one more." or "It's ok to just have one.". You gotta tell it "yo voice, I don't need another one". This voice is your addiction talking and once you tell it to fuck off. You'll be in good shape. All you have to do win the argument with that voice. It's really easy because it doesn't have any idea what logic is. It's just spouting some bullshit to try and get you to smoke again. I would say good luck, but if you can out argue that voice you'll be golden.
And he is off the team now lol. I wouldn't call Nihilum "Pro" at the moment with the roster change, we will have to wait and see, but I also wouldn't refer to them as "semi pro" by any means. Sure they got decimated by the EU teams, but which NA team didn't :(
I've never had much trouble with MyKi so I wouldn't mind hearing what others have to say about this. (Although I think the readers are pretty crappy sometimes) 
Zion is amazing. I've only been in late fall/early winter, and we encountered snow/ice in certain areas. I thought we were going to die because of how slippery it would get (also, falling icicles) since we weren't wearing chains on our shoes. I loved it!
I don't buy this shit. His system is still outdated, he wouldn't play Otto until April &amp; would bench Gortat in the 4th to play regular season Drew Gooden. Now that he had one good series (having Paul Pierce mind fuck that team certainly helps) everyone thinks he's a genius. 
Aristides Aquino, OF, CINSneaky 5 tool pick who drew rave reviews over the past season.  He's going to fly up the top 100 if he maintains last year's progress as he's promoted.And if we're talking about the next draft, I'm high on Kyle Tucker.  He apparently has a beautiful swing that some are comparing to Griffey Jr. and Ted Williams.
And in your case, you put a period where a question mark should go.EDIT: Ok, so I'm being called out, being told that was the joke. Maybe it was. Maybe it was a genuine mistake. Honestly, I thought it through before I posted, and I thought it was the latter. Who knows? Who cares?EDIT 2: Just watched the entire Anchorman scene. Ok, so the guy says exactly what OP said about the ? going where a period should go. Nowhere is there any reference to OP accidentally putting a period where a ? should go.

Sorry not anymore tonight but I'll accept when I get back on. I'm still looking to do the race. I didn't realize how much grinding it would take to get parts for cars!
Additionally, parrots can live to be fucking 60 (SIXTY) years old or more if properly taken care of.  I don't think these idiots who get "a new cute baby parrot lol" are ready for a 60+year commitment to another living thing.  Hell, most marriages don't last even half that long.Idiots, all of them.  Leave birds like these in the wild.
I met you at San Diego comic con last year, picked up some of your prints and got a few signed mtg artist proofs. When I got home I tracked down your artists of magic playmat "artemis" and have been playing on it ever since. Are you planning on doing any more mtg art any time in the future? I'm a big fan, keep up the good work.
What else do you think is fake? What about the Guangxu coin makes you think it is a fake? The Kangxi one also looks a bit fishy. The metal does not seem to be right, based on the rusting on it. The Jilin mint Qianlong also looks a bit fishy.
Why are there only reports about what the Eagles are offering? Nothing about the Bears, or Browns. And who leaked that? Seems like everyone's trying to F with the Eagles.
It works for me even with the adblocker on. Do give it a few minutes without any plugins and you'll see the guy in "live" action. It's actually pretty intriguing. 
People always think that divorce means they won't see their kids. My father and mother divorced and got 50/50 custody where I seen my dad every other day and weekend. As long as you got your shit together and will fight for it, there's no reason why this won't work out for you. You seem to have a strong head on your shoulders and I hope it works out!
Turns out crucifixions and Christianity both rose from ancient human sacrifices intended to enbue the wood with protective energies. Jesus was a great witch who linked with a full coven and sacrificed himself, granting protective powers to the essence of the cross rather than just one. Witches then created Christianity to convince people to wear the protective charms long after they had forgotten about the vampire monsters the crosses were created to protect us from.
The GPU is what draws the most power. As for how much it needs, plug the parts into pcpartpicker and look at the estimated wattage it gives(thats how much it is estimated to draw total under load.) The Fractal Design Define r5 usually goes for about 96 dollars. The NZXT S340 is also a good case and goes for 69 dollars. 
Not to mention all the people that can't write 300 word paragraphs.  No joke, my brother's freshman year, the English prof assigned a 300 word paper.  When my brother turned in a single paragraph, he had it immediately handed back with an F.  He asked the prof about it, and was immediately told that it was invalid because it was not written in the form of a three paragraph essay.  He had a 300 word limit, and it was meant to be 100 words a paragraph.  I hardly believe that is college-level work.
They're old but the Dale Carnegie "How To Make Friends and Influence People" books will help you get out there and talk to human beings like a fellow human.Please don't try to "socially engineer" anyone, though, since the awkwardness of the amateur trying to be a master is embarrassing. That's a bit like "I've never played baseball, how can I engineer a win against Tony Romo?"
Any tips on breaking up adhesions? I had multiple abdominal surgeries and a liver transplant, so my abdomen is one big adhesion now. I'm in a rural town and we don't have massage therapy here. 
it has the same stuff as before except now the building, interior, and dinnerware will be super expensive so the menu price will go up.  But, it has special maple syrup you can only have there.  You take it out of the building it stops working as maple syrup.  Unless someone opens an hackin-hop
I have been too busy to pay attention to any prospects over the last 9 months, so I have no specific name, but I want an ILB who can stop the goddamn run.If Sam Barrington is our best ILB (not counting Matthews) going into the season or defense will be shit again.  I wouldn't mind if we spent two of our top 3 picks on ILBs, the position needs a complete overhaul.
Sory to hear that. Were your blotters from the I-Ching print or the Yoda's Ghost?We've had great reviews so far from the new Yoda's Ghost print, although one person has reported less than expected results from it. It's the first sheet we've had of it so we're still testing the waters.We also have another print we'll be putting to market in the next week as well, and we'll be going with whichever of the two has the most consisitently good reviews. (The new print is the Snowflake Buddha print which was popular back on Evolution before the I-Ching came along, it'll be going live once Agora is back online after this yet-another-outage)In the meantime while Agora is having issues you can find us on Black Bank, where the listings for the new Snowflake print are up and running already. =)
1. Just try finding a different flaw. You might be able to get away with Compulsion (Cleanliness) for one point.2. Let me know when it's been done.3. I understand that you want a healing mage, but it's gonna need work. Move away from glyphs as much as you can though. 4. Backstories can be tough, just let me know when you've worked on it and changed some things. 5. In your advantages section you have the number "2" but we actually calculate armor as having it be */*. The first star is it's armor against melee and the second is against ranged damage. So in reality, your armor score will be calculated in an event as being 4/3, because I forgot to account for your aura armor. 
amateur night at a strip club/bar is basically an audition, sign up for one of those and impress and you are in. It's a pretty comfortable way of getting in anyway.
That is the best description of a fatty imploding I have ever heard of, Neutron Star.  At least we will never have to worry about the fatty going Super Nova.

&gt; all R* did was patch online missionsThey didn't even fix the missions, they made them more difficult to grind. They removed every easy way of making money Just to encourage shark cards. Not only did they make Covenant a pain in the ass to complete, but now it's not available in the job menu and you need to walk up to it at certain times of the day to play, meaning you can only do a few runs before waiting another half hour.

What part of skilled labor don't you understand? I'm not an office drone, I make my money doing a job that can't be outsourced. I can't be fired because I don't fit in. The only way I lose my job is when the robots take all the jobs. And by then you'll have lost your office job to software. 
I want Mayweather to lose, but I also don't want Manny to be President of the Philippines, which he intends to be.  Defeating an undefeated champion would make him the most beloved Filipino ever, and he's been an atrocious congressman so far.

I really like the music in this one. All the music played in Witcher 3 trailers has been great and unique but I like that this is a more subdued battle theme rather than the typical epic sounding stuff.
I just remembered this old picture of my previous dog, a 60lb GSD mix, in the front seat. Either the car is weirdly roomy, my dogs are weirdly compact, or maybe both.http://i.imgur.com/QuoVk.jpg
In the tutorial I posted above, all he did was paint on the texture after unwrapping it. It looks really good but why should I do that rather than taking a real image (or one that I created) and adding a bump map, specularity map etc... I'm brand new to this whole painting textures thing, so sorry for the confusion.
It works really well, I used it for a PMS breakout the last time I ordered some, and it seemed to heal faster. I actually used one today because I have fibromyalgia, and sometimes the nerves in my face get inflamed and red, and the hydrogels in general seem to help with the redness. My face pretty much looks normal color, and I used it a few hours ago.
I have been getting some braxton hicks the last couple weeks too (or I think that's what they are). I only really notice them if I poke my belly though.
Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'And yet, I warrant, it had upon its browA bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
Sometimes, the children of affluent families have weird ideas that spending money means happiness. Or that living someplace more expensive is better. I think the most important thing that needs to happen here is that she needs to talk to her parents for her to go back to therapy, and get some medication. The fact that is willing to take support from them for *some* things, but not *that* is concerning. 
This is one of the things I was getting at / hoping for with the post. It's not the worst thing in the world right now, but it would be nice for them to have a cleaner, neater install experience.
Well, by definition, if you have both Naxx and Blackrock cards in a deck then that deck isn't really low costed.But if you only take into account only the dust expense, then the decks off my head are Zoo (with Imp Gang Boss) or some midrange Demon Warlock variant. Also, I'm sure you can find more on Hearthpwn if you filter the search.
&gt;We are debating if what the media is calling "rape" in this video, is actually rape.Uh, no? Sometimes people simplify what they say to save time. No one is saying that virtual rape is the exact same as regular rape.&gt;You can't honestly say that this is rape...&gt;Tieing real world rape to this is insulting on many levels to many people.I literally never did that. You've said that the stuff in game is fine for reasons which are absolutely horrible. Reasons which would make real rape okay. Your reasons either apply to both, or neither. Pick one.&gt;in all of the stupid news video, you don't see any penetration, just the implication of penetration, so there is more evidence to it not being rape.You realize that's only because the models don't have genitalia right? The people doing this stuff would still gladly do it if there were genitals on the models. Hell, they'd probably do it far more often if they did.
I make kale smoothies all the time, and I have a Ninja. I've had no issues with chunksIt is no doubt in my mind the best blender for under $250. I highly recommended it!
It's an exercise in semantics showing that you can't say that the average player in league X makes the average wage in league X. That's what OP said, and that's what I've been refuting.More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.Can that be true?Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS. If you're a player with a choice of one or the other, and you care about getting a higher wage, which do you chose?
&gt;Furthermore, wind speeds associated with a tropical cyclone only are moderately correlated to the total societal impactVery true. I actually wrote a brief paper on a similar topic for an econometrics class where I regressed damage(log($$)) against a number of hurricane variables (wind at landfall, pres at landfall, minpres, maxwind, surge, etc) and found a similar result  (using admittedly rudimentary analysis, I actually found that wind speeds were not significant in explaining the variation in total damage cost, believe it or not, while surge and minpres explain nearly 70% of the variation).  In this sense, your point is reinforced as category and storm surge heights are not perfectly correlated.
Bucks get away with hammering DRose at the end of the first, Henson walks on his post up, Giannis jumps on Dunleavy and no calls. What are we doing here?
And I've been attacked multiple times on RP merely for stating my preference in this, without giving it a value judgement. It's always "fuck em and chuck em". Fine, if that's your strategy.  I feel it must be some doubt or insecurity in what they find themselves doing, that makes them have to criticize *any* other strategy.I want my girl to be dripping from anticipation, and even then, I'm controlling the pace. Trust me, she was.

Red Death is highly competitive in PvP.I'd drop the Mythoclast, personally. It doesn't hold up very well at range in comparison to the other guns listed, and it doesn't perform well enough close range (like TLW) to make up for it.
I've picked my 650 up a few times and it feels pretty light to me. Maybe I didn't have enough gas in it.TREs only affect the first two gears and don't make a huge difference imo, but they're cheap. 
&gt; Hahaha, I don't think he will.You absolutely are correct on this.  I don't believe in downvoting for anything except being ugly.  (The posts that are bad trolling)In this case, it doesn't matter if ultimately you are correct, or if I am correct, there is no need to downvote opinion.Time will tell one way or the other, but I believe the voting system on Reddit should be used all about the upvotes.  :)Edit:  Just to kind of prove the point, according to RES, I've got you at +25 on your comments.  So, apparently I agree with much of what you say.  Just not in this case. :)
&gt;Most Dwarves would choose an Elf over the Orcabseloutly not!for goodness sake yes the dwarves hate nearly everything about the eleves. but if they see one redeming quality in the elves it's their hatred of orcs being nearly equal to that of dwarfs.
Are his seizures currently one year apart while on medication?  It is possible they could become more frequent while off the meds.I also have to agree with the other commenter about seizures changing you.  A seizure can cause damage to your brain, and to allow that to happen simply to avoid the process of finding effective medications could potentially be a large mistake.Your last few questions are more suited for a neurologist, I think.  I would say that every case is different and has different goals and challenges.  If your neurologist is unable to answer such questions, I might suggest finding one who is able to do so.
A more interesting point is why I would condone anyone using an iron age book of mythology to talk right their immorality.Condemning people for the crime of how they were born is immoral. I do not care about your holy book of fairy tales. 
/u/LunoWear [says](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/3496fq/promoted_as_73_year_old_grandfather_designed_the/cqt4t88): "I want to assure you that we are 100% honest."How exactly does "100% honest" square with buying watches off of Alibaba and claiming that you "Bring 100 years of watchmaking history to design this masterpiece." Because that doesn't sound even 10% honest to me.

&gt;Eventually he shot him, then claimed he moved his hands possibly to reach for a gun.You left out the best part. His "reach" was scratching his nose after asking for and receiving permission.

The one in five statistic has a very broad criteria for rape including forced kissing: http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/10/24/statistics-dont-back-up-claims-about-rape-cultureAccording to the DOJ, rape is down 60% from 1994-2010.

You're criticizing the U.S. for using it's navy to protect it's citizens and their territory.  They aren't escorting all ships, they're escorting U.S. flagged ships.  It's not like they're blockading Iranian ports.
You sure he didn't tear it when he planted, which caused him to slip? I agree that playing on turf is terrible form your body, but not sure it was to blame here. 
RAW is just that. Raw sensor data. If won't look good regardless of the processing because RAW is not the end-result image format. The only thing that changes how a RAW looks is how you set up camera's settings and the scene you're photographing for the best possible exposure. 
My starters, including streamers, have not won a game since Strasburg on April 19th. 7 starters and a streaming slot. HOW is that even possible? It's like nearly 20 games started at this point.Stras, Kluber, Odorizzi, Hughes, Smyly, Chavez, Paxton, McHugh(traded for him after he won his game last week), Hammel(picked him up after he won his game this week). Seriously is my staff that bad? What the fuck fantasy baseball gods.
There's a difference between sexual orientation and physical conveniences. Like bathrooms are made for you to poop and pee not express your gender identity, like wtf. I'm very pro gay rights and am pretty liberal but that's just dumb. It's making an issue where there is none.

I'm betting the best thing you could do for her is give her undivided attention. No matter how nice/doting her parents are, they have shit to do every day. If you're willing to put your stuff on hold for a weekend to entertain your niece, she will love it no matter what you do.
We already have quite a bit of bases, and sunderers can easily be pulled, not to mention were getting things like sundy cloak. It would be more effective just to update the resource system, that way attackers can attack the supply lines of defenders, lowering a bases power supply and draining defenders' nanite gains .
That's a good point.  And it's making me question to how committed I was.  I think the wanderlust was definitely driving the marriage thing, coupled with all my friends getting married and brother, as well.  I don't know the best way to figure out myself.  Feel completely lost at this point.  
You believe in one God. Whether you say Jesus, or I say Allah, there us still only one God who Rules us. US as people have differing outlooks. Why you left Islam is your decision, but as long as you took the good things with you, that's good. I really do suggest looking into Islam a but more, again, if not to revert, at least just as a guide book. Allah will Question us all and based on our deeds and who we are, we will be rewarded or punished. I'm not a scholar, and I don't know much, but I know we are responsible for our lives. What you do is between you and Allah. I have no right to ask you why, or day you'll be punished for it, when in fact Allah may very well find something He likes in you. Be good, do no harm, we'll be fine, In Sha Allah, God Willing.

I am so sorry for your troubles. I totally understand and sympathize. It is frustrating and can leave you chronically sleep-deprived when a construction project drags on next door. In 2008 I, too, lived next door to a major construction project. Fortunately for me, the communications department was *very* communicative and helpful to neighbors. When I emailed a complaint, *they sent me a plant*. I'm not even joking. It was lovely.You deserve a plant, at the least. Keep fighting the good fight!

It's a shame they scrapped standing starts. Obviously the clutch in the DW12 was not up to it, but I doubt it would have been that big of a deal to fix over the off season. They would have had plenty of time at least..
I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, but I think *Isma* is giving an accurate account of her faith.   Under Catholicism you can't just say something is so because *you* think it is so.  If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  "no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality." He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority.

I stand corrected, everyone always called it the Rotex III here. Even DSA.  I do know the MP9 has its own can (it has a slightly different barrel shroud). B&amp;T actually has four different barrel shrouds they have put on this gun and B&amp;T USA is going to make their own soon apparently (no idea why it has to be different). 
It's through my university, so they're mostly grad students. Mine's certified with whatever organization my school is affiliated with, and is studying kinesiology.

I main Alph because Pikmin 3 is one of my favorite games on the Wii U, and one of the least appreciated nintendo games in my opinion. Also I get so much less confused with the new changes made in smash 4.

During skilling and pvp I come across certain people, I don't seek them out or spend time waiting at the ge realistically I probably only spent 2 hours ingame talking to them I was just being conservative 
I get what you're saying, though. It's going to be great to get to a point in the culture where we can just say "Oh, you like dudes? Cool." :) We'll get there eventually.
&gt; do we even have this?I do (although I spend money fast, heh), Siriann does, Belial does; Prof and newman together likely do, Soccer likely does; ... you probably have it too, if you added up all your easily liquid-able wealth.I'd suggest that Mount Augusta has that kind of liquid wealth, collectively, several times over.
No one ever talks about being responsible for the adult they become. Every action, memory, punishment, reward, and decision will impact the adult they are becoming. Their self esteem, future, spouse, the way they raise their kids....is because of every decision YOU made.  Then there are decisions they make because they are human and have free will but those too you will blame on yourself. I have intense anxiety about this all the time.
&gt; Biggest draw of religion is the "what happens after death issue"I don't think that's fair. Most historical religions have pretty dissatisfactory answers to that question.
Those are the accuracy bonuses, only the strength bonus and your strength level determine your max hit.     General rule of thumb is the scimitar is best for training, having good speed accuracy and strength bonus.

You guys have Barnes all year round, we have to put up with Greg Martin all year round. They are basically they same person, wild claims that the Kiwis are past it and each time they open their mouth they are wrong. 
The thing is, the cultures that practiced that sort of polygamy do the same thing when they're monogamous.  So that doesn't seem relevant.  Looking at modern polyamorous (not polygamous because it's illegal) families, we really don't see those traits at all.  I'm thinking here of the poly scenes in major cities... San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Boston, and similar.

I'm very happy to know you're ok Ms. Subzerogazpacho. So now we know it's astral. That means salt blasting is temporary. It will reform at some point since salt and any similar items only displace them once they've destabilized. Seeing how it salivated means it's weak. Feeding on your fear and despair until strong enough for a bigger meal. Once you stop being afraid it will leave. Just remember the salt. And whatever it shows you, don't trust your eyes. Shades use illusions to feed. Other than that. Sounds like you'll be ok.

What is the problem? Because some people actually like this idea Riot put out? Crazy how people have different opinions on things and some people like the colors. People WILL buy anything Riot releases you're right because there's always going to be someone who's favorite champion gets a skin or a skin someone just LIKES that they release and they will buy it. The same goes for these chromas. People like them. People will buy them.
Heyyyy I'm graduating next month! I'm excited and nervous at the same time.And as far as what's going on in your life, me and my ex started talking again and I'm actually really happy. It's been about 7 months since we've talked and I'm just anxious to see where things go from here.
That's very kind of you. Videos and Funny can be a scary place to post in, and sometimes I second guess myself on sensitive issues because I know there will be people yelling at me and downvoting to oblivion. But I decided that I don't care about that anymore, and if anybody gets to see what I write and appreciates it then that's all that matters.
Es wurde schon mal Hearthstone gezockt am Blizzard Tag mit Daniel. Die Folge wurde selbst nach über einem Monat nicht auf YT hochgeladen, auch nicht nachdem ich darauf hingewiesen habe.Du siehst an dem Beispiel wie viel Interesse bei den Bohnen an Hearthstone vorhanden ist.
Hey yea i do know all of the stuff you just mentioned except for controlling destillation column, feedback control loop and seperation process control i think i will be taking those courses in the up coming semester and i also believe we dont get trained to use CAD in here.
Yeah. This sub is like grindr. People claim not to be fem and be just a regular bro to hang with until they insist on watching bravo all day and just watch sport to perve. 
Pretending it is Friday and blowing off some steam about work. I have/am consumed/consuming:-top shelf margarita-enchiladas from Sylvia's-quarter of a bar-one blunt-two bowls-a beer-and some motherfucking sweet and sour stripshttp://imgur.com/OMnVbuFAWWWW YISSSSS
Formally?  Not without an official company-sponsored event.Informally?  Every team's a little different, but I know there's at least one with a team keg.
TBH I can't stand her music but goddamn I'd be lying if I didn't say her makeup and outfits weren't amazing. I don't own any NARS but Im jealousss! Someday I'll try their blushes / lippies.  * _ *Ruby woo gang till I die tho.
IMHO, it was pretty easy. It could have used an option or method of making it harder.Calling hardcore players "hardcore" is an understatement.Edit: From 6 karma to 0.  Casuals get pissed. 
thats a very confounding  way to make a comparison considering some SJW's would also be represented in the both the category "white people" and black people.. You are maybe not so good at this form of illustrating a point yet. Let me help with that.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding
I grew up in filth like this.  It's disgusting and humiliating.  You can never invite friends over.  It's sad when the child is the cleanest person in the house.
Fletcher was sold, Cleverley will be sold in the summer. Mata isn't a CM, Carrick is soon to be 32. Fellaini isn't a natural CM. We definitely don't have depth at CM, hence the reason why Rooney has been forced to play there.
I don't know why people are hating on these figures so much. They're just simple vinyl figures that look cute. No harm in it. I have a bobble head of Baby Groot from *Guardians of the Galaxy* and the Alien from this set. Both look great and don't have any paint job issues. If it's not for you, it's not for you. There's no need to make a big deal about it.
This reminded me a lot of the onion's video:**[BREAKING: Hundreds Feared Dead In Coors Light Party Train Crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLQLS93ba3I)**
I put horseradish and mustard on my hard boiled eggs. I mix hummus and cottage cheese (is that weird or not really?). Let's see.... Cheetohs in salsa and/or queso, malt vinegar on everything, canned tuna straight ( not a combo but apparently it's the norm to use mayo so a deviation?)... I'm sure there's others but I can't think of them...
It's surprising that there hasn't been a Goldfrapp LSFYL yet. Then again, we got a Kylie lip sync for the first time in RPDR history this season, so I can wait another season. 
They already earned CP as they went though the VR levels. That's what I'm getting at. That 13m exp required to go from vr1 to vr14 has already gone towards champion points.
The industrial hemp think for me is huge. Such a HUGE industry going to waste with all of the textiles, oils, paper, etc using the strongest natural fiber on earth. Hemp is even stronger than bambooSource: minor in paper engineering 
Amen. That's what made the whole thing so unbelievable, almost every alleged cast member was a hugely popular name on wishlists, there was no way they'd cast all of those queens together
Ahh the stock turnigy 20 amo esc, there's your problem. Stock firmware goes out of sync at any rapid throttle change. Mine would just randomly flip my quad until I flashed them, but since getting SimonK they've been amazing! Flashing them is a big pain in the ass though...
Confident I see. Maybe I have made a terrible choice to face a legendary undefeated Defense attorney. who knows? maybe this thread will end with your first argument
We would walk like emus, if you can be bothered there is a gif somewhere of an emu running but the gif is reversed, and it's exactly how we move our legs
Especially since if it's your first time playing, you won't know about merveil and her cold attacks until you encounter her. So as an option, how would you know to pick it?
Be careful to avoid bouncing checks or having automatic bill payments fail.  The fees for those can be pretty high with large banks.I can't really answer your main question without additional information (see the above questions).
Isn't science still up in the air about how much weed really affects one's ability to drive?  So it actually may be the case that if this person puts down the phone and actually pays attention that he or she is less of a road hazard when high.  
You can usually get around 2 competitive shinies (or 1 HP comp shiny) (with hatch thread proofs) for a typical bank celebi (since yours has a good nature and IV spread, you could probably get more)I have no issue getting the venusaur for you, but like you said, you are kinda ripping yourself off.  is there anything else that you may want that I can add to even the trade?
As someone from Iceland, I can confirm that none of what you said happened :p We protested a lot sure, but come last election the same goodballs got elected again pretty much. Sad but true.
I feel like these SJWs are just making up privileges based on their own jealousy. Everyone in the USA has "education privilege". I actually am quite privileged in the US due to being poor, and so the government is paying for my education. My white middle-class cis-gendered male boyfriend has to pay for his own education due to how much his parents make, and I get it all paid for because my parents make nothing. I think that's an unfair system, in my personal opinion. 
She tilts her head, looking at the boy as though he's slow, "Do you not have ears?"  She points to the pine tree, "see this?  It marks the boundary.  Monsters can't get past it."
Being a support SnS there isn't really a recommended weapon since you're there to heal for the most part. Although, I would suggest status weapons (I use the Nerscylla line myself) Once the monster's asleep, paralyzed or getting hit by poison, heal the team! Don't leave anything to chance, heal as much as possible and needed (hence why I bring Mycology along for extra healing power)

There are a few species of myriophyllum native to SA bud, although very few available in the trade(likely because they are not anything I'd consider "ornamental").  Keep looking at videos and you'll see it here and there :).  What I commonly use in my exhibits are Parrots Feather(*M. aquaticum*) and Filigree Myrio(*M. mattogrossense) both of which are SA native.I'm a plant guy and couldn't ID what species I saw(most of which was covered in a film of algae).As an anecdote, Karen Randal(judge for AGA) went on a previous Piaba expedition several years ago and was equally mystified by the plant.Yes sir, beautiful thanks for sharing :).
Of course you know it all by personal experience,go ahead and tell me every detail of it,perhaps another muslim raped you and you feel all this anger which makes you getting more dumber than the rest of them.
It's the original unreversed for me, so I think you got it right. Other people are either messing with you, or maybe it's the mobile glitch (I'm not sure what causes it, but mobile users sometimes report being linked to some other random image on imgur :/
Do you think if I refunded it entirely complaining that the function key light stopped working they'd forget about the 15% restocking fee? If that's the case I'd be more willing and able to go get a XPS 13. 
Going to disagree with the other commenter and tell you what the tire people will tell you as well. Unless the tires you have are relatively new in wear, it's recommended that you replace minimum two tires, and put them on the front for a front wheel drive. Sure, you can get away with less, but it's not safe if there's a significant difference in wear.As for where, I always get my tires from Discount Tire. They have a good selection, can get others they don't have in stock, and you can get a final price without any surprise add ons. In my area, they have four tires in stock that size, one of the brands being a Kumho for $50 each.
I drive around high all the time. I've been smoking daily for like 2 years now so I'm accustomed to the effects to say the least. Obviously for me driving high is no different(I'm sure people will say I'm probably swerving all over  and don't know it) but for some new smokers driving high is basically the same as driving drunk.I've never driven drunk but I'll admit I've driven around on LSD and shrooms before. I expect some hate for that, and while I'm not justifying it, I will say driving abilities are less  impaired on LSD or shrooms than while drunk. (But still impaired, and more so for some than others)
In Maine, the SNAP program changed the rules, so to collect, if you are childless and without disabilities, you have to work 20 hours a week, OR volunteer OR be in a job training program.about 80% dropped out.  So we could try what Maine is doing.  If the labor force participation rate would get closer to full, than prices would drop across the board.  $7/hour might be a livable wage again.
Hey, sorry for the slow response. I haven't done the tracert yet because I'm a bit busy, but I'm not on Wifi, I use Rogers cable internet, and I'm in Canada. The ping numbers are fine, just the spiking and ping loss is incredibly difficult to play with
When sweet potato fries were such a huge trend, it was awful. Every restaurant you'd go to wanted to up sell you to sweet potato fries over regular fries. Why would I want to pay more to go from something salty and crispy and delicious to something sweet and mushy?
Yeah, I mean, it looks like a -sorta- shitty OC. Like, if the person behind it was okay it'd be tolerable. Not insta-nope on nearly the same level, but still pushing it.It's a thing of beauty.
I'm living out Hibike Euphonium. Currently at the spring show of the brother school to perform soon.In other news, I'm valedictorian :) my class is super competitive so that was an honest shock. Any other high school seniors here?
&gt;Imagine after a murder the mayor came out and said "well, walking home alone is an invitation for someone to stab you."In some cities it is, and mayors make comments just like that. Like the mayor is wrong for implying that people have a significant chance of being raped while walking around at night, and for implying that only women should worry about the dangers of walking around at night, but he's not blaming the victim. He's needs to be educated about rape and nighttime safety, but he's not victim blaming.

&gt; So what's the difference between that situation and him open carrying?A. Before he starts (and gets worked up), I can tell him we don't allow loaded guns in the store and have him come back later.  B. I know what I'm dealing with right off the bat, I can send a minion to go call 911.But mostly, I'm gonna stick with my reply to /u/CrazyIvan101 as my reasoning.  EDIT:  So, it's nice to see that having a polite discussion in this sub gets me downvoted.  It's not there as an "I agree/disagree" vote, it's supposed to be for whether the comment adds to the discussion.  I actually upvoted the people that were discussing this with me.  To downvote just because you disagree is childish and churlish.  Way to go New Hampshire, make me proud to be a native son!
I've literally never tried sugar dating before, and I had no idea that was even a thing that still happened outside of 50 year old guys with midlife crises looking for an 18 year old to make them feel successful again. so TIL.And Yeah I try to be nice, but it's not really nice to promise money in return for a service then never deliver? I do think it's harder to be a jerk up front to someone rather than over a webcam.To be clear, I'm 26 and a lot of guys would immediately suggest I was "past my prime" when it came to stuff like that.
I'm dating 3 people. One I met on OKC. Married polyamorous woman. Been seeing each other for about 6 months.One was Tinder. We chatted briefly a few months back, I ghosted for no very good reason, then reopened the conversation after going on a date with a terribly boring woman who's ex-husband was dating her - I realized I was on a date with the wrong woman so I fixed it. That's been about three months.The third is my yoga teacher. A few weeks now. Probably won't amount to much but she's sweet and kind and smart and pretty.
I love Ratchet and Clank but that's not the vibe I get at all.  Ratchet and Clank is single-player focused and your guns upgrade and gain experience as you kill enemies.  This is multiplayer focused where you'll unlock different guns by playing people online.
Yes, scimitars are best used with slash. Daggers/swords are usually meant for attack, but you can really use anything. Use scimitar for strength if training that, its usually the best type of weapon in each class (Meaning like bronze,steel, black etc).
no, we are either Dipper spouting crazy theories as you said, or we are Mabel, creating lots of fanart and shipping various characters with each other.
They can very easily OTK also. With bond it's basically just a matter of getting 2 Ulti-Apelios and a clear field, which is easy to do with steeds and the dolphin.
I have never, nor do i ever plan to, buy gold. But ive heard stories about people borrowing money from friends, and getting canned for it. I only borrowed the initial 10m so i could buy magic logs in slightly larger bulk, having only had maybe 2m before that. The stranger just handing me 50m cash was definitely weird, but as i said, completely random. i paid back my friend his 10m since yesterday, but i still dont feel comfortable passing larger sums of cash back and forth like this.
You seem like you know what you're talking about so I'll ask. &gt;I add another channel which is just the score, adding more power to the sound. This replicates the IMAX mix, the way Nolan wanted. The score overpowers some of the dialogue though, so I say proceed with caution if you like the script. I saw the movie in a true IMAX experience at the Henry Ford in Michigan. I couldn't understand half the dialogue and it really bothered me. For example when TARS makes his first joke during launch. Some of the theater laughed and I thought I missed something. This happened a lot during loud portions of the movie. I bought the Bluray and on my sound bar I heard so much great dialogue. A lot of other people told me the same so  thought maybe my theater screwed up the sound levels somehow. Now I read your post. Why would Nolan want me to see it in the theater, but not hear the dialogue?
people complain to much, ive been working in a cubicle for the past five years, the job is great, the work is great, and the people are great. i dont understand this stigma with office work and cubicles. 
I am.  I trust google to provide a better user experience than some team of after school hackers.  Things like enabling a half baked double tap to wake feature or disabling encryption that provides no perceptually discernable performance gain are not interesting to me.  What is interesting is a swift clean and stable experience and stock nexus has always been about delivering those ideals. On my S3 it was necessary to root to get away from touchpiss but on the nexus 6 there's no reason to bother.  Its much more effort then its worth even if the mod devs can actually provide a marginally better experience.
Thanks for the pointers! It's been a bit hectic trying to figure out where everything is in the sea of options. I'll keep the backstabbing in mind haha
The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances.
I agree with you, but my uncle once bought a puke brown/green hatchback. Was strait up ugly. He got a discount for the ugly color. Idk if I have that commitment
Yeah, I know Harmonies is both a lower-hanging fruit and a more commonly used feature - that's why I list it higher. Personally we rarely had people wanting to do harmonies, thus I prefer Keys, but I wouldn't want to have Keys at the expense of Harmonies because of the greater good.
Kansan here, I don't think most natives associate it with politics. It blends in just like any other town name and loses its other meanings in that context. 
You are right, they are not what gaming needs, but it's what the developers want to make. So what if they want to make a game with all-male cast? It's their game.
Once you know the game enough, you can deal with them but for your first 3-5 characters, it's insanely difficult. I remember my first character I was SO frustrated and pissed I stopped playing for like 2 months because I didn't even want to try anymore after getting destroyed on Gardens alone.

How squishy are they in hard cornering? I've been debating on a set of the Team Dynamics 15's with Grabbers. I do a lot more fast rally-style driving than slow offroading though and I'm afraid the big sidewalls on 15's will be too squishy. Maybe I should go with 16's instead.

I've met so many people in my career as a software developer that remind me of Daniel Conley.  They're typically the out of touch Project Managers and CEO's that have no idea how algorithms, math, software and reality work.   
This is wrestling has always bugged the shit out of me. Of course it's wrestling. You paid the money to watch wrestling. I would understand if you were oblivious going into the show, but you most likely knew you were watching wrestling going into it.
This is like when I get an error at work that says something like "please contact the administrator." Damn it, I'm the administrator and I don't know how to fix that...
Yeah, but he gets an extra point. At level 3 he has defender, weapon focus: ruffian, and the ability that boosts the endurance regen. At level 2 he will only have the endurance regen boost ability.If you manually level him up to 3, you can only choose defender, and not weapon focus.
No, while the ping would be better for all players, the regions themselves would be less competitive because the player base would be split. If you have, for example,  half the challenger players move to another server, then less skilled people would fill the slots, etc. and your server wouldn't be as competitive.
Doing a big touchscreen table app right now for a client trade show . Recommended WPF because there were 3d models involved along with a ton of complex animations and I figured helix toolkit and Blend would help a lot there. Also considered Kivy (which I would have preferred from a dev perspective), Universal XAML apps, and Android but at the time none were really the right choice for various reasons.
or that Asian-Americans do better statistically in education, jobs and follow social rules  (no crime, no divorce) at a higher rate but European-Americans still have more control and power then maybe our merit society is not as influenced by merit as it is by white privilege :0
I'm super rosey too - I have mild rosacea. I've noticed a change in the morning by not putting my face under the shower stream directly (I use my hands to soften the stream if I really need to get soap off my forehead or something), taking less hot showers, and then just washing my face quickly with lukewarm water at the sink afterwards. Have you thought about changing your cleanser and moisturizer? That might help with the redness too. I use CeraVe foaming cleanser but they also make a hydrating.On the make-up front, I use Revlon Photoready Concealer and Everyday Minerals powder foundation. I've heard Meow cosmetics powder foundation is also really great (they have light, medium, and heavy coverage formulas) which I'm going to test out soon.Good luck! :)
This is why the Eagles shouldn't do the deal, the asking price is way too high for an unproven commodity. Roll with Sam this year and build the team around him. Chip said he wouldn't mortgage the future for a single player, if he does I can no longer in good faith trust anything he says from here on out. Maybe it's a smokescreen? Maybe Chip's balls are bigger than anyone thought possible? Who knows, it'll be interesting to see what they do.
The day my mother died suddenly, I found out that both she and my dad had been married before. On top of this, the "cousin" that used to come visit us when I was a child was actually my half-sister! She had stopped coming around, but I always liked her and wished she would come back. Sad part is, even my father had lost track of his own daughter (long story involving the secret they were keeping from me, a marriage and subsequent move and then divorce of my half-sister) and he hadn't able to locate her for years. Happy ending - 18 years after my mom's death, my sister contacts me out of the blue, we meet up for a tearful reunion, and shortly afterwards, father and daughter are reunited at last! We all love each other dearly and love to get together (we each live in different states.)  
It is misleading. But I don't see where they said the grandfather designed it. The title is says the Grandfather was involved in the launch. The video says he learned how to make watches from his grandfather. 
Wow, you can really tell the delay to Honolulu.  They were still watching the intro video.  That might be a couple minute lag on reaction when he gets selected. 
My wife was trying to get a caramel frapaccino and got caramel milk twice! I get you need time to learn the drinks but at least she coulda put some caffeine in it.
If you watch closely, by the time she's heading to attack him, he is also heading to attack her with his arm outstretched, aiming for her hair. It was a stupid move, no matter how disrespectful she was. The final rule of a teacher is: you are an adult, they are a child. Take nothing personally. Deserves to lose his job. 
I enjoyed the movie but didn't like how Ultron was handled. At the beginning, Ultron came across as a really intimidating villain. By the end, he just became a walking punchline (a la Loki in Avengers). Getting beat up by Hulk mid-sentence and having him defeated by a single member of the Avengers kind of negated any of the tension the film had built up surrounding the character.Also, kind of disappointed with how Quicksilver was outed. Bit lame.Besides these two things I quite enjoyed it, though I think it's inferior to the first.Oh, also why the fuck was Stellan Skarsgard even in the film? I feel like they cut out a few scenes.EDIT: Also despised the "Oirish" AI F.R.I.D.A.Y. Sounds like a feckin' leprechaun.
Not sure if mariota will be op but judging by how he is in real life I'd assume he's gonna be better than FO Wilson so if without a doubt shop him now. I would be shocked if Winston isn't as good as UL Vick/PH Wilson...his 92 card is unreal aside from his carrying, but he has 86 speed already for a dude who had a 40 time slower than Joe Thomas...
I think this is common in long distance relationships when there is no end in sight to the 'long distance' part. From your post, it sounds like you are thinking about this relationship as a potential permanent partnership rather than as something more casual/just for fun. The scary thing about that is that means you're a ways away from your goal in the relationship--a long-term commitment. If it doesn't feel like you're progressing toward that goal, that can make you question the relationship. Your relationship might seem stagnant right now. It sounds like the two of you have reached a point where you are very emotionally intimate, so that part of your relationship isn't developing much over time anymore. Because you're in an open-ended LDR, your relationship also isn't developing much physically or in terms of practical commitments ("after I finish school, we'll move together to city X," etc.).Do you think that is what the problem is, or am I way off base? (Be honest.)
Not a problem. After I went up and read the advertisement post, it was a valid question.Toxic is great on the server (lead Dev) but I suspect he missed his aim with the advertisement. xDThe website is currently being redone by a pro, it should have a large features page and generally look awesome. These features are still evolving and until the core is open we're at the mercy of the swgemu team for some basic mechanics.
nope.... not a scammer.Just because he blocked him and didn't message him doesn't make him a scammer.It's a trade offer..... If the agreement was set that he would buy the  KS one, and the guy put the non KS one up in trade and traded it, that would be a scam. Your friend making a mistake doesn't make the other guy a scammer.
I've recently fallen into the same unmotivated funk. Got a PS4 over Black Friday and managed to finish Alien: Isolation and TLOU (but none of their respective DLCs). Since then, I've been bouncing between PT, GTAV online, and the various free idie games and spending more time reading reddit about the games than playing the games themselves.  I definitely think having too many unfinished games in my library contributes to my problem, as well as, having 3 young kids to look after. I recently bought The Walking Dead Season 1 but haven't even started it yet. I think I need to delete all my unfinished free games and just focus on one game at a time...all except for PT, that is. Somebody should start up a game club/reddit sub for us unmotivated gamers! Like a book club, only geekier.
Honestly RS3 is so convenient for skilling between bank presets, being able to put items on the action bar, and just the ease of leveling some skills now.
Good point. So its pathfinder, and she's an inquisitor infiltrator dhamphire (spelling not my strong point and I can't be arsed to look it up).She was born to a human mother who took refuge in a temple to a lawful good god when she found out her child would be half vampire. The character was raised by the temple as a zealot, but the fact she was part vampire led her down a darker path. Now she does the dirty work of the temple, infiltrating groups and destroying them. She's passionate about her religion, but is battling the fact she enjoys the pain she causes.That was what I have so far.
AA is a joke on the magrider. dont bother use a lightningfor anti-tank run it as a slightly bulkier lightnign: with lower DPS but higher armour and profile
This is crap.  If he was treating you like a partner in your lives together.  Where you each fill a role and your part was just as important as his, and most importantly you wanted to do this, then fine I could see it work.  Sounds like he just wants a personal assistant and what's worse he just discounts your feeling.    
Subreddit oriented trade. Basically I send beer to someone and receive it from someone else. Basic information is given (address, beer preferences, etc...). The matches are pretty random with an attempt to keep people as far apart as possible to prevent overlapping distribution.
Lol, while my group was being trained, one blonde girl, (I think her name was Hannah or something) walked out on her break and didn't come back. Guess you weren't the only one
Well that's an awfully academic view of it, and probably not all that useful as far as advocacy goes, but if that works for you then I suppose I can't really fault you for eating less meat. But for what it's worth, I think it's a bit insane to try and make your pets vegan too, especially cats. 
Tech Support Inner Monologue&gt;Really you aren't comfortable doing it by yourself? You can obviously read, do you just have a fetish for reading to people. Stop wasting my time and click next. 
That's all valid too!!! I just honestly can't believe how much people have ripped you apart for this post. Not sure if they're just not fit/active to begin with or think you should just let yourself go or just not care how you look or what. Attraction is really important. I think just address your concerns with your husband and that will help a lot.
Roger says yes, but most of the footage is pretty dark. He said it could see a remaster and release someday. David says only a few songs were filmed (Hey You, this one, Another Brick In The Wall, Mother etc…). I'd tend to believe Roger on this one considing it's his project.
This is the kind of post we need more of on this Reddit!The gameplay looks a little more like Zelda than an adventure game, but it does look great :)
Because restaurants want to be recommended on popular foodie blogs, and baby food brands want to be recommended by popular mommy bloggers. The personal tone of personal bloggers make their recommendations more powerful and "genuine" to their audience.By the initial definition of blog, Kotaku is not a blog; it's just a news site that doesn't even try to remain factual.
Ah thats great man, thanks for clearing those things up. So its not so much that he rejects the self, just that the self **is** this (psychological) continuity. I am contrasting the view against Bayne and Dainton who come up with the Phenomenal continuity account of personal identity, where the self is an ontologically separate thing to the (phenomenal) continuity, but cannot be separated. So im trying to argue that if it cannot be separated then it would look like, from the outside, that they are the same thing, so whats the point in postulating a completely different self?
Although you don't get the full amount, there are services out there that will exchange gift cards for cash. In fact a number of local Giant Eagle stores have self serve kiosks for this.
Nice, thanks for that. I'd really like to see some FCAT charts comparing the i5 to the FX in these types of games. One of the biggest differences I noticed from going from an FX8350 to a 4790k was the complete absence of any kind of framerate dips. Intel CPUs just feel SOOO much smoother, while only seeing a gain of 10-15fps. 
Wait for the BM ursa mini! It ships in July. https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagicursaminiThe c100 mark1 is great (I've been shooting with it for a year) but you can't beat the ursa mini at that price point!
We should just do a reddit meetup there. Hell, most of us are probably going anyway. Regardless, I will. I will be the fat old guy. Shouldn't be hard to pick out...right?
About to finish my last day of training at my new job tomorrow. However as great of an experience it has been so far, I am not confident that I want to continue doing it. There is nothing wrong with it at all, I just so not feel like it is a good match for me. :/ 
It sounds like she thought you would "get over" being child free, have a kid, and then boom you are eligible for surrogacy.Do sorry you are going through this OP. I would let her go through her tantrum for a few weeks, then maybe send her a letter via your mom telling her you love her, you're sorry for her grief, you made the best choice for you, and you're ready to be sisters again if she ever is.
Courier - Drive around all day delivering stuff. Sure sometimes someone wants something somewhere in an unreasonable amount of time but what can you do, smile and say sure. Sometimes you can't find a place but next time you'll never forget where it was.
Well everyone sees different things. I think most comments that begin with "I'm a blank" tend to be disliked and atheists would be no exception. If someone says something criticizing a religion they rarely receive a retort that isn't an ad hominem attack.
Very nice! I made one that looks very similar (and equally gigantic) with solid granny squares and black edgings; makes it look like stained glass window panes :)
Seeing him in Germany would be great, I might be wrong, but at almost all levels they play good-looking strategic football. Spain would be good for januzaj for similar reasons as well :(

just like the subreddits fan favorite mentioning 93 ships last season, the exact same number as Vickys navy. People still had hope for ironborne shenanigans. Now if one of danys dragons is stolen this or next season we can attribute it to Vic and his horn.Nobody else has dragon stealing plot items, right?On another note I wonder which dragon will be the first to bite it.
I believe one prominent reason that horror movies tend to be "bad" is that it's difficult to get characters into the desired scary situations in a believable way. I think horror, moreso than most other genres, is subject to more intense scrutiny in terms of the audiences willingness to suspend disbelief.  "Cops wouldn't do that," "I wouldn't do that," "yeah going alone is a great idea," and other thoughts like these are common reactions to typical horror flicks because writers have to come up with ways of getting people into strange circumstances. That, and the fact that they have a more easily achievable albeit "cheap" way of giving audiences the indented thrills. You can't get tears without some serious emotional connection to the story, but you can "scare" the shit out of someone at ANY time with fast cuts and loud noises. 
I'm sorry, but you have no one to blame but yourself. If it wasn't bad enough that you wanted to read a topic dedicated to a show that ended some time ago, you read the question "what death affected you the most?", and then decided to read on. C'mon man.
To save my marriage.  I Swallowed the pill.  Lifting is important: Raises SMV, keeps me out of the house, makes my time productive, teaches discipline and the value of improvement with small steps and over long terms.  It teaches patience and the understanding that you aren't perfect, you can be better, and it develops goal creation mindsets.
I see your point maybe its just because the only time i see abathur on my time is when it's dragon shrine. I only see him useful on maps where we can force teamfights.
Shanahan has initianted his Shanaplan by giving Nonis a Shanaban  and replacing him with a new Shanaman. Leafs fans pray with their Shan-quran that he does well creating a new Shanaclan.
Well its easy, get a few hot girls and throw them in some boob armor, give them some unique weapons like the ninja turtles, and put them on the beach and shoot. Presto, sand snakes.Ironborn requires good actors, boats sailing around, cgi galore and faith the viewers can remember what the iron islands is, and have an attention span to tolerate it. They are already saying season 5 is boring and what not when its moving at a breakneck pace. I wonder when someone will attempt to adapt this series again. Could be 50 years. 
If a faded ODLH and a 38-year old Mosley came so close to beating Floyd, then there's no way he beats them in their primes.The Pacquiao fights were a case of size vs. speed. Speed won. When they were young Oscar and Shane had size *and* speed.
I think lowering the players needed and removing class restrictions was a great idea. Imagine how much less time it takes to find a game in a 12 man match as "any class" rather than finding a game in a 18 man game as one specific class there are only two of D:
http://www.usgamer.net/articles/fire-emblem-ifs-black-and-white-kingdoms-nintendo-gets-flexible  "This is where Nintendo and Intelligent Systems get odd. If you want to play the other side, you can purchase it as DLC for the full game. The retail and digital versions cost 4,700 ($39.25, probably $39.99 in the US), and the DLC will set you back another 2,000 yen ($16.70, probably $19.99). Then there's the third storyline, which will be the same price as the DLC, but released at a later date."
i am not sure why mine just piled up on the floor instead of flying away but still was funny.  all i can say is report the bug and hope tomarrow they patch and fix. till then for playing just hope to get a lucky spawn i guess it is not ideal. on a upside cryo pods seem fairly stable to respawn in.
I can't tell if they legitimately don't like other gummy candy companies, are being sarcastic, or are slightly playing it up like /r/pcmasterrace does.
So I have heard that exact quote a few times "by philosophers and thinkers much smarter than you or I."  That is something religious people say when they don't have anything else to say in support of their position.  It is totally irrelevant.  If you think someone else has said something smarter find it and quote it.  You will never hear a scientist say anything so ridiculous.Now, back to the point, distinguish between the wonders of the world being proof for a christian god vs. proof for the flying spagetti monster.  You can't because the wonders of the world are questions which are in need of an answer, not pieces of evidence that point to a specific answer.
After an appropriate time of separation from Malazan (when the hangover has wore off a tiny bit), give it a shot. The second book is my favorite of the trilogy, and it's a good trilogy. The main thing I had to keep in mind was that it was a trilogy, not a sprawling 8 book epic fantasy, and so it *couldn't* have some of the level of detail of...epicness...as some of my favorites. In terms of short series, though, it's really top-notch.
Your argument wasn't about which place should be used as an example. You essentially claimed insurance and the government will cover all the damages of the riots for business owners, and you're wrong.
&gt; Torn between saying he had a vasectomy or I was pregnant but aborted.As the taco commercial goes.... *Why not both?* LOL ;)"I was pregnant but sucked that parasite out of me ASAP. Then he got a vasectomy so we would be parasite free 4LIFE. Fuck off."
If it is after every new cert for every app then that is still pants but not something unexpected methinks. Reminds me of [this](http://www.linuxtoday.com/infrastructure/1999021500310OP) actually. Because we all want our Pi's to be minty fresh right?
Cool, then you should be able to go on and buy a bunch for less than that...  or maybe if you look at current offers you cannot buy one for less than $130.You can't put a value on parts on the lowest possible sold listings.  Most of the ones shown at lower prices are damaged or people selling fans hoping they fool someone.  
I don't know, the degree to which I expressed my recent disgust with Verizon probably shocked him slightly. He was very helpful for what I was calling for, so maybe he realized that it was hopeless.
People need to realize that, yes its good to love your body, but when you're 300 pounds overweight you need to loose some fucking weight because it's just not healthy at all.
I'm in the UK as well, just a year older and can entirely sympathise. The way I dealt with informing my GP was almost embarrassingly shy. I messaged him beforehand, and even in the surgery I read from a prepared statement.
I was watching Netflix on my X11. It brought up a little notification I could watch the draft on it. I love this thing. I thought I was gonna be stuck with ESPN. 
I did 110 miles a day for two years on a motorcycle, Downtown Riverside to Old Town Pasadena. I would recommend against getting a scooter and instead get a regular motorcycle. You'll be higher up and are easier to see and have the power to get out of a bad situation when it comes up. Get a bike with heated grips. Be prepared to buy both winter and summer gear. Wear your gear at all times, no exceptions. If you don't have your M1 license already, take the MSF course. As for a bike, I can't recommend a Honda NC700x enough. It was designed from the ground up for commuting. You can never get comfortable/complacent on a bike. You have to know where everyone is around you at all times.  I had a good time commuting via bike, but it was still a commute. After two years I was burned out and moved closer. I take the Gold Line into the office now and have never been happier.
Yes, the difference between those is that when you say "a people" it is unambiguous that you are talking about a group of people, whereas when you say "a fish," if you are correct, there is no way of knowing whether you are talking about one organism or a group of fish.  It seems like a useless word if you are correct, so I think I'll need a source to believe your claim.That is to say, there is a large difference between your examples: you are comparing three words, person/people/peoples (edit: arguably four, counting persons, which is usually now replaced by people), to two words, fish/fishes.
I seriously don't get startup clips.Why play it every time I boot the game? I personally think it should only play whenever I start a new play-through.
My older cat was terrified of the foster kittens, abd hates the 1year old cat we adopted.  yhe only time they are ever close to each other they are fighting each other or trying to get the mummy cuddles for themselves. 
Law. My law school has one of the highest tuitions. Plus it was in downtown Manhattan, so it was expensive to do anything and everything. Even lived at home for the first two years, and that didn't clearly didn't help. 
No I hope not, yusui is a very raw player, kind of like how bjergsen was before lcs. he needs to get into an org that actually knows how to develop talent, which I think c9 does. His skill ceiling however is very large.
I've done it a few times when my cat has gotten into things I don't want him licking off his fur. Not something either of us would want to undergo on a regular basis though, so I'd imagine getting them used to it from a young age would be helpful!
I'm sorry I just simply don't care that much about tips. It's not a big part of my life. I'm happy you're passionate about it. It's good to see. I just really don't care about it and I don't think about it. Sorry. 
The idea that the most recent 2 books are somehow inferior is an old and tired one. In my opinion they're just as good if not better than any of the rest of the books, and when the series is complete I firmly believe they will be looked upon more kindly.Obviously this is all entirely my opinion as I said from the start, so arguing about it is pointless. But you've raised fair points and I appreciate your thoughts.
True, but there are plenty of other things that could have gone wrong – issues they still don't know about. The same issue as CRS-6 could have cropped up on the previous test if ASDS had been there.Trying to determine whether or not it could have landed is meaningless in this context. The fact remains that unless it *actually performs a stable touchdown on a solid surface*, it's not a successful landing.
Then you pay $600.  You're risking it but out of the *cough* few I've had I've never had one come back.  Also, there are things like Probation before Judgement and deferrals that a lot of states support.  Lawyers are good at getting that stuff done.
I was paraphrasing what those tin foil hat wearing people say about the attack on the World Trade Centers being an inside job. "Jet fuel can't melt steel beams".
The fact of the matter is that people born into poverty can go to schools that are reasonably priced but they will likely still have student loan debt, and there's nothing wrong with that. And garbage collector? Just because someone is born poor doesn't mean they should settle for a job that barely makes above the poverty limit just so that they don't have debt. I have $40k worth of student loan debt. But because I got a degree I have an entry level position making $62k annually. If you say that I should have not gone to college and instead become a garbage collector or an equally horrific job, I'd tell you to fuck off.Some people don't need to go to college, but that division is based on intelligence and work ethic, not on income. And not everyone is able to work during college, myself included. 
I'm a union construction worker. And from my experience the answer to "Why shouldn't I be a slacker?" is you are much less likely to be laid off in slow times. And for the people that step up and work harder, they get promoted to foremen and superintendents. I'm sure this doesn't apply to all union workers in other fields though and the seniority system is much less prevalent in construction unions. At least in my part of the country.    
Maybe so but you can't have 450 people run a company, no decisions would ever get made, it's hard to find a single person who's proven they can handle an immense amount of responsibility. 
Get a GTX 970 (an Asus STRIX one maybe) and get a better PSU, 600W+ would give you a bit more headroom, Enermax and EVGA make great PSUs. And maybe a 850 Evo instead of the MX100.
Your extrapolation is illogical, for a start art and music are hobbies that can still be enjoyed in the sky city, just without the pretenciousness. Also art and music are merely visual and audio mathmatics 
How is it a red herring. A black person can make a girl just as uncomfortable as a boy, it's not the black person's fault, the girl has an inherent prejudice against the black person, same as towards the boy. And you don't think teenaged lesbians probably leer in the changing room? teenagers are horny and riddled with hormones, a teenaged lesbian or gay guy is very likely to be practically drooling in the locker room, just as a straight person would be if they were in the opposing gender's locker room, that doesn't mean you shouldn't allow gays into lockerrooms.You think trans people aren't insecure? A trans girl in a girls lockerroom would be very insecure and probably keep to themselves more than a lesbian.Sorry ~~black~~ ~~gay~~ trans people make you uncomfortable but you shouldn't keep em out of the locker room 'cause you don't like them
According to Toriyama's interview in [Daizenshuu 2](http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/daizenshuu-2-akira-toriyama-super-interview/):&gt;**And then the Cell arc ended. Did you think that everyone felt you would put Gohan into the leading role?**  I intended to put Gohan into the leading role. It didn’t work out. I felt that compared to Goku, he was ultimately not suited for the part.I sincerely doubt this has changed, especially since Gohan has gone on to pursue his career and have a family.
Sorry about that, something came up last night and I had to leave. Does the offer still stand though? Still need the gq and would very much appreciate it!
I'd actually much prefer history and factoids. I personally have no interest in watching dudes drink things and try to compare them to other flavors. Got old quickly for me. 
&gt; Again, that is either naive or dishonest.You like to go on about the constitution. If you read it, you'll notice a listing for the judicial branch of our government.
1. As I said, it's fine, I just personally find it to be strange. Go for it.2. The thing is, if you get it for 4 or 5 rounds, a single cooldown round isn't that important in the long run. Also remember that -1 to armour means that, should you deal 6, you'll be getting possibly 3 extra damage in. That's enough to win. Maybe even for the fire one, having it be /3 or /4 would balance it more, because that's a serious advantage to get.3. That's actually even better, although getting it to 4 could potentially be bad.4. NP5. &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;
Wow, thank you for the detail, I think that's the easiest to understand example I've read haha. You kinda really opened my eyes... not to sound too cheesy!I do really try and I do see your point that just being there for him is a big help. I just wanna give him the best life I can and make it easier for him so thank you for the kind words. You've really helped me see it from his perspective. It honestly means a lot that people have even commented on this thread giving me suggestions and trying to explain what it's like, so thank you!
So I had this nice post typed up, about being careful and taking it slow. Then I remember I topped my gsxr750 out the 2nd day I owned it.Have fun, but don't go beyond what you are capable of (the bike can do more than you, I promise), and be smart about it.
Mariota is just better than Winston: 38 touchdowns and only 2 interceptions compared to 24 and 17. He throws a better deep ball, is just as big, just as fast, and he is not a rapist piece of shit.https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2014/12/31/mariota-vs-winston-by-the-numbers/
Would love if someone could pm or email me the catalog and email for z. I heard he has the new eldar stuff already. I can provide ccon and irene info in trade
Well to be fair, being well-read probably strongly correlates with some degree of introversion. You're not going to spend a significant portion of your life reading if you're deeply extroverted. Finishing most books takes hours. Reading is typically a solitary activity.
If you care about the obesity issue then you would do something with your life and work towards lowering that obesity issue. Spewing out facts doesn't mean that you CARE about the obesity issue. All you are doing spewing facts to justify your misguided morals in order to support some coward who creeps on other people's lives while he hides in his apartment window so he can feel better about himself after getting some karma and other delusional jagoffs like you can jackoff to it.
You're right about that.  Although you would admit (I hope) that many Christians *believe* that gay marriage is sexually immoral.  Remember what my post was about.  It was to show why a Christian could be concerned with gay marriage while not being concerned with eating bacon.
I just posted something on their Facebook page. Apparently I'm not the only one this happened to, after reading some other people's comments. What a bunch of sore losers.
&gt;Equating being transgender with having autism is a potentially nasty implication. Erm, why?  Is there something bad or shameful about being on the autism spectrum?  There's nothing "nasty" about having faced additional struggles in life&gt;Minor point, but what you've just described is a very extreme situation. Trans people that 'sensitive' are definitely in the minority. Really?  It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.  It's not some cosmetic thing, they're doing it to make the pain go away because they've determined that the pain comes from not looking and dressing a certain way.
I use it without the queue and it is my first record player and im like 2.5 weeks in, I do pay very close attention when putting the needle on the record, but its been extremely easy and I don't think ive damaged anything yet, lol.
Even if everyone had all skills at level 5, people still would be afraid to buy and use carriers given how many more potential titan pilots there would be.Everyone in PL can fly carriers and owns them but that doesn't mean that every fleet is a Slowcat fleet :D
Simple trait that's as old as Hollywood itself. It's called acting and even most directors can do it well because they exist around it all the time. It's easy to pretend to be nice…as Vince mentioned, that's part of the gig and it's only part time. And to be honest, that's all the fans deserve is a part-time look at who you are if you're in the public eye. A few minutes here and there out of a month's worth of time. It's easy to be grateful and nice whenever you're being approached by people who love you for what you've created and who only want to express their love of that work. It would take a special kind of asshole to not act favorably toward those people. And we've seen it before, it's usually from very, very *very* wealthy people who just end up losing that patience and don't mind losing a few hundred fans here and there and who can afford to.For everyone else? Yes…you can be crazy and angry all over the place, just not publicly and in front of gracious fans.
&gt; Sensitive to that, not necessarily overly sensitive. "Sensitive" is used dismissively a whole lot, but if you apply it equally people aren't willing to call their offense by that same measure.In the context of the question, "sensitive" can mean "generally sensitive" or "sensitive to that". I am on the side that it meant "sensitive to that", but I can understand how people could have read it as "generally sensitive". However, I see no way that it implies "overly sensitive" or it used the word sensitive to be dismissive. &gt;In fact, let's make one change.&gt;Should the government regulate blocklists in order to prevent sensitive individuals from being offended?U wot m8? I said that the removal of the "sensitive" would not change the question. I didn't say that you can replace the focus noun with something else and it wouldn't change the question. 
Getting CP9's kick slashes wouldn't change his fighting style, it would just be a new technique. A Devil Fruit however... For all we know, he may already have them.
There's no danger of that happening since Barack Obama ran for President and won *twice* on many of Bernie's policy positions.  Obama's mistake was in abandoning those campaign commitments.  Had Obama stuck to his campaign commitments, Democrats would not have lost control of Congress and he would have achieved far more than he did. 
It's becoming normal it seems. Works fine in client, try to login on the web page and it accepts your u/p but then still shows "login" at the top rather than being logged in.
This is exactly the type of response that i was hoping for, thank you very much. You reinforced the opinions that i have made over the past couple months. This morning I decided to go to UM next fall so Go Blue!  
Thanks man. I was never like most junkies I always felt awful about being an addict but I couldn't kick it on my own. Feeling better than ever at the moment, I'll post pictures mid summer once the tren is in full force.

same thing when driving sober. Common sense, drive at a reasonable speed and be aware of other cars. Driving while high at night on a empty highway with music playing is the best feeling!
Handwriting *better* be considered personal information! There is definitely enough on that photo for that person to be identified with the right skills.
Yeah I don't remember the last time we had that kind of prospect. I was in elementary school when pierce was drafted and I honestly though rondo would be terrible in the league. He wasn't had his moments his rookie season but wasn't that great. Celtics fans can only hope for a scenario where Danny cashes in on his chips and do a complete turn around (like 2007). Maybe that's why we get excited when our team is in this mediocrity state where we have lots of assets as well as young promising players. I personally think our contending team will only have smart and thomas (as a role player off the bench). Everyone else is a trade chip with those picks. Also, you guys have a really exciting team. I really wish we could get Noel though haha. It would be awesome to get a hometown guy playing for boston. The people here would love him. Embiid could be a beast of a two way player if he stays healthy
I think the free stream on NFL.com is like a knock-off version, or at least it was last year. Rather than Rich Eisen etc you get a couple of their fantasy guys / B team going over it all.I think you need Gamepass to get the "proper" version.
League players are really bad about this. If you do something non-meta, suddenly you're an idiot noob and a worthless teammate. Sometimes you are in that instance. Other times people need to realize that the meta isn't an ironclad set of rules. There are no fucking rules.
Both are probably a bit true. I don't think Hiko really phrased it the correct way though, his motivations are just totally different from where someone like Tarik is at. Hiko has to win now because the window for him is fast closing whereas Tarik has much more time on his side. 
Again, I think people are not saying your points above.  The overall theme is that if Season 3 SKT or Season 4 SSW did the above and more, they would still shit on WE.
Siltfin is an overpriced carddraw mechanic. Usually a card like Siltfin is meant for a midrange deck, not for an early game deck. Coldlights are ofcourse awesome for Murloc decks, but since you only have two of them, they are not a reliable card draw engine. Also, it increases the chance of your opponent drawing into an answer.
None, really. These new cards are just plain awful. Fucking useless expansion. One new op card, everything else is useless with the exception of some class cards. Sadly, Druid and Zoo will stay on top of the food chain for a while. 
Not to sound like a dick, but I feel like every gun most gun owner I know own is a vanity gun. Reason being is that they own at least one, some of them many guns, and rarely go to the range more than once a year. They also don't carry, or even use them for home defense.  I can't think of any other reason they own them than to look at them and to impress their friends.
He's a forward, he's not expected to set the tempo like a CM or play like Hazard and Neymar. You could apply the exact same critique you wrote to Reus and most would still call him a great playmaker.Sometimes it's almost like Bale is punished for being so much better an athlete than most that people forget that even speed and strength aside he has freakish natural ability. Not as good in tight spaces as Hazard or at close control dribbling as Neymar But combine that with the fact that he's 80% (to pick an arbitrary figure) as good as them at those aspects of play (which is still better than the vast majority of players) and add in his freakish athletic ability and he can be just as if not much more effective, dangerous and useful when in good form. As Di Maria has shown this year a more traditional, technical playmaker/forward is much less effective than a more athletic one when out of form. 
You can't send paypal to venmo though...Sending Circle to Circle will be $100 to $100. Same with coinbase to coinbase.Yes, coinbase charges exchange fees, which throws things off. Good thing is Circle does NOT. If everyone uses Circle (or any new products with 0 fee 0 spread) you'll always see $100.

Ran 37s on stock Sport axles for over 100k KM's collectively, hard and abusive KMs too, never had a single issue. The axles under the Rubi would be enough to run 40s relatively safely, I know guys who do and see no issues. Upgrading would obviously be nice though.
Tbh, as a linguist I'm not buying this etymology. Bae comes from African American English, which frequently has consonant deletion in word-final positions - usually with /g/ and /t/ [goin for going, don' for don't, can' for can't, etc] - but I could see it happening with babe -&gt; bae. Just a deletion of the /b/ consonant sound.I think the 'before anyone else' / 'before all else' acronym explanation was just made up by white people so they don't feel like they're using 'ghetto' black slang.But that's just me!
Matias Kranevitter from River Plate. 21 years old, physical CDM in the mould of Mascherano. Watching him play, he's got great awareness and can put in those sneaky tactical fouls that Lucas is well known for.
I'm glad to help. It's good to know someone else wants to do the same as me... Well I told them telling my parents is a risk to my well being so they block Centrelink from asking them. But then it's harder to apply cause you have to have more forms of evidence and stuff... Like I'm getting old teachers and friends parents to sign off saying its a risk for me to live at home and/or my parents to find out what's going on before I leave.I think give them a call and see what happens. Hopefully you will get a nice lady like I did who was super super helpful 
I agree about the public knowledge of the gambling wasn't prevalent. But he couldn't hit a minor league breaking ball in 2 seasons, he would have never got called up. 
That's one of Falco's good moves tho isn't it? You should definitely get in the habit of using it more often if you're talking about Melee. It can even kill at some higher percents (around 120 comes to mind but can't confirm)
Nah, it's the other way around in my opinion. The beginning was the only "good" part and even then it wasn't that great.Lets just agree that Guilty Crown wasn't good.
Not an unreasonable idea, but learning algorithms can cause unforeseen issues. A dedicated attacker might learn enough about their software to know what rate of change to stay below to not trigger it, and just slowly build up.
I really doubt that it will but clearly Reddit has had its say: shut up about the Tibetans, stop talking about them, condolences will not comfort them at all. Any Tibetan leader who says different doesn't get it like you do.
doesn't the hunt happen during nighttime? and when Gehrman kills you, bam, you wake up in the morning ---&gt; hunt is over. All the tombs in the dream, especially in the arena, can probably be the graves of the hunters who have been beheaded by Gehrman before you arrived, the doll herself says that many hunters have come to the dream; something to consider is that it's normal for Asian cultures to have a cyclic vision of things, while the Western culture on average has this kind of line-event (beginning---&gt; stuff happens ----&gt; the end), I think this is one of the main differences that lead to this thread. just my 2 cents ofc
Also agree that the jewellery is probably causing it, and also saying that I have had my septum at 3mm for 2 years now and it still has its smelly days. I wear titanium septum retainers and I find the only thing that helps is if I leave one in a glass of tap water overnight. The next day the smell is usually gone.
I was just thinking about that bit of the movie reading through the comments here. I've wondered if that song is the reason I have a drive way full of old cars I'm restoring. 
I'm just happy to see some love from the crowd, we need this kind of support to get the deal done. Hope we can claw back into it and give them something to watch
Oh well I assume fig leaves are the traditional artistic device used to censor them. It's pretty clear that artistic depictions of religious figures and events can completely override the actual source material. They probably had no idea fig trees weren't around at the time when they first started popping up in artwork over hundreds of years. Art is the reason everyone assumes hell is on fire, heaven is in the clouds, angels are people with white eagle wings, god has a long white beard, adam and eve ate an apple, etc. Sometimes common depictions just sort of get in the way of things. Actually a ton of history is skewed in people's heads because they only know of the stereotypical wrong depiction such as the first thanksgiving, Lady Godiva riding naked through the streets, vikings wearing horns on their helmets, etc. 
Yes! Thank you! How and why the mods let him and all his alts get away with his rampant bullshit is beyond me. Not to mention how does Metacanada get away with obvious downvote brigading? 
To be completely honest, I looked at the newer 328i and 330i, which both had good reviews but my father( ~35 years in car industry as mechanic and sales management) has seen numerous problems with them, otherwise that'd be one of my top picks for sure :/
I told my 6 and 5 year old that the sun was just a star like you see at night the other day and they laughed themselves silly thinking about a night sky full of suns. It was hysterically cute but we will revisit that topic soon.

K-pop is not all that much different than, say, American pop music. Almost everything is just so fake. The only chance I get to see them being human is when they succumb to mental health issues.I stopped giving American pop (basically anything that goes on the Billboard charts) any ear time when the US RIAA started its nuclear war against piracy.
Is there fair and good reason for it to be an all female workplace?  If your applying to be a nurse, so few nurses are men the probability of an all-female nursing staff at a nursing home or similar is very high.  Even with out any sexism at all, select 10 nurses at random odds are you will get 10 females.Is it a teacher position?  Again so few early childhood educators are men that it's highly probable to get an all female staff.  You shouldn't take this job because of the pedo-hystiria, not the sexism of the admin.Her comments in isolation are meaningless.  The simple fact of all female staff is not.  You don't get all female staffs outside of nursing and child care with out significant amounts of sexism.  The admin may not be the sexist bigot, it may be one of the employees that makes the work place hostile to men.
Not at all. My point was pretty clear and well-stated, but it's that if everyone resisted every time a commonly used expression or trope or stereotype was called into question by offended minorities (races or otherwise) then we would be a lot dumber as a society. And would not have progressed past calling each other fags in the middle school locker room, which, when I see some of the opinions here about this topic, describes 40% of this sub's users.
idk, the last time my mom tried hitting me (maybe when I was like 10?) i slapped her arm back before she hit me, and while my dad hit me for it, she stopped because she was afraid I'd do worse next time. I blame some of my anger on the times I was hit (not punched or anything either, [until a fight w/ my dad a few years ago] usually just smacked pretty hard) mostly by him, which lead to years of pent up anger along with his random assholeishness.
depends on your location, i work at the sylmar hub that appears on OP's post. since they're shipping next day air, OP's watch landed in burbank airport and then got to sylmar.
Unless Di Ma starts seeing more of the field, I feel like United fans would want him gone. His wages and transfer fee are absolutely absurd for a player who has basically been an impact sub since February. That said, with Young nearing 30 there's definitely room for both him and Bale in the side.
Charlie's because of how sad Claire was and how everyone said he's coming back don't worry and then he also does a hero saving everyone. Also how it wasn't pennys boat
well i made this when i was bored, and it had about 10 views. since mistertime posted it here it has grown to over 300 views in about 3 hours. that's big for a small channel.

30, female, USA, princess. I started watching from the beginning because I liked Joel on *The Soup,* but then it reminded me of my community college days (only as weird and interesting as I sometimes wish they could have been; my school was boring). And then it just got funnier and funnier.
Actually, you are wrong.  :)Donner page, states it has the pt2399 - http://www.donnerdeal.com/donneryellow-fall-delay-guitar-effect-pedal.htmlInfo on the PT2399 - http://www.diyaudiocircuits.com/tutorials/pt2399-digital-delay-analog-echo/QED it's digital, and not a rebadged anaecho which is actually analog.  The yellow fall is likely a rebadged mooer echolizer.Thanks for the downvote and misinformation though, dingus.  The sub appreciates it.
Please update how the next MM goes. I'm imagining an epic movie-style montage of the two of you practicing and practicing your combos, before the two of of you face each other off.Also, ask him if you want to do doubles with him. Because 1. You guys could go by TV, 2. because playing smash bros against each other is useful when fighting with each other, and 3. It makes sure that the two of you don't let toxic opinions fester.Edit: scratch no. 1, thought T was his real tag.

Hello friend, I struggle with the hatred as well, it seems like second nature to just scream abuse at myself in my head. I don't know for sure how to stop it from happening but maybe making a point to yourself to notice whenever you feel yourself spiralling downward and see what sort of thing sets you off could be a start? Wishing you the best of lovely times.
Well, the trick is to make your food so spicy that you literally can't tolerate it at a normal eating speed. This slows down your eating and lets your "brain catch up" to your stomach. You end up eating less when you eat slowly. It works this way - It worked for me. Just remember that your goal isn't spicy, your goal is to slow down eating. The spice must flow. Don't be afraid to chug water either.
I used the otangs that are on my prophecy now on my baffle but then I put Raynes on my baffle and haven't ridden it often as I've been trying to figure out how to slide on the prophecy 
Eh, I interpreted that comment as "hahah, look at the wealthy complain about money inequality!!", which in all honesty, I think is quite hilarious. Rich people complaining about financial equality is pretty funny. 
I was on the depo shot for a few years, toward the end I really ballooned up. I gained about 60lbs in a couple months. Yay stretch marks! After i was off it for a little while the weight came off, without changing my eating or working out habits. 
Some chinese guy brought freeze mage with Malygos in it, but he had pyro,antonidas and of course alextrazsa.Malygos gives you one more win condition i guess, but if you happen to have 2 win condition in your hand already, thats a disaster.
a corporation, by definition, is an entity whose sole purpose is to conduct business within the guidelines set by society. when you hold a corporation accountable for its 'moral' actions, you are circumvention the shit that society should be taking care of
They probably would have those feats if people like you would accept them. WoG Toriyama is the moon is the same distance from earth as in real life. A ki blast reached the moon in 2~ seconds. That makes that ki blast travel at 50%~ the speed of light. Characters dodge those for breakfast. No? Or let me guess, that's just a fancalc?PIS and Outliers. I bet you don't like any scene of Goku as a child out running light, any character tanking planet busting+ attacks, or any statements of power. Fair enough, I guess the star stated to be in another nebula was actually twenty feet away.

Of course! Dragonaire would be nice! I've only just started doing EV training so I'm not as savi about what some of the better ones are, but and I haven't done any breeding for IVs yet :( But I do have some with good natures. I can give you an Adamant Charmander, or I've got some Eevees with natures for some various eeveelutions, like I've got a timid one and a bold one. I could do a bold squirtle, too. Some of the pokemon I already trained for good natures though aren't great, and I used them just because I liked them haha. If you've got something in mind let me know, and I can check if I have it with a good nature :) Also, I just added you :D
Wasn't Devin Westin a civilian. The weird thing about GTA V is that other than the douchebag son and the bimbo daughter (who are both indestructible), there's no other kids in the entire world.
I think it was clear the missiles were launched and hit earth. Tranzit is a result of it. Origins is weird because it was supposed to be events before everything but there is alot pointing to it being an alternate dimension or story. We see in the trailer for bo3 that the zombies have yellow eyes and that they are wearing ww1 army helmets. It looks like it will o4 and a continuation of origins.
He called... actual terrorists, y'know - people who make bomb threats and such.. terrorists. Which you would know if you'd actually listened to the part of the conversation in question. Using a word to describe people who fit the word isn't Godwin's Law.

[Technically though, Cingular was AT&amp;T Wireless and the post monopoly break up main AT&amp;T branch before that and the giant AT&amp;T/Bell telephone company before that.](http://subjunctive.net/klog/images/2008/Att_history.jpg)If you go back far enough, AT&amp;T, Verizon and Qwest(centurylink) all started out as AT&amp;T during the monopoly/trust years.  Combined, all the former AT&amp;T companies own something like 62% wireless market share and almost 90% of landlines.
No. What you could do however is subscribe, use one of your friend's referral links (not one belonging to a dick that will no doubt spam theirs here) which will give you a free server transfer. Transfer a character from your old server to your new one, and your legacy unlocks will go with it.
Which leap of faith are you willing to make?  How about a 17 year old Pakistani magnet student/athlete being railroaded by a host of law enforcement agencies, attorneys, judges and a jury.
That would be great, IMO. It would lead (usually) to brainstorming possible things to bring up to DE or at the very least a decent conversation or two.
You obviously misunderstood. :)That's why there is Teamspeak/Skype/Ventrillo. To join on same second and get on same server at same time. Works every time. :)
The question was what would be the most annoying though. If reading this so much bothers you than wouldn't it be even more annoying to have to listen to it every time you pee?
Ted from **How I Met Your Mother**. What a douche. Also, the main dude from **Law Abiding Citizen** and Tyler Durden from **Fight Club**, but for some reason those characters have massive fanboy followings that seemed to miss the nuance.

On the use of "clearly", etc.: There actually is value in using these words. It conveys to you, the reader, that the necessary steps to show the sentence is true are not complicated or extensive. This can be quite helpful.
If you can use static statistics about the percentages of hate crime offenders you can use static statistics about the percentage of blacks committing crimes versus others as it relates to the total black population...If one is valid so is the other.
We're all huge fans of Mary's solo stuff, Helium, Ex Hex, and her many other projects. I started listening to her after hearing my stuff as a teen compared to Helium and felt a pretty immediate kinship. Superb guitarist, songwriter, arranger, and lyricist. We loved touring with Mary + Betsy + Laura and are happy they're our friends! - Sadie
What the fuck ever, dude.You won't hear a god damned peep from me about it.This subreddit is a goddamned shit show. If anyone wants to figure out some of what happened, clicking on my, Knowltey, and Drape's post history shows 95% of the thread's contents, but out of order.This was a well handled situation by the mods though."There are no rules, Drape is allowed to troll and name call at leisure, this isn't /r/omaha ... you've entered the THUNDERDOME!"
;)Sometimes I just take my telescope out just to experiment with different filter combinations and acquisition/processing methods for hours. Usually, nothing worth showing comes out of it, but when it does... well, now when I think of it, this pic was also a result of playing around with filters.
I know the feeling of looking forward to a class in that way.I'm studying Maths at university but taking Japanese as an optional module for credit and I always look forward to it since it's a break from Maths and my teacher and my classmates all make it really fun. Plus it's a fun language as well anyway, though I've only been learning it for just over half a year so my Japanese isn't that good yet. \^_\^
I have seriously wondered sometimes if I would have been better off just becoming a plumber or something.  They make as much as I do, just pay union dues.  Whereas I work 60+ hours a week and send a big check to student loan servicers every month.  :(
Ok are people really considering Fame? JDF is the obvious choice! Bitch didn't say one negative thing about another queen. And when she did have a problem (i.e. Violet) she addressed it tastefully. Fame had problems with Pearl. Fame had a lot to say about Jasmine. Max WAS a good choice but her elimination edit didn't do her justice. If not JDF, I'd like Katya. Let's remember...it's not Miss Popularity...it's Miss Congeniality. 
&gt; I don't care about his psyche or solidarity or any of that. Fair enough then. I guess you aren't a Hulk fan because that is why Stan Lee created the character. To explore the psyche of a scientists who by all accounts should be a successful and happy and be in control of his emotions but is still unable to control them and the ugly side of himself. How many times do you have to be told it wasn't a gamma bomb it was just an explosion that happened to be green, perhaps because off the gases or experiments of the lab. More than anything though its just a motif for the film and to explore childhood trauma and memories. 
I won't start until 6 months (baby led weaning) but pediatrician just said we could do fruits and vegetables if we wanted at 4 month appointment. I don't think my baby is ready yet though and I don't want to divert any calories to lower calorie veges yet since she's too long and skinny as it is. 
Yeah, ended up not being worth it, for me at least. I thought the update would include the ability to have multiple user accounts on one device, but apparently Samsung's version of Lollipop doesn't have that option for no reason I can think of. Kind of pissed about it.
Wonder if there was a little altercation starting as the game went to commercial break. Looked like fans starting getting up and cheering, and Dunleavey and the Bulls looked over towards the Bucks  bench
This picture is sort of correct, but the person should be fatter. Also, don't begin to assume it's gender, because transfags. Not enough triggers as well.

As a member for over 10 years.. it's one of the best general discussion forums but the quality varies wildly. The reason I'm still there is they allow single-topic 'megathreads' which run for thousands of pages - e.g. the boardgame thread or the league of legends thread. Very few places offer that sort of continuous discussion about specific hobbies where you can actually get to know people and it's not *totally* overrun with teenagers.Having said that you need to do a lot of curating and figuring out which bits you like. Some parts of it are (intentionally) very unfriendly.
not sure if this was a dig at me, or watch snobs in general, but i do not own a rolex or anywhere close to it. i have a $500 steinhart and my first watch, a ~$250 armani exchange quartz.. 
hospitals are very frequently very shitty places to be when it comes to treating the suicidally depressed, often doing nothing more than locking them in a well lit room under camera surveillance with a hospital bed.this is is hardly a victory just yet.

I think that @DutchessArcher and @niliti summed up what I thought pretty well, but I would like to add one more thing: political incorrectness.  All of them, especially Clarkson, say what ever the hell they want.  This results in pure honesty that is great to see in this dishonest/politically correct world (and it's sometimes funny).  It's a rare thing to find today; that's what makes Top Gear more than just a TV show.
Shit won't happen until the infrastructure is top notch. Between WV shithole roads and daily road construction in PA we can kiss any substantial growth goodbye.

I've played and enjoyed Hearthstone since closed beta, and I've never spent a single second on WoW. The game has plenty of charm and character with needing a knowledge of WoW lore to appreciate, and it obviously isn't a disadvantage to have never played WoW when it comes to how easy the game is to understand, so I never really think about the two being related!
Remember when Vaz Te, Maynard, and Baldock were killing it in the Championship. You have to be weary of spending top dollar on lower league strikers. Hooper only just found his feet this season. 
Urgh... it's hard for me, because I am wondering if my vote for Miss Fame may be my inner-stan influencing the vote. On one side, Miss Fame was supportive through Katya's struggles, got Violet out of her shell in episode 5, was very kind and complimentary about other contestants... never lowered herself to rudeness and never meant harm.On the other hand, Max and Jaidynn were absolute *sweethearts* as well!I think if I included stuff outside the season, I'd throw my vote with Miss Fame. If I restricted myself to things only said on the season itself, it would be either Max (for building people up) or Jaidynn (for being forever friendly).Katya also... but the only thing that makes me a *lil* bit hesitant with Katya is that she does tend to kiki with bitchiness and does sometimes come across a bit as Ginger Minj's background vocalist when she's being cunty.

His accent is really interesting, his English is totally perfect but there's something where you can tell its not his native language that I can't put my finger on. At first its not obvious but the more you listen to him the more you hear it.
Ex-churched here... Not ex-Christian. I once had an experience where someone was praying for me and she put her hands on my belly and suddenly these words flew out of my mouth. I had zero thought, zero pre-meditation....was not even thinking about speaking in tongues in the slightest. That was my only organic experience. All others were more forced...was told to do it as a form of spiritual discipline.
Many of them are sock puppets. Many of them are promoters (5% commission). I'm sure many of them are real people who are hyped, but to care enough to drop $160 on something but not enough to take in the larger environment into which is being released (OSM/FL) seems like a stretch. Ignore the hype. 
You haven't missed much, most of them are still to be determined!Brynden Rivers being the Three-Eyed Crow is a pretty important one that was confirmed. Coldhands not being Benjen is one that was debunked, although not by anything in the books.

I would use the wedding websites (Weddingwire, TheKnot, maybe even Yelp and their Facebook page reviews if applicable) to look up photographers in Connecticut and go with one that has positive reviews and look at their portfolio on their website. Most photographers I saw in CT charge no extra travel fees within CT. I don't think photographers would really mind this type of job, and you would just explain how long you want (I'm guessing 3-4 hours?), where, etc. 
for most of them, it's best to buy them.  I borrowed only for the biggest collections like Pittsburgh, Chicago, Washington. You should try to do more. They are really worth it.

Why are people shocked this kind of thing is happening? This is what happens under martial law. And until it's clear that protests and rioting has stabilized it won't be lifted. 
Loved it when I lived there. Great vibe, but be responsible about your safety.  When people would ask if Vine was sketchy, I'd say, "For the most part it's fine if you use some common sense.  You won't find trouble unless you're looking for it."Plus, its halfway between campus and downtown.  I miss it, but when my first child was born, I moved in favor of something a little more tame.
I'm not really sure I get where you're going with the "be confident" portion of your response.  I don't really see what you're talking about with respect to politics or the "decisiveness" comment.

Cloud chasing with a tank is difficult right now. They're getting better at the dripper experience, but we still have a ways to go. Building isn't that hard, and if you really want to cloud chase than a   rda is your best bet. 
I didn't say I don't believe that. But just get over it. Niko didn't get sent or drafted by the wolves, and he didn't get 36 minutes and he had an awful stretch for a month. Wiggins got 36 minutes and put up the numbers. 
This is nice and all, but I really feel like it could benefit from some more spikes. And where, exactly, is the open-air sound system? Completely missing.

I'd actually say neither. We had OADs (Rivers, Paker, Hood) under Coach K before, but still flamed out early in the 2012 and 2014 NCAA tournaments.Bottom line is team chemistry is what wins games. We went to the Elite 8 in 2013, plus championships in 2010 and 2015, because our teams just "clicked". 
Welcome, brother.  The Draft is, for some of us, the best holiday of the year.  Every pick has an effect on the rest of the draft.  Every moment can bring a blockbuster trade.  Moments of intense excitement around our picks.  The Jets will do something stupid somewhere.Enjoy!
&gt; I even saw a "classy" gentlesir, cane and all, dressed to the nines in a way that ironically made him look like an actual magician.It would be hilarious if he was actually a perfectly functional adult who put on the neckbeard guise for weekends at the comic shop.

Thats the thing - cryptic is a crazy card,  bur the triple blue is a problematic cost in this deck. More counters feel beneficial for the deck while not really fitting in there - tough decisions to make. I really don't think I have enough experience with the deck to give proper advice here.
&gt;Well, no. You can still set privacy settings within the network so that only group members can see the content. What the email does is it permits you to restrict the potential group members to just U of T students (you aren't going to be able to check each person individually), as opposed to anyone. That's significant.Not really, not at all. Anyone will discover anything simply through UofT students, you're not keeping anything private on social media. One extra small step does not change shit.
Ah, okay, I thought you were saying the Super Guerilla XP event from BCJP was being ported over to BCEN. It's way harder but gives out up to 1.1 million xp a shot.
Yes, but the point is to have a cheater flair for a failed (cheated) attempt for every possible color. These accounts would all have purple flairs, but they would all have a different unique (and therefore collectible) reason.
This is scary in that it convinces me that this route of making an RC airplane is actually possible for me with a set of servos and some shit from lowes, which can't be good for anyone near me. OP, it is truly frightening how easy you have made both the building and flying process seem in this video. Two enthusiastic thumbs up!
To be fair, on -my- display an FoV of 90 works out okay. But unfortunately, I have several friends who use MUCH larger monitors who practically -need- the higher FoV, otherwise they get motion sick. It's basically their brains going "Hey, where's my peripheral vision?".
Cupid, Ah Muzen Cab, Neith Ullr. None of these Hunters have CC immunity. Every other one outside of Xbal has to blow their ult to get CC immunity. CC immunity on his 3 would break him. He would be fine if they just made his jump near instant like Neith's the start-up time is far to long.
Here's what I don't get about Reddit. Someone will ask a question that literally one second of Google will solve. Yet they make a post on whatever sub is relevant to the question and wait upwards of 3 hours for the answer. 
That is because you went to a midnight prerelease. Those really bring out the stereotypes.I've played competitive Magic for over a decade, and I've been in many, many different stores. Sometimes, all the stereotypes ring true. But the tournament scene tends to attract the more serious players, and I've found the tournament population is more representative of the wider population. I've played in Magic tournaments and then gone to a bar to watch a punk band play. I've been to giant house parties held ahead of major Magic tournaments and had everybody go to the tournament hungover as shit the next day. I've also discussed anime and video games over casual games of Magic. I've had all kinds of experiences.I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but please don't use that one experience to judge the entirety of Magic players.
my exact point. Invincible trinity is an amazing build. Personally I find EV trinity extremely boring, while with invincible build I can just run around care free. 
I like that there's another dog creeping in the corner with a look on his face that says...oh, i guess i'm not your best friend then...okay, good to know.
I could be mistaken, but from what I have read they define PAWS as the psychological (aka mental) and other symptoms that immediately follow physical withdrawal symptoms.  I have read that PAWS can take several months to years to full go away, but have never heard of it taking that long just to set in.  In fact this article from TheFix specifically talks about paws and according to it :"PAWS symptoms peak around four to eight weeks after quitting"     http://www.thefix.com/content/pawsIn fact, I can't find any info on just acute WD except when used within the PAWS term.  There are physical WD symptoms followed quickly by PAWS which can last quite a long time.
aw damn, i didnt think the mix/delivery was too great this week but i was hoping the switch in flows throughout would make it a nice listen at least.thanks for the feedback tho, preciate it!
I wouldn't worry too much about it. The viewership will stop declining eventually. I remember about a year ago the yogscast was experiencing the same problem. Viewership was going down and many doomsayers kept on harping about how they're dead and that this will be the end of the yogscast.  But now the yogscast is getting better and better views.  Their viewership is going back up and things are looking pretty good for them.  I think the reason YouTube groups experience this is because people's tastes change over time.  Some people have watched RT since the start but you cant expect that these people will keep watching forever.  People will leave and new people will come.  
But what doesn't make sense is the quest reward is a cloak.... they were saying the cloak is the base item. What exactly is required. How does it work.

Hello legatotheone.There is a good writeup by one of our users in the sidebar; it goes over several options dependent on what kind of gear you have.I use a slightly varied version of the star pact build he mentions there, and detail it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo3Wizards/comments/33z3sm/22_tal_rasha_builds/cqptrpv).According to Diabloprogress my 3's 60 clear is in the top 10 for wizards, and my 4s 62 clear is 24th for wizards. It easily has the DPS for higher in both cases - Got the Jailer King for our 61, and missed the 63 by about 5 seconds.
Hey that was Charlie LeDuff getting assaulted with that traffic cone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB_hjqZQ1UY, in case you dont know who I'm talking about. I think this video shows how much of the rioting was due to sheer ignorance. These kids need school not jail time.
Oh yup, yeah nah, wanted one of the proper ones, but even the TMT store would take a little too long even with the expedited shipping, was hoping there'd be a store somewhere in Auckland.  Cheers for the response though!
Amen. The Daily Mail is the shithole of shithole websites. The ads on the top and bottom and overwhelming ease to swipe to another story make browsing it on mobile even worse. Beyond that, it's like if Buzzfeed went even more douchey... And that's saying something. 
It's pretty basic, and it works. It gets kinda gross after a while, because any product you use in your brows will end up in the gel tube. But it's still good - and super cheap!
There are speculations it will be early May. Just a heads up; if you want the Ares and Ymir skins found in the Founder's Pack, you will have to buy said pack.
I think people eat more and less healthily when they smoke because lots of people time their toking very poorly. For example, people smoke in the evening, after dinner. Now you get the munchies, so you eat again. And because you're stoned, you're not likely to eat something healthy but instead have whatever is convenient(junk food). I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help. Have some fruit or something instead of doritos. But you're right, it's still not a healthy thing to do every day. 
If Germany had waited until summer of 1917 to start the unrestricted submarine warfare they very well may have won. Russia would have had their revolution and the us very well might not entered the war, as combatants at least

Its been said before, but fuck the nigerian touts of Roppongi. 6 different guys harassed me but there were many more watching. It was nervewracking. No I do not want to spend a fortune to chat at filipinas tonight. I can easily book a trip to Manila, and probably come out ahead. All the fun clubs from guides on Roppongi appear to be closed. Went to Feria and was watched by bouncers the whole time. Yay that puts me in a party mood. Finally started to talk to them because I felt like they were being left out. Fuck.
Yeah, I'm sure when they took it in they made a bunch of money. No, cash money. And they had to pay minimum commission to the sales guy. I think they lost about 500 when all was said and done. Making me think they made a lot on the trade in. And like you said, it's probably much more than they would got through wholesale

Thanks! I have no regrets about this and gonna go the distance for her, I think she is worth it.  The time is interesting with this, I'm about two to a week and a half from graduating college and she is about to start her new job after leaving grad school.  I know she does want to return to New York at some point in the future, but I also have no problem with uprooting myself and moving as I've been keeping my options open for work and of course grad school. She was also worried on our last day together that I wasn't going to talk to her anymore, but I assured her that I would do all I can to still speak to her whether it was text, call, skype, write Civil War style letters.  I hope it works and at some point we are together again not just through technology. But for the time now looks like I might be making a lot of trips to Kentucky the rest of the year.
&gt;10% from your support itemThe gold items are garbage, Talisman is good if you need disengage, if you need a speed boost engage get RG which has no CDR.If you're playing a support that builds Mikaels and you want to get Zekes then just ask your jungler to get locket. If not then you can get it as well and have 35% CDR.Don't build Morello's or Rylai's on any of those champions. Don't build any AP on Nami beyond the 5 you get from spellthiefs.
So the only thing people who don't like a certain post needs to do is to make a similar 4chan post and then they'll message the mods of /r/videos, and SJWs like yourself will bravely come to rescue and remove it.

The poverty excuse is bullshit. I grew up with very very little money, at times sleeping on a foam mat on top of a treadmill in the living room of a relative. My parents never went after government assistance and we still managed to survive. Sure we had to mow lawns and do work for neighbors to support the family and missed out on presents for holidays but there was no need to actually rob something. It's just them being greedy and not understanding the difference between wants and needs. Before anyone says "oh you grew up in a white community" no I didn't. I grew up in a predominately black community, had a gun pulled on me twice, and had a friend get shot in the head at 13 years old from a drive-by shooting where he was simply standing in front of his house. I'm really fucking sick of them using the same old excuses every day. "It's the community" "They didn't have enough money". It's all bullshit

Rock climbing!I don't know if there is any rock where you are, but I'd bet there's a gym.It can be as expensive or cheap as you want it to be. My trad rack is upwards of $2,000, but you can get into it for as cheap as a pair of climbing shoes, a chalk bag, and a gym pass.

The only time I would ever do that is if I knew the train was about to get crowded and I needed to get off at one of the next few stops after so that I wouldn't run the risk of getting trapped in the inside seat.
You'd be hard pressed to find may cars that are that light, I'd say the average is closer to 3500lbs.  I see this shit all day every day on my commute.

They were the first settlers in the area and basically carved a city out of a horrible, nearly uninhabitable desert. They did the same thing in about a hundred other places too. A very large portion of the cities in Idaho, Utah, Nevada, AZ, and several notable towns in CA were founded by Mormons during that time period.They were operating under the "if we live here, its our land" model of diplomacy and were trying to start their own country. Then the USA purchased/conquered/etc the land from Mexico and things got a little tense for a few years.
Ok, yea, I guess I just wasn't sure if those were considered cheap, or expensive missiles.   It will be interesting to see how missile heavy the final game is. With long trips and deep space exploration it seems like ballistic weapons and missiles will be sort of a luxury to covet and keep for special occasions, where as any pre-planned combat will rely much more heavily on them as they are harder hitting.  I guess it comes down to the fact that a fully loaded missile boat is way more threatening pre-combat, but could be a sitting duck afterwards, where as a couple omnisky's will always work.
A common sales trick is to act like everyone you talk to is interested in buying your product. Now that's clearly not true but it works because of the mindset it puts you in.Just because a neat mental trick works doesn't mean it's correct.
There's a lot of opportunity at the Disney parks. You're pretty much standing in line all day, it's easy to start conversation. It can get really boring and you can make it something fun. It's really easy to start a conversation there. You could also get Tinder and Yik Yak too; for when you're in between the tourist group from Brazil and a that family from 16 and counting.
What you are talking about is called [Shirred Eggs](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/shirred-eggs-recipe.html)They look quite yummy, but I'm not quite that fancy.
I had thought about that too and currently work in an office that has that set up. I love the open feel of it. The only problem is if you have multiple apprehensive children one crier will start a chain reaction of freak outs 
Let me put it another way. Not winning a championship this year doesn't decrease how great a teammate and how unselfish he is, would it? That's an intangible thing that has been there his entire career. I don't think winning a 6th ring would add much more weight to that than there's already been.So my argument would still be that winning a ring this year doesn't influence his legacy a huge deal. He's already got a great legacy and in the conversation for "best big ever". Getting another ring on a smaller role wouldn't change much. If Malone had gotten his ring with the Lakers, I wouldn't consider it changing his legacy much either.
Noticed that about Fox. It's like 'lets give the entire narration of everything then ask the most obvious question before barely even acknowledging them after they've answered the question.'V8SC do their interviews much better. So does IMSA radio/RLM.
You can't say American society rejected it when American society invented it and made it popular. Obviously American culture ate that shit up.Edit: Not to mention you expect them to know American cultural history.
Glad you guys enjoyed your samples! Ginger Vaper just recently did a pretty big blowout sale which was posted here, and it makes it easier for those who want to give them a chance to do so. I think in the end it is worth it, to me at least, to spend a little more on something I am actually going to enjoy and finish than spend less and suffer through a bottle :)I'll keep this sub up-to-date on any upcoming sales from these guys as much as I can.

Think he means Bungie has been following this theme of only allowing raid exotics to have elemental damage, whereas all the other primary exotics are kinetic. My guess is to make the raid exotics even more special.
If you're a police officer and you know that a young black man js statistically more likely to vomit a crime than a young white man is, you treat the two with different levels of suspicion. It's profiling, but that's a huge part of what law enforcement does.If you constantly stop and frisk middle aged white men in business suits on their lunch break, you're not going to stop much crime. If you stop and frisk young black men walking around residential neighborhoods in the middle of the day dressed like thugs, you're more likely to get a possession charge, etc..It's unpleasant, but it's no unreasonable.
Does anyone know the best way to buy a functioning C64?My Dad ran a very successful C64 peripheral company that went down as they did. He turns 70 in a few months and think it might be a cool gift.
I can't understand how anyone can credibly say that a team that went to back-to-back OGN Finals, winning 1 and losing the other in 5 games, and reaches the semi-finals at Worlds, after going 5-1 in groups, and winning a quarterfinal 3-1 is can be anything other than a top team.They obviously weren't as good as SSW in the end, but at season 4 worlds, no one else was even close.
For a lot of people who have asthma, one slight whiff of smoke in the air can cause their airways to get fucked for a couple of hours. Outside it's not so much an issue, you can easily stand so the smoke won't get near you. There are times when you don't notice someone lighting up or you have to walk by them (like on a sidewalk) to get where you're going and then you'll be screwed because it's either walk past them and potentially get a couple of breaths of smoke or just stop. But in a car, even with the window open, or in the house next to the stove fan, will still cause issues. Plus the stuff (cigarettes) stinks like ass hole. Pipe tobacco and cigars I can understand as they have decent flavors and can even smell pleasant to those around. But I've never smelt cigarette smoke that didn't make me think of a fat ladies ass.

Optimally, the entire turn from the launch pad to your parking orbit is done with the SAS off, and gravity making the rocket turn.In reality, you usually have to use the SAS to keep the rocket pointed in the right direction long enough to get your speed up to ~100m/s.  From what I can tell, having the correct starting TWR will help tremendously.

I have some friends who are still in high school, and one of them just recently went to prom. I asked her if she had any good stories for me. She said, "not exactly, just a ton of grinding ;)" I wasn't really wanting to hear stuff like that. Grinding is gross to me, no matter who it is. *shivers*
Obviously, there are dangerous people everywhere. But why is the onus on the victim to prevent an attack and not the person who will be doing the attacking to not attack?Men aren't mindless animals who simply can't control themselves or their penises in front of women. They're the ones responsible for their actions, not everyone in their paths. 
That's the kind of thing you'll wish someone else was around to hear. Now you'll forever wonder if it was Steam or your own brain deciding to fuck with you.

I always heard Breaking Bad was intended to be a dark comedy at first, and then as it started taking shape, it turned more and more to the dark drama we all knew and loved. Any chance Better Call Saul could take a turn in that direction, and become even darker than some of it already is?
I have no idea what you mean by "jump right in" or how such a thing would be a caveman tactic. I'm assuming you mean jumping in in a physical manner, and I wouldn't advocate escalating things like that unless it was really necessary. Being a bitch, though... That, I advocate. It's always hard to say how someone would react in the moment with situations like this, but when he kept telling her to be chill, I think my preferred response would be "This is as chill as I get. I think you need to go back to your own table." It always depends on the personality of who you're dealing with though. I wouldn't go instantaneous full bitch mode with any stranger that tried to talk to me, but it sounds like this guy overstayed his welcome when he wasn't welcome in the first place, noting OP's mention of her obvious death glare.

The biggest issue is that movies now-a-days suck major nuts.  Think about it..... Just two tickets alone will run you around 40 bucks.  After that, you have to add on the cost of the snacks, parking, and even tolls (depending on the location). That can easily pay around 7 or 8 months of Netflix.

It really is mind boggling how much return these kind of games get for the money put in. The cost to create these sort of mobile games is pennies on the dollar relative to bigger budget ones, yet rake in just as much money (and often times more).

No, the radio shack was the room on the ship where the radios were (the question was about a ship, remember).  So, room is the correct term.  Possibly the only thing about that clue that didn't need to be rewritten.  
And that's where you and I differ. I fail to see how it is theft if the person feels adequately compensated for their labor, whereas you feel that unless the person directly sells their goods or services to the market (and only the broader market), all forms of compensation are otherwise theft.

I did grind a bit, but not to the point where everyone was overpowered. Each unit I used for grinding gained around 1-2 levels between chapters. My endgame units where around level 16 promoted. I mainly used grinding for Ewan, Amelia, and Franz to get them promoted.For some reason I have a strange feeling that Elincia is white-haired...
This featurette makes me optimistic. It looks like they're really trying to do the "gradual build-up to dramatic collapse" approach that really made the first Jurassic Park so special (and wasn't replicated well at all in number 2 or 3).My main remaining concern though is that the dinosaurs have some level of physicality in their interactions with characters. The original did this great, through limited use of CGI and lots of practical effects. The up close interactions the characters had with the raptors (and other dinosaurs) were so believable. The focus in the trailers on the larger dinosaurs makes me very concerned about this.
To be honest, the mere concept of a brand rules out the possibility of true creativity and innovation; brands seek to brand things, while designers create new silhouettes and work with creating new products from scratch instead of putting any name or logo on an existing one. That being said, I think the designers that really have changed the name of fashion forever are the old (and some new greats); Yves Saint Laurent, Gianni Versace, Hubert de Givenchy, Coco Chanel, Georgio Armani and Rick Owens.

This is my first RTA coming from a Protank/Mini 2.. so I had no build experience. First time I wicked it out of the box it worked perfectly. Just built my first coil a few days ago and it's still running smoothly. And this is with decently thick max VG juice. I don't have a lot to compare it to but I couldn't imagine an easier or more forgiving platform short of an RDA.
Being chased by wolves. I really fucking love dogs, they're ace as hell.

My only CC would be to place your blush higher and soften up your brows; they're quite blocky. Other than that, I think this looks fine; you picked a really cohesive color pallette that works well for you (:
I'd imagine a lot of the random large rings were magically levitating or something back before the Cataclysm and the whole place was probably a lot more colourful. (as opposed to 99% grey and brown)
Interesting. So the government of each country should make its own laws then? Its difficult to police the internet because what's legal in one country is illegal in another. Also budget, I would much rather see my countries budget go towards healthcare, housing, catching actual criminals than waste money on catching pirates. 
The que doesn't mean anything.  Its an utterly useless number.I've had a que as high as 280 once.  I just clicked OK, selected my character again, and logged in immediately.  The same thing happens if it's 5 people or 200.  Gilgamesh or Balmung.
Good advice OP.Every poker player has a weakness in at least one of those categories.Would also recommend for players who want to play seriously to not play anything below 10NL. What you "learn" at 2 or 5NL you have to unlearn ta higher stakes where players will range you better and aren't as passive.
But all those things are what makes this game fun, if you can't do those things then maybe yes you need to find a different game.  Or just play roc strikes and crucible if you're set on playing destiny.  Not everything is going to be optimal for everyone 
"Oh, wow! So all I have to do is let you stick your little alien pecker in my ass and I'll be able to shit green fireballs?! What are we waiting for, dude! Let's go!"
Hell or High Watermelon is one of the worst beers on the market. I'd rather have a Coors light. My local bar couldn't sell the stuff, had to sell it for like 50 cents. All that said, who am I to judge? They make different things because everyone has different tastes. 
I think it's going to be a really big deal when people start realizing this en masse, and I don't think we're far from that. If Gamergate can be credited with kicking that off, that would be really goddamn impressive.
GPG lets you encrypt a file to multiple recipients. It's a single file, but it's implemented as a random bit stream which is used to encrypt the contents, and the bit stream is then encrypted with each recipient's public key and stored in the file. So you have one copy of the cyphertext and N copies of the decryption key that is encrypted with N different public keys, all in the same file.
This is a shitty life tip. When buying a new car, ALWAYS get up and leave during the initial negotiation. If the dealership really wants your business they will call you back very quickly. Then you get them to take of TT&amp;L or throw in something else. Don't feel bad about doing this cause whatever deal the initially offer is going to be in their favor anyway. 
It's actually downvoting being used as intended, to drop comments that add nothing to the discussion to the bottom.PS: some of us like the new sound.
if you have a look around you will come across posts regarding the dmg potential of mammoth hydra. long story short the higher the gr the more dmg mammoth hydra will output (high breakpoints assumed to be achieved). but meteor dmg obviously will be good in mid to high grs as that is what the set is built around.
Hey, sorry about that, something came up and I had to get off. Does the offer still stand though? I still need that gq. Would be very much appreciated!
[This is a good resource for how to set up an electric guitar.](http://www.samash.com/help/library/main/How_to_Set_Up_an_Electric_Guitar.html) You'll want to read the section on intonation. I'd recommend doing all of these steps every time you change the strings, along with cleaning and polishing your instrument, but you can do all of this yourself with the right tools/cleaning supplies. Saves you money and you get to know your instrument better.
&gt; None of the four Originalist are expected to disagree about this.There are only four originalists? Who knew. I thought this philosophy was far more wide-spread than that.Speaking of four... was it actually necessary to post four different replies to one post?
&gt;Option 3 implies that stealth aircraft are immune to being locked.I was actually going for a different angle. Lets say the missiles are reliant on radar- the larger the radar signal, the shorter the lock on time. So a Galaxy would be "easier" to lock on to than an ESF. Running stealth would add time to the lock on time, so an ESF with stealth would take the maximum amount of time to lock on to.

I definitely agree with you! Those aren't things I generally feel, and I don't feel like they would be present in a healthy relationship. Entitlement and feeling like you "deserve things" could easily lead to resentment, which has no place in a happy, loving relationship.  
It's not recommended: https://github.com/Araq/Nim/wiki/Whitespace-FAQ#tabs-vs-spacesBut if you absolutely must, this will make tabs work:    #! replace(sub = "\t", by = "  ")        for i in 1..10:      echo "Hello World"
Wouldn't Dan winning be a miraculous unprecedented win? Would that make it top tier if that happened? I would kinda love it if that happens just to see this sub burn lol

I appreciate your viewpoint, but at the same time, I own more games for the ouya than I have any other console apart from the NES. There are a lot of great games on there that are more than worth their price, I think to simply blame the developers is to ignore the larger issues that are going on here. Ouya has had its back against the wall from day one, it was thrown under the bus by the gaming press, and it lacked the capital backing that has allowed other more established companies to enter the marketplace. Blaming the developers for the ouya failing is like blaming students for a school closing. There might be a legitimate argument, but you are overlooking an important point. 
No way man, that gas would effect the cops way more than the protesters especially them being in the enclosed space. A flashbang would scare the shit out of them and send them running but there's also a chance someone might have ended up very slightly hurt, and unfortunately very slightly hurt is enough to justify a lawsuit sometimes.
I would start new gun users with a long gun.  Harder to shoot yourself or others because you are naturally more deliberate with a long gun.Having huge ammo to reload in the dark helps the untrained as well.As far as penetration, 2 walls &lt; 4 walls, but definitely don't shoot with friendlies behind your target in the next room.  Or, don't miss.
god dammit, it's one thing to be disrespectful to puppies and kitties, but the Islanders? Doesn't she know what they do to orphaned hockey teams if no one claims them?
Yes it's all foam, both craft foam and foam garage mats. Not to mention googly eyes which I used as pretty much, the poor man's rivets. And to make it look like real metal I bought a few cans of Plasti-Dip, gave each piece 2-3 layers of the stuff, purchased 3 different brands of gold spray paint, sprayed them in random intervals, then hand painted over each piece with a brush covered in small amounts of black and gold acrylic. God the helmet took about 4 hours to paint correctly, and you can imagine how long everything else took. Not to mention that the weapon still needs to actually be made. But I digress, Thank you very much for your feedback! It's nice to know people like my work.
As an ADC main if there's one thing I'm grateful to riot for doing is reworking Nidalee. Support nida just fucking vanished out of the earth's surface and surprisingly enough I didn't lose that much games because of a rampaging top nida (back when she was the ad splitpush monster). 
&gt; What I meant is that this is more than some "obsurcure UN document".An "obscure UN document" is exactly what the document I was talking about is.&gt;You can't say "anyone being neo-Nazis is the last thing that comes to mind" when the ambassador of a european country legitimising a battalion with a nazi flag.Of course I can say that about a UN draft resolution despite the ambassador of Ukraine saying something completely unrelated in a completely unrelated context in a completely unrelated place months later. There's no connection, for reasons of causality alone.That's why I don't like talking to people who bring up obscure UN documents - they're usually conspiracy nuts who can't understand how two things can be not connected because they don't understand the concept.Oh, and in case you still didn't notice despite my mentioning it several times - I was talking about the UN draft text which you misrepresented as a UN resolution and not neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
Oh, the thing behind the library? Having been to the real Smithsonian dozens of times, it was alright. Sorry I have a life and get out of the city, the county...hell, even the country more than you.
There are about 30 Star wars minifigs in the Box... R2-D2s.... several binks,  3 darth mauls, about 8 clones, and random figures.   Also several HP characters..
Stealing from people by pretending to be a charity or stealing funds intended for charity. People are afraid to donate to those in need because it may be a scam or money is getting misused. Deserves a long sentence for the indirect effects it has on the needy. 
[Yeah.  This was in primary/elementary school, and we continued to be friends until high school was over.  One of many people who I don't hang out with much anymore but still see every so often.  I'll have to ask him if he remembers this haha.](/spoiler)
Blame Amagi's lewdness on the original author. KyoAni was very adamant on keeping the sexualization as reserved as possible. Given what we were shown imagine what would have happened if the author was given free reign. KyoAni's got class.
Sorry to burst your fanboy bubble but I only buy off-contract phones.  OPO isn't a cheap phone for me because I splurged to get it.  I wasn't one of those idiots that were spending $700 in the first place to get an off-contract flagship phone.
It's efficient is what it is. Hemsworth is definitely poop in my mouth hot. Evans doesn't quite do it for me. He could poop on my chest...or like...my thigh. 
ep dmg on everything that can roll it. i think our monk had ep fist (required obviously) + the cold % 1h. i didnt look too much into the details tbh as i dont rly play monk. make sure you have ancient weapons in both hands though as ep alternates between main and off hand iirc.as for fire ally, we had mixed results with it. the little dudes are super stupid and would run rly far to aggro mobs, which sometimes prevented the optimal grouping of mobs. this was happening even when the monk was hiding in the corner (the ally range is insane). overall im not sure if its worth.
Generally speaking of course, but if your ass is starting to leak, You're either doing it wrong, or you like jamming things up there in a way that stretches your sphincter too rapidly, which I guess could be considered doing it wrong. But to each and his own.
I recommend these:  [A History of Vector Analysis] (http://www.amazon.com/History-Vector-Analysis-Evolution-Mathematics/dp/0486679101/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430438156&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=A+History+Of+Vector+Analysis)  [Analysis by its History] (http://www.amazon.com/Analysis-History-Undergraduate-Mathematics-Readings/dp/0387945512/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430438471&amp;sr=8-11&amp;keywords=analysis+history)  And if you loved Dunham's book, check out Simmons' *Calculus Gems*.

I have had one Efrideet's spear for awhile, with Ambush/Rodeo/AP rounds/Firefly. And I love it. I use it for PvP and PvE. So when I saw you could buy the Spear again... I got 3 MORE. Because I won't dare reroll my original one, but now I know that AP rounds is pretty much not worth it (it was definitely before they nerfed it). And then I want a PvP Final Round one and a PvP many shots one. And I think the default roll is decent so I store one for that.My PvP Final Round one has current roll of Ambush/Rodeo/Perfect Balance/Final Round. I don't know if Perfect Balance and Rodeo effectively "stack" but if it does, holy shit this will be like Praedyth's Revenge and have no kickback. My PvP many shots hasn't been rolled yet, but I am hoping for Ambush/???/Field Scout/Firefly. Maybe Double Down for ???.
Get comfortable and relax your shoulders. Trying to tense up and muscle your way into stability doesn't work that well. Even if you're not at a bench, having something solid nearby to lean or at least maintain a point of contact with is helpful to keep yourself from swaying. 
Yeah but he should exert a certain fear/authority as in "If I dont listen to him it will have consequences" Obviously it would be ideal if the coach was a guy everyone in the team looks up to and would listen to out of their own will and not because they have to but where do you find that for a team which consists of veterans?
Chow's is great. Geddert Twistars too. I really like MG Elite in Jersey. Their girls are awesome and I think they are going to make some serious noise going into the next Olympics qualification.Look up Laurie Hernandez and Jazmyn Foburg at MG Elite. Pretty amazing gymnasts. 
My pug is going to be 10 in May. I've tried several times in his life to switch him to a high quality dog food, most recently Blue Buffalo. He will not eat anything other than Purina One. He's a pug, he'll eat anything! Nope. One the bright side, he had never had gastrointestinal issues ever!
I work in an emergency room, this is how things go down at my hospital:Ambulance calls in saying they have this type of trauma (we will use a traumatic 3/4 amputation of the left arm in a roll over accident as an example). We get 5-10 minutes notice that the patient is coming. So we call everyone. Lab (who does the blood type &amp; screen), X-ray, trauma surgeon, etc.Patient shows up and we're all waiting for him. If EMS crews didn't get an IV, we have to establish IV access. Either way, we still need to draw the blood for the lab to test to get a blood type. Do we wait for the results to come back? Hell no. This guy is literally bleeding all over the damn place or did so at the scene of the accident.At this point, depending how bad the patients injury and blood loss is, we just start infusing the 2 units of universal donor blood that lab brought with them, along with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and normal saline. 5 min is a long time when you're bleeding to death. 
I was slightly hoping that the "is it tough?" question would be followed by somebody peddling really, really slowly into a wall and crashing very unspectacularly. 
I agree, I don't think you're 28. Probably mid 20s. It might be thrown off because it doesn't look like you have that much muscle mass, but you're definitely not 28...
Ahh the NCSHP.  Never has there been compiled a more complete group of psychopathic assholes with a severe napoleon complex.  And to top it off they give them guns!  These boys walk around with a permanent swagger that must be taught at the trooper college and have zero respect for anyone who isn't part of their brotherhood.  A permanent "us v them" mentality doesn't help matters.  Edit: a word
they cant even get legend with their main accounts in 24 hours .. forsen and kungen usually play 2 weeks to get legend .. and they play at least 10 hours a day
What I find interesting is that you give the link to the correct (or at least officially accepted) study, and even a cursory look shows that we are far from the ~200K sexual assaults on inmates that the Daily Mail claims exist. The document states that the number of inmates claiming they were sexually assaulted rose from ~6,000 (2005) to ~9,000 (2011). However, the report also states that the confirmed/verified assaults have stayed stable over the years (from 885 to 902). Even if we assume that all alleged sexual assaults did indeed occur, the Daily Mail's figures are ~20 times over the official ones.
Well it was at my university's library and I haven't seen anyone pregnant. And that didn't really look like a discharge. After a few hours it was still hanging on the toilet. 
I agree with this. I also think a lot of the perceived "grittyness" or mature situations from anime comes from the Western notion that most animated series are for kids. When in reality, plenty of anime is made for an adult audience (like NGE, Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop, etc.). This idea has somewhat changed over time, but in general anime and animated series in the West are viewed as for children, despite their target audiences. NGE in America was originally aired on a block made for kids, but was pulled before the third episode. 
It wasn't rose tyler, but 'the moment' - the device that ended the time war. It chose the outward appearance of rose tyler from the doctors memories (past and future) to act as the interface.
I know you are trying to demonstrate various aspects of the language, but it kinda felt like you were doing Clojure a disservice by making things more complicated than they needed to be.You are trying to "show the power of clojure", but the power of Clojure is in its simplicity and elegance as much as anything else. :)
Sounds like your friend was your typical nerw age warriror trying to change the world one dead kid at a time.Its not that he isnt smart or logical, he is following a trend. The whole anti vaccination movement is nothing but a fucken trend started by these smug selfish parents trying to be perceived as new age. I cant really articulate it but at the end of the day it is nothing more than ppl following a trend to be perceived as progressive.Its disgusting and these people should be called out for it.Its the same as these paleo diets.Next time someone asks you to make a glutton free meal for a dinner party, oblige but dont do it sit back and watch. Chances are they are faking it and if they arnt then make the excuse that some glutton must have contaminated the meal. Thats what i do anyway and i havent had any issue with the liars.
Ah thats pretty lucky.I've had 4 occasions where I have to move large tanks and 3 were a one day only situation where everything had to be done in a matter of hours and one slow move over a week.The fish you have chosen can be quite aggressive and ideally should be introduced at the same type (the clowns are fine).Or if you can, get the damsels last as they will beat up the others if they are introduced first.
Thank you for the generous compliment. I feared the abrupt ending would ruin the whole thing but those 800 words had to come out somewhere and I had already hacked the beginning portion to bloody chops. It pleases me to hear that you liked the characterization, which I was hoping would carry the story through. This challenge has been a great learning experience for me. Thanks for providing a great pic.
Yeah, that's time for a 2-player match.  But there are also rules and variants for Tag Team play (four players) and Tournaments for stringing matches together.  It's still on the light side, though and it sounds like you're looking for something heavier.  I'd say **Luchador** is around the same weight as **King of New York**.
She refuses to use the nice, expensive, very well configured and easy to use Harmony remote because it's not the Tivo remote. Literally the only remote she'll use. She'd rather use the Xbox controller to control Netflix/Blu-Rays in the Xbox One than the Harmony remote which will do it all ...
They are for utility. When one of those giant amalgams of corpses (Cramped Caskets) touch one, they will light on fire and take some damage. They will then move a lot slower and take double physical damage.
Put the junction box on top of the rafter for easy access. Wire clamps everywhere. A small taped hole in the barrier will be fine for the electrical will be fine. Regular Romex is acceptable (check what gauge you need). I would staple to the same side of the junction box.
Yep, you bring a kid into the world, you're a fucking dick if you ditch the kid and don't provide for him.And that goes for my uncle, too.  his wife was a total psycho hose beast and gave up custody of the kids completly.  It's fair that she had to pay child support to him...So I don't want to hear about patriarchy.Of course this has nothing to do with how fucked your ideology is.. it's a distraction to avoid having to actually address the issue at hand.
As a Swede, all I want is for Lundqvist to get at least one cup. I would not even be sad if they beat Detroit to get it, Lundqvist raising at least one cup is all i want to see right now.

Very true. Colorists never seem to get as much praise as artists but they *are* artists.Where artists provide depth and dimension, colorists add *substance* and character. The two seeming to cross paths from time to time.
Well, you can definitely find worse than crack in Brazil. I don't think Krokodil is a problem there, though. It's also probably likely that I might rank hard drugs differently than you, though, I guess.
Mostly the same way that heterosexual couples benefit society.And it's not like the government examines each and every prospective marriage to see if it would benefit society. Do you *really* assume that every single heterosexual marriage benefits society more than every homosexual marriage? Even ones that involve a Kardashian?
Just change his position to LF then I have Modric to link up with him. Manager would work too if you have him in a Hybrid, if not, Manager doesn't matter. I plan on pairing him with TOTS Suarez (if he gets one) and using TOTY as CAM or TOTS Ibra when TOTS comes out for La Liga and Ligue 1.
3 rules to enter:*All weapons will be turned over to the guards and kept in a safe location. You will get yhose weapons back when you leave. *Several full body searches*Several background questions will be asked by our psych. If everything goes smoothly we wont have any problems. What do you do? Talents, trades, skills? Somethings kept you alive this long.

Yeah, no one likes being the third wheel. However like I replied to the other comment she has has become closer to us. While I enjoy that immensely, I hope they all become closer again.
I'd say evans out, Blind and shaw fighting it out for lb, Rafael gone or on loan, Gundogan and carrick in deeper mid.. Bale if he were to show up could pick a wing with di maria/young on the other one..i guess bale over valencia on the right if we dont have to use a rwb by necessity? 
As I said, I get the per capita stat, you don't have to explain it like I'm some buffoon that can't understand simple statistics. I'm not living in a fictitious stat world. I live in the real world. Of all the REAL hate crimes committed, were the majority committed by white people or black people? 
This is straw man bullshit. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth. In 1st Corinthians 12, Paul says marriage is between a man and a woman.THIS FLOWCHART IS A STRAW MAN
Indeed it is. But one thing that remains true: apart from exceptional situations, the subject of the photo has no control over its use.A political party is totally free to use images of rival candidates, provided it has the necessary copyright clearance, licence or other permission. Any image taken from Wikipedia, for instance, is fair game. (It can be fun checking just how young certain MPs look from their Wikipedia photo, and what else has been edited by the same user or IP...)
After a bit of searching and checking, the guards allow the four of you to go inside.The city is bustling with activity. From the looks of it, the market district lies directly in front of you. Here you can see merchants in stalls, hollering over each other, as well as a few buildings that likely hold larger shops. To the north, you see a large, ornate building surrounded by walls and guards. To the west you can see smaller residential units. The south side looks like a cross between a warzone and a garbage dump. Smoke rises from various points and the buildings are crumbling and decrepit. 
This and the subsequent "discussion" can't possibly be serious.100% of funds, no leverage long, market moves 5% down = 5% loss5% of funds, leveraged long 20x, market moves 5% down = 5% loss, because you still have 95% of your original funds which can be put to work however you like, including but not limited to trading entirely without leverage too, because the exchange can only take your collateral (5%). There is no weird internet argument that can change this reality.

What were OWS demands?  Exactly.You get half of the town to camp out in front of city hall in order to get the sheriff to resign.  INFORM People on the issues, so that when they are interviewed they don't look stupid, and something might change.Maybe not for the nation, but I bet that city has second thoughts.Or you can burn down buildings and have everyone in the nation call you thugs.  Your choice.

He thinks the OT law doesn't apply because he ignores the part where Jesus said not a jot or tittle would pass away, and he quotes the story of Paul in Acts writing letters that **also** don't overturn the old law. I read the comment. It was stupid.

This is interesting because I used to create cities like that within a region on SimCity 4, but didn't expect it to be something done in the real world.
I never said "impending over throw of the constitution" besides, the Constitution is not respected anyway in terms of citizens civil rights.If you don't say it's possible, you're an idiot.

There's that one that just closed down.  And that undead monster one or whatever that you summon a giant avatar in?  I have no clue what that one was called.I actually enjoyed Air Mech a bit.
Yeah, he marked my order as shipped but did not reply to any of my messages. I will post back when it gets delivered which should not take more than 2 more days if she shipped when he marked it as shipped but I have heard that people got their package in 16 days after he has marked shipped so its hard to tell right now.
I value people's freedoms to a point...It certainly seems dickish...but how do you believe "rape is wrong" (consider this as a doctrine) and not seek to make it law that you can't rape?  The murder example is just kind of a throwaway example of things that people consider to be objectively bad...Though murder is not defined in the Catholic church in the same way it is defined secularly; animals actually don't count that way, exactly... (Before everyone jumps on this, there are several reasons you shouldn't go around killing animals all willy nilly, Catholic and non-Catholic reasons. We're not pro-meat eaters and we're not pro-vegetarian.)The cancer example isn't well thought out. You can replace it with vaccine cases if you prefer. I'm really just kind of loosely throwing out stuff here when I should be more rigorous. And for that I ought to apologize. I want to address more as your questions are very good, but I gotta run off! So, feel free to type at me and I will respond later.
By being sober more frequently than not sober until it feels like extra special fun when you get fucked up again like it used to when you were first experimenting. Moderation is a good thing
A couple other things you could consider: You can paint the cable hider to match the wall, which might help to hide it even more. You could also pick up a couple more for the rear speakers, and paint them as well. In addition, the Fluance front speakers are rear-ported, so you'll benefit by pulling them away from the wall about a foot, if you can manage it.THX recommends 80hz crossover, so I use that. Depending on how low your speakers get, you might want to adjust it beyond that. With small front speakers and small rear speakers, 90hz sounds about right.Set your sub to 0, and adjust it if something ever seems off.
Did you do much travelling around the surrounding countries? Where did you go? And what's accommodation like near Vic Falls. I assume it's more expensive there due to tourists.
Just chiming in, but I have had the same experience as /u/PBI325. No problems with phone activation, regardless of how many times I've activated that same key before.
So basically, if a 5 year old in a white robe brings out a kitten, and you and your spouse have a marriage license, and the feeding of the catnip symbolizes your union to one of you, you are married?
Why do you care if people complain?  Does it make you feel insecure?  Does it make you feel bad?  Do you feel that people have no right to complain when their so called partner cuts their pay multiple times over the last couple years?  Does it make you feel worse that you accept working for 5 hours and only get $50 gross while other people do not accept that?
Why is that?If the fetus has a right to life, then you shouldn't kill it. It's not fair to kill the fetus for it's rapist scumbag father.If the fetus *doesn't* have a right to life then getting an abortion is fine in any case, rape or no rape.If you say only women who were raped can get abortions, then you're basically just punishing the women who had sex willingly because ... sex is bad and/or only for married couples?
I'll add some quick recommendations so I can send you into the world of snails:* Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream - *light moisturizer, not enough as a standalone cream** Mizon All in One Black Snail Repair Cream - *slightly more moisturizing than the Mizon All In One Cream, but still not enough** COSRX Snail Essence - *Great essence to check out, 96% snail mucin filtrate** COSRX Snail Cream - *~~Higher snail mucus percentage than Mizon's cream,~~ non-irritating for sensitive skin, overall better*-- Overall, I think the COSRX Snail Cream would be a great place to start and would probably help the most with hyperpigmentation out of all the other snail creams out there. As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over.
Caught my dad puffing a few times in my late teens but we'd never burn together until my mid 20s.  At Xmas,  he comes to spend it with me and my family (I'm 36 now), and I introduce him to my Plenty.  He uses it exclusively for two weeks and loves it.  Xmas surprise from my sis, my mom, and me:  we all chipped in and bought him a Mighty.  He is now a vape enthusiast, and S&amp;B should pay the guy commission; he's easily converted 7-8 of his friends, each trying and then buying their own Mighty units.  There is a big market in the 60+ crowd - bigger than most would assume.
My church once had a day where the congregation all met up at the church had a brief, 15-minute sermon and prayer session, then spent the day volunteering around the community. Once.

Exactly.Some people might claim that they're all for acceptance of sexual orientations but when it comes down to it, they really can't let go of their old traditions. It's something that I, as a foreigner, have noticed in Asians, in that traditions are so deep rooted and ingrained that even with how advanced Singaporean society is to say Chinese or Indian society, people still hold these traditions to heart.It's obviously alot better and alot safer to come out of your closet here in Singapore but you can still feel the judgement.Of course this is the case in some places in the Western world such as Texas and Dallas aswell, but I digress.
It could be psychological. Maybe Pearl and Garnet deliberately or subconsciously incorporated symbolic "battle scars" into their new outfits, while Amethyst didn't.

&gt; nothing beats 6 day a week Mysore-style AshtangaWhich isn't possible with my schedule, and my goals. Yoga is not my main exercise, it's a supplement to weight lifting and cycling. I work 12 hour shifts 3-4 times per week (with a 1-1.5 hour commute each way), go the gym 3x/wk...there's only so much time in a day, and only so much a body can do. More, I work overnights, so the range of classes available to me are limited.I do what I can, which is 3-4 yoga classes per week, and preferably Vinyasa at that (with some bikram and yin thrown in the mix). The difficult class *has* gotten easier, it's just not my level...**yet.**
&gt;STEM jobs are paid more not because they're harder than teaching, i agree. But because they create more wealth.Which is why it makes me cry inside to see my generation being pushed away from social good because wealth.
Well i definitely see things in common, i dont have a 3ds but used to play pokemon all the time, seen the 1st season of once upon a time, and im also from oh :D so we should probably be friends

Here is a drive that you need: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822152291Good news though, the seagate you bought is big enough to backup all your stuff so you don't have to re-download anything ;)For a little more you can get an SSHD, which lets you have faster loading times on the years old console by now. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822178340For an exact demo and difference, here is a video from CES 2013:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb-OMi6RWpY  Your choice if you think the decreased loading times is worth the price difference. In my opinion it is though.

I've always wondered about this. So many cars have the brake closer to the driver than the accelerator, but this means that your foot could slip off the brake and hit the gas, but your foot couldn't slip off the gas and hit the brake. It just doesn't make sense to me
I get using random funny ideas in my standup.What I wanted to learn is Comedy Writing (formulaic writing?), you know, the one talked about used on TV and whatevs. I was lucky to find myself at a writer's room a couple of times, but with zero input - I just didn't know how you sit down and start writing jokes :(

Yeah, this is definitely what he was suggesting. It's definitely weird and shady though...Amazon customer service has usually been really great in the past.
Likely the maggots, this is the answer that is almost always given in this sub.  You'll notice there were quite a few, i'm sure they are the nasty kind that also eat healthy skin.  But still they likely prolonged this guys life, I'm not sure how much longer he'll live with that kind of damage and skin tone.There was a guy further up thread that said as a medic he'd never seen a living person with skin that color.  I've seen it once IRL on someone that had a weird skin condition where the skin basically was a massive callous and it was that grey.  I saw it in a small patches not like that.  I don't even want to think about how long he let that go for it to get like that.

It basically sends the implication that women shouldn't expect to go out in public without being attacked. Even if it is more common for women to be attacked, it happens to both genders, and the advice would be equally applicable to both.

This is a known phenomenon within the criminal justice world.  The news reports rarities because that is what people want to watch.  It has nothing to do with people being "fed up" or "outraged", do people honestly think that mainstream media cares about public opinion... good luck.  All they care about it sparking controversy to get ratings and the easiest way to do that is to stir up marginally existent race relations.
That should be a rare occurrence, majority of spawns are towards the south of the map, zombies appear to be bugged and hardly spawn in the south, so you cant be swamped by 20 when you spawn, not every time.  Maybe once in a blue moon when you spawn in PV or north.
It does that one thing correct. It is designed to measure the accuracy of your circle based on the requirement of there being 3 points. It does not take into account discontinuous points, solid objects, etc., all of which would make it much more complex and involve it doing lots of other things correctly as well.

Ay, there's the rub. I would not consider high school a social setting. It would most definitely make me uncomfortable. That's all I was trying to say. I feel like there are better ways to meet people then walking up to them in the hallway. If he can get a friend to introduce them (like I said before) then he doesn't even risk the chance of her thinking he's weird. 
She's purdy, Pent is a lucky bastard.As a unit, eh she's about what you'd expect from a pre-promo sniper- that is to say she's basically more worth using then investing in either of what I now call the "bad base stat earlygame archer dude/dudette," but she not amazing by any means, if I really want a bow unit in FE7 I use Geitz or Rath. Auto A support with Pent is a nice bonus, anything that helps that guy out is certainly worth considering.

Source on that? It would be useful. It doesn't make sense that he'd say mid-to-late Dragonball, because the WHOLE SERIES is Dragonball in Japan. There is no distinction between DB and DBZ there.Even if he did say it, there are far more instances of them being demonstrably Slower Than Light than them being FTL. And even so, Toriyama isn't a reliable source. He once forgot about SSJ 2 and 3. He thought 3 was 2, that there was no 2, etc.
Indeed. He also doesn't seem very bright - he hadn't spoken to her during her entire pregnancy, then asks out of the blue to meet her in  a parking lot? Then she disappears and he tells conflicting stories to different people and lies to the police? The only way he could look more suspicious is if he were twirling an old-timey mustache while the police were interviewing him.
If you're going to say "If you're winning with mages, it's just luck," I'm going to say "If you're losing to Mark/Dash, you're just bad." The projectile is slow and the damage is low enough that frontliners can happily body block it all day. If you're squishy and you know the enemy team has a Mark/Dash Galio then don't be an idiot and run around way in front of your team. 
As someone who was induced at 36 weeks w/ my first child for pre-e, I would recommend avoiding induction unless absolutely medically necessary. Measuring/estimating baby size is very subjective and often very wrong. They estimated my son to be 1lb larger. My body wasn't ready to labor and the induction was taxing and unnatural, although completely medically necessary. My second birth my labor started naturally. Completely different experience, much better. Being 1 week overdue I had to advocate for myself to avoid induction/unnecessary intervention. Ended up having a vbac with #2 and highly doubt it would have happened had I been induced. Good luck!! You are your own best advocate for the birth you desire. 
I'm running it on a 7yr old laptop, it's a bit choppy but playable.hint: turning on the traffic overlay makes mine run at least 4x faster, which is really helpful for zooming around and having a look at what's happening in various places
Ok, but in a scenario between two rebuilding franchises why don't we see a trade like this happen?  For example, the Cubs currently have ~3 SS in their system (Castro, Russell, and Baez).  The general consensus is that Baez will play 2B and Castro will eventually be traded so Russell can play SS.However, the team doesn't have many pitching prospects so why not trade Baez for a top pitching prospect?  If anything, Baez has lost value since last year due to his extreme struggles at the MLB level (very high strikeout rate).  Trading him while he is still a prospect keeps his high value at the time and brings back another relevant future piece in return.
I thought the discussion was incredibly interesting and not as one-sided at people in this thread are making it out to be. I'm getting a little sick of this "If you don't hate Valve and think this thing was 100% bad, you're my enemy!".
At the start of the year, Sparks was the defacto AHL starter going into the season. He lost his job to a younger, more talented goalie in Bibeau, who had just come off a MONSTER Memorial cup run. He was the best player on his team (which included 50g man, Mantha) by a mile. Bibeau is the real gem in our goalie pipeline, and I' much prefer his career not be put on the back burner for a guy who did well in the ECHL.
Yeah, it's not like I haven't had ONSs. I just find them kind of a waste of my time, as these are people who I never want to see again, and they always want a repeat. I want someone I can explore ;-)
Yep, when you have empathy for either side they do something really stupid and then they're hard to defend. I generally try to avoid reading stories or particapating in conversations on that conflict.
Well you've just validated my decision to include the data about ch-3 alternatives - if someone's making my pattern I want them to make it look as nice as possible!
Tristana was pretty bad during the BT rush meta. She had no optimal build paths. IE was bad as a first item, and BT wasted a lot of early game power, because she didn't have any AD ratios. The only decent starter items were Bork and Statikk, both still bad, but less bad than the alternatives.
Both are great lists and its very hard to say which is better. One thing to consider that I think many don't is the fatigue you face the longer a tournament goes on. Regionals will be 75 minute rounds and you will likely be playing 4-5 before they break to top 8. That's 5 to 6.25 hours of play at minimum if you don't drop. So anything that reduces the amount of mental exertion helps. The bbbb* lists are already a great choice in this respect but going the ac route is even easier still (1 less ship, all the same dial, less thought on actions/tokens).
This week was really hectic, Finals are next week, so this week was a mess of final projects and getting ready for final presentations. Other than that, it was pretty good. Got Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate with birthday money and been going really hard at that.This weekend's probably gonna be mostly hanging out in my room and relaxing before Finals next week, might marathon Girls und Panzer or The Rolling Girls on Saturday.(Also, I completely forgot Age of Ultron comes out tomorrow. I might have to get a few friends to go see it with me)
So you mean to tell me that if I do some borderline illegal shit I'll get mean comments from people online?!?!?!....DUR HORROR! Also she wasn't doxxed, at least the people(Wizardchan, a site for NEET degenerates where most of this sub's best shit comes from) who she claimed doxxed her said they didn't nor do they have a reason to, and when it did happen the post was quickly removed(After people in the forum said it was bullshit and reported it) and the user was banned. The results of all this doxxing...Quinn got some mean messages. Also have you seen what both sides have been doing to each other. SWATing, doxxing, hazardous mail, hate videos, the whole 9-yards.

What killed it for me towards the end was how many times the bad guys could have killed the protagonists and just didn't. The entire final encounter seemed like they should have died about 6 times and never did because reasons.
I'm with you.  That figure probably includes the salary of the guy who put it together.  I always assume guys who make Formula1 race cars for a living can bang out a front jack while sitting on the john in between sessions.
Oops. Both are kit lenses. Sony is the 16-50 and the Canon is the 18-55.I played around with the A6000 outside. Set the creative scene to Neutral, and sharpness to +3. Haven't brought out the T3i to compare yet though. Getting dark.
Can I take 225 before any other course in the program? This will be my make or break, and I rather take it at the beginning of the program to save time and money.
Yep. I am. Fuck Windows 8, give me back my start menu, don't fix what's not broken. And I'm ok with change, as long as it's for the better. And I used to use Windows 3.11 and dosP.S. And it wasn't 10 min, it was few hours. And then I installed the start menu

When it gets to that point, why not use a console cheat to restore health? You're basically botting at that point anyway, except it takes way longer. I hate cheating in games, but I see making a macro like that as the same thing but way more time consuming 
I usually just lurk in threads like these, but I wanted to applaud you for using the word 'differently' rather than 'weirdly' or 'awkwardly'. It's always nice to hear someone speak with tact.
Well not well, but i don't hate the rangers, just your poor luck that ny has 3 hockey teams for the purpose of spoiling your Stanley cup dreams :-)Though i will root for you vs the yankees.  your team being the lesser of two evils.

You have a source on the last time that happened. Because I can name multiple states (most states) that voted Blue in 2012 that had a majority of counties vote Red. If you look at the by county election results the country looks completely red. Its that the cities have small numbers but tons of population.I think you mean when the state's electors don't have to vote with the popular vote, but that's even rare as crap nowadays. Finally, counties aren't Gerrymandered, Gerrymandering is with congressional districts, not counties.

Waking through a shop in Japan and a woman in a suit was walking towards me briskly. Just before we passed she said "Hi" quite loudly, so I in my most oblivious said a friendly "Hello" back. Then she kept saying "hi" and I realized she was saying yes to somebody on her Bluetooth. I slunk out of there as unnoticeably as I could.
&gt; Holy shit, now I've lost all respect for her. She always had a kind of cute goth lolita thing going on but something seemed off about her.Probably the fact that she was doing the goth lolita thing at age 43.
I have to say, as a recent former smoker, if I started out with an istick and subtank mini, there's no way in hell I'd have stuck with not smoking. It's really the only thing I have to say negatively about this sub, though.  Now that I've gotten more advanced, people here have been a lot of help.

Using a Volcano you can get 5x as many people with the same bowl because you evaporate 99% of it (and the left overs can be vaped again to get you high later).

Right now I'm in my first play through of the game. I got the game when it first came out but because of Finals, I had to put up the game for a bit and focus on my studying. I'm going through the forbidden forest right now and as I enter the area I see this guy just walking all slow. Pfft, I got this. Villagers aren't shit. I take a stab. "....Why didn't that do very much?" And then his motherfucking head explodes with snakes and he rapes me. I was not expecting that.That was this morning.. I despise this area so much. Everything looks so similar, that if I lose my Echoes it's like a 50/50 chance that I'll be able to find them again. I can deal with the monsters, but getting all turned around frustrates the shit out of me and I start getting impatient which leads me to making a bunch of mistakes. Can't wait for my boyfriend to start playing. I want to see his reaction to the snakeheads.

I am merely showing my support in a thread created for that very purpose, you're the ones voting. Feel free to "ruin your country", I am staying in my nice little hellhole ;)
Ironic...that was written by my Nicaragua placement officer and published the same day I wrote her to tell her I wouldn't be going. So someone on the Nicaragua TEFL waitlist should soon be getting an invitation!
There were people having trouble with this a while ago, and I believe some people said to call Tanya.   There may be a mission you missed there.  Otherwise, go to the 100% checklist in the pause menu and it should be pretty clear what you've missed.  Like others have said, check stunt jumps, knife flights, and under the bridges.    
Got my report finished and handed in with an hour to spare. Also managed to get exactly 61 words over the minimum word count (as although they said it was okay to be under, I didn't want to risk it)Now I've decided to start using HabitRPG again and so have been having fun finding challenges to do. Also trying to get a bunch of gold today so that I can then buy one of the spring items before they disappear.
You're welcome, I hope you find something you like! :) The shirt is from Hot Topic! They also have an NCR flag shirt, and various Nuka-Cola and Vault Boy merchandise (lanyards, wallets, beanies, etc.) depending on the store location.
They are accuracy bonuses. You will see when you hover over the attack styles wether an attack is a slash, stab, or crush attack.Only Str bonus and str lvls will change how high you hit were att bonuses and lvls will effect how often
Sorry, I read AK for whatever reason. Long day at work.You are actually fine. With your own knee, it's a thousand times easier to have normal gait. The most important things to do is keep your muscles strong, and STRETCH. If your residuum's hamstrings start getting contractures your gait will look like crap. Next, would be comfort of your socket and suspension. If it hurts to walk and you're always trying to avoid a certain area, it won't look normal. It also will look terrible if you keep slipping out the socket. The rest can be adjustable by a good prosthetist, and can be trained quite easily.TL/DR; I thought you said AK; with your own knee, it's very easy to walk normally with no one ever knowing.
My only complaint is the E.T head action that is going on in first person. Like for example, if I am on a quad bike in third person and not moving, leaning or anything, I am perched up with my head high above the handle bars. If I enter first person, all of a sudden I have arms growing out of my ears and my head is in my chest. And now, if I rotate the camera away from the front, my head will lift up like I'm E.T. and grow 3 feet up in the air. It even does this to an extent in cars as well. By far the most annoying part to first person to me.
Is there a way to use my 1.0 install media to switch to PC before Heavensward?A couple years ago, I bought the 1.0 CE with hopes of playing on the PC I had at the time. However, since the PC wasn't mine, I found myself returning it before I installed. Fast-forward to ARR Beta 3, where I grabbed a PS3 CE copy and finally made it to Eorzea. Shortly after sorting out the PS3 install, I registered the 1.0 codes for all my bonus goodies.I'm on PS4 now but want to go PC before 3.0. If I get a suitable gaming rig, is there a way to get ARR on it without extra expense? I'll be buying the 3.0 CE soon and don't want to double-buy ARR if I don't have to.Searching here and on Google led to answers about PC to console switches, and Steam store stuff, but nothing like this (I think).Thankies! =\^.\^=
Reform tax law to encourage the break up of large companies Richard Stallman outlines a pretty good take on this in a blog entry called [Fixing 'too-big-to-fail'] (http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2013/02/04/fixing-too-big-to-fail/) [Basic income](http://www.usbig.net/) would probably be my second choice 
That is a really thorough write-up, and there is nothing I can really add if you are looking to inspect the car yourself. I always recommend taking the car to a mechanic for a used car check before the purchase is finalized. It is really nice to be able to get under a car to check out the chassis before making a buying decision.I hope the deal goes your way, you are going to love the car. I have had mine for 15 years, and I have never regretted buying it.
&gt; My deputies did their job to the fullest extent of their abilities....In the sense that we kept these drugs from reaching our streets, this operation was a success...Yup, I lived in BH at the time and remember how hard it was to find weed after that. /s
Ok, I'll feed the troll.There is no advantage gained in LoL/DB when you spend money. You can just unlock the characters/mercs you want faster. You can spend nothing and still play with the free mercs (which get rotated) until you have enough gold to unlock the rest.
Actually the risk isn't denting but the blade actually breaking. I'm sure you've seen the home shopping video on YouTube where the guy bangs the katana and stabs himself when it breaks? Yeah not good. 
It would probably afford the government more options. One big advantage would be allowing public corporations to declare Ch. 9 bankruptcy. Right now, through a legislative anomaly, CH. 9 does not apply to these. But long term, I don't personally see much advantage. A straight bailout would be nice, but neither the Fed nor the Treasury would do that, even for a State I think. 
I'm with /u/boydboyd on this one; I just like playing games with friends. I've now been dubbed the 'game dude ' in my circle of friends...HOWEVER: You play a game of 'Lords of Waterdeep' against me, I'm playing to win. If you're playing 1v1, don't expect to win against me &gt;:D I actually played a 1v1 game against a friend last night, score was 302 to 266. At one point I did a lap around him.It really helps that I have the iOS game of it and play it a lot...A LOT.
Depends on who I go with. If it's only 4 or 5 very close friends, I'm not anxious at all and they understand me enough that they don't think it's weird  that I listen more than  I talk so I can relax. Otherwise, talking to the cashier, forcing myself to make conversation to seem friendly, constantly being on edge to contribute something meaningful while fighting off urges to escape to my quiet, safe room where no one can judge me is very tiring.
A first time offender will likely get drug court.  Basically you clean up and do some drug counseling and if you are successful, it won't stay on your record.
More and more people are gaining access to it every day and the population keeps growing in general. Not only that, but the cost keeps dropping, the speed keeps improving, and the content keeps expanding. Unless something better comes along, no, it's not losing any popularity. 
It helps me because I offset my viewmodel way into the lower right corner to keep the middle bottom of my screen clear. Dualies look ridiculous. The off-hand weapon is coming straight out of the chest. 
I have never thought of that...I know people who do that with the ring, but not with the normal pill. I think this might be a really good option for me!
Gah, I'm such a baby. You list made me cry. I love dark chocolate and tea and mountains and singing (also badly) and flowers and kisses and wine and wind chimes and BBQ and hot showers and blue. Also the sounds of someone cooking on the grill. And when sunlight lights up the leaves, so their undersides are bright green. And my husband's laugh. Gah, I'm just so grateful. Life is rough, but it's also really great. Chocolate, man. Lol. *sigh* I could do this all day. 
The best gear that drops from dungeons is bound and drops pretty randomly. You can spend weeks/months running dungeons trying to get that last piece of your set. You're often better off spending your time earning gold and just buying tradable crafted armor. AA is NOT a game designed for solo play, unless you want to play farmville. All the best content requires large groups. And be prepared to grind for months/years to get the end game gear, depending on your luck. RNG is rarely kind in this game.
When i go out west all i can think about is how I haven't seen a decent greasy spoon in the last 10 states. I'll take a good local joint over chain burgers any day. In 'n' out is really good for a chain though.
Chances are there may be one not too far from you. Part of how I got the job was that I taught myself freehand sharpening years ago. Anyone with the upper body strength and half a brain with emotional stability can put the blades on the grinder. Knowing how to properly deburr and hone is a different matter.
&gt; We don't have an Edlund anymoreSadly, no, we don't.And there seems to be some kind of culture on this show where they writers all just go their own way.
I once had a Wells Fargo phone rep tell me that my bank account keeps shutting down because I keep using my card "overseas." I live in Canada. I told him so and he goes "yeah." I asked him where he thought Canada was an he said "Europe." =( 
We do that, but unfortunately a few slip through the cracks, and the government can't really protect you from them until they actually commit a crime. That's just the nature of our criminal justice system. 
We aren't friends. We don't dislike each other we just keep it professional. I could easily be replaced and life would go on so I guess i don't see why it would be a bad thing.
&gt;but i hesitate to call it "hate" since "hate" implies malice (to me).  Past examples through history of what is called "hate", specifically to ethnic or religious minorities, have not relied on active malice. It is determined more by actions and attitudes inevitably based on treating these groups unequally.Limiting it to active malice would let someone who supported Jim Crow laws out of callous indifference off the hook. The is a certain type of person out there who will treat these groups like that and not even consider them human enough to warrant a strong emotional response.I also don't think anything is gained from holding back from identifying hate for what it is.
this, said the same thing earlier, if it costs ip for skin chromos then riot might even make more  money for people wanting to buy the specific skin which costs more
Yeah I understand that, but that whole thought process is quite odd in my opinion.He hated the ending right?  Generally when something has a really bad ending, you give it a score lower than you usually give it (had it ended better).Even after the show ended poorly, he was considering giving it an 8.Yes I guess you can be distracted about fancy art and what not. But the last thing that sticks in your mind is the ending. To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending. It makes me think that he was likely over analyzing/nitpicking.I know not everyone uses the MAL scale, but 4 is most obviously a bad score (on a scale of 10).
It worked after we made our own cable. Guessing it was not working because of the lack of termination. It was a 5m cable. Also had to utilize the receive on interrupt code. Thanks for the help.
It's called a [Platypus](http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/JimPuzzles/RUBIK/Platypus/PlatypusMove2.jpg) but mine was just solid stickers. The stickers were really bad and the puzzle was super easy so I tried to make it a little more difficult, it did not become any harder you just have to make sure the pieces are flipped right.
I've been screwed. I don't think I'll be able to get terra. I try everyday. Support redirected me to Google support for some reason so fingers crossed.
Try a different kind of buttercream from what you're used to, say French/Swiss/Italian/German rather than simple American buttercream. There's also ermine frosting, 7 minute frosting, whipped cream frosting (less stable unless you pick a recipe that uses gelatin or something), whipped ganache, meringue, or [marshmallow frosting](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/super-easy-marshmallow-icing-recipe). Cream cheese icing is great, but tends to be quite similar in texture and sweetness to American buttercream.

A little strong, but you see these hyperboles and slips so often it definitely shows some of the warped attitudes people have towards GRRM, D&amp;D, the series, the show, this sub, etc.
Spurs, so we can be Texas State Champs. Also, would rather beat the last champs than some team that can't seem to get it done. I know Pop is going to hack us a bunch, and that is going to make for painful basketball to watch, but you have to beat the best to be the best. It's not a knock on the Spurs, heck I think they're overall better than the Clippers. I just don't think there's a real advantage/disadvantage in us playing either team instead of the other.
Mainly because they want Mariota and to get him they're gonna need a lot of ammo (meaning draft picks) and Kendricks makes the most sense out of possible players to trade since teams would give more for him then they would Ryans
Yep, you are what we would call in America, a conservative. These are straight up right wing talking points.Also, in America we enjoy the greatest freedom of speech in the world, as protected by our constitution. A part of the law that I spent weeks on in my Con Law class. I feel confident that at least in this country free speech is safe, There are originations, like the ACLU, committed to upholding it. I don't think either the ACLU or my extremely conservative Con Law teacher would say the PoE incident has anything, whatsoever to do with free speech. In fact the only one telling someone thay can't say something is you. I say, you can say whatever you want. You are the one saying you can't say what you think, because language? It is a bizarre and indefensible understanding of free speech.And since I just went appeal to authority that was at the 3rd best law school in California. 
It's important to distinguish between PAC and individual contributions when looking at a table like this. PACs are the company; individuals are people who happen to work for the company.
Yea, I told my mom 10 years before I actually started transition. I never had the courage to bring it up again after that initial coming out. Be strong, you can do this.
Gender identity disorder isn't even the proper term anymore. It's Gender Dysphoria and there is no known permanent treatments for it besides transitioning.

Thing is I really do love the draft. I'm way excited for tonight,  but I just don't know anybody. I try to watch some college ball through the year, but i never seem to get any of the good teams on my local channels, so I never see these good college players. 
That's great. Yeah, plastic surgeons get a bad rap sometimes because they are responsible for atrocities like [this](http://i.imgur.com/mc1dvqt.jpg). But it's wonderful when they do amazing reconstruction jobs for people who have suffered damage and just want to look normal.
If you choose to be a non-presser, you leave yourself with the same choice limitation as a presser, by failing, you don't stay a free presser, you only change groups. It's a gamble whichever group you choose.
I love Gosling. Drive gave the biggest broner since I saw my first Bond movie. Crazy Stupid Love made me feel things. Hard glorious things I didn't think I could feel again. But Teller would have been perfect. He's the every man underdog of now, which fits this sort of film well. Gosling is already number one. Will I still watch the fuck out of this though? You know I will 
I think the nerfs here are not supposed to target support annie as hard as they are a hit to mid lane annie.Support Annie is niche and in a good spot, mid lane Annie has problems with being a really low counterplay 100-0 champion like Veigar was.
Always keep thinking they should do a late night special service on the weekends. I live in Kits and if I am ever out for a drink either at the Wicklow or Olympic village or even more so around the west end I always think to myself it would be great to get one home.
This is probably the closest thing to what you're looking for:http://www.mmobomb.com/video-interview-cory-jones-hex-shards-fate/A fair bit of info of what we can expect in the coming months. If you're looking for a roadmap of exact release dates that is not gonna happen anytime soon. If you just want to know what is on the horizon then the MMO Bomb interview as well as the fiveshards podcast from awhile back are good places to go to.
You absolutely do when he's 30 years old and you're getting a 25 year old receiver with the size and athletic ability to post 1200 yards and 8+ touchdowns if he actually had a QB situation that wasn't as horrible as Arizona.It's trading short term offensive productivity for long term offensive productivity at a more desirable position.  Adrian Peterson is a non-factor in two years.  That's just life as a running back.
This came up a while back in one of the subs, and the conclusion was that Joffrey is just plain old evil given the environment he's in. Beheading people, taking of their limbs, etc. for various crimes is just the done thing in that universe. Walter White is special evil in our universe, he was willing to do shit that almost no one does. Imagine putting WW in King's Landing.
Stuff like this is why i don't play edh.EDIT: Actually upon taking another look at this, I have to say, this really reads like someone's glorified kitchen table/house rules. Don't be surprised if people start dropping off. 
Wow damn! Thanks for the pictures, from those, it does seem like VGA is the way to go. I'll probably order one from Amazon or the website the other guy told me. Thanks!
I don't think interceptors is in the same realm as twin bolt really, but maybe I'm undervalueing interceptors.I am very wary of drafting UB, so I'd likely take the twin bolt.
Doing a lot of discussion and usability testing before small changes isn't going to be much fun. Being very limited in how you can change things because you shouldn't disrupt things others use also isn't much fun. Being free to make big changes which seem cool is much more fun. If developers aren't being paid, they're going to want to do things they enjoy.
No. Definitely not. Sadly, he was on my team, and we had to 'carry' him for a group project. Thankfully, I was also team lead, and documented this in our SVN and shared it with the professor so he knew what was up.
It sort of like they rolled in Conc and AoE into the gem. Before it was 75% base at lvl 20 + 57% inc. physical dmg. If you ignore the 57% (I use a windripper, so phy dmg doesn't matter to me) then you're doing 45.3% MORE dmg (109/75) compared to before. The base area of the skill also appears to be larger than current lvl 1 RoA on live servers. There's also some changes to Inc. AoE (+20% inc at lvl 1) gem, and to Conc Eff gem (40% more dmg, 25% LESS aoe) These things combined, I'd say it's a very nice buff.Also forgot to add, they changed the quality bonus from 0.5 attack speed to 1% area damage.
&gt; He was in the last good uk ganster/crime film LayerCake. (i dont know of any others since then)Check Wild Bill, which was directed by Dexter Fletcher who played Cody in Layer Cake. It's about a gangster who gets out of prison to find that his wife has skipped the country and left their two young sons to fend for themselves. Bill has to try to be a good dad and stop his younger son going down the criminal path, while adjusting to life on the outside.
150 int is going to give you roughly 1.5% dps and a bit more toughness.8% ED will give you roughly 7% dps vs Elites (assuming you already have Aughild's)Seems like a no-brainer to me.
exactly. the bubble burst around the time the OUYA came out. (not because the ouya came out, mind you). Indie titles became back in style, and AAA's began to fall to the wayside. its's shifting back but I doubt that AAA's will ever have the same margins they did back when the 360 came out.
Well, not everyone's best interest. Payday lenders and title pawn places wouldn't fare very well under those conditions, for example.That's totally not a bad thing.
2% would be better.Imagine Bellona and Bakasura and Kali with 3% true damage per hit. It would also make hunters a bit too safe. 2% is a safe number. 10 auto's = 20% health and that isn't counting base power, crits and penetration.
I placed the curved side facing the screen and the flat side facing my eye, using it the picture comes out fine, 3d effect is good too so I think the lenses are in the correct way. Im not sure what is causing the head ache, it may/may not be the lenses, ~~or what I was thinking is the way its resting on my nose bridge / forehead and that pressure could be causing it~~EditI just tested it with me holding the cardboard rather than using the headband however it doesnt matter how I hold it it, it still strains my eyes after 3-5 mins and causes a headache.
I think he meant to say that he wasn't in college, and that his father would think that fact was what lead to his drug usage, when in fact his decision not to go to college was based on other preferences.
Yes, you should be using the vamp against living targets. You will swing a bit more often since less damage but will heal up all the same and are thus not only safer but you also reduce rest times significantly, and thus even gaining more piety! Since you are nearly finished with the game, feel free to swap out against any nonliving enemies (liches, OoF, curse skulls) and just eating permafood all the time. I'd grab that holy wrath morningstar for Aliches and the orb run. Any Freezing/Bashing morningstars around for OoF? Encumbrance: as rule of thumb have at least the encumbrance rating, better is 1-2 points more. This is even more important when casting spells; your character "just" has bad dodging. 
Gravity *has* a theory and evolution *is* a theory. I think you're getting confused because gravity also has a mathematical proof, the law of gravity. You misunderstand what a theory is, sir. In fact, a theory is an explanation for a  broad set of observations. Please, don't try to correct people when you don't know what you're talking about.
It was an answer, but also an analogy and a life lesson all wrapped up in one go!If you feel salty about this, you could probably only handle being a weekend hooker. That's OK though, they live much more comfortable lives and can have a career outside of burpies and swapping dip spit with each other. If you laughed and thought of a witty retort, you might be ready to join the big leagues and whore yourself out everyday! Show up to the recruiters office 15 minutes prior to 15 minutes prior to 15 minutes prior of 0500 with your butt pre-lubed and ready to party. 
Perhaps you are unfamiliar with this:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderationSeeing the the world in non-binary terms when you have overwhelming evidence and thousands of years of experience and optimization at your disposal may not be 'lazy' but it sure is dumb.If your perspective is "1+1=3," you can bet that others will refuse to understand it. That you think there is something wrong with this is a problem with your perspective, not with others'.PS: The first word of your post is "Absolutely." So maybe you shouldn't be talking about taking any middle ground.
Yeah they have movement classes that start at like 7 PM and go til 10 PM, or they did when I was there. Their schedule obviously changes.Idk, I wondered that myself when I was there because you'll get jealous of other students in classes that you're not in. They learn things you don't. If you were to ask Suzanne she'd recommend at least her class alongside movement and voice. The rest, while important, aren't a necessity. But ultimately it's what you want. I'd say try and get at least 1 or 2 supplementary classes.
You also have to think about it this way too.. We lost script hooks and a lot of mod opportunity using scripts right now. We'll get it back soon since all they really did was scramble shit around (Changed hashes and stuff). Not to mention script kiddies will be back once that's all figured out.Now for people like me who only play online with a few select friends and dick around in SP all the time, we lost all the fun stuff. R* needs to implement a way to stop the hacks and scripts from coming online through maybe an anti-cheat or something. This latest patch seems more like a temporary fix than anything.
The Miata is also built for driving experience and it's super easy to work on and lasts a long goddamn time.The Germans in particular just seem to like doing things in a way that involves some kind of "clever" engineered solution that's unreliable and complicated (and sometimes it is legitimately a good new way to do things). The Japanese tend to build stuff that doesn't break and the Americans make things that tend to be easy to fix.
Probably 100 000&amp; gold certificates (http://moneyfactory.gov/100000goldcertificate.html ). Just to see what would do happen. Also, dropping heavy things would be mean!

Rolled four times:1. Double-Edged Blade Brave, Claymore +1 RCV (Dupe)2. Massive Blade Brave, Zweihander3. Minerva +1 HP (Yay!)4. Dark Courier Kurone +1 HP (Dupe, already had Kurone from last fest)Overall happy since I wanted any of the Greco Roman gods but didn't really need anyone. Minerva was one of the ones I kinda hoped for so I could build a future descend team with her. I'm saving four rolls for tomorrow.

Now, I understand the jump doing a lot of damage, since it's pretty loudly telegraphed, and there is time for you to dodge. However, if by normal attacks you mean the gears that come out of the chassis and the ones that the VP throws, then that's just a bit unfair IMO.
Not nesscairly in 2012 the PCs got 95% of the undecied and the rest went to the WR, majority of the undecied are located in traditional Conservative City areas and extremly rural areas.
actually I see what you mean, I was comparing your picture to [this one](http://www.destinygamewiki.com/images/5/54/Trials_of_osiris_gear1.jpg) and thinking the Hunter looked more like Horus with the way the hood mirrors his hair/mane thing, but now that I'm looking at it more I could easily see the front of the titan helm being a Horus-style "beak" sort of deal.Hard to decide really, but I think you might be right. (as in Horus - Osiris - Anubis)

RP is also a dialect, albeit a prestige dialect. Also, not even the queen speaks Queen's English.&gt; Like all accents, RP has changed with time. For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the /æ/ sound, as in land, with a vowel close to [ɛ], so that land would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of lend. RP is sometimes known as the Queen's English, but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II has changed her pronunciation over the past 50 years, no longer using an [ɛ]-like vowel in words like land.
Yeah the graphics card is the weak point. My plan is to upgrade it around christmas. I tend not to overclock, as I use my PC for audio production and therefore need to run the PC as quiet as possible.
I'd like it mainly for the TDB daily missions. I can almost solo crota's end at this point but I still avoid those dailies because they're hard to me :/
For AV this is not possible....Even with the surge of cash they had in the beginning they couldn't muster even releasing all the classes within a years time.  I'm sorry I loved DFO just as much as the next guy but it's not going to happen with AV.  They need to bite the bullet and sell to someone that can work year round without 4month holidays and works weekends.  This has been nearly 10 years of con jobs on us.
Does it need to be via email? Your best bet is  a rest interface. The import set api is worth looking into if you're on at least Eureka. http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Import_Set_API
I'm saying that racism isn't a function of police unions, and it seems unlikely that if they went away cops would just wholesale stop killing black people. For example, Robert Bates was a reserve sheriff deputy in Oklahoma who shot Eric Harris in the back. Bates wasn't a member of the union, he was a volunteer and a donor to the department.The issue also isn't cops not getting fired, it's a pervasive attitude within the criminal justice system. Prosecutors do not need the union's permission to investigate criminal complaints against police. The failed indictments in New York and Ferguson last fall had nothing to do with unions. Police abuse of power is criminal, they should be going to jail not getting fired.
This was WestJet.  I called and specifically asked for a window seat, not over the wing, so that I could enjoy the view of the islands.Edit: I should mention they let me switch seats to see out a different window.

Except for ya know....we won Game 1 by double digits with Perkins playing 24 minutes. He only played 19 minutes in Game 2 and we lost by 4(although LeBron fouled KD on our last possession.)He played 34 minutes in Game 3, and we lost by 6 on the road. He played 17 minutes in Game 4, and we lost by 6 on the road. He played 19 minutes in Game 5, and we got annihilated. It was a closeout game, Miami smelled blood, and they got us. There were many reasons why we lost that series, but it was much closer than a lot of people realize. Kendrick Perkins was one of them. James Harden scoring less than 10 points in 3 of those 5 games is another. Hell, he had nearly half as many TO's as points in those 3 games......
I know he dose it sometimes, not sure if you payed attention when he kept saying his Skype was making a weird noise and he was trying to fix it.  And alot of times he looks at his computer to watch his stream delay to see how he diedI know its not ideal excuses and he should call out but its not like he is hittin the DMs or something 
I use indihome, but I think it's the regular indihome without fiber. I use dnscrypt on my tablet and laptop, I also use data compression proxy on chrome
To clarify, this is a rolling 20-game average, starting with Hech's 20th game with the Marlins (back in 2013) and ending with the 4/28 game against the Mets. The the first data point is game 20 as a Marlin, the second data point is game 21 but it now ignore game 1, the third data point is game 22, but it ignores games 1 and 2, etc. etc. OPS+ is a comparison of the player's OPS against the league averages, so by definition it should be steady at 100. 
[Definition of MISOGYNY](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misogyny):  a hatred of women Nothing about what any of them said implied any sort of hatred of women, at all.  Rodney and Dan's statements were totally sexist, but absolutely not misogynistic.  Nothing about what Will has said strikes me as either sexist or misogynistic, as far as I can tell.  You could probably argue that him calling Mike a "bitch" was sexist or misogynistic or something but honestly I think that's a stretch. They're all assholes of varying degrees.
Centurylink may not have the best speed but their customer service is pretty top notch. They also let me out of my 2 year contract without paying the agreed upon $200 cancellation fee simply because I asked nicely and had only renewed my contract 3 months prior.
Well you're in luck. Vindicator convinced me to still do it, he came up with questions for me. It just won't be out until the end of next week when my finals are done *sigh*
Mmm he had one bad game against Fusion, played well the other two. Dunked Dignitas in two games. Then had three different scrim blocks vs TSM and overall he played well vs Bjergsen, they both traded winning lane throughout the blocks.
I do this for any whiskey - latest attempt was to figure out what they were drinking in The Drop, which I think is Middleton Very Rare. It amused my ex when I could point and say "I've had that one!"

My only other option was to go to a much lower-tiered law school for a year, take the scholarship and then transfer out by year two. Too many what-if's. Lots of people warned me that the return on law school was not what it was like - but I was confident that I would defy statistics..... thought wrong. 
I remember you requesting it.  This one is actually pretty polarizing - a number of people seemed offended I didn't make new animations.  Thank you for the shout-out and the idea.
Stalin had needed time before he was ready to attack Germany. Germany found out about Stalins plans to invade Germany which then led to Hitler taking the initiative 
The arena would be divided into four arenas: Three depicting the arena from the past Quarter Quells.They would be connected to the main one, which would be divided into 12 parts, like the Arena from No.75. Except, each sector will be a piece of the arena from the Top 12 rated/popular Games.
Chances are, there is some small issue between Ramos and Stras. That said, it's just ridiculous to jump to the conclusion that he's "blaming" Ramos or whatever. Its probably a non-issue, so it sounds like hot air to me. 
Daniel Bryan wins the title, but only after they keep saying how hurt the champion John Cena is so no win can possibly be clean, and he wins by debuting a new finisher so nobody pops when he hits it and wins.Also all the stupid shenanigans with crooked refs and terribly foreshadowed cash ins.
This is not true there are quite a few IT providers in the area along with tons of places that need IT professionals it all depends on your experience and your appearance. 
It's just a practice thing. Sounds like you've got a pretty good method though!Question is, why are you worrying exclusively about technique? Remember, no one became great for being good at scales. Sure, you could become super fast like Yngwie Malmsteen, but people were always more impressed by his technical skill than his songwriting.
Pretty sure Ontario is leading the country in economic growth this year. Pretty sure Harper ran around for 9 years declaring Canada an energy superpower and going on about "Keystone, Keystone, Keystone XL pipeline!". How did that go?

Unfortunately nothing crazy.  They basically told her to leave me alone and if it bothered her so much then they could coordinate a time where we would not be eating in the break room together.  I didn't end up staying there much longer since it was just a summer job while I was in high school.

I'm not so worried about bullying. It's just the whole damn package. I think I've taught him well about majority of things, and I know he has common sense. But when he's with his friends...I think sense goes out the window!And dude, what is with the damn ATTITUDE towards me? No, it's a school night, you can't spend the night at a friend's. You never do. WHY DO YOU GET PISSY!?!
Totally. I always remember things about people, even if I only read one or two comments by them. There was a user who posted in FPH and got called out on it in SRD. I later recognized her in a linked thread.

Traditionally the Berlin Philharmonic recorded on Deutsche Grammophon has had a great reputation.  But I haven't kept up with the latest trends so I don't know if they've been surpassed by now.
I would guess that the carrot is losing moisture unevenly, probably from the outside in.  The stress that builds up as some parts of the carrot shrink faster than others would cause it to split, relieving the tension.
Oooooh, can you shoot me a link to the EPS, or let me know if you need me to PM you an email address? I'd probably be able to get it printed up pretty cheap around here.

Well seeing as all you need to make professional, consumer quality music is a DAW and headphones, I'd suggest that's all you need on the plane too.  Oh and don't forget your ears too.  Toys just distract you from making music
At first, yeah, there was a lot of complaining about the button itself. But I think now the general tone here is leaning towards not caring about the button itself, but not wanting it placed at the top left of the phone where you can't reach with one hand.

I find the Exercise Ring to be very lenient when it comes to what it considers 'exercise', but like Apple says, it's anything at or above a brisk walk, so maybe we walk brisker than most people haha
I hope to donate to a stranger.  I am in good physical health, but it may be that some of my medications for mental illness disqualify me.  I'm open to donating as soon as I'm cleared for donation!
I don't think people are playing hungry dragon correctly,  it still feels better than shredder in most cases for me.  I do think Rend was undervalue, but unless you go dragons, it is still pretty bad.  Did people think grimm patron was not going to be good in warrior?  Everywhere else it is pretty bad.

You get hella damage from their skills. Only downside is that you'd have to craft a bow for ranger equippable for most things til you have some stats to equip allclass bows. Eh, it doesn't really matter. You can easily craft a ロングボウ til you can use it with ranger. That'll last you a long, long while. Deadly Breeze is a strong potential for Ra/Br.  I don't think there's really a wrong way to level Ra/Br since you'd want both maxed out anyways.

Vote for him? Hell, I might even campaign for him. Gary Hart was the last candidate I, regretfully, did that for. Instead of growing a set, and telling the press to go fuck themselves, (like Clinton did over personal issues), Hart folded like a cheap suit.

yeah, but the way you worded it was weird. You said thank you for taking consideration for "future projects", which infers that you didn't think that riot took chromas into consideration in the first place.
In my league we get 2 starters, 2 relievers and 4 pitchers.  I keep 5 relievers on my roster.  At least two of these are closers and the other three are 2nd in line guys who get tons of relief appearances and have low era/whip.Scoring in my league for pitchers is W, Save, Outs, K's, ERA, Whip, RAPP
I see what you're saying.  Yeah, multiple months should help.  Summer months will be the tell tale sign for sure.  Even with the limited precipitation in the LA Basin, your data still shows there was a solid conservation effort over last year....so the maps are still valuable tools - even with the added 'noise' from the precipitation and weather situation.
I'm the opposite. I just can't get into a TV series. The way I look at it, they are really just super long movies. For instance, a show like breaking bad covers one story over the course of several seasons. It's like a 40 hour movie. On the other hand, I like TV shows where each episode is a distinct adventure, like Star Trek. 
I think the key term in that report is Income, as opposed to wealth. I imagine it would look rather different if it included capital gains and the like, where the big money is.
I don't speak for reddit nor do I want to sound like I do.  I've seen people talk about Vardags being better than Hjarnan, or Hjarnan not standing out like Forgiven or Freeze.  I don't agree with it, but people have differing opinions and I wanted to state mine that's all.
You would have to get your daily power usage and cost of electricity, then calculate your electricity costs. Estimating 500 watt power draw and ten cents per kwh .5kw x 24hrs = 12kwh12kwh x $0.10 = $1.20Next, estimate your income with the calculator at: http://dwarfpool.com/xmr/calc.3 kh mining power looks to bring in ~ $0.14-0.15 per day.  $0.15-$1.20 = -$1.05 = NOT PROFITABLEThat seems worse than I would have thought, so I may not know maths.  (I went to public school.)
I've only been in Meredith once, and I wasn't in my most right of mind.  But if I remember correctly, it's TINY.  I would say if you like what Meredith has to offer from the description above, look into Wiley.  It's similar, but with bigger rooms.I really don't think it's necessary to HAVE AC.  You only use it during August/September and maybe the very end of April/early May if you're lucky and it's super nice out.  So if that's something you're looking for, I would slightly suggest you think about it?Idk xD I'm rambling.
But there is no reward for the leaderboard, it's a pissing contest only. Same as when single player racing games have an online leaderboard, there are always people that have cheated it.I don't understand why you'd care about said leaderboard anymore than you'd care about how much karma you have.
Sorry for the late response, been busy.  Still a little busy but I have a minute.Picrd is a key character, fitting into the archetypal role of the wise old man.  (If you don't know about archetypes, its interesting.  I suggest at least a glance at Jungian archetypes)In your dream, you start in a cave, in the dark, captured by ogres who represent violence, barbarism.  You had given in to fate.  But it seemed like Picard, representing leadership and strength, gave you hope.  He was human, like you.  Your hope turned to disgust when he proposed intimacy.What other associations do you have with Picard?  Think about your outer world as well.  Like the people you know or places you've been.  Anything that comes to you when you think about Picard (or even star trek since they are directly related)
I feel like my school was super tame now. I mean, there wasn't many social cliques, but still in middle school there were kids who could barely hold hands with their "Boyfriend/Girlfriend".
I don't care as long as they're doing what they're most comfortable with. For all intents and purposes, any woman that walks into the bathroom while I'm in there is a woman regardless of their biological sex. Same goes for FTM transgenders using a men's restroom.

For two months our AMU had to write down the times we started and stopped any task during our shift.  They wanted us to account for every moment on shift basically.  So this made everything anyone did longer because they had to stop and write down times or just bullshit the whole thing at the end of the day.

The Witcher series is a very very lore based game.   The Witcher 3 is going to have plenty of cutscenes and a ton of dialogue/choices to make.    So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10% of just cutscenes.   I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes?   If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles.  However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total. Just trying to be honest and say it doesn't sound like your type of game.  Chances are it will win several GOTY awards especially in the RPG categories.   So its going to be an amazing game but that doesn't have to mean its your type of game.  
Cast On, Bind Off is definitely a great resource.I love all of my Tin Can Knits books, they're such well written patterns.And Socks from the Toe Up is amazing for reference and patterns.
I've seen this question a few times, but the short answer is yes.  Long answer: Its multifactorial, but includes the most important difference, course management.  Also, many people think they're hitting really well on the range because they only pay attention to distance and trajectory, make sure you're picking targets for every shot at the range, keeping in mind your distances on the course will vary.  Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.  Practice chipping and putting as much, if not more than everything else.  One last thing I see a lot is people rushing their shots, forgetting about grip, setup, and tempo.
Coming back to my high school. It's a small private school with 25 roughly in each grade. I am living at home for the time being and he participates in everything. I hate coming back here. It's awful.
Exactly this.  People claim they play to have fun, but when the game is "unwinnable", they back out.  That's the perfect time to pull out the fun class and NGAF about the match.  Just go around blasting people with a silly gun.Start quickscoping, run around with launchers, try to trickshot, use a knife class, whatever you find fun.
It was pretty obvious to me, but that's subjective. I agree that it's not a big deal though- that's my point.If they'd, for some reason, plastered a photo of a penis on their sign, I'd say it was grossly inappropriate and suspect it was in violation of some sort of public decency laws. With the current sign, I question their intelligence but not their intent. Similarly, with the Bud Light thing, I think it's pretty clear that they were not trying to say, "Use alcohol as an excuse to ignore it when people say they don't want to have sex with you."
I don't think so, among people like friends or family members you want to differentiate between a normal shout and a cat/dog/toddler/neighbour/toddler/alien just ran onto the range cease fire immediately kind of shout.         And there's no reason you should be grabbing your bow when you retrieve your arrows anyway
I'm scared to jinx it by even saying anything. Honestly, with the number of picks we have, we can do some damage if we are smart about the moves me wake. I think they're definitely thinking into the future. 
How thick is the leather? I carry my wallet in my front pocket so I don't want anything super thick. Do you think you'll ever get any other colors and what other colors are even available? How would you describe the leather besides rough? Would it scratch my skin? Etc.Do you have your own store online somewhere or do you just take orders from Reddit? How does that work?I currently use [this](http://makr.com/angle-wallet-ox-blood-horween-chromexcel-leather) wallet and I really like it. I like the angle as I think it makes it easier to get to cards in the middle. What would something like that cost?Thanks for answering all the questions. I'm pretty interested. The leather does look rough but looks really interesting too. 
Aside from the fact that I can't imagine any queen talking like this, there's no way that a queen would confront a fanfiction Tumblr on anon. Seems like a bad fake.

It certainly does - I know I tend to set people up on pedestals and then get incredibly frustrated when their real life counterparts don't live up to my vision of them in my head.I think experiences are valuable, whether they're good or bad.

No just straight PG.  So what it takes 5 hits not 2 to get to where I want to be?  If I wanted to I could make my own EJMIX as they charge way to much for it.  Its just a mixture of glycols (PEG, PG, and VG IIRC).

I keep getting redirected to these guys and this price (also Buffalo Wild Wings, with a similarly awful cover charge). I agree with you, $25 per person for entry alone is absurd.

&gt;There has been a donation system, it's been largely a joke.Well, because it hasn't been done exactly right. Selling Skyrim mods (per installation) is a thoroughly bad idea. A lot of mods depend on other mods. So, either mods that are used in other mods would have to be free and copylefted (so their creators get nothing) or there should be a whole system in the workshop that tracks mod dependencies and makes you buy/install all required mods. But all of that would require extensive curation which Valve did not want to do.Without a system to track all of this, payment model that Valve chose is simply incompatible with how mods are actually made currently, and it would be impossible to make that system make sense. 
Hi! Can you tell us about the process around system thinking that is a tool of storytelling? How hard/easy is it in your sense to tie story lines into each other as you are in the midst of now. Thanks! Big fan! Great work!
I dunno, google dlift theory crafting.  Anyone that you click will probably be sufficient evidence.Edit: but on a serious note when they made the changes to adc itemization he predicted tristana would be bad, surprise she was probably the number one pick.  Secondly why do you think tri was bad then?  Just because doublelift said it?  Even his explanation of why triforce is bad is dumb.  Also dlift was relevant because half the video was mocking him being wrong.
When people say they're offended, they are basically saying, "I don't want to deal with my negative emotions about this, so now I'm making them your problem."
Well, that's why most IT certs now you just pay the yearly maint fee and keep up on continuing ed. That's how most professional licenses work.That being said, if that's the route we're going to imitate, I'd prefer to just do it for real then. Make an actual non-profit IT licensing body in each state, or nationally, and have them come up with standardized licenses. A better solution for employers so they know exactly what they're getting in a candidate, and a better solution for candidates so they're not paying a bunch of money to 2-3 certification companies every year. If a hairdresser can be licensed, an IT guy can.
Thanks yrdrazi, it looks like both the Longbow and Warbow need some attention so if this set gets in I would be more than happy to look into doing a Warbow as well. I love hearing what you all are looking for in items, please keep sharing your ideas! 
Oh you mean exactly like today? Except most it's blank looks with slight embarrassment. It's like saying "did you hear about the internet-riots, they are about the dumbest things imaginable?"
The Termites didn't kill Bob. Ghost Martin tried that same argument in Tyreese's boot episode, and Ghost Bob was like "that's stupid, I got bit at the food bank...". Rick was not right. The way they did it instead, the Termites killed no one and Rick's group killed all of them.Glenn and Michonne are the good guys. Daryl too. 
If Labour said they were going go into coalition with the SNP with the current feeling in England, they would expose themselves to huge English backlash. And England is so much more important for labour at this stage, given that they are basically non existent in Scotland now.

They talk about current events and bullshit for an hour and a half.

At the time of airing the episode, if you go by BMI, yes, he was overweight. Also, 25 is considered overweight by that scale so even now, that isn't far off. Either way, the point is BMI is shit so this conversation doesn't matter really.
I did! We are reading everyone's kind words together.  His Lego creations earn more internet points than my own posts for sure!Edit:  HE also just asked me for a soda. "Come on, I just got you a ton of internet points!" Y'all have created a monster! Or maybe just a Mixel...
Not sure what to take from this.I'll say that I was more aggressive than I'm used to when it comes to 'debate'. I felt like pressing my point forward, instead of just trying to contradict OP. It's a nice perspective to have, I think; to be paying Riot for what they've given you in experience and a quality time in League of Legends. It's one worth sharing, no?So in the case that you wanted to kick me in the head because I sounded like (pardon the French) a twat, I don't necessarily blame you. I probably could've sounded a lot more disciplined. With that said, I don't necessarily want to. This is /r/leagueoflegends, after all; I'm not an alien and I don't want to present myself like one.We're here for eSports news, PBE updates, YouTuber videos, recent drama and all that other good stuff that comes from here. Not the Politician's Handbook on Undermining your Enemy.
Cap's role hasn't really changed besides not being in the front line of the battles. The story right now is pretty captivating and interesting (Hickman's Avengers/New Avengers). I haven't read Falcon Cap, but I heard it was pretty good. 
My girlfriend and I usually pack about 4/5 of my air stem with some really potent bud and vape on green usually unless we're going to bed I'll put it up to yellow or red. Usually gets me to a solid 5 or 6 and a couple rips for her gets her at a solid 7 or 8 while I finish off the bowl. (I've got a decently high tolerance) smoking a packed stem to myself gets me close to an 8. The air in my situation is efficient as fuck.
Woah that's crazy. My hair is a little more on the strawberry blonde side (looks dark in the picture though) but everything else is quite similar. Even from the side. You actually found my doppelgänger!
That doesn't actually invalidate the man's point. If your stats can easily bail you out of your situation - whether that's a fight, a trap-filled dungeon, or a diplomacy scene - why waste time and resources being clever about it?
So women and men differ in their use of information channels. Does this really translate into simpler communication, and how would you measure that? Are men less able to communicate complex concepts because they rely less on body language? I don't think that's the case. I would be convinced of relative simplicity in men if it could be shown that men think and feel with less intensity or less complexity than women. I don't think that's the case either. 
I think you have to add "apart from in the fox ditto" to everything you say about Armadas fox. You don't just beat leffen (and other top foxes) the way he does in the ditto with "only" shinespikes etc. Nor do you get to grandfinals of Apex, never lose to HBox so far (although sandstorm was close), and win the tournaments of the magnitude Armada is currently winning.
No I'm actually not sure he is male. My friend said he was and I never cared to check because I don't plan to breed him. I could have the vet check I suppose. I don't feel comfortable doing it myself.  
Be very careful of being hit with an airport exit tax.  I don't know what the situation is like today, but as recently as one year ago it was about $56.
I dont know which one I like more. One is used after letting it soak in hot water for 10 minutes while you're in the shower (Williams) while the other can be used whenever, wherever by applying directly to the face and brushing it in (Arko). Both cost about the same, smell about the same, produce the same results. CVS used to carry Williams, shame they don't anymore.
I believe that one big consensus is that software patents are far too broad, last too long, and that in most cases are used by trolls prevent building real devices/applications instead of protecting stuff that actually gets built. Apple spends more on patents than R&amp;D for example.
To me it doesn't matter that much if they are actually trans, or if they're legit just a regular guy and the men's room is full.Some creepy dude trying to get their rocks off? GTFOTrans girl just looking for a safe place to potty? Come on in.Men's room is full and your bladder is going to burst in the next minute? Just get in and do your business and get out like everyone else is trying to do.
I am still using them. I switched over to some Cobra 1960kv motors. I am using BLHeli 13.1 and performance is great. No sync issues whatsoever. If you use the Afro or Turnigy tool it talks to the Simonk bootloader. If you go to flash it and it asks you what bootloader to use make sure to use Simonk (or have it leave the bootloader alone).I also flashed BLH on some ZTW Spider 30a that I am using to run some 2600kv Sunnysky motors on 4s. Works perfectly even at those RPMS, though I found that using medium-high timing instead of medium made it seem more responsive in the low end.
Honestly I would love to see Barry have some fun with his powers like Quicksilver did in X men. (making guys punch each other, hitting them with frying pans, merely poking their face at high speed.)
I know you already changed your position to reflect immuno-compromised kids, but I'd like to say anyway:My nieces *are* immuno-compromised and do rely on the so-called "herd immunity" of having every other kid in their class be vaccinated.  Something like a cold can hospitalize them; it's very dangerous.
to be fair its the last decent CoD Edit: ok since u guys are fighting its the last decent single player CoD the rest are rubbish in the SP department with CoD2 having everything wrong in the series the regenerative health the never ending enemies the crappy check points and i can go on about this forever 
Ah, my bad, I misread it.  Still seems a bit sillier, the cost of delivering Bitcoin would be less than delivering gold, so I would expect a reasonable number for redemption.  Say you would need a minimum of $100K of gold, maybe it makes sense to have $10K for Bitcoin delivery.
The more simpleminded fools fail to realise that international culture is American culture. We have immense soft power on a scale never before seen. We're the most powerful human civilisation to ever exist. Look at the vast amount of English loanwords into German (and practically every language). Just because we can't go back to Otto der Grosse in the history book doesn't mean we lack culture. See how many Germans are addicted to BK or any of the other multinational American fast food corporations. Let alone, all the products America produces, iPhones, Android, and on and on.
Perhaps you're right, perhaps not.  We would have to discuss that.  But the point of my post was to explain why the flowchart that was posted earlier today is flawed.
On that note, my impression is that multi-impact lids are never certified. Is that true? Can anyone point towards one that is? Who wants to replace a helmet every time they crash - shits pricy (in b4 'so are hospitals')

As much as I want to pin this on Mets announcers, he did. Last time he was angrily gesturing at Ramos in the dugout and got quiet when Ramos went back in after his PA.

Does that mean that OP's Voldemort is mostly screwed? Several of his Hocruxes are in space. Whichever character takes him on doesn't even need to destroy all of them - just the ones that are easily accessible.Also, can't Voldy or his followers .... I dunno. Use the summoning charm to drag his Hocrux from Mars?

I'm not wrong about the science. A supposed 0.7 degree rise in temperature over a 150 year period as we come out of an ice age is nothing to worry about. Temperatures have been flat since 1998. There is no urgent crisis. This is also a very telling statement:&gt; I said I have a lower carbon footprint than others in the society I live in.That implies that people in first world countries are morally allowed to have a bigger carbon footprint than those in third world countries. But you're also admitting that your carbon footprint is bigger than most other people in the rest of the world. So therefore you're actually part of the problem. 
Another stick of RAM was something I was already thinking of. Quick and easy way to help with my multitasking.As for the motherboard and PSU, do you have recommendations available? For relatively small increases these are very much worth it to me.CPU I'll probably stick with. Overall overclocking is probably not something I will deal with. GPU, unless there's an alternative in the same price range I'll probably stick with, and add a second in about a year, and be prepared to replace in 2-3 years.Thanks!

Actually, I'm pretty sure the median pay for Kindergarten teachers and your average programmer aren't off that much. A quick Google search shows me that it's about 54k vs. 59k.
&gt;Wild Blue clone.This is going to be tricky. Blueberries, like most fruits, ferment out pretty dry. When you dump a ton of them into a beer, the result is usually pretty tart since all of the sugar turns to alcohol and you're left with a lot of acidity and tannins. To get anything close to as sweet as Wild Blue you'd really have to backsweeten the beer, which is easy if you can force carbonate but trickier if you have to bottle condition, since you'll probably need to use an unfermentable sweetener.

I love this podcast. But I don't get how an "audio only" podcast shared on a video platform is a gift to the youtube fans? It's like that wooden pickle that kid made in "Bad Santa". It's really sweet, but borderline retarded. This will be my only complaint for the rest of 2015.
I assumed so, perception for finding traps and mechanics for disarming. But I've made a little research and everyone says it's mechanic skill that's responsible for detection as well as disarming, so now I don't know... If that's the true, all that perception is a waste...The ingame description is "Perception represents a character's senses as well as their instinctive ability to pick up on details. In interactions, it can be used to catch someone in a lie, to make an observant comment about their appearance, or to notice something happening in the background. In combat, it contributes to the Deflection and Reflex defenses and grants a bonus to Interrupt." So it suggest it's responsible for spotting things...
I think the 'in the works' deal is Jetlines.  They're going to use (IIRC) Vancouver and Winnipeg as hubs.  My impression of them is more Spirit than Porter.  I'm guessing you'll have no frills, low seat pitch... I wouldn't hold my breath for espressos and shortbread and spaciously-configured Q400s :)But yeah, maybe this estimate is based on the small handful of Delta flights, rather than with Jetlines calling YWG a hub... Dunno -- it just stuck out to me when I was reading over the new budget measures!  It'll be interesting to see.
I saw that the PPV costs $100 at home ($90 for nonHD thanks for the cheaper option)  if that's what they are trying to charge B Dubs there's no way they would do it. Anyways it's boxing and doesn't matter so I'm sure they'll just pass. 
I have on two separate occasions, both times the seller listed the reason for selling was that they received the product as a gift but didn't want it.Looking back, I can't believe I bought makeup off Gumtree, but both times the product arrived fine and seemed to be legit! I wouldn't do again though, I think I just got lucky.
Insurance doesn't pay for investments that fail to make a return. Insurance is for outright lost or damaged investments that occur outside what would be considered normal risk.
Imagine for a minute that you have a 6-year old kid. Let's say he/she is alone with a male babysitter. This male babysitter exposes himself to your kid. Wouldn't that make your kid uncomfortable? Traumatized?  This would land the babysitter in jail for exposing himself to a minor, not to mention being added to the sex-offender list.Now as for the open shower, this is very similar to the baby sitter scenario. The only difference is it's the parents who take their kids to the showers to see the naked adults and there's no crime involved.This is totally different when kids see other kids their age naked. Adults are authoritative figures to kids that's why I think they're more vulnerable.
Basically, it's up to the staff's discretion.  They're pretty lenient, but if there is something (ie. strobe light) that is distracting to everyone they may ask you to turn it off.

I don't think counting a player more than once would be a problem, first because it would be a rare occurrence, but also because one point is not going to significantly skew the distribution of a larger sample size.Anyway, I found this really interesting - and would love to see something being done over a larger sample size.
Superman would be on with it. He can get where he needs and fast enough to deal with the grain of sand because he can cut them all within a reasonable amount of time. as for the ones on mars and beyond...not much anyone can do to stop him once far enough from earth.
It would be very difficult. Originally there was just a large area filled with tables and booths. But they spent a couple of months remodeling the area in order to turn that part of the store into the "Market Café". We also hired a few dozen waiters, waitresses, chefs, and managers in order to run the café and changing it back would mean letting those people go. Some shoppers are confused because they are accustomed to getting their food from one part of the store, e.g. Chinese express, Italian express, the deli, etc. and would go to the booths and enjoy their food there, however now they see that there is a restaurant and may be confused. These customers are more than welcome to enjoy their food inside the restaurant, but we are still in a sort of a transitioning stage as you can see by /u/ScottWalkerSucks post. I hope this helped shed some light on the topic, if you have any questions feel free to ask me, or anyone in the store and we would more than happy to help.

Out of the top 32 kickers last year, there were 90 50+ FGs made.90/32 = 2.8 average per kicker.So, they only happen, on average, less than once every 5 games per kicker.To put this in perspective, out of the top 10 kickers last year, 32 FGs were made from 50+, for an average of only 3.2 made per kicker.  Still only once per five games.And, as I mentioned elsewhere, the #1 kicker (Gostkowski) had only 1 from 50+ yards.

I'm doing alright this week. I'm in finals week (last exam tomorrow!) then I have to drive back home. Because of this I won't be seeing the new avengers but instead I'll be busy packing and cleaning up this weekend. Should be real fun.
I've had this dream a couple of times, the first time was when i went to bed stoned and it was awesomeMy family and I go to a dinner party at my dad's boss' house, who in the dream is super duper rich and lives in the mountains. I spend my time in the basement, meeting all the other kids my age, from like 5-18. I meet this semi-scene chick, we sneak out and hike to this giant ass purple waterfull that is super fucking wide and looks amazing. we take the bridge over the waterfall, but then the wind throws her off. I jump to save her...And I wake up. the first time it was really vivid and it felt like a movie, while the second time it was like pressing the skip button on the dvr, getting glimpses. then again the second time i wasnt stoned so yea. EDIT: i was 17 when i had the dream both times.

It's the fucking worst. One time I was making a run for a party and I was like 2 mins past the hour they stop and dude wouldn't sell it to me. I had to drive 45 mins to this town next me that's 24/7. Also they stop super early on Sundays.

I work at a company that has software with expansive barcoding abilities, and have spent a little time trying to decode the other barcode. It looks pretty darn similar to a PDF417 barcode commonly found on FedEX labels. I've tried a few different barcode scanners and  only one "successfully" scans this barcode, but only returns a &lt;CR&gt; (carriage return) I figured there would be a bit more information in there... 
It can be done! Truly. It even gets easier to the point of frustration if you can't find the Black market once you've made it a few times. Keep at it.

Bomb all who dare oppose you. World 4-4: Position Olmec so that he sinks directly underneath the doorway above the lava. World 5: Don't die. Good luck!
Ok, so your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31.6. Normal weight is 18-25, overweight is 25 to 30, and obese is over 30. I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries. You might want to steer away from this, but I understand if your food budget would not allow it. 
With stride you do not need to legion immediately, you're better off just striding to get some cards to hand and not go through extraneous effort to legion right away to get your deck rolling.
I woke up this morning way earlier than usual. Realised I slept through the evening and wasn't on TPP as usual. Got my phone, logged on, happily posted a story and went on to the TPPLeague Chat to hang out. Was also mentally preparing for round 2 of the forced lore debates.Then OfHyenas alerted us to Lyra's post. All I can say is that this morning has been quite a bit of unexpected turmoil emotionally.
is your vet going to have trouble refilling her prescription or are you set for the season?i can't wait to start my girl on it, even if its just one month of relief. i'm just blown away that the company didn't foresee this much demand.
Most analysts think Vince is training the subscriber base to pick and choose with all the free months. The argument is he isn't generating a solid baseline of users, he's generating freeloaders who will cancel and resubscribe as they please.  Originally they were saying they would offer Mania 30 and reconsider it for Mania 31. People at the WWE basically told Vince people weren't going to go back after paying 9.99 and the general idea is that Vince has kind of killed the idea of Mania being a premium.

Wouldnt it be fun if one of these people in this conversation mentioned that TF2 (more or less), Cs, cs:cz, cs:source, cs:go, dota2 and even Dota 2 from Warcraft 3 are practicly made by the people in this program. People like them. Shouldnt they be able to find a loophole in the economy of things and earn money from these kind of things? Its quite ironic, that these people who have bashed and gone on craze about the monetizing of mods are probably playing mods for free and earned ALOT of money (in time) thanks to modders hard work already?
Well, at least two are in the same city. Give him credit for that at least. And perhaps Florida was his alma mater? You a Lightning fan, btw? Congrats on the Game 7 win. I'm not really interested in the Eastern Conference (aside from Montreal), so I'll be getting my first taste of watching Tampa Bay play multiple times. 
Ahhh, Chabby. Eternally stalking me. Dots n bubbles got on that kick the first time i compared Rcon to /r/Whiterights. It's totally missing the point of /r/conservative!=conservatives. SPS is usually offended at this place because of that crucial step of thinking. 
she already knows they're nice pictures don't tell her the same shit the other guys are responding to those same pictures with. you can mistakenly enter a girls frame getting all impressed by her talents.  your response is so fake, it just seems like your trying to only say what you think she wants to hear.STIMULATE HER BRAIN. when you respond with something that is bold, it's like a dumb person seeing something shiny. It pulls their attention. The trick is to do it tastefully.
You say you've voted R in the past, so Bernie would most likely diverge from your interests more than not. But concerning things that directly affect you as an international citizen:Bernie opposes the NSA. The NSA records internet traffic globally, even more than it does in the US.Bernie is anti-war. I can't imagine the US invading Thailand any time soon, but if you're concerned about international cooperation and opposed imperialism in general, Bernie is your man over anyone else.
I cannot stand men who say "We're pregnant!" No. You're not pregnant. Your SO is pregnant. But I'm fine with, and prefer, "We're expecting" if they're going to insist on "we" anything.
Well, my best advice in the meantime is start programming in your free time. You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming.
Notice how the DLC is priced in yen - they're talking about what's been announced for the Japanese release. The article even says this:&gt;  In Japan, Nintendo has announced four different versions of the title. 
I Have mine in the Box mainly because i like to stack them but they look awesome outside of the box too :)My first Pop(s) were Buzz Lightyear Zurg and an Alien from toystory
&gt; The guy is too predictableHe's not any more or less predictable than anyone else? Your just trying to come up with some reason to balance his 'nuts aim and fragging ability' He does have good aim but so do a lot of other pros he's just got the spotlight on him, he doesn't just win every 1 for 1 trade.
Hmm. I've heard (ha) otherwise. My dad (who is partially deaf in one ear, former cop) says they are amazing, allows him to hear so much more, even claiming to hear a distant plane with them on.
Aside from winning lane (which Ziggs is good at, especially against Mord. I mained him in diamond last season), you should've won team fights with your comp. Yes, you have one main tank and bruiser top laner/tankish support. But you can zone Jinx out through landing your ult/placing your minefield towards her direction. Once you do that, basically your user will CC anyone attempt to go for your back line while you guys as a team focus that person. Unless it was Ali, everyone on your team could have focused. Or have Diana/Tristana dive into Jinx if she didn't respect your abilities. Mord was a bit fed but you have yourself to blame for that, he can one shot almost anyone on your team unless MR/QSS/Crucible are used. However, they did somewhat out pick your team. But the game is still very winnable if you play correctly along with your team, but they more so rely on you since you're the control Mage. On top of that, you had the benefit of Mord/Darius falling off (more so Darius).
It's been that way virtually since the beginning. All those wordy infographics are useless for recruitment because they assume a large amount of prerequisite knowledge.  But they're *really good* for maintaining the rage.
I had a few chats with him before the account deletion, as seen here: http://imgur.com/a/ohSM4 then, I messaged Spycrabs and he danced around the question, not answering. Then, as seen here http://www.reddit.com/r/april30th2015/comments/34gf2w/i_honestly_think_usavethespycrabs_is_telling_the/cquf8t5?context=3 /u/20150501 answered all the questions.
Keep in mind that without government, people couldn't work without a minimum wage due to no fallback on welfare. I'm guessing this is why libertarians clamor for UBI. This way, all burden is removed from business to be responsible. Anyway, I've seen enough studies on [the negligible effect minimum wage has on overall employment](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/04/09/what-happened-to-fast-food-workers-when-san-jose-raised-the-minimum-wage/) that at this point, when I see libertarians going nuts about a gradual increase in order to meet price of living increases, it's just pathetic to read.
I think it could work. Make a module with four or eight or so pods on it. Oxygen tank, battery, beacon. Load it up, have the last guy hit a button (linked to a timer block), unmerge it, and push it out with a piston. That way you're not careening through space (or wasting space by attaching a thruster) but you can rest assured you'll be thrown away from the exploding ship.
Continuing to get better, I got a call from one of my bosses and he wants to hire me for a side deal he has going with the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to do security this summer, and I found a decent server to play Minecraft on. Its been a pretty decent day.Oh and I have the first flutterings of NRE with a new poly partner, but they may be premature. Time will tell...
He definitely just let me have a good cry. We're a pretty good duo. It's hard though because he's freshly graduated and landed an amazing job in his field. But it's super demanding and he's realizing that he's underqualified but that no one else was willing to do the job he has. So he's stressed enough, and we try to leave our "work troubles" at the coat rack. God I'm sorry I'm so rambly. 
I'm from Europe but I'm traveling right now. I've met a lot of people from America and sometimes get that question. Does that mean my accent is good, or so weird that they can't place it anywhere.
It is. This video is entirely about what is within your own control. He reiterates it constantly, talking about what you can and can not change. Their detachment from externalities such as material wealth does not mean that the Stoics were completely indifferent. As Chrysippus said: “’They are insane who make wealth, health, freedom from pain, soundness of  body of no account and who do not cling  to such things’”[ \(Long 1997, 20\)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2041-5370.1997.tb02260.x/abstract). 
I have the buckshot ones and the recoil is tame for buck. It holds 2x the amount your guns typical capacity. I have an extension tube so I can typically hold 9+1, which is 18+1 minis.
ELI5 why is this a good thing? I know nothing about construction but if it can be done in 19 days, is the rest of the world stupid? Something's ducky here.

Thunderball Fists makes me sad. I found one in the first month of playing and it waS AWESOME. Then I lost it when the game crashed a week later. In the year since I have not found another.
The major problem I see is that you would be attempting to hang your hammock with a near-zero suspension angle with respect to horizontal.  If you don't know why this could be very problematic, play around with the hammock hang calculator linked in the sidebar. (Hint - watch the suspension tension force as angle w.r.t. horizontal approaches zero)Additionally, the main point of a structural ridgeline is to create the same hammock sag every time you set up.  With your proposed system, the two hammock prussik knots would have to be totally repositioned each hang, unless the tree separation distance happened to be *exactly* the same as the last time you set up.  So what's the point of even having a structural ridgeline if you have to adjust the length every time you hang anyway?
Mine!  My leadership thought it'd be super cool to pin me on when we were at cruising altitude, I didn't care either way.  My jet had other plans and we had a no shit life threatening in-flight emergency that required an immediate return to our TDY location.  I ended up getting pinned on in the middle of an inflight turned ground emergency with the fire department ordering our evacuation.  I am the only one that I know that has almost died during a promotion.  
&gt; multi-billion dollar corporationWell.... standard approach for many would be hire some trolls to run the .sucks domain, give them insider info so they can sound legit and have them gather up all your detractors.Take a look at water4gas scam for a small-time example where effort has been put into this, they own all the negative domains and control all opposition. (hey actually google is much improved on this keyword, now showing legit stuff rather than fake opposition, used to be flood of shill websites)Evil of course, but it is a billion dollar corporation, so that's to be expected.
Are superstars as versatile as Stan smiths? I copped some cheap  classic white with black striped ones and have been wearing em with raws and some simple tops white and grey tees. What else could I wear with em? Inspo? 
Yeah, I just wanted something to laugh about in the background. I'm a nerd, I spend election day reading exit polls and visiting election board sites.
Mini crits are given on double donks.You want to charge it enough to where it will explode within .5 seconds after hitting the enemy. So that the explosion also damages the enemy right after hitting
Right, and my point is that poor people generally live in the cheapest housing they can find. Because they're rational actors. What exactly are you objecting to?
Raising the interest rate will by itself lower demand for oil (and the price) by contracting the economy, BUT they only raise the interest rate when they think the economy is expanding (in order to keep the growth around 3%ish) which means demand for oil is already going up (and the price).In conclusion kinda sorta yes, kinda sorta no. The price is influenced by the interest rate but I think there are better indicators.

I mean the word superfluous comes to mind. Im not an analytical chemist nor do i plan to be. Im in the class now which necessitates the understanding of the effective use and mechanism of action of instrumental techniques. And Ill have my degree in chemistry in two weeks so i guess i didnt have such a bad time. You make it like you can judge me and give non-constructive criticism for something that is besides the point of my statement whether it be correct or not. 
I may be mistaken, but "lookded" is not a word. Perhaps you meant "looked?" Occasionally, people might verbally add sounds when pronouncing words (eg. some midwesterners pronounce "wash" as "warsh"), but it doesn't change the spelling.
I like Hendrick but a bit of a meaningless article. Neither player was a high pick or is projected to make the lineup in the next couple of years. Nikita may be a sleeper but we'll see.

But now suddenly something that was intended to cost money doesn't. It sure sounds nice but then again so does having free anything. The game you are playing is free to play and Riot is a company so they want to make profit. Does it seem like robbery to you to pay for these skin? Maybe but it's still not 10% of the robbery companies like ubisoft are commiting so just live with it. Different ways for payment (like 1 at a time) are reasonable proposals but free stuff is a lot to ask for.
I had a friend show up to a fantasy baseball Draft absolutely drunk with a few names written on a torn envelope.  I'm pretty sure he dominated that league that year.  
I guess it's just a difference in opinion. I don't feel you deserve the content if you don't earn it. It's hardly game-changing. It's an achievement because you achieved something.As for it being luck, I don't know if I agree with that either. Before I took a break from Isaac I was winning the lost about 4-6 times out of 10, no resets. You do not have to be lucky if you're skilled.
Be forewarned,you are going to see someone suggest a Ti West movie or two. Personally I would suggest NOT to waste your time. I didn't see boring in your description! I do agree with The Babdook though,great movie!

It took Medieval scientists a long time to tune the Earth to make it take exactly 365 days to go around the sun.  They didn't quite succeed, which is why we have that extra day every fourth year.

There's an argument that part of getting out of debt is about generating momentum. Not only does it give you a good feeling to retire out debts, the more that you close out, the less you need to keep track of as you continue the process. From that standpoint, making a mistake if you end up having a hard time juggling it could cost you more money than what you'd save if you went after the highest interest loan first. I'd close out the smaller ones. You'll feel great when you retire them and get some momentum to go after the last one.
I don't care his opinion, I take issue with him talking down to people who disagree with his point. He thinks that anyone who disagrees are smelly neck beards.
I'm a troll because I don't agree with you? That's literally how a four year old reasons. Also, why admit that you're too lazy to check usernames before hurling insults? Fucking psycho. 
It's actually controversial, I know a lot of people enjoyed the Akame ga kill ending with the amount of episodes they had left. Especially the manga readers because the manga is more of a fuck you compared to the anime. I for one liked the ending.
[Here's my favorite high jump video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HspzxKXhpzk)  Check video of your jumps and see if you're getting that same lean away from the bar at takeoff.  If you're not leaning away from the bar, you're just going to go forward.
&gt; I just became an Angelos fan.A lot of people did, including a great many Oriole fans. I don't think it was really intentional, or manipulative, but that man just completely re-formed the public image of his entire family. I don't think I can underestimate the impact it's had. Nearly everyone I've talked to in Baltimore this week has brought up his Twitter rants. The Angelos name just went from shit (unfairly so, despite some lows) to respected and admired. Well, lots of people probably still think Peter's an ass, but John's image is set.
"Voted NO on establishing nationwide AMBER alert system for missing kids. (Apr 2003)." Is there a reason for this? It seems like a good idea to me, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.
Palutena.For starters, Palutena was my most wanted newcomer for Sm4sh. Her reveal trailer got me more hype than any other character. Kid Icarus Uprising, very obviously, is one of my favorite games (up there with Mario 64 and Monster Hunter). In terms of how she plays, Palutena is the perfect fit for me. She's a great mix of defensive play and offensive play. A lot of her aerial and smashes space and combo well, and some customs (Super Speed) make her an easy character to approach with. Though I know her flaws and how much of a challenge it is to overcome them, that only means I get to have more fun playing as her when I train. 
Mason here. Looks awesome, congrats!! If any single bricks fall off try sticking them back on with PL Premium by Loktite. I personally like it a lot more than liquid nails. It's the strongest adhesive I've come across by far. I've been doing a lot of this thin veneer style the past couple years. Even on CMU walls that could handle full sized stone. They have really cool products out there like real field stone and granite that's cut wicked thin.Anyway, looks good. Now that you know how easy it is you can veneer anything!
Enjoy! And don't worry about specifics with regard to the recipe. I am planning my next batch to include sour cream instead of HWC, and topping them with salsa instead of green onions. I can't wait!
I've played on servers with proper auto balancers. If you are getting perma banned because of a language filter, is it even a decent server? I've played with admins of servers where scripts make their lives 10x easier because they are still there to play and not carry out each action all game long instead.
but... he *did* yield. he attempted to go. he couldn't. he stopped. he hit no one, and the fact that a bike went down BEHIND the vehicle that he almost turned in front of proves the rider didn't have enough control.
Aw, this is awesome! You must be a super fast builder to put some of those together in just a day. I'd say the police station is my favorite "realistic" one, and the dollhouse is my favorite "fantasy" one.

He's probably understandably frustrated, but he should also understand that these are pitchers being thrown into the rotation without being fully ready for it. 
So you've just worked through Griffiths? Sure, I could list a bunch of impossible textbooks, but that's not very helpful. In my opinion, Townsend's  Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics is the best book for people at your level. It is mathematically rigorous while doing a fantastic job of explaining the material. One of my top favorite textbooks from any category. 
Civilians with body cams.  Can't believe I'm saying that.  People are not great at recalling events.  They could definitely be there to ensure compliance... but...A contracter contracted out a security guard recently at my job that was in his 60's.  Not a bad guy, and his job wasn't hard.  The contractors set up a video camera to do their repair, he just had to make sure they complied with the video camera (signing off on each video and repair), and he had to keep track of keys.Well, the old man put 67 keys into 67 'security envelopes', with the specific customers account number located inside the security envelope.Face palm.  Chain of custody is fucked because I didn't realise how bad he fucked it until he left.  Contractors gonna sub contract out as cheap as they can.

What Seth said, you essentially want it like 4th/5th/6th into the build. its sixth here because you're adc and your main dps will be crit but you can extend your dps by alot with oddy bow last item. Whereas other builds that aren't adc like Warrior Tabi, Ichi, Exe, can get Oddy 4th item.

There is only one correct answer here, and that is:http://www.samplemodeling.com/en/index.phpThese guys will blow your mind.  Watch the demos - it's phenomenal.  I have "The Sax Brothers" collection and it's truly the most convincing sax I've ever heard.  Even better if your got a breath controller.The rest of their demos are worth watching.  I'm not sure what their technology is, but since it's Kontakt based, it's got to be samples - but each horn must be made up of like 250 well-cross faded samples.Anyway, check it out.  If you like sax, these are well worth the money!
Cersei is willing to play nice, but there's zero sincerity in her attitude. She's only trying to stay in a position of power and comfort, and if that means lying through her teeth, then she'll be as kind as possible. But she means exactly none of it, and she will not take this lying down. Margery is a marked woman, and I only hope she understands that and starts having someone sample her food and brings in House Tyrell security, at the very least until she has Tommen's heir. (Or a couple of them.) I love Margery, but her being top bitch is not yet guaranteed.
&gt; Nobody can convince me someone in that state is safe to drive.It's sort of self regulating, though.  When I was young and dumb, we went on the rule of thumb that if you're sober enough to actually get to and start the car, you're sober enough to drive it.  There's probably some truth to that.  
Yeah I've had former classmates complain about how they never learned certain things in school, but I'd mention that I did learn it. So maybe their actual problem is they didn't pay any attention and didn't retain anything.
I was thinking the same thing! Dude! It's on sticks! WTF is the deal!? Unless the platform they are on is shaking, which is a possibility...and horribly obnoxious. 
Ah bah oué, si c'était des gens on dirait "des gens", logique.Ça et les threads sur l'abstention, ou le féminisme, ou le végétarisme et ses dérivés... nope nope nope.
My Christian boyfriend respects my belief and I his. Shoot more for mutual respect than having the exact same belief system. If that respect can be achieved, at least that part of your relationship will work. 
You're absolutely correct. The post was a bit hasty, I'll update it now, however I'll be using the car as a daily driver, and also as a sport/weekend performance car (basically pushing the car on the streets, possibly track if I find the time)
&gt;You know things have gone down the drain when Europeans have to fear islamic attacks in their own countries.Except I was noting that just because Europe has terrorist troubles doesn't mean it's down the drain.
He's talking about the armours, not the canon character of Osiris. Look at [this picture](http://www.destinygamewiki.com/images/5/54/Trials_of_osiris_gear1.jpg) and tell me the Warlock armour isn't supposed to be Anubis. 
Christian as well here, but I don't think divorce is unholy in this day and age. I mean, sometimes it is actually much better, or safer, and I think that it's different now.
I'm pretty sure this is actually supposed to open up your eyes to abuse, not approve it, the last line sounds really satirical. This wasn't actually made to condone hitting men, quite the opposite actually.(Yeah yeah, I know I'm going to be down voted for going against the circle jerk, whatever)

ooh yes, Ruby And Sapphire probably had some similarities in appearance when they were pre-Garnet. that's why they looked like that in the pre-steven time. But they got poofed and decided to make their separate forms look more like Garnet. So when they reformed they looked like Garnet with extra Garnet. And then they got split up, and became more distinct in case they never saw each other again and that's why present day garnet has more of a red/blue motif and a different skin color!
Sounds about right. Korean male teachers are generally pretty hot headed and of the older style of corporal punishment. They're not allowed to do that, though, since it's becoming more and more frowned upon.Source: I also taught English in Korea and am a Korean male.

Well, if your team failed 4 consecutive splits, you should know by now its not just a fault of one player. Why don't you kick all the team members, including Doublelift?

He has studies that he cites in it, dunno what the arguments are for not being up on carbs. I tend to believe lots of carbs are crucial, if I'm not eating a lot of carbs per day and during rides (even stuff like 2.5 hour Z2/Z3) I can often smell ammonia which means I've gone into amino metabolism and I'm breaking down muscle.  I think theres people who argue for riding a purely aerobic levels and not eating much in the way of carbs to 'make the body want to use fat for energy more' ...I've experimented quite a bit with that: at a pace in which I've never gone into amino metabolism for 3+ hours is... slow. It's so slow it becomes a waste of time really...I guess if you have 6 hours to tool around it might be worth it, doubt it gives any benefit for fitness however. 
You should definitely get it! The game could use a bit of extra maps.. otherwise it is relatively excellent all-around.The reason why EA sucks is that a vast quantity of games are made by inexperienced devs who desire a quick buck. Codemasters clearly isn't one of them.

if their service or collision department knew anything abou professional detailing they would be able to get them out.  Also could have been avoided if the person who washed it knew what he was doing too.   It doesn't take religious levels of dedication, it takes knowledge of the correct method.  
Small portions. You can literally eat anything you want without gaining weight, provided you don't eat too much. I usually gain weight when I live abroad in western countries because the portions are huge (like 2-3 times Indonesian portions) and my stomach gradually adjusts to the point where I need the bigger portions to feel satisfied.Also, yes we drink a lot of sweet things, but we still mostly drink water. It's a lot worse in countries with serious obesity problems. There are people out there who don't drink water ever and would exclusively drink soda or fruit juices, which have tons of sugar in them.
Yeah, you're right that they can affect the health of their children. Most fat people probably got their bad habits from somewhere. However I'm not so sure that making someone feel like a shitty human being will really help. Most fat people are probably well aware that they being fat is not a good thing (I guess it would be okay to speak up against those who deny that fact, that's just stupid and a outright dangerous opinion).However, since fatness correlate with a lack of education and low-income (in many ways fatness is a matter of class) I think that maybe there are better ways to be attacking this health problem. 
&gt; I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be close-minded but it's a new release by a musical group...You're surprised by enthusiasm for a topic in a community dedicated to that topic?&gt; Are these greatly exaggerated/made up comments for karma?People like sharing their joy with others. They're not "made up for karma", they're fashioned to portray that joy for others to join in. Upvoting is simply one way reddit allows you to express that.And FWIW, I'm pretty sure you're aware of all of this or you wouldn't have made a new reddit account just to ask it.

Giving away something at a low pledge level (like a PNP, wallpaper or mentions) has made me back projects more than once.I also had a $5 pledge level on my own campaign that brought in 63 backers and that is 63 people that I can contact for future kickstarter projects and keep in the loop of the things that I do.IMO I think a solid pledge level that costs under $5 is worth it for any campaign. Offer things that you already are making but in a digital version. Find ways of incorporating them into your project without causing extra costs for yourself and you are golden!
That seems like an enormous optical recognition database connected to a nutrition database.  In other words, actually a really easily manufacturable device.How much use it is is questionable though, as it's never going to tell the difference between a cucumber sandwich and a bacon-avocado sandwich, and most raw ingredients (like bread) come with this nifty new nutrition label thing.  Fools and their money...

Well I've recently been selling some comics, and those are ridiculously fragile if you want to maintain value and no one online wants ever wants to shell out the extra for one of the good services. It just...it really frustrates me. I know how to pack well, but sometimes there just isn't enough I can do.Honestly, it's just the idea of yall just completely ignoring a fragile sticker that worries me. Yeah, you can pack glass in with a lot of packing peanuts, paper in the glass, etc, but something glass even with all that can't really be expected to survive being tossed about.I don't mean to be that guy ranting on random usps workers on reddit /r/trees but it frustrates me so much.I do understand that it's a shitty job, and mostly irrelevant at this point, so I don't want to take it out on you guys. Just please, for all of us, don't throw any packages. Even if not labeled fragile it just seems disrespectful 
There are multiple competing theological definitions of meditation, but what I meant by it was meditation in the broadest sense, which includes prayer.  It's bringing you to a different state of mind in which you can think about life differently than you often do.  The key bit of the guidance is that you are led to certain specific paths (which prayers really help with) rather than allowing the mind to go wherever it may.&gt;So what?So the prayer that comprises the majority of the Catholic service counts as guided meditation, while sermons often do but do not always.
They work by inhibiting histamine, which is why allergy medicines are called anti-histamines. Allergies are caused by an overreaction of your immune system, which releases histamine and causes inflammation, itching, rashes, and other allergic responses. 
[Pete Carroll just posted something about the 1st round on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeteCarroll/status/593927981153656832). Are the Seahawks trading up? Apparently the pick grew up in North Carolina?
This sub isn't only for funny pictures, infact I haven't seen a single comment implying anyone is actually laughing at this.This sub is merely meant to be for images that represent you, 'selfies of the soul.' 
I tried the jerm once. And only once.For a long time I used a standalone program that would take a single .txt with combined data to write to them one after the other (without having to touch the PC between cards). Not sure if that's how the jerm works.Nowadays its all automated. Totally worth it!
Yeah man it's awesome. I'll give you a favorite if I can ever log back into my soundcloud account...I agree! Like for example the beginning of [White Noiz](http://www.silenthillmemories.net/music/downloads/sh2_ost/02%20-%20White%20Noiz.mp3) uses this beautiful... Noise haha. It sounds like church bells almost. I don't know how he did it, but the sound is so unique and you instantly think of Silent Hill.Yeah like I said in the review, the OST works best in context. I don't think I would ever have any songs from the original OST in my iPod, but that isn't to say that Yamaoka created something wonderful.
&gt;From what I've seen it's trying to alter a creative market by shaming people into thinking films are somehow sexist.Some people may use the Bechdel test in such arguments, but that's not at all inherent to what was originally a lesbian joke in a light-hearted comic strip. In a broader but more serious context, the Bechdel test is simply used to illustrate the pervasiveness of imbalances in media representation that relegate women to secondary roles.That doesn't claim to evaluate the worth of a film (as if the Bechdel test *should* separate classics and pornos into distinct categories), nor does it claim to propose an alternative to a free-market model where people consume what they want and produce what sells. It's merely a simply way to illustrate a prevalence of a certain kind of male-centric perspectives in media.
100% agree. I prefer the jiu-jitsu analogy though. You grapple with someone who thinks they are dominating you then you triangle choke them when they least expect it ;). 
Do you even read your source? "Women suck at Math" is not "objectively true", certainly not universally true. That study itself states that they only do poorly in tests, because of a number of reasons, but whether they are actually bad at math is not determined. Another bias prevalent in reddit is when a news story get posted that says Asians are better at math than whites. Then all this horde of people comes out of nowhere saying how they study specifically for the test, that test score does not reflect actual math aptitude, followed by the anecdotes "my chinese coworker is a PhD in Math, and he's dumb". It's all a joke.
Nah man I just have Napoleon Complex (self-diagnosed, no I'm not a doctor) to the extreme and it pisses me off these insolent fools fail to understand life
The world of reddit is so vast. I go to my regular subs and have a laugh then move on to the next sub. The only reason I even saw it was because I clicked on one of the ads on the right and then the aforementioned dialogue happened in my head.
yep. 85k might be way too high, or not high enough. we can't confirm that. the OP has to figure out the typical salary for the position in his area and request that.

&gt; that TNA has been 200% better than WWE in the past 12 months, but you still watch WWE over TNA, if that isn't WWE biased i don't know what it is. So you'd rather watch a terrible wrestling show each week along with their monthly PPVs, instead of a quality wrestling show like TNA...where's the logic?
Warpriest has no damage boost, so no. It's just nice for when you need to use multiple combat styles, especially for Slayer as when using the Slayer Helmet you can't use void.
So I originally wasn't planning to go to any cons this year because I may or may not be moving... But the idea of crossdressing as Hestia sounds like a lot of fun. I don't know what that says about me though...Edit: [I drew over a picture of myself](http://i.imgur.com/99xwLmO.jpg) to get a rough idea of how it would look with my proportions.  I would need some help making the outfit though :\
Thanks! I'll give that a try. Didn't think of r/jerseycity either. Our budget is 1500 max, but ideally 1000-1100. Hoboken looked pretty expensive.. like 1500 seemed to be the minimum for the most part.
Yea it really is true what they say about arguing with stupid people. They drag you down to their level and beat you with experience LOL. Can't discuss mechanics or baseball with you because you've never played so you wouldn't understand. It's all good though.
I've had cats, cats don't give a shit. One cat in my neighborhood would lay directly under back tires, as if DARING someone to run him over. and I do mean directly under. 
So fucktards can remove their tattoos by getting sunburnt? Sounds like a cheaper alternative to laser and since they already showed they don't care about their bodies I think we're onto a winner.

- disable cross team chat - no, i mean you already have an option to disable messages from enemies. it would also remove all the reactions to sick plays- different team handles skin and champs- limiting rank play time = angry ppl. they already ban some ppl and force them to play normal draft for 10 or 20 games before being unbanned# NEXT
I hurt my back at work today, like a total amateur.... luckily, I had a coworker help me move a few things after that, so I wouldn't hurt it worse.  I didn't sleep well last night, but I did get a nap in today, woot.  I was so out of it this morning.. I bid on an ebay auction and didn't realize I had won for several hours later.  The item is by a brand called iiJin, which I had never heard of before.  After research, I discovered it's a Korean brand that seems to be famous for its interesting shoe designs.  If you're interested, check out [their site.](http://www.iijin.com/online-shop/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=product&amp;id=1&amp;sid=23)  I bought a non-shoe item via ebay, but I would so rock [these](http://www.iijin.com/online-shop/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=productDetail&amp;id=1&amp;tid=0&amp;psid=714) if they weren't so pricey and out of stock.
Barely over 50%, which means nothing when there are 6 times as many of them and you are still committing half as much hate crimes as them.Edit: I know you said your not a buffoon, but you seem to not be able to comprehend that per capita statistics are the best way to accurately compare between groups with large population size differences. You say you live in the real world but you are ignoring a very large part of it.
They just showed a replay on the Bulls telecast. One of the Bucks went to shoot as players went to the bench and Butler contested it, got the rebound and Mayo came off the bench and bumped him. Got a T. 
This article (along with many others) neglects to mention that their article was about differences in how men and women transition from PhD to post-doc.That, to me, is a very relevant piece of information; they were writing about how the male and female experience differs, so the peer reviewer saying they could do with a male viewpoint is quite understandable, depending on how much of their manuscript was based on anecdotal and personal experience. 
If by shading/highlighting, you mean contouring? Then yes! I use it with my Guerlain bronzer--it's flat but fluffy (made from super soft Saikoho goat hair, I believe), so if I use it like I would with my NARS Ita, I can get a semi-sharp contour on that I can easily blend out by turning the brush on its side. Shameless plug: I'm actually [destashing my new one here](http://www.reddit.com/r/makeupexchange/comments/34gmll/sellus_to_intl_chanel_mac_lots_charlotte_tilbury/).I don't know if I want to spend $200 on a brush yet...I'm not Beyonce levels of Grown Woman enough for that. But to collect all the brushes in the GSN series is my absolute dream.
I had a few chats with him before the account deletion, as seen here: http://imgur.com/a/ohSM4 then, I messaged Spycrabs and he danced around the question, not answering.

Because I'm practically mindlessly turning knobs with no real explanation as to why, I'm being told "To make this piano sound, turn the attack to 0ms, decay to 1.6 sec" etc. without it saying why doing all that works out to create that particular sound; that doesn't seem like learning to me. I just want to learn.I learned more through reading three pages of this than through ten times that of How To Make A Sound:http://synthesizer-cookbook.com/SynCookbook.pdfThere's other sources, I was just wondering if this is one of the best ones, because I'm getting the impression that it may not be.
Dated girl. She loved me I did not love her. To get back at me she started dating my housemate and told everyone I knew all this crap about me that was not true. Everyone believed her. Housemate moved her in. I kicked her out. She tried to kill me. I wanted to die. Shit was fucked up.

Try this painful but sometimes workable script."Can you help me? Who can help me? Can you transfer my call to them?"If they say no, ask for their supervisor or higher up. If they insist they do no have have such a person, ask who else you can speak to. Or insist they do, and maybe repeat the original script.Then continue with whomever you get transfered to. You may go in circles. Write down the names of the people you speak to. Be polite. You may go around more than once, and you don't want them to hang upI pulled a full weekend this one time. Got to know a few people. Built some rapport. They ultimately put me in touch with a technician who solved my problem. He was confused and weirded out.  But the thing continues to be fixed.Fucking time consuming. But possibly effective. Especially once some supervisor people speak to you multiple times, and start to realise you're not going away. Be personable, and funny if you can.
To be fair I play a Merc healer and the few times I've done FP's with him I've gotten screamed at by the tank. Note I was keeping him up, I was getting screamed at as I wasn't DPSing along with healing at the same time.

To elaborate more for OP, I interned at a preschool and kids definitely had unique things that made them blow up that we were working on. One kid was overly affectionate/didn't do well with rejection, another was set off by not completing his "circuit" during play time, one had a very hard time with transitions, etc. To me it's the kind of question that acknowledges kids are individuals and you have a mild interest in hers at least. 
200 should definitely be noticeable. 250-300 will with 300mg caffeine should have you going crazy. Unless you're crazy stim tolerant meth addict who weights 300 pounds 
&gt; One extra small step does not change shit.Is this "extra small step" you are referring to **being a U of T student**?  That would seem to change something; namely, it would restrict potential group members to just that group of people.
Thanks for the explanation. Once you start the stall, are you allowed to continue it even if they don't pick up and run long? Are you essentially able to stall them out while they're waiting in the endzone? Haha and I guess if you can do that, then I'd say if someone else picks up the disc its essentially a 'hand-off' turnover? 
For raids all they would need to do is just take the same system Call of Duty Zombies has been using since 2008. Just have a pregame lobby with voice chat that requires everyone to ready up before a matchmade game can begin. Somebody doesn't have a mic or gear you want? Just back out, invite the people in the lobby who do meet your specifications to your fireteam and search again. It's really that simple.For Trials why on earth do I care if people want to go in with randoms?
The guys playing with him are absolute pros. They know exactly how bad he is and they are still playing their hearts out. Hopefully someone will see this video and rescue them from Wieland. 
I live on a second floor apartment and I had the same problem with workout videos! My only solution was doing more pilates type videos. I like blogilates on youtube. You have to do a couple videos to make it long enough but there a lot and most of them are fun. 
We do visual approaches almost always. I probably fly 10 visual approaches for every 1 ILS I do. In the summer we fly almost all visuals. In the winter we fly more ILS. 
It's based purely on the velocity of "real" upvotes. The higher the velocity the faster you get to the top and once you make front page the velocity increases because it's in front of almost exponentially more people.
We split it, it's a good backpack so I might as well keep it (also took it on a trip already) but when I'm off doing my own thing during college I'll definitely get something else.   
Well, first, Lapis was sane. Centipeetle immediately reformed when released, signifying that gems do recover while bubbled. But Lapis could use her powerful water-shaping ability which is clearly a mental skill.Still, the rushing of the ocean we see at the end of Ocean Gem is actually fairly close to the amounts of energy released by that much water falling -- almost as much as the Tzar Bomba (though not instantly like the bomb, still would have boiled a significant chunk of the pillar and killed all life in it.)
I sent a request to that group a while back and was never approved.  I'm a member of several traveler groups on Facebook. Mostly those run by Dorothy Grezik. I just recently resurrected /r/TravelNursing when I realized there weren't many redditors on the Facebook groups. 
He once confiscated my cell phone in class, (Back when flip phones were cool and showing off a cell phone was like, some kind of status symbol) and it remained on vibrate locked in his closet for the remainder of class. At this point, everyone in the class had basically had it with him and his bullshit in general, so everyone else who was cool enough to have cell phones at the time took turns calling my phone and the damn thing **did not stop vibrating** for the entire hour class. The look on his face was priceless. 
Well Ive worked in a euro only shop, a hyundai dealer, and two chain repair shops. I can tell you they arent as bad as many make them out to be. The cooling system and crankcase vent system are a bitch, but replace them and you get another 100k/10 years out of em.
&gt;Why don't they do this in america? So do you regularly see people on their phone calculator trying to work out the real price?We dont have a vat. Sales taxes are set by multiple levels of government and it can change rapidly, not only that items can be tax free or taxed depending on where they are sold. As a result if some company tried that it wouldnt be able to run the same adverts everywhere and it would go insane printing out 100s of different prices for the same item.Honestly, its not hard to add about 7% to something.
Thing about mumble is we don't have to have anyone speak; we can use text-to-speech for any questions, and let the people(s) who are telling the story go off that
Note that the L-button lock-on seems to have a very short delay in updating.  Keep this in mind when Dalamadur leaves the area and you're waiting for the beam.  On a related note, that's about the only time when locking on to the head is going to be helpful.  Tail lock-on still works, but the head is usually in a different direction than the torso/claws.If you've got spare slots, put in Heat Cancel to stop damage from the canyon and that thing Dalamadur does with the sparkles around his chest.

Actually, Suncorp was the mob who did offer cover. Although they did  do the dick thing of jacking up my premiums every year thereafter though with no claims. I switched to RACQ and saved $20 a month instantly, and the premiums have dropped twice already.
I don't think the zombies are the reason for it.  I think it is the loot table (which is supposedly being fixed for .56).  They added the zombies because server performance was increased and it could handle it.  But the loot is causing massive issues with the way it is measured/spawned.
I'm with VB right now and haven't had any problems with them as of yet. But I have heard some bad reviews. What fees did they over charge you on? What tax work did they screw up?
I run a plugin file that handles all of the objects to do the work I need to do. Most of what's passed around is just a few objects that get passed through various functions and queued via anonymous functions into different actions and filters. Tom McFarlin has a decent guide for it.You have to remember that there are a lot of plugins that have been around since 5.2 (which didn't support closures or lambdas), and a lot of plugins are built by self-taught programmers without any knowledge of OOP.
It's both. I played OWB first and frankly really enjoyed the hints of some creepy dude (Elijah) going around, and having no idea who he was and then later encountering him and being "hah, caught you suckah!" as opposed to "oh, this was that guy that I already killed."

Hello Scotchit! Here to review the Ledaig 10 today. Bottled 46.3% ABV, I took notes with both a Glencairn and my larger bodied Canadian Glencairn.**Nose**: salty caramel, fresh tilled earth, lemonsThe Canadian gave more presence to the eathy notes of this one and subdued the others somewhat**Palate**: salt, some caramel, more saltWhat happened? I was looking forward to earthy lemony caramel... **Finish**: Lemon followed by salt, after letting it open (30+minutes) a touch of the earthiness I was hoping for earlierThis is not the dram I was looking for.... Great start with the nose, but all that salt afterwards... I won't be buying this one again. **50**/100
&gt;A2A missiles are probably the most obvious pay-to-win weapon in the gameWhile I agree with you that they are broken, I don't think they are *pay* to win, persay. It's pretty easy to rack up 500 certs- that's how I got mine- and I think that they don't make up for terrible piloting skills. Aka if you can't fly missiles aren't gonna help.

I don't know if I should pick Smash Bros. or the Ruby/Sapphire remakes as my first game.I've always loved the Smash Bros. games, although i've only played the N64 one in an emulator, and I loved Pokemon Emerald, although I thought the game had very little tactical depth, all I had to do is get Pokemons which countered the gym type and teach them abilities of various types, and I outleveled every single random trainer I found. That, and making sure I can one or two-shot Pokemons after 50% HP since their trainers would use a Restore All or an Hyper Potion
Probably because you ate and slept poorly. Were you still sore from your last squat session? If you got 190x5 you should be able to get 205 once. I would just chalk it up to a bad day... If your not on a program I would get on one. Then base your squat off a max of like 200. 
I want to see how many people would be interested before committing to a time/date/location. I also don't have a perfect agenda written out yet, so I don't want people to drive out and then feel like they wasted time and then feel a bit demoralized doing this. So using technology via skype or phone to keep people engaged without making a long drive could be a good thing.I also want to get a ballpark of locations people are coming from. I live in Kenmore myself. 
Under Tenessee law class E felonies are the least severe felonies, and have a maximum penalty of six years. Killing an actual cop is at least second degree murder, a class A felony. Your idiocy is astounding.

In Chinese medicine, it's all connected. I have been to a few Chinese nofap forums before and there are tons of people whose hair loss has been fixed with nofap. So to answer your question, yes there is a connection. 
Too true. I built my collection over years and years. There's no way I'm going to remember everything that I had when I'm inevitably forced to use some other music service.

&gt;people legitimately think that it really doesn't count as rape if she's drunkUh, so every time I've had drunken sex I was actually raped? Let's be real here, it's not on everyone else to monitor a person's intoxication and make decisions for them. If you're going to get so drunk that you offer to sleep with me when you probably would not have casual sex otherwise, that's on you, not me. How am I to always know whether you're too impaired to make a decision for yourself?Obviously I'm not going to fuck someone who's so intoxicated they aren't equal participants (i.e passed out, not fully aware of surroundings, acting erratically etc), but if a girl is actively seducing me, it sure as hell isn't rape. If I knew for a fact she was doing something she wouldn't want to normally, I would say no as a point of honour. But it's not my responsibility to guess whether or not a girl actually wants what she's saying she wants.
Yes, you can plug the drives in in any combination. Whichever one is booted from will be the active OS drive, and the rest will just be storage drives with a dormant OS on it.The only issue you might have going back to the 2TB backup is programs. Most programs installed to the 4TB will also make registry changes on the SSD's installation. If you then not from the 2TB drive then those registry values won't exist and programs that depend on those values won't run.My suggestion, after the SSD is up and running, wipe the 2TB drive, make an image of your SSD, and store it on the 2TB or 4TB drive. Then, if the SSD dies or the OS gets hosed you can just restore that image. Periodically remake the image so it doesn't fall to far behind.Also, sign up for DropBox or GoogleDrive and save your important documents in the cloud. They will be automatically synched so you have an off-site, professionally-managed backup of critical documents.
#The /r/Anime Podcast UpdateThanks for all the feedback guys! We are currently digesting all that you've said (although a lot of us have been busy over the post couple of days). We will definitely be looking at practicing more, so there probably won't be another episode in the next few weeks. But don't worry, the next episode should be a lot better than what we have put out on Saturday.Edit: I will be posting polls and stuff on /r/animepodcast to see what you guys want to get out of the podcast, so be sure to check out the sub every now and then and vote on what you want to see!
&gt; I'm actually pretty sure the internet in general did that. A lot of sex-positive feminists were unhappy, and that's not a group with a lot of GG overlap.Maybe I'm slicing this too finely, but I'd lump that response in with "disagreeing with" the review, rather than "criticizing" it. In particular, I don't think any of that crowd gave any kind of a fuck about the review score, which was a major point of GG contention. 
I started reading it last week and I'm up to volume 14. I recommend watching the show first and then reading ahead since it makes it easier to visualize the characters and their voices. 
How long is eventually? It's been nearly three years for me and to this day I wish I could have him back. Even the feelings for  my current bf doesn't come close to the ones i felt for that man.
As much as I want this guy nailed so hard, There's no way the government can mandate how sober you have to be on private property virtually regardless of what you're doing.
&gt; Cool. I was only asking because I was curious if Mirror Master had done so before, or done something badass like that[He hurt Wonder Woman pretty bad](http://i.imgur.com/Ueg5ccr.png) and I think if [he shot him with multiple clones](http://i.imgur.com/dRjcmP6.png) and only ever left the mirror dimension to shoot him he could take it.&gt;The Rogues are all just such badass villains, that it would be great to see them pull off a heist against the Justice League or something entertaining like that.I was really hoping they'd get an ongoing after Forever Evil where they did stuff like that
i would LOVE if we took Cooper. I think it would launch our offense to even greater heights. I just think that with a defensive minded coach, we're gonna fix the defense first. Especially since we already have a pretty good offense as it is. 
Probably just the normality of playing football or enlisting in the military. Both things I would have loved to do, like I am girly and petite and sweet as a button but I've got that attitude where I can fuck some shit up haha... I seriously considered enlisting but the military's shady policy on sexual harassment makes me so uneasy. I feel like i could have really excelled but I'm happy where I'm at now:)
I'm not crying for me, I personally believe this beautiful story is $100% true.  I'm crying for those who don't believe because they can't comprehend the truth when they read it, and that's sad. 
Theres that word that everyone just loves to throw around. "Entitled". I'm just giving feedback on something I dislike about what the best friends are doing. There is nothing "entitled" about it.
Well that is the point, I have rarely seen really good management.I think people that come from an academic environment are the best software guys to work with.  If your top people have PhDs in Computer Science, these guys are pretty good.

Well, actually carbon dating is quite inaccurate. *Which is why we don't typically use it.* Carbon dating is just, somewhat unfortunately, applicable to a wide range of applications.There are tons of radiometric dating methods that are used, many prefered to carbon dating.

If you view it frame by frame, you'll see they both had both feet on the ground when the ball left their hands. As for the foot being in, in can be, as long as part of it is still touching the line.
Applejack has the best design in my opinion.  She's the closest of the Mane 6 in colors resembling an actual horse (which I like for whatever reason) and I'm a sucker for green eyes.
The people who are picking up the gold bars from your bloody corpse buried under combined weight of an inverted umbrella full of gold bars?    Yes, I think they are laughing.
Ok? This is exactly what happened in the other thread. Again, I agree that's what the intended joke was. It doesn't matter what you or I think about it, what matters is that it was clumsy and inappropriate for that specific medium (an official NBA Twitter account) and used language that has a questionable connotation. Whether you question it or I question it is irrelevant. I'm sure the guy said verbatim your exact comment...... right before he got fired anyway.
Doesn't that add up to like $20 an hour with tips though? Also the employer is required to make up the difference if the tips don't cover minimum wage.
To this day whenever a convocation is held at a major command event and everybody is bowing their heads, I'm always carefully looking around to see who else doesn't have their head bowed in prayer. Occasionally I'll make eye contact with one or two of those folks and sort of give a silent nod, but that's about it.edit: I just came from a SOF command. Generally, very *few* of those guys had their heads bowed in prayer. 
You do realise that writing a check and swiping your debit card are the same thing, right? You still have to balance it. I mean, if not, do you want to come to my store tomorrow?
I had a few chats with him before the account deletion, as seen here: http://imgur.com/a/ohSM4 then, I messaged Spycrabs and he danced around the question, not answering. Then, as seen here http://www.reddit.com/r/april30th2015/comments/34gf2w/i_honestly_think_usavethespycrabs_is_telling_the/cquf8t5?context=3 /u/20150501 answered all the questions.
Oops my bad on the pick, I Should've Checked that. Changed it to a 2016 1st. As for the return, it think its fair for both teams. Im not trying to be a homer by giving the Leafs a monster return on Kessel. Its not realistic based on the season Kessel had and the remaining money owed to him. Ryan Strome was the 5th overall pick in 2011 and is only 21. I think if Leafs fans expect a huge return for 81 they're going to be disappointed, IMO
I think that I have the leggings. You can have them, when you would upgrade one or two weapons for me with twinkling titanite. I really don't want to farm that stuff but I'd try out some new weapons.Are you up for that?
I live in Alaska.  It is challenging, but actually getting easier all the time.  There are a lot more healthy choices than there used to be in the grocery store.  I am not a vegan, but I shop the vegan section more often than not.I mostly eat fruits, nuts, veggies, chicken and fish.  Every couple of months I will say fuck it and have a burger and coke.  Everything in moderation, including moderation, and what not.
I see. Well, as /u/lifthrasiir [said](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/34cyas/rustfmt_help_wanted/cqtmqpk), Rust is still an evolving language and the conventions aren't set in stone. Any formatting tool needs to reflect conventions, not define them. Go got away with it because the conventions were set by the Go authors, and then enforced by gofmt. But while the Rust project is attempting to set various conventions, there's still a lot that hasn't been determined yet.
honestly bro.... one thing i hated was when people confronted me with shit...... most of the time- a handful of times, had my friends had worded stuff a little different or pushed a litle bit harder i woulda opened up too em...
I could make you up something like this pretty easily in 3d(3d printed) to lock an audio cable into a phone case but they probably would rather not do that because letting it be pulled out probably prevents damage to ears / and other parts of the cable that aren't meant to move.
Almost every sector listed there pays well over double, and even triple or quadruple minimum wage on average...I would like to see more encouragement for students over tfw's, but there's no problem with low wage jobs either. Minimum wage jobs have to exist.
This is dope kinda reminded me of Gibbs at the beginning. I would really turn up the vocals on this though but don't have any other  criticisms. Rapping was really well done!
&gt; Some sort of life livedNo, no it did not.  The moon was created ~4.5 billion years ago, shortly after the formation of the earth itself.  The crust was probably still cooling.Life started some 3.5-3.8 billion years ago.  There was no known life on the planet when the moon was formed.  If there was (and given the state of the planet this is unlikely), it was destroyed in the same event.  
Thanks for the info!! I didn't disturb them in any way, Was just worried about one of them, he seems to have a small gash on his back the other seems to be doing fine.

If you want a cheaper way to try to troubleshoot it. Remove one RAM module and see if you can replicate the error (if easily replicated). Then swap the RAM with the one you removed and try again. Then try in the empty slot with each module. If it continues to give you the error with both individual RAM modules in different slots, chances are it's the logic board. If it only does it with one of the RAM modules and it doesn't matter what slot it's in, it's that module. If it does it with both RAM modules but only in one slot, it's most likely the MLB.
The latter.*Buuuuut*, by using our capabilities for rationality, reason and logic, and the scientific method, we can come to understand aspects of objective reality, and over time humanity has started to fill more and more gaps in knowledge about objective reality. Of course its impossible to fully understand reality, but full understanding of reality is not necessary. 
My highest comment on this sub would probably be [from the Aldnoah zero season 2 discussion thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2vvzl4/spoilers_aldnoahzero_2nd_season_episode_6/coldjm4?context=3) (link because It's quite long.) Not really much context, I sort of just explained what I thought nearly every episode of AZ was similar.Also, I can't wait for the whose line is it anyway, I love those.
I've been playing 1.5 800 DPI for a while now. It's not exactly optimal for CS but I also play a lot of TF2 and would like a reasonable sensitivity for that game. My Mousepad is only around 13 inches wide so yeah.
This trade is very close to what I am thinking about.  However, at the time Pineda had just finished his rookie season and was hurt.  I'm thinking more of players who haven't reached the MLB level at all being traded.
Hey guys! DutchFarmers here and I have a little announcement to make! I am currently part of a podcast with six other /r/anime users!

Agree 100% . Over the last 6 months I've been going to a tactical shoot house for training. Not IDPA but a shoot house ran by a recently retired SF guy and his friends. First time going was truly eye opening. Static shooting is great for basic fundamentals of marksmanship but that's about it. Slamming doors open and shooting on the move is FUN and amazing training.   
Yeah, once you sign a contract, it no longer becomes a question of "rights". He signed the contract willingly, knowingly, and without any threats or coercion. By law and custom, he is so bound by it. 
There was a BBC documentary - possibly [When Tommy met Mo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03ghfyp) I can't quite remember - which followed EDF leader Tommy Robinson meeting prominent British Muslims. If I remember it correctly they attended a kind of town-hall style meeting for people who were worried about Muslims in Britain. What surprised me was a young gay man stood up and said he supported UKIP as Muslims disliked gay people, and he thought their position on immigration would limit homophobia from the Muslim community.This scene definitely happened - I'm just unsure if it's from the exact programme I mentioned above. But whichever programme it came from, I was shocked by this attitude on so many levels.  But maybe it can shed some light on why your mother intends to vote UKIP - a misunderstanding of the country's original problems and an incorrect understanding of what the party stands for and would achieve.
Actually no, it was confirmed that they were getting swapped due to an error in how the shop used to be coded.  Basically things were sorted by price, and things the same price would get moved around.
Even without simulating the guard's positions constantly, if they have a set routine then you can still figure out where in that routine they are based on time, and then calculate where the guards should be located for their starting points. You just need to know what each NPC does at a specific time of day.
&gt; The people on top are the one's that will determine worth and that is never a good thing.This is a community, not a government. The people in charge of making the decisions for that community are going to hold the opinions of contributors higher than non-contributors. This is how it works pretty much everywhere.I don't see how these are separate fields.
Quotes usually include attribution. Maybe you could have avoided confusion by attributing your original comment to Jim Gaffigan. Ask your thesis adviser what "attribution" is. Might come in handy.
Just FYI, it pretty much always costs more to go through the appeals process required by a death penalty than it does to house to inmate for life. You save money (at least as our system is structure now) by throwing him in the hole and mostly forgetting about him.

Yeah, that was the saddest part for me, is Konami being a baby about shit. Kojima won't have problems either starting an independent studio, or getting his team hired under a new publisher, though, I also fear for if the Metal Gear franchise will stay with Konami.That being said, forget about konami, if Del Toro and Kojima were able to team up on an original horror game, they wouldn't need the Silent Hill name to sell it... in fact it might even do better without it. I'd buy two.
Core rager isn't good in face hunter because it's four mana for maybe a 7/7 which gives an opponents bgh value; plus it doesn't deal damage the turn it's played making it not fit in the list. As for quickshot it's more about the 3 damage rather than the draw because face hunter will often hold specific cards in hand for a finishing burst like owl into unleash-kill command.
My wife knew that I wouldn't find her nearly as attractive if she put her nose ring back in (which she's never worn with me, but I had seen it in her pictures when we first started dating). And I know that she isn't interested in kissing me when my face isn't smooth, and that's fair too. We all have preferences, and should be willing to compromise a little for the one's we love.
I agree with the Katya win, but I meant they shouldn't have worn their dresses on the mainstage as a "main runway challenge" rather have them bring them as a mini challenge or wear them for a skit. Then you can see what they think is ugly, but it holds less weight.
Unfortunately I have absolutely no PC parts stores anywhere near me. However, thanks for the feedback and I'll definitely go check out liquid cooling units right now.
The only thing it is useful for is knocking out a few of the requirements you would need when you go back to school to finish a BS. You will still be working at starbucks.   
I'm running a relatively ghetto 'throw most of your REM rolls into a team' consisting of osiris/kushi/meimei/GZL/michael. Kushi is my uber-defensive sub (1 skill away from hyper), and burst is currently in the form of GZL -&gt; meimei, sometimes into michael if hes needed.  Currently I don't focus too much on TPA, but i do them if they're relatively easy. Liu Bei is my instant michael replacement.

Well we do have a suggestion box kind of in the US, you can write your legislator. And it works almost as well as the suggestion box at the last place I worked! (not a whole lot)
CTO of BitGo here. We have no intent to use any software patents in an offensive manner. You can expect to see a more formal announcement on this from us within a few days.
You really didn't give any detail at all about her situation and your view of it, other than you feel she is screwing herself. To be frank, you can't force someone to change. When someone decides to change, it has to be their decision. And you have to be *very* lucky to try and convince them. Otherwise, they need to come to that decision on their own. Are you willing to keep talking at her, in the hopes that she *might* decide to listen?
how trustworthy are the sellers of these watches on Chrono24?at the moment there are 4 watches and all say unworn new etc. but are in AUD 5000 cheaper then from the nomos website.http://www.chrono24.com/au/search/index.htm?query=lambda&amp;dosearch=true&amp;searchexplain=1&amp;SETLANG=en_AU&amp;SETCURR=AUDwould they be a safe purchase or is it better to just buy from Nomos?
The funny part is the box though. I don't know how anybody could possibly be offended by this. What do you think food is? Maybe it'd only be funny to people that have raised animals or something. My intentions weren't to offend, but I apologize if I did. 
I can't tell exactly from the pictures, but are the white spots fuzzy, like a growing fungus? Is he rubbing or scratching against anything? Is it possible they just part of his coloration? Just trying to narrow it down. If you do decide its fungus (I suggest a lot of research), there are many treatments available. Also, is your tank cycled? With that many water changes, makes me think it's not. A cycled tank can do wonders for fish health :)
She has no foibles or character flaws to speak of, and she's *definitely not a slut* or anything...and since they had sex, but she's *definitely not a slut,* he *must* be a rapist.  It's the only logical conclusion left. .../s  I want some feminist image macros that say "Literally asking for it" at the top, and then say "Still not asking for it" at the bottom.
Man the reason Gamergate took off wasn't because of a sex scandal it was the RESPONSE to it. Scandals like quinns happened before. however Grayson and his editor using GJP to censor other people's forums on the subject just made more people courious and talks of collusion a common occurance...Then Alexander's Gamers are Dead articles confirmed it.Quite literally Quinn and Grayson threw fireworks on a small fire thinking it would put it out. When really the entire thing could have been blown over in a week to a month if they didn't try to silence everything.

If you're richer, it means you can hire more poors to walk behind you and carry your baggage instead of strapping it all to the sides of your camel. Simple!
It's a trade-off. You don't have to deal with expansion disapproval , and most of your economy is based in your capital city, which needs to stay fervent.I would rebalance it such that it isn't worth as many points for custom factions; the game developers thought it was better than it actually is and it's terrible without cellulose mutation.
Do what's best for you.  It was a suggestion.For the last 3 months my job has required me to work 12-13 hour days 6 days a week.  I am still at the shala every day at 5.30am.  Not boasting - just saying it can be done.
I would usually do something like that. My SO was having issues cumming when he was on SSRIs so it would happen fairly often back then. He knew I loved having sex with him, but he also knew I could only go so long before I started to get sore so he knew not to take it personally.I'd always offer to blow him to help him finish if it hurt too much to continue with PIV. When he's having trouble cumming, anything where he can be passive and not exert himself seems to do the trick, so that's either me blowing him or riding him. So sometimes I would get on top without saying anything and it would make him cum faster.
So tell me. If there is a cultural problem with black Americans that leads them to be more involved with drugs, more violent, having children younger, wanting to live in povery and so on.....If they are inherently not as hard-working, honest, or humane as other ethnic groups...if they want to exist outside of society....Why would you hire a black American? Give one a mortgage? Let that person in your school? Date your daughter? Trust them on a routine traffic stop? Believe that they need that government help? Give a black person a promotion?You wouldn't. It would be dumb too, if what you believe is true. It is the fucking logical outcome. So, how do they get ahead? They don't. And the rest of America places the blame on African Americans for not fitting in better while screaming that they don't belong.
If your school IT is in anyway competent access to the campus academic network is restricted to PCs that are part of your active directory domain. So essentially, no bueno for the Xbox. Best option is to create a ad hoc WiFi hotspot with your phone or Mac and connect to the Xbox to that.
Had a seatpost completely and (I thought) unfixably frozen in my seat tube after 2 salty, snowy Montreal winters.I tried every method I could scrounge up to no avail... finally, just took it to my LBS, and $40 and couple hours later, good as new. They torched it, pulled the post out, painted the frame back up all purdy, and threw the new seatpost in. Easy peasy!tl;dr: LBS. Take it there, they got this.
No idea if this break rules or not. He's claiming that I instigated a brigading of him, but I didn't link the thread, and even said I wouldn't do as such. If people wanted to down vote him out of their own volition, that was their choice. Never said, "Let's hunt this guy down."
Can we get over this mentality?  It hasn't proven true even once in the 14 years that Brady has been a starter.If Jimmy is the guy, it's because he's the guy. Not the "training" he's receiving from TB12. Their styles aren't even that similar.
I will tell you straight up there is no way to defeat that statement. People that make statements such as this are dishonest and will change their story to match your refuting of their claims. 
I could never understand why people would wake up hungover and not handle it with the hair of the dog. Worked every time for me. Every single time. So many times :/
This type of  impotent response is the problem.  Teenagers and young adults act like children these days because they think that they are the center of the world and can do whatever they want without consequence.A reality check knuckle sandwich is the cure.  So many millennials ... so many knuckle sandwiches needed.

''you'' meaning her?  me?  the reader?  yourself?  what if i/we/they don't, ever, die without improving shit?  DOes that mean i/us/we COULD'VE improved things and tragically stupidly chose to not?  If  maybe its a matter of choosing, are the the choices we don't make, that we don't choose to make or that we aren't able to choose, are they actually available to we/yu/me/him at all?  The black homeless man in rags/aids, did he choose that or did that just happen to him???  I honestly don't know.  It seems like both and neither.Does any of that make sense?i just think, if i ever did have any chance, then it's already gone lost wasted and not coming back.  so i'm left to decide between 0 good options.  0 well.

Well how are you feeling about it now?I mean, it started off as a story right? And then what? You made the subreddit.

Conservatives don't really see things entirely rationally. They fear change, no matter what that change is. They would rather keep things the same and continue on the path that says "danger, pit of death ahead" than change course and avoid it. Hence the whole global climate change thing taking so long to acknowledge.Not that anyone behaves or sees things rationally all the time, but conservatives are specifically pro status quo.

It's funny, my receipt had printed out by the time she asked to see my ID.  If I was trying something funny, the transaction wouldn't have completed.

As long as there was no way of glitching or gaming the system this could be quite nice. Maybe just class items or banners and shaders? Another thing could be to matchmake highly skilled and helpful players together?
The fact that people will abandon an app they use EVERY day because the developer asked for 1 measly dollar.... So depressing. Just use your stock messaging app then.
The area around the wormhole opening was considered a navigation hazard, basically. All of the spatial weirdness and exotic radiation produced by the wormhole opening would cause most ships to avoid the area. Remember, on the first trip through the wormhole it was pretty rough and certain modifications had to be made, even with late 24th century technology, so that ships could safely pass through on a regular basis.It's similar to the tachyon eddies found by Sisko during his historical recreation of ancient Bajoran spaceflight. They could detect such things no problem, but how they interpreted it and reacted to it would be very different.
*Kai was sitting at a desk in the library, flipping through an anatomical study of Grimm. Occasionally, he will shake his head, and write directly onto the pages of the book, highlighting certain qualities that he had observed through all his time hiding from and watching Grimm, or making note of potentially dangerous errors in the book's descriptions of abilities and weaknesses.*
My hypothesis is the guy who put it in the tree copy-pasted it from the P-80 (which has the exact same cost, RP cost, and BR) and forgot to change it. Although it doesn't explain the fucking batshit 20k repair cost.Good luck getting Gaijinooblebibs to change it to a reasonable amount though... if they do it will be in a couple months.
This. I actually like the stamina system. I'm a fan of gated games if they are done right (this one seems to have done it great). I'm just not a fan of locked gates that that use money to unlock them. Because not matter how many times I spend money, there will always feel like another gate to unlock.
It's not all that surprising in retrospect. The fire suppression system in the building was designed for suppressing a typical office fire until the fire department can get there. Having part of a skyscraper fall on it, a water main break on Vesey St limiting the water flow to the building, and having the fire department decide not to fight the fire due to the extensive damage already caused by the WTC collapse was never part of the original design. Expecting the sprinkler system to control that would be like expecting a person with a watering can to control a bonfire.
It's something I'd love to see. I'm guessing that since it's implemented in Astro Arena and likely FPS as a whole we'll see it in the cockpit too one day.
*Democrats:*  we are in favour of increasing the minimum wage because we love poor people and want them to have more money.*Republicans:*  we are opposed to increasing the minimum wage because we love poor people and doing so would eliminate jobs for the poor.Who is being satirical?

I think you're right.  I really hope Mariota does well in the NFL.  may take him a little adjusting, but he's a great kid, good head on his shoulders.  I hope he has a long, successful career.

That's Wegmans store brand diet cola! Which reminds me of a fun fact I heard through the grapevine; some of the writers and other people who worked on the show had never seen or tried anything from Wegmans or the Utz snack company until they went to Scranton to scout it out for the show. Supposedly they ended up going to Wegmans and trying some of their products and Utz products and loved them so much that they snuck the brands into various shots around the office. There's quite a few times you can see these two companies' products, especially in the break-room.
I'm really looking forward to an old school, characterful and somewhat cheesy typical bond henchman, there used to be at least one in every movie.We need more Jaws!
IEM was a huge tournament, but the setup for showing who would make it to quarters, semis, and finals was terrible. There is too much chance that flukes, minor tilt, or cheese strategies confounded the overall results. Which is to say, TSM didn't necessarily win based off of luck or cheese, but WE might have won off luck or tilt(although spirit was impressive as hell), given there was only 1 series that featured a total of 5 possible games. Thoorin did a great summary on the whole situation on his youtube channel. Because he was willing to say TSM did show great skill (probably the best in the west), but globally it didn't set them up to be a top 3 team in the world based on such a small sample and inferior rule set for how the matches went.

I just said that these two examples of hate speech are not comparable in terms of intensity. But with that being said, they are both types of hate speech so they are comparable. Why do you not get that hate speech, big or small, is still hate speech? You seem to be justifying this because it is being said by minorities but that still doesn't make it right. Again, why or why not is the phrase "Die CIS scum" hate speech?
I don't think it's unhealthy at all. Hypothetically turning a situation around is a good way to promote empathy. Make the other person see from a personal viewpoint what exactly it is that they're asking. If he refuses to do this, then she can more clearly show him why she might not want to do it. "If you wouldn't do it, why is it reasonable to continually ask me to?"
I quite like the people here so I'd be fine with staying here or moving to another new sub regardless. Also, is it just me or has time passed pretty quickly? I was never worried about the wait until episode 5, but I'm surprised its gone so fast, thus far that is, still. If anything the final wait from 4 to 5 will be worse than the last three weeks or whatever it was. 
There are probably multiple answers to this that are all valid. For some it's going to be because Starbucks is trendy, for some it's because our coffee has a lot of caffeine, for some it's the customisability (ya know, the secret menu everyone knows we have that we don't actually)  for some it's that we sell a connection, a place where you're supposed to be guaranteed someone to talk to while you wait for your drink. Hell for some it's so they can post pictures of how we misspelt their names on IG. 
I'd be emotional too if I were one of the best players on the team and was told I'd probably be replaced by a freelancer who didn't even end up going to the org.
You may be right, but then what was he threatening Imus about all those years back, that involved Imus' daughter? Genuine question, not being a dick, I barely remember the incident, but I remember being shocked by Howard invoking some secret he had about Imus' family that he learned talking to Imus' daughter. As I recall, Imus backed down from that battle because he wouldn't cross the line Howard crossed. Or can someone clear that incident up for me so I stop having the wrong idea about Howard?
I skipped a line in that analogy.Consider you are sick. You need medicine to get well again. (You are alive and need to reproduce to replace yourself) medicine is necessary for that. But it is bitter. Only if it was sweet...
The best thing to do is sell base chromos for rp but skin chromos for ip, this way you get more sales on skins.people dont want to buy a skin then later have to buy something else to make their skin more special

Well the cowboys in that comic are from a different timeline all together. They are the catalyst for the character the Saint of Killers. Cheesily, my favorite character ever.
Well, a lot of that 28% in Switzerland is other European peoples.  Switzerland is still very white as I understand it, and they have direct democracy and guns.  
Just a quick heads up, I have not gotten the chance to drop them off yet. I sorta fell asleep last night and today, I haven't caught the town on at all.But every piece of art and papers are just waiting right outside my train station for when I do catch the town on. I'll be sure to pop right over and mail them then. =]
I won't believe that someone can be in college and have that low of a level of critical thinking. He's either completely aware of what he's doing, or he's somehow mentally challenged. 
[](/tiashrug)Things blow my mind all the time, but I can't think of any good examples, so I guess I'll just post this *kind of* (but not really) mind blowing video of how to turn a [sphere inside out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_w4HYXuo9M)
I've found just keeping track of my calories and setting daily limits does the job for me.  Knowing that once I hit X calories I can't eat anymore for the day moderates my intake.
hiko got fucked Lol. It's sort of like when you're selling a collectors skin (say it looks really clean and has expensive stickers or whatever) and you get a lowball and say you'll wait for higher offers but they never come and a week later you have to quicksell for 50% of the "lowball".He got too picky and was stuck with nihilium (not that they're a bad team but it sure isn't the new c9 or even LG)
For everyone saying they hope he can get elected so weed is legalized, Congress would still have to pass it and that is not likely since the Republicans hold the majority.
if incarnation really is that good, he will want to go to C9 and C9 will want him. Think about it, this dude is coming off 3 years of bans almost, and now he has the chance to play on a top 3 western team. Why would he go to 4th place SK who's probably losing their star ADC and not even getting rekkles instead?
I agree with you that calling "trigger" in an argument in an attempt to censor someone is bad. I just see the whole "OMG you're triggering me" satire posts so so so often, while I see the attempt to censor pretty much no where. I agree that there are a lot of children on tumblr that complain about a lot of stupid things. But a bunch of children and "a few news articles" about college kids who think they have everything all figured out (like a lot of people in college think) hardly warrant how much reddit likes to make fun of them. Regarding your point about PTSD and psychology, I also agree that never confronting your traumatic situation is probably bad. However, I don't believe that many psychologists would agree that trigger warnings are a bad thing. Again, just because someone is choosing not to think about a traumatic experience in a given moment, it doesn't mean they're trying to block it out forever.
I feel like Moore over-uses rape.  Yes it happens, yes it's an adult subject etc etc, but I feel like he just throws it in regularly for easy "character development" and "adult themes."  Like "o, who do I need to rape in this book to show that it's *serious writing* and they have been wronged?"
I'm Chinese American and I have a large extended family, mostly in China, Taiwan, Thailand, Germany, Australia, and in the U.S.before any race based or state based identity I most strongly id with my clan. They have done a lot for me in terms of making me feel loved and forever integrated into a big community of people. They also provided me with mentorship and friendships. I think this is probably the most important reason why I feel the way I do about so many issues. Curious if any others understand where I'm coming from.
What does temp control do?  I keep seeing it listed as a feature, but no explanation.  I am assuming it is a thermonuclear on the chip that causes a cut-off if the compartment gets too hot....
I practice ballet moves in the kitchen (I'm pretty terrible at ballet and haven't taken a class in about six years but MY DEGAGES ARE IMPECCABLE, DAMNIT).  I also sew in my underwear - I make costumes for conventions and sew some of my own renfaire garb, and usually there doesn't seem like much point in putting my normal clothes back on after trying on something that's half-finished; they'd probably just come off again multiple times.
&gt; For instance, when you're writing a movie, the script has to be completely finished before production starts, and there's no chance to make those changes as the shooting continues.That's... Not actually even a little bit true.
I'm still madly in love with the Veyron. I'm more excited for this car than I was for any one of the hybrid supercar triplets. Bugatti are masters of shock and awe. The Chiron is sure to surprise.
If you have the Warmth pyromancy and some prism stones, then once you get your humanity back, you can farm effigies by hosting a fight club. Lay down the stones, summon a red phantom or two via red soapstone, stand back, and let the effigies roll in. All you have to do is use Warmth in between fights to heal the victor.Do this on the iron keep bridge, it's a pretty major pvp hotspot. 
It's an idea which originated in a comic, not academic research, intended to make a rhetorical point, not actually function as a test to measure how misogynistic movies are.As such, it does draw attention to a real tendency in movies. however, the implication that this is misogyny is a bit of a leap.There are many factors at play. Gender roles absolutely result in some of those factors. however it's not simply anti-woman. It's restrictive assumptions and expectations placed on both men and women.I ranted about this at great length here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2uu7pp/genre_responsibility_empathy_value_and_women_in/Then there's also the fact that, in movies intended for male audiences, the focus is most often on male characters.Movies with many important female characters are generally intended for female audiences and these are generally romances, so obviously most conversations will be about the (male) love interest.
I guess when you have your health it seems trivial,  but is it worth the risk to save few dollars? For me safety before frugality.  However each to their own.
I wonder if people like that get a hard-on when they moderate. They wake up at morning and almost run over to their computer to see if there's any material they don't like that they can remove.
Many towns chlorinate water in March then switch back to chloramination the rest of the year. The top thing is to figure out if it is a supply (town) problem or some kind of issue with the house inside pipes. Either way, whole house treatment is better than filters only for drinking. 
Very hard thing to choose, im thinking a brand like Comme Des Garcons who have been around a long time has, done a lot of things with a huge range over its branched-off collections too, possibly put Junya Watanabe under the CDG umbrella as well, dunno if he counts.Stone Island is up there. Iconic compass badge, 30+ years of innovation, material uses, so many unique pieces and fabrics developed. Created some of the best outerwear there has ever been and is still doing that today.
1) it looks like any normal chat on the watch. With the group count and name of the chat at the top, and names per message. I would set nicknames (even if first names) for regular contacts, with an emoji at the beginning or end. The watch doesn't understand multi culti emoji yet. 
Definitely. *Never* talk to him again. You owe that to yourself. Even if he's the father of your kid. Take pictures of yourself with the date and time in the picture, use them against him if he ever gives you shit. Does he have any form of custody?

I've never been able to get into the crafting, farming, or RNG aspect of this game. I don't find it fun despite the fact that I long for the better gear. Everything I have was bought with real money :\It's sad really.I just don't even know where to start with this game.

Yes, children can pick up on adult relationship dynamics. Like how they know Daddy isn't necessarily married to Ms. Teacher-lady. They aren't idiots, and especially aren't going to assert that their friend's mom is their own. 
This guy and this girl fall madly in love despite barely knowing each other. They make some mistakes along the way.Romeo and Juliet is clearly a ripoff of Adam and Eve.
Normally no AFAIK. However, as part of the map reset, I believe PGI un-set all the faction contracts. If you leave the old unit before the commander takes a new contract, I think you're good to go.
I know that it already isn't that big, but these renderings make it looks like the "Love" in "Love Park" is just some random thing placed there.    You would think if they were redesigning it all they would make it a better centerpiece. It's the goddamn namesake.
Me too. I haven't driven her in months with it being such a big project. I'll be putting the chromed bottlecaps back on temporarily until we get just the right size tire. Driving my Sentra lately has been hell since I know I have the thirty just waiting to take its top off and give it a long night drive.
Make sure you refuse all prescription  drugs or even using OTC drugs, even if you need them. http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/While you're at it, maybe you shouldn't eat, either, since foods contain compounds that have had little or no testing to make sure they're safe to your standards. 
The first picture was August 2013. It was 3 months after my third was born. I stayed this size/ weight for a decent amount of time. Well I actually just hovered around 150 and nothing I did got me lower than that. Maybe two 1/2 months ago I gave up fast food which I ate at least 3 times a week. I also had a horrible habit of 'grazing' - just boredom snacking all day. Once I stopped snacking (when I do snack it's healthy and I watch portions). I'm also a lot more active now. So to stop rambling and answer your questions, the last 20 pounds was about two and half months of work. 
I am working on a couple of novels. One is a horror story set in Bronze Age Arabia, and the other is the prequel to a book that I've [already released for free](http://www.nearlydeparted.net).

It does make you wonder if you're in a Truman Show type situation. Especially when you pull into your driveway and your song ends right at that perfect moment. 
I never touch my volumes. I have a set hierarchy of sounds in my stream. I'll list them from lowest to highest:Music, Game/notifier, My voice. I never change any of my sound settings because Ive found the sweet spot. 
I didn't actually ever count, but it shouldn't be too long if you live nearby. I locked one in and returned 30 days later. Wall was broken and there was 6-7 of them (including baby beefalos).
Agreed.  People don't like to hear it, but it's way better and more fun in the long to adapt to the game instead of the other way around.Rise to challenge, don't lower the bar.
I've never done LC to be honest D:But given it's all baby mans at level 5, training should be easier (no raising stuff to level 50) so if I have nothing better to do I'll probably join.

Hydroelectric power is great! It's clean, it's renewable, it even creates lots of cool lakes! ...Creates lots of cool lakes by inundating river basins, severing migration routs, cutting off gene flow, causing sedimentation upstream, causing serious erosion and channel entrenchment downstream, creating unnaturally variable or unnaturally stable flow regimes, on and on. The loss of a few small cultures is verging on insignificant compared to the unavoidable extinctions and ecosystem ruination that constructing 250 dams in the amazon will cause. In north america we look back at the unmeasurable ecological damage we caused building dams and think "what a tragedy" I wish Brazil would learn from our mistakes.

I'm not hugely fond of alignment restrictions either, but your DM may have different opinions.Hm. Treantmonk has a rather good guide for a ranger that he calls the "pinch hitter" one who uses the Combat Style ability to ignore prereqs to get by with a middling Dexterity and boosted Strength with a powerful Composite bow. That higher strength may also contribute to being a decent grappler. Especially if you go into Monk - master of many styles perhaps? Or unarmed fighter? To get into one of the good grapple builds.edit: Konebred and I_done_a_plop-plop have made much better suggestions than mine. 
Ah yes, I love it when sheltered people claim there's a grand Stormfront conspiracy to... post racist comments or something. They point to a thread posted a couple years back at Stormfront that got a handful of replies and died a quick death. Racist subreddits have middling activity while many popular subreddits were taken over by SJW beta males.It never occurs to these shut-ins that people are simply racist outside of their hugboxes.
&gt;Not the guy, but I like the change of pace of an actually good gamerShe's not that good though, the only thing she's preformed well at is lion King. The only other thing she's played games in is steamrolled/grumpcade where she consistently comes in last. and Monster hunter for the polaris thing, and while i'm not familiar with the series I've seen multiple comments stating she was carried. 
Exactly. You are one person in a room of 18 people COMPLETELY disrespecting you, the school, and the other students. * Nothing you say will change their abhorrent behavior.* You can't leave the room, according to school policy.* You can't use force to make them leave.* The bad girl *can* leave, but *chooses not to*.It's enough to drive good people insane.
Well it could be an Invasion styled gametype but instead of playing as Spartans vs Elites it's Chief as the guy doing the VO and playing as Blue Team for... well.. *Blue Team* and Locke doing the VO and playing as "Locke's Merry Band of Brothers" as Red Team. I think it'd be pretty good imo. 
Carlos Torres wouldn't be able to hit a barn recently, and Mario Torres gave up a home run to Ichiro yesterday. Still, the bullpen isn't too shaky, but you want your starters going as long as they can.
Protesting doesn't make you a hipster. Hipsters attend protests to pretend like they actually sympathise with aboriginals even though their entire knowledge is based on their grade 6 trip to Central Australia and articles they've read that were shared on Facebook.The usual rhetoric of 'cultural genocide' and 'forced closures' shows how little they actually know.
well the cutout has a map of FNAF2 (Small) folded in front that is where you put the animatronics and when its your turn you grab a card also like the custom night because it can have up too 12 people as the animatronics and 4 people as the nightguards theres 4 flashlights but only 1 mask. the map is on one side where the animatronics are and the nightguards set the way in front of the office like battleship.
Trans people have gotten so used to using intersex as a rhetorical device I guess they just decided to lump them into the ever increasing acronym.  I don't think most of them really know or care all that much about intersex people or conditions.
As enjoyable as it is to listen to passive aggression from someone who pretends to be above it, I'm not interested in a random internet dweller's anecdotal evidence. I've given my sources, I don't mind if you want to pretend not to know how they work. Your narrative of Sudetenland as a centre of industry is a pure fantasy. That is all.
So no one opens businesses in those neighborhoods, the area gets shittier, and the problems don't get solved. There are 10k+ people in Baltimore right now peacefully protesting for greater economic opportunities in their neighborhoods. This is literally what they're asking for. The rioters are the small group who are so fed up they've exploded emotionally, but they want the same thing. 
This is the wrong question for several reasons.First, its not at all clear that good things (economic growth, poverty reduction, real wage increases, whatever) will happen if people and businesses get more economic freedom.  Free markets, especially in labor, healthcare, and finance, can fail often and spectacularly.  This isn't to say that free markets never work, only that in some markets and in some conditions, they don't.Second, liberty is a really ambiguous idea.  Does my right to vote matter if there are no roads to get to polling stations?  Is my right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" meaningful if I'm unemployed and can only afford to live in a crime-ridden neighborhood?Third, the Heritage foundation is basically just a propaganda machine.
I feel the same way anytime someone posts on here. Guess what, everyone has to make sacrifices for their animals. But I (like a lot of people) fucking deal with it because I am not a horrible fucking person.

Is it that big a deal that it was suggested they bring on the opposite gender to help remove bias from a study on gender differences? I mean it makes sense to me.It's not like they were doing a paper on the migration patterns of exotic birds or anything, it was specifically related to gender and therefore there is a strong likelihood that the results could contain bias if only one of the genders is actually doing the study. Getting a male author could eliminate that problem.I do find it kind of ironic that the women were told they were biased and so they instantly complained they were victims of sexism. To me that is just a clear indication that they were indeed biased, like they were looking for it (called confirmation bias). It's a research study! They should be scientists first and women second, science is about being objective and looking at facts not about what you want to be the case.

You may be right, but then what was he threatening Imus about all those years back, that involved Imus' daughter?

Howard does have trade value and there is no need for the Wings to keep two starting goalies when they are in desperate need for an upgrade either on D or a scoring forward. Mrazek is cheaper, younger, and seems like he has a much higher ceiling.

Works like a charm on regular black records, all 3 coloured records I have tried had significant more surface noise after flattening (when using the same protocol).

My question is how do blind people browse reddit? If they use screen reading do they just listen until they hear a link that interests them or what exactly? I've always wanted to know.

Most people who played Nuts and Bolts liked it.  If the Banjo name wasn't on it, it would have been praised.  Hell it could have been successful as a spin-off if the main series had a new entry prior to it.
The problem with a broad system is it's ok for a lot of things but not great for any one thing. I can see a D&amp;D based game with a d20 to-hit roll for example, that sort of suits the wild variances in hand to hand combat, but a mecha crawler (for example) might need less randomness and more strategy. I do like "literally Hitler" tho. Escape from Castle Wolfenstein is more or less a crawler, right? WWII works for me.

I have posted this several times in the past, but its relevant here as well.  During my junior year I was being grilled about something for in class and another student in the room told the teacher to lay off, or else I might hang myself.  The teacher responded by telling the class I was too heavy to do that, as I would probably just rip whatever ceiling fixture I tied the rope to out of the ceiling.  I don't think I ever talked during that class again.

Maybe not is they're for work, but there are plenty of substitutes that are just as viable. Also, you didn't imply that you meant work shoes the first time, you just said shoes, and I'd be willing to bet that the average person considers leather shoes as a luxury item.You can keep trying to shift the goalposts and change what we're talking about, but how about you make an argument for why we should continue to subsidize any of these things? Just because something is used by things is not a good enough reason to be subsidizing such a huge industry.
The Vespers reading can be messed around with and then a homily written to go with it. Obviously the homily must be given by a priest or deacon.(and for those who are horrified by the words "messed around with" when talking about the liturgy, here's the instruction that allows it...&gt; A longer scripture reading may be chosen, especially for celebrations with the people. It may be taken from the Office of Readings or from the passage read at Mass, and especially from those texts left unread for various reasons. On occasion, there is no reason why a more suitable reading may not be chosen in accordance with the norms of nn 248–249, 251.
HotS isn't LoL's competition at all LOL. And the difference here is HotS is owned by Blizzard. A company with...5 VERY popular games out right now? WoW, D3, Starcraft 2, Hearthstone and HotS. They can afford to give shit out for free because they already have so much money coming in elsewhere. Sure, you could argue Riot does too but Riot also needs money regardless. Especially since it's their ONLY game. Makes perfect sense to offer a little something like this for RP.
okay?   i bet if you had someone telling you you should start dating women,  despite your personal preferences being towards men,  you'd tell them to shut up a bit too.
I still don't necessarily see a problem with a company having &lt;20% of licenses available in the state. What are you arguing? That the licenses should have been rescinded based on thwarting monopoly in its incipiency?

They're not animals, but they're more akin to a force of nature (literally) than a people with their own distinct culture and whatnot.  
Ah yes, my favourite type of post. Literally no effort joke post. Front page, here it comes. [In case you were wondering where I'm from btw](http://nationalwood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/salt-lake-city-downtown-2.jpg). Anyways, haha wins. It's all around more useable, and even easier to type. 
&gt;He is a little funny, but he's always finding ways to bring race into every issue. "Keep it 100" sucks ass, I'm glad they don't do that shit every night. Seems like he's just trying to get ol' whitey to say something black people want to hear those damn crackas' and peckerwoods say. But whatever, I try and look past it and enjoy his non-racially charged segments.That's simply because race relations have been a huge issue as of late. Can't eexpect him to not report the news.&gt;I will never forget this.And I'll never forget you. &lt;3
My question is this:You say that you signed your lease through your real estate agent, but that you were never shown the lease. Did she sign for you, or merely provide you the proper paperwork?
Let's say the Xbox is connected to the "Family Room" TV. Your wife wants to watch tv but you want to play videogames. This way you can stream the Xbox to another display in the house.Shit, just think of Steam's in-home streaming feature, same thing.

As someone a bit older, I can say this with some authority - pretty much everyone is attractive to some chunk of people.  One thing that happens in school is that people are afraid to appear different, so if they have tastes that lie outside the mainstream, they may very well be afraid to express them. I knew a couple guys who were into bigger girls, but were way too insecure to express it in high school. Not everyone - I'm not even sure most people - find the sort of default media-created concept of what is attractive to actually be attractive.  It sucks that you're on the wrong end of that sort of thing right now, but it will change with time.  And hell, if you're still in school, your body hasn't even finished developing.  You might look far more like how you want to look in a few years.
It was a **successful mission, it ran out of fuel which was bound to happen, and it was over a decade old.**Title doesn't mention that, but I guess it wouldn't be good clickbait if it did. 
Not too hard. I just took a pair of wire cutters and clipped them. If you have an older set of triggers you like though you could just swap those in. It'd be slightly easier.
Humans aren't biologically wired to detect the actual age of other humans, they're wired to detect health, and thus closeness to death. What you're perceiving as premature ageing is their shortened lifespan.

Wow, a year already! It sure doesn't feel like it's been that long. I'm not sure what my favorite moment exactly was, there've been a lot, but I absolutely adore the community that has popped up. Both the BWs and their fans are such fun, friendly, creative people, and I can't wait to see what this upcoming year will bring!
Just like any item, to continue what other redditors stated, the item will likely fall in price due to increase in supply/sellers (from restocking in shops to obtaining through goodie bags).  A good place to start may be backgrounds that come from retired goodie bags (as the supply of those bags *cannot* increase) or backgrounds that do not stock in shops.
Ideally, they allow for candidates from different socioeconomic backgrounds to be able to campaign effectively, though the vast majority of candidates still come from high society.But without political parties, there wouldn't be a very viable option for most people to compete.  Only the super rich would be able to, like Ross Perot.
It only requires two ideas:* How the player's actions affect the world, and* How long it takes for those effects to be realizedSay they topple a government, the city can devolve into chaos immediately, stay unstable for weeks, months, or years; and then finally something can happen to return peace and prosperity, which tye build up over the course of weeks, months, or years.If they start minting money, how long before inflation causes problems?If your question is about "how much should they be able to change the world at a given level?", I assume 1-5: negligibly, 6-10: locally, 11-15: continentally, 16:20: globally/extraplanarly 
Same with me on the second point, saves a lot of money if you take a toke and then Vape for a half hour and then take another toke. Plus it's just like how everyone smoked back in the day because it was cool, except vaping seems quite a bit healthier than cigarettes.
Good to hear but I would never go back there. They're not just pawns following the SJW narrative because its good for appearance those guys really believe that bullshit.
I couldn't find my little ones heartbeat consistently until about 12/13 weeks. IMO you are trying when the heart is a little too small still, even my doctor wouldn't attempt with a doppler in office until after 12/13 weeks. Wait another week and try again. That's what I did and eventually found it!
&gt; ARIBO, or Applied Robotics for Installations and Base Operations, is a public-private partnership aimed at demonstrating how driverless technology could be used by the Army.http://smartamerica.org/teams/autonomous-robotics-for-installation-and-base-operations-aribo/Neat.Pics of the shuttle:http://www.army.mil/article/128291/ARIBO_drives_acceptance_of_automated_vehicles_at_SmartAmerica_Challenge/&gt; Team ARIBO, sponsored in part by the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC), demonstrated the potential benefits of cyber-physical systems technology.... Of course they're using this technology to flush out the problems of automated tanks roaming around. *Fuck.*
That's just part of the EU project though - the richest countries are able to help direct (a small in the grand scheme of Western government budgets) amounts of money to poorer areas of all the countries to raise standards in those areas.The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_policy_of_the_European_Union#/media/File:European_regional_policy_2014.svg (Red is bad)
Good for you. I had a situation with my ex-wife. She would only get adventurous when she was drunk, but I didn't think it was okay to do anything more than basic sex when she was drinking as I felt it was unsafe. It sounds like you know what you need to do , you just wanted the validation that you were correct. You are correct. 
Exe modding is needed to add items and this cant be done at the moment. Ed could add it to afterbirth tho, after all friend ball and safety scissors came basically from this community
&gt; The theory is this: intense cinema (or plays, in Aristotle's time) is like purging your soul of deep emotion. If your every-day life is balanced and normal, there may be emotional depth and chaos that is not easily expressed in real life. People are relieved when they watch horror movies and emotional movies like you're describing, because it puts them in a spot to be vulnerable and emotional while still being safe at home or in a theater.Never heard this before, but it sounds so true. When I think of it, my real life sounds so dull and emotionless compared to movies - not in a bad way, just that... not many bad things happen, super deep emotional moments happen rarely too. These movies sort of help me experience the more extreme range of emotions that real life doesn't always give opportunities to experience.
Wrestlers used to be stale and over the hill and they would go to another territory and be fresh and new. There is nowhere new to go and it's a natural reaction from an audience that both feels ignored and has few ways to show their displeasure, outside of verbally displaying it.

You've called in a few pipe-hitting homies back in the day.You are employed at Trevor Philips Enterprises.You've been told by somebody to "stay out of their territory."
In your example is sounds like your craft is just finding what is aerodynamically stable. That is, the drag on the bottom of the craft is more than the drag on the top of your craft.If you wanted to "adjust" what end points which way, I would increase the drag on the top of your rocket and reduce the drag on the bottom.

Because it's not worth my time to stay if it's a loss regardless of how well I do. I'm guaranteed a loss to quit a match that's hopeless thanks to bad teammates, so I'd rather just take my L and move along to the next match without prolonging the inevitable.
The Bechdel test is a single litmus test. It's not suppose to comment on the whole value of a film.  It's just a broad measure of temperature of equality. (Like how carbon dating can't tell you if something is 100 years old... but it can tell you that something is 10000 years old).It's also a low bar measure ("The film can't even pass this basic test")And, Legally blonde is kind of a bad example because it's pretty much a feminist film in disguise of a romantic comedy. (I'm willing to explain my reasoning)  Although the musical is better. 
they offered hiko and ska a spot when they cut semphis and shazam. when they got freakazoid they only offered ska a spot. in terms of just the positions on the team they now dont have a lurker and then it has to be n0thing to lurk and hiko is clearly better at it. it might take n0thing a month or two to grow into the role.
"Teaching a child not to step on a caterpillar is as valuable to the child as it is to the caterpillar."

I've shot an 1887 from around that age. Winchester AA "featherlights" function pretty well, assuming the chamber in yours has been lengthened. Original chamber length for those was 2.5", I believe. We used custom cut-down ultra-light loads until the chamber was lengthened.

Can also do that on console (PS4 anyways), which I don't understand that rule in some FCs.. I could play with a keyboard and mouse if I wanted to, but I choose not to.
Yes, but how do you increase current? You must convince the inverter to do so - this isn't so simple as bolting on parts, but requires skilled firmware and/or hardware modifications. On an ICE you just throw in more oxidizer (whether it be forced air or nitrous oxide) and hope the fuel system keeps up. You can't force more power through the motor without convincing the inverter to do so, etc.
Its sad knowing what happened to his son. Glad he got the fuckers back though.    I wouldn't say its sad knowing the fate; Not even if its rewatching breaking bad.
In that sense, the only interesting part about Contessa is *how* she pulls it off. It is good that she was not a protagonist so much as a force to be accounted for, and that she did not have a solution to the two main problems the world faced.
Can someone explain to me why John Connornator has gone back in time in this movie?  I realize that the movie isn't out yet but the only reason I can fathom is that he is there to kill his own parents.  This is a plan so stupid I can't adequately explain all the problems with it.

When I was a kid I always used to have this dream where something was trying to find me by looking in through the windows in the middle of the night. Sometimes it was aliens, and sometimes it was giants, and sometimes it was both. I'd be in my room and there'd be some presence outside trying to see in. The aliens would split up and go to all the windows, so I'd have to hide, but there wouldn't be any perfect hiding place and after a while they'd come into the house, so I'd have to keep moving from house to house and keep trying to get away. The giants would look in through the second-story windows and sometimes they'd tear the roofs off of the houses. I have blockout curtains on all of my windows these days.
I can't even take you seriously anymore. You're attributing his success to the line. AP has the best fb in the league, Jerome Felton. Shady had the best ranked rushing o line last year. They're on the top 5. Why isn't Murray?

I like this perspective! Thank you.I'm a giver, sometimes to a fault. I don't do things for karma or exposure or what have you, but I'm just naturally super sensitive so I can't just sit around, especially when someone is down or needs a hand. It's one of those "well wouldn't anyone do it because we are all human and that's what humans do?" things, but apparently not. It sounds like you might be similar.It's hard to remember that, yes, some people are horrifically self-centered, but the reality is that most people are good but they just don't pick up on the little things, especially if they're not a giver by nature. 
What you wanted was one of [these types of systems](http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Art-Hanging-System-Gallery/dp/B003174K82), even though they still usually attach to the wall, just the top of it.Where they does leave you is potentially having to suspend your art from the ceiling (or the moulding if there is moulding) by putting some eye hooks above the wall. I don't know how much art you have to hang but it takes a loooooooong time to hang art that way.What are the walls like? How high are they? Can you install a wooden cleat across the top of the wall and hang from clips [like this](http://www.finearttips.com/2012/06/diy-build-an-art-gallery-hanging-system-for-around-100/)?

I like their analysts better.  I feel they have better draft analysis and video put together for each individual player.  Also, I feel their analysts throw less cliches around when it comes to player evaluation and potential fit/future.  Just my personal opinion.

My frames go down to about 54ish and I'll get fraction of a second pauses, particularly in highly populated zones. Even tried lowering my settings to minimum but that didn't seem to help much.
I honestly think that this data point doesn't get enough attention.Karpeles was convicted of fraud in France and sentenced to a medium stretch in prison.  He was convicted in absentia and has not returned to France since the conviction (and, hence, has not served his sentence).How in the world is there any question that Karpeles was (at the very most generous) engaging in extra-legal behavior running MtGox?  Whether he intended harm isn't the question, as the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  Leopards do not change their spots, especially when said leopard has been assessed by various peers as borderline autistic.What matters is the outcome: a convicted felon magically made a lot of money (Bitcoin and otherwise) disappear ... and not only is still walking around free, but has been white-knighted regarding aspects of his behavior during the US SR investigation.Amazing.  Simply amazing.
You could argue that, but you could also argue that it doesn't only apply to those people. To the best of my knowledge, we aren't told exactly the mechanism by which Hatchet works.

There are certain traits that are generally accepted as characteristic for the less intelligent. Like troubles with memory  and retention of non trivial facts, issues solving logical problems and math in general, sense of orientation, or just plainly doing things that are stupid on a daily basis. Like always looking for your keys when they are in your pocket, or not being able to memorize the layout of the town you live in or the building you work in, stuff like that. There are plenty of things that can make you feel stupid, and if they constantly come up, chances are you are not the brightest. Lower intellect is not something that can't be acknowledged by the people that have it. What you are thinking of is a combination of ignorance and ego. 
Good luck! I'm sure it will help you. And thank you for actually being open to the advice given in this sub, you'd be surprised at the number of people who come here and to the other gun subs looking for advice and then get upset and argumentative when they don't hear what they wanted to hear.

&gt; Yet, it is amazing how few attorneys and judges are willing to report or sanction even egregious conduct.I've been a solo practitioner for almost two years now. In that time, I've reported two attorneys to the disciplinary authorities, am in the process of preparing a third report, and have moved that the court sanction the subject of the report being prepared.The board did bupkis about the reports I made and the judge *refused to rule* on my motion for sanctions.I have absolutely no confidence whatsoever in either disciplinary authorities or courts to enforce the rules of professional conduct.

I think one of the most important things you can do to make a character memorable is Backstory, Especially in games that start above level 1. Your character didn't pop into adventuring at a higher level.
This seems like a truth that so many people cant grasp. However...given the authority position that law enforcement has over us as citizens, they should be held to a higher standard, not given undue protection ( which is what the police union provides.)
This is what my intuition would have been.  On the surface, tobacco doesn't appear to be noticeably psychoactive (pre-medical science), whereas all of the other drugs discussed tend to cause marked changes in behavior, which seem like exactly the kind of thing that feeds moral panic.  I figured this is the reason why drugs like caffeine are similarly widely condoned historically.
Starting on a 600 is doable, but not recommended.  600s typically have quite a bit more horsepower and weight than starter bikes. This makes them more fun, but exponentially more dangerous for an inexperienced rider.  The KTM 390 is a great looking bike, and has the most power in the 300 class of bikes. Granted, it wont keep up with a 600 in the straights, but it's definitely no slouch, and will be an absolute riot to carve up corners with.
TB mentioned possibly 2 hour sessions so he can handle it better. Which I'd be cool with especially if it meant we got more than 1 episode every few months.

I also wouldn't expect to report my coworkers for something like this and have them just move on like it's no big deal. If you turn into a tattle, no matter where you work, most people are not going to like you. I get that police should be held to a higher standard but they are just people too. This seems like a pretty harmless thing to go reporting to the chief. I would be on the guy's side if he had started all this over something more serious.
He was in favor of modders making money for their work. He said that valve's system wasn't good though. However he is a very light mod user and doesn't know how heavy mod usage is for Skyrim. Where any pay wall system wouldn't work. Most users have dozens upon dozens of mods. So you are spending $100 if you are using a bunch of piddly paid mods not worth their salt. Where as before it was free and you could experiment. I know I wouldn't use any of the mods I currently use if they were paid. Hell I wouldn't have gotten skyrim and I wouldn't get any Bethesda games in general if mods had a pay wall. Bethesda make big worlds but they are always so flat and you have to shove so many mods into them and unless you experience that, which TB hasn't, you just don't understand the largest issue with paid mods.I feel most of his statements are made worse by his own ignorance to modding in Bethesda games.
Its a gaffe but I think he meant to say something about in light of there being known rapists in the area, if people could be cautious about their security and be watchful and careful of people matching the descriptions of the perpetrators. Saying being alone is an invitation to be raped is a idiotic. 
If anyone doesn't know, this design is nearly identical to their cream ale but with a blue can instead of green. It's also one of the cheapest beers on the market, if not the cheapest.

I don't think the show would have been much differently, honestly. Well, besides the fact that he might have actually killed Buu when he unlocked his power.

I think I recall the tracklisting for the Demon Days promo CD surfacing on Gorillaz-Unofficial, but that's been shut down.

I got lucky the other day when I needed to do a rally race. The first job I popped into was with another guy that needed to do one. We both got on a motorcycle and did that race at the horsetrack without any competitors or the need to communicate since you can't miss the checkpoints. It wasn't fun, but it got the job done. At any rate it's a stupid objective since it only really works for the subset of the population that has their mikes working.

Actually, I'm kinda interested. I've been wanting to edit another video lately. I made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSuvj0QzLko) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np4rJGUI03Y). Feel free to throw me a PM if you haven't already found someone.
Yes. That's between the two of them. It's none of my business. Their dealings with friends, relationships and work stuff can be completely compartmentalized.
I see where you're coming from. Yours is definitely one style of leadership and a style that works every day. Les's style at LSU is obviously a different one. Just analyzing Les's style, it clearly works with many guys, as several players LSU puts on these lists completely turn their college careers around, some even becoming captains. With others, it never worked (as noted by some Texans fans in here who drafted two of them). No strategy works with 100% of people 100% of the time. At the end of the day, players continue committing to LSU and they send more underclassmen to the league than anybody, so whatever they are doing, for the most part, it seems to be working. Edit: On a side note, this world needs more people doing the work you are doing. Just wanted to say "Thank you." 
You were talking about your lander not having enough fuel. If you can get a munar encounter, a reasonably small fuel tank and an LV-909 is enough.You can use a few of the engines you're using now instead of the Skipper, but asparagus staging is expensive overkill. SRBs are cheap. The top half of your rocket with the drop tanks looks very unstable and will cause flipping problems. Consider adding another stage instead.
I should also add that he obtained his degrees from the University of Barcelona and has a heavy Spanish accent, which makes everything he says 10x funnier. I had him last semester for physics 1 and I caught on to his accent in about a month. This semester was a breeze though because of that.

jfc, while i agree she should report it to uber, you are being incredibly radical in your use of the word rape. the dude overstepped his professional bounds, and was incredibly cringeworthy to say the least, but he did not sexually assault or forcibly have sex with her against her will, so please stop jumping to conclusions and trivializing the experiences of those who have actually been raped. christ.

So many things wrong.Let's take the French Revolution, since it's so badly quoted.OK. I sum it up for you. The French guys execute a king and the foreign queen in front of all kings of Europe. All of them want naturally to smash France for that. What happened next ? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_ValmyLet's not talk about Napoleon. Before loosing, how many victories ? He just built an empire in his lifetime and France did not loose everything after Waterloo.
A guy in my 8th grade class decided to argue about skipping english class... "Miss why do we have to learn english it's not like we are living in England" It is actually the stupidest thing i've heard
There's a lot of people very eager to set you on the "right path", in fact, two came to my door earlier today. I would be very careful around those people.
95.3 has always seemed to be more Americana/Blue Grass and of course gospel on Sunday, but besides getting better reception for the ranch where im from, I choose the more Texas country sound I get from the Ranch. Also Shayne Hollinger has just about my favorite music, from what I be noticed 
There were tons of topics on this let me find some for youEdit: here's one, but just do a search and you'll find morehttp://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/33o6ol/discussion_what_vendorfaction_weapons_should_we/
&gt;Erm, why? Is there something bad or shameful about being on the autism spectrum? There's nothing "nasty" about having faced additional struggles in lifeOf course there isn't, I'm not trying to say there is. I'm honestly having a hard time finding the right words to state what I mean. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic. &gt;It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.Yes, absolutely many of them do. But some do so because they just feel more comfortable as the opposite gender. And many do feel suicidal thoughts about it, but they don't necessarily have *physical pain* when they hear their birth pronouns. 
I haven't gotten that far yet, I'm planning to cut out enough to live on for at least 3/4 months, while I look for work.  I have a friend who spent a few years in the UK who I'm likely bringing with me as well, so I won't be completely on my own!
You should also ask if the late payment can be removed from your credit report if one ever appeared or hasn't been already. They sent a letter admitting fault, so I would hope they would correct every action caused by it. 
&gt;  we would normally stream from. We'll get back to our cadence of Pre-Patch Livestreams next week.Alright thanks! The patch is still coming tomorrow right??
I'm on the edge of getting emotional. ... I hope everyone gets how huge this pick is.... this is the difference of losing for another 5 years or winning....
Agreed. This game will probably be released in 2017 if it's the great collecta-thon its looking to be, which I hope it is (and also means that Smash 5 - if there is one - will not likely include them because they're too young of a series). Banjo-Kazooie was one of my most fond childhood memories.
I am also thinking the OP and her husband are pretty upper class, she said in a comment he offered he would pay for surgery if her body changed. Probably in her social circle they worry more about how everybody looks because they aren't weighed down by issues like how much day care costs or working part time vs full time and what if the car breaks and we have a big hospital bill or we don't have good insurance blah, blah.
Well, usually something becomes inedible because of spoilage toxins (like bacteria, fungi, or viruses and their waste-products).  When an edible item is frozen [EDIT: and sealed off from oxygen], metabolism for most things living on and in it stops - and spoilage ceases.We have a few anecdotal instances of [woolly mammoth meat,](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2725/prehistoric-its-whats-for-dinner) that was frozen in tundra being eaten, but I can't vouch for their veracity.I've not done any research on bacteria and viruses that can survive a hard, cold vacuum - but those would be the culprits in making something inedible after billions of years.  Well, that and the fact that we would almost certainly have either evolved beyond the need for a stomach or gone extinct.
Not if you've been wanting out for a while, not saying I'm in this situation but I could see why people who're tired of the job but need some sort of income. 
yeah ive done a lot of reading today. i was semi trolling there but i take it back. i agree with i hateourlives points. there is a lot of institutional racism that just gets ignored because it just seems so insignificant, like calling them thugs
Hard to tell. There were a few black characters on M*A*S*H but that is South Korea and wartime... Divide black probability of character recurrence by show popularity, multiply by rerun coefficient, carry the 2... so probably more than most redditors have black friends, but not by much. Depends if Rodman is visiting, most likely. Tis seasonal.
Other ways at least cover the orgasm issue.  But, if a woman made you orgasm whenever you wanted but only from handjobs would you not get upset at the lack of variety?
Zombies really take a backseat in my opinion. To me it's more a game about people. It shows how humans behave/cope when their surroundings and lifestyle is flipped around and turns to shit. Everyone in the game has a seperate, deep, personal struggle. Edit: spelling
I've noticed a much stronger conservative/small government presence in /r/fatpeoplehate compared to other subs on reddit. I think the fact they take responsibility for their own actions/body might correlate to the conservative views.  Might be why AnCaps tend to be in better shape than most in my opinion too.  
There are no reasons not to run 8 cards in g zone.  Personally I would Opt for the fighters collection 15 Cray elemental and atomos and blizza possibly.
I can understand that with whedon in his stuff but these characters seem to act just as they do in non wheson movies so it just confuses me. They are all witty
Good thing is that you've come here and have actually responded positively to the comments here. Nobody's perfectly non-bigoted and everyone can become better people over time.
The thing with runningbacks is, I want a great RB not a good RB. I'm fine with a good OT and LB, but as far as RB's go, I want someone who will make a big impact. If this is a good RB draft, now is the time to pick the cream of the crop
It's all on Nintendo.  There's no excuse for a company that has the ability to make them to not at least reissue them.  I have many but not all, and the hysteria is ridiculous, so I, too, got out of the race.  If I can't walk into a store and pick one up, it's not worth my trouble.  If Nintendo (specifically of America) wants our money, and we're clearly willing to give it to them, they can do right by their customers and respond to demand.
I just had some time to kill and thought I'd throw it out there for fun. One thing I've noticed is that the more I fill out forms that ask the kinds of questions these competitions ask, the better I am at making a more concise explanation of what we do :)  Likelihood of winning might be low, but it doesn't negate trying.
Yay pay day! The day I go to the liquor store and find some beer I've never heard of to try!  I hope you're all having an awesome night. Gotta go now and tend my crops on Story of Seasons. 
I live in Baltimore and we had riots and protests this week which was pretty exciting.  Other than that my week was pretty chill.  I just finished the last class of my undergrad years and have a bit of a break before all my final papers and stuff are due. 
Loving the stories! :)  Always nice to have a slightly different tech story.And today I have learnt a bit about sewing machines! They are oddly similar to cars - if you break the chasis, no matter how much you try and fix it, it will never be the same again. Something will be out of line.
Jesus Christ the font choices on this site are fucking terrible. It's saddening to hear that a horribl**y** marginalized minority is being discriminated against, but for all I know this article could be actually talking about puppies since I had to stop reading.**Edit:** Fixed a typo...
Not sure that angered/frustrated is the right description... but I'm constantly sickened by the fact that people can be so negligent of the facts, so tied up in emotion, appeal so much to faith and belief and push so hard for guilt and censorship in the 21st century. Honestly... SJWs bear so much resemblance to 19th century Victorians and 16th century puritans... and all the other nut jobs before them... it's absolute whaling insanity.A few years ago I was an optimistic futurist. Surrounded with MOOCs, and new technologies, 3d printing and all that, I was convinced that we were casually heading towards a blissful utopian society were knowledge and facts are held above all, and that the uncensored internet was the perfect forum for the truth and debate to prevail unfettered.Now, I'm much more pessimistic. It seems like no amount of availability of information or freedom from authority is enough to stop human stupidity from finding a way to try and bring it all back down. 
Well dunno if you're interested, but since I looked it up here's how the rosters work. (from the iihf website)&gt;For the first Directorate Meeting on the day before the start of the tournament each team had to register a minimum of 17 players (15 skaters, 2 goalies).The remaining players up to the allowed maximum of 25 players (22 skaters, 3 goalies) must be submitted for players' control two hours before any of the following championship games. Players can be added throughout the tournament until the roster is full.During a game, a team may enter 20 skaters and 2 goalkeepers from the registered players.Teams can continue to add players until they reach the max roster size of 25.
They basically have already.  Yes the clause exists officially but lots of games have come out that were on other platforms first with no new content.Microsoft has taken the stance of our consumer base is first class citizens so a game SHOULD be released on our platform the same day as any other.  If you can't meet that then you should offer something extra for making them wait.Developers can take it or leave it but Microsoft has shown they are willing to let it slide.  Let's remember for a moment Microsoft is a massive corporation run but corporate trained people.  Indie devs might not be the best business people to deal with.  Sure they might make a great game but their business acumen and attitude might be total garbage, we really don't know.
What did you have in mind? And yes I went thew quite a few people but I responded to every one. I blocked quite a few (looking at you Dick pic guy) but I'm learning 
For the same reason that when I hit back after checking a player's market price, it doesn't take me back to the card, it take's me back to the beginning of the collection menu.
I'm so sorry OP. I have tears streaming down my face as I write this. He wasn't just a dumb little mouse. He was your companion and he was precious to you. Your post made him precious to us, too.  
OK, i read through all the posts and there were lots of good tips and I didn't see this one.Don't offer unsolicited advice on the courseEDIT: added that it should be on the course
"My girlfriend got mad at me because I said something callous and insensitive without considering her feelings for an instant. DAE women play mindgames?"
Thank you and I'm sorry to hear you're in a similar situation.The stuck in the old ways thing is so true. It's really hard for me to help out when they offend someone (like my in-laws) or when they make really poor financial decisions. It's like I want to stop helping them, but I also can't stop apologizing or defending them either.I'll try and use your advice the best that I can though, thank you!
I don't contribute that much to the mods I use. I comment on the thread on the features I like, and report game breaking bugs I haven't seen reported before. I certainly don't think I'm in any way entitled to have mods for free, and appreciate the work modders put in to their mods for no tangible benefit.The reason I was worried about this was because there's a long history of sharing assets for free, and profit being made on mods could put an end to that. If I bought the COK mod for Warband would Floris get a cut, as COK was built on Floris? Would the guys who made Brytenwalda get a say in the monetization on all the mods that built on them?What about IP seperate from the modded game? Non-profit stuff generally get a free pass, but could the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings have been made if the modding scene was monetized?
Trust me, I'm no fan of what's happened and is happening in Tibet, but that motion would have achieved little other than annoying China.  I believe more (even if that 'more' is sadly rather little!) can be achieved with quiet diplomacy than harsh words, in this case.
[PS4]Want:DT's and/or RG's 96 or higher. I'm mainly interested in:97 - DT Aaron Donald, 99 - DT Greene, or 99 - DT McCoy99 - RG Kyle Long, or 99 - Larry AllenWilling to trade 97 - SS Lott, 97 - HB Franco, I'll add more soon when I get home and see my binder.
I agree with this.There's a difference between saving resources by living at home and being a leech that failed to launch.I've dated both guys, there's a substantially difference between the two, which is heavily guided by their character.The ones that are trying to move out generally have a job and some sort of fiscal responsibility.Then you have the other type. They may or may not contribute anything at home. They likely bitch all the time about being stuck at home, but have no plan to ever actually leave.
Thank you.. i swear i almost left this community when i saw how all these folks talked about the riots.. they went from what i considered to be a group of really funny, witty intelligent people, to a bunch of sheltered suburbanites.  really... it is understaded how ignorant reddit has been to these riots.  preach it! 
I'm not sure if I'm going crazy, but when they say "punch line" I think it's also a pun for "panty line (punchi line)". Or maybe it's gonna end with a bad joke. I'm just rambling.
"Sorry, do you mind telling me what this is about? As far as I know, my fiancée merely told you about a birth defect she was born with that she has since had corrected. I was born with webbed toes which I got fixed, do you not want me around your kids either?"
I doubt you will find anyone outside the scientific comunity who is as well Read on the subject of common decent / Evolution.As to the evidence , the facts exist the conclusion is wrong. Yes each form of life was created by kind and has a built in ability to change as needed but stops short of becoming anything outside that animal family. 14 species and countless subspecies but all by design. Yes I understand genetics, and the thin amount of fossils claimed to be transitional. Do you know anything about complex proteins required for life? 2000 all left hand required at the same time in a oxidizing enviroment? The odds trump the theory. 
Six years????? there are very few that make it to black in that time. The general time is 9 to 15 years this depends on a lot of things (how often they train, who their instructor is etc). 
Every time you walk through a door, remember to stand up straight. You walk through enough doors in a day that it should be frequent reminder to stand up straight, as long as you're not taller than most door frames.
Yes I agree, in regards to transparency, especially the defendants that do not even know whats going on, without a proper translator. And as for the corruption in other countries, I just meant that mainly it is a republican influence. The United States has the Liberals, Democrats etc., to kind of balance and seemingly cover anything bad behind the scenes.People have a right for access to justice, if they are innocent. It just sounds strange to me that once convicted, even if it is true of whatever crime it may be, through the legal system, you can get away scott free.
&gt;she could be pulled over more by police, etcWhite men are jailed far more than any other type of woman. &gt;looked at less based on her name,What if the guy's name is Cletus and her name is Lashonda? Who do you think would win? 
Answers here are only going to scare you. Fluid in the lungs is just too general a statement to give a prognosis. If she's a healthy young woman, and -like you said- with no previous medical problems, her chances of survival of *most* things are high anyway.

I use Customizable Camera &amp; iHUD and I play almost exclusively in 3rd, long range bow shots being about the only exception.  I also use the crosshair again as aiming a bow in 3rd without it is tough!
Just goes to show how unfair reddit can be.10 times the karma when it's reposted two days later, in a relatively small sub (compared to the big ones), no less.Who is the real OP (on youtube)? These are two different videos, from two different users.
Someones getting paid, someone is doing it out of friendship/consideration/LOOT! (From filthy filthy enemies).There's a difference, but then again a [Flying Dragon] like you will call it despicable anyway.
Agreed - why is it represented this way then? Why not some other crazy looking thing with shed loads of squares and cubes blasting out from all holes and poles.
As with anything that's shiny and new, it loses its wow factor about a week after. For me, it takes using a lesser device for me to really appreciate what I have. My recent upgrade path was Moto G --&gt; Nexus 5 --&gt; Note 4. When I pick up the G (which I still adore) I appreciate the Note 4's hardware all the more.

I dont know if you have a flash or if you know this, but using a flash is great if you want the object to stand out against a dark background, which in this case would be great. Even though most assume your cameras built in flash is not that great, and while it isnt, its good at least for throwing some light if you're far away enough on your subject so the background falls out of exposure.
Similar thing happened to me awhile ago, your tolerance to the actual cocaine in it probably just got too high, while your speed tolerance remained fairly lowEdit: why did I get down voted :^(
Sounds like you're about to have the crowd turn on you, we internet denizens are a fickle beast. Spam will get you crucified, what you might want to do is stick to one thread (your own, don't go hijacking somebody else's thread) and give a bunch of bottles away if you can afford it. Gets your product out there and you get some karma out of it. Real karma, not the reddit shit. Or not, just an idea.
That sounds like a good idea, but he was still only a small crew and he was a long long way from the sea, the north is a big place and i imagine it gets a lot bigger when you're trying to kidnap the heirs to winterfell.
All in GILD and may add more to my AAPL holdings as well if it keeps dipping.SWKS, ENZN, TEVA, DVAX, EAGRX,TSLA on my watchlist for plays during the day.
Isn't it weird how when a woman is filming something like this there is always a ton of pointless screaming and "OH MY GODDDD" and this guy doesn't even get up he just goes "Hey chill." All calm. 
I'm seeing a "Game of the Century Edition Upgrade Pack", though if you're not seeing the regular GotC Ed. then I'm not sure if this'll help: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/47503/Incidentally, can anyone comment on if just the Upgrade Pack is worth it at this price (assuming you have IV already and have no interest in the rest of the franchise)?
Is it racially loaded though?  I've never heard anyone say that it is before the recent series of disturbances beginning around the time Ferguson was going on.  
It's a waste of a year. Usually at McGill what happens is that you enter as an MSc and then if you like the lab and the lab likes you, you switch to a PhD and don't bother writing up the research. Compared to doing an MSc with a rotation you're saying yourself 1.5 to 2 years of wasted time (writing and on rotations). 
Redditors have always prided themselves on being against what the "mainstream" media has been. 5 years ago /r/politics was one of the most popular subreddits because being progressive was still an unpopular thing to be. Now that mainstream media has started talking more and more about white male privilege and that has become an more and more popular narrative, redditors have switch stances so they can once again be "edgy" and against the stream.More and more they are starting to reflect right wing media. They believe  that race and gender minorities are asking for "special rights" that white cis straight Christians don't have. 
I don't recall things going out of stock, unless they're specifically stated as limited, like pressed shadows, discontinued items, or Femme Fatale items.
James Harden is good, but he is also a rep for a sports drink that kobe has a big stake in. Would probably be good for business if he got MVP after all.

The lack of discipline is the result of on overly-litigious society and insurance companies that would rather just pay the settlements and raise insurance premiums because it's cheaper than fighting in the courts and winning.  This results in zero-tolerance policies to scare people into letting the students do whatever they want without teachers being able to interfere.  Firing a good teacher is cheaper than paying higher insurance rates.None of this has anything to do with liberalism.
Oh, right, the real world... Let me just get on a plane to talk to a friend who lives on the other side of the world... So much more practical than using something like Skype...
That's two different things. Making it easy to port apps from the other platforms is about solving the missing app problem (which is no longer about the total number of apps, it's now that one missing big app. Right now that's snapchat, for a while it was Instagram).Microsoft had to do that to try and get these apps on their platform because that's a big reason people stay away from the platform. The idea is that once these apps are on the platform and the companies behind them see the numbers they will eventually move to UAP to get additional features (and to get to the Xbox/HoloLens as well)
Don't marry/date in the ages between 18 and 21 or date someone who's between 18/21.  This is a period I like to call 'turning into a productive member of society'.  A lot of things change and get dropped.  Relationships are usually at the top of that list.

Hey, a fellow Aussie! I live in a city area, so I'm sure there are plenty of vegan options - I just haven't looked very hard so far. Thanks for the tip about the fat free mayos!
It's the same thing with recognizing that some cultures in the world are more socially advanced than others. But in my anthropology elective class, I learned that's called "ethnocentrism" and it's offensive. (rolls eyes)
I wonder if Blizzard had any idea the monster they were creating when they added Pepe. Also I think it would be super cool if Pepe played some important roll in events somehow. Like the worm from adventure time. 
This is true, especially what is packed in some of the sub 500 phones as well. When I switched I couldn't believe how much more I could do with a 2 year old flagship compared to this years iPhone.
90% of that is coke. Shops there have 3 fridges of coke, and one shelf for everything else. They even sell Pepsi 10-20% cheaper, because no one touches it.
My kid asked me recently why 'poop' isn't as offensive as 'shit' when they both refer to the same thing? I don't fucking know, because society - that's why. 
I was more referring to people wanting guarantee that their mod still work in like 1month or even 1 year. Or buying 2 different mods and needing guarantee that they will work together.   In your example it would be like buying ketchup from the machine and then complain when it goes bad 2 months later. Or that it no longer tastes like ketchup when you mix it with mayonaise, mustard, hot sauce, and every other sauce in the machine.I agree thats it's a bad comparison though, and that food and games are unrelated and totally different. I'm just rustled
I'm getting it from rock star as well as its only £29 on G2A. I really want it for the online as I played that on 360 and loved it. I get around 20 frames now. Which isn't great, but playable and I'm happy. But every little helps  :)
Guys, I got in! I got into the Air Force. This isn't a question, but this is a big deal for me as it's been almost a year since I started the process, and I wanted to share since I've spent a lot of time on here and the newbie threads have been a fucking motherlode of information.I can answer questions about the waiver process if anyone would like. I can't tell you what it's like from the waiver authority/surgeon general's side, but I can tell you what it's like from the DEP perspective (or almost DEP, I guess. I can finally be one of you now).Spoiler: it's a lot of waiting. But the waiting pays off!
I believe Phantek also release a 120mm version for static pressure. I personally use AP15's (when they were still decently priced).  I've seen people use the EK Vardar series fans for their build. I just find their noise very whiny compared to the GT series fans. 
Tf isn't an engage champ?  The fuck are you talking about?  Also all he has to do is w again to get his stun up while Annie has to use 4 spells to get it up.  If 4 people burn flashes because they see an annie run up to them then it is their fault for standing together, not running away sooner, and not ccing her.  I'm dropping salt all over this thread?  I've commented 3 times because people are posting false information.
This is completely false.  taxes have gotten more progressive in the last 30 years, not less.  in 1979, when the top rate was 70%, the richest 20% had 45% of income and paid 55% of taxes.  Today, they have [50%](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?DocID=458&amp;Topic2id=20&amp;Topic3id=22) of the income and pay [70%](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?DocID=558&amp;Topic2id=20&amp;Topic3id=22) of the taxes, a massive increase.  And that is all federal taxes, not income taxes.  the richest 20% pay a whopping 93% of income taxes.  
No, I don't mind people who choose to act and adopt the personality of the opposite gender, except think they're a little weird.But if you've literally convinced yourself and lied to others that you are the opposite gender, you're mentally ill. Please don't recognize yourself as a female, but a M2F transgender or vice versa.Queue the downvotes. I know a lot of people get pissed off at people like me for thinking like this, but please be honest with yourself, if you're a man, you're a man. If you're a woman, you're a woman. You're free to behave differently, but don't lie to yourself or other people.EDIT: for illustration, imagine i went into a female bathroom and was held up by girls asking what i was doing there. i exclaim 'no no, it's cool! i'm a girl!' should i be denied access to the bathroom because i haven't made any effort to look like a girl? why does it matter what i look like? if i 'believe' i'm a girl i should be able to pee from my penis in here!
I understand what you're saying - that parts of the Old Testament are valid and parts are not, as if God himself wasn't sure what was moral and what was immoral and that he changed his mind, or that objective standards of immorality themselves have somehow changed.I think it's an idiotic argument. 
It's currently done with a bunch of polygon strips with alpha textures.Here's some nontextured Last-of-us models to give you an idea of the underlying geometry:http://www.zbrushcentral.com/showthread.php?1027594&amp;p=1027594&amp;viewfull=1#post1027594 I think the demo shown is suggesting it's down to polygons per hair strand.
It sounds like she has gone off the deep end on this, but I am also thinking about the circumstances.  She is far away from her family, her friends, has nothing in her life (work, school), living in a hotel room.  At this point it sounds like the only thing she is, is a wife, and is freaking about anything that might take you away from her and take away that last definition.The irony is that her behavior just might.As well as therapy to address this behavior, what are her plans for building a life in your new home?Edited to add: I had wanted to say also, that I personally would have told my husband if I found out a friend used to have a crush on me.  And I would expect the same from him.  I think it would be reasonable for her to be upset you didn't (though it doesn't excuse any of the behavior that's spiraled out since then).
That's sorta the point of flash, if you couldn't flash out that would be dumb cause you just flash and get feared from so far away and die anyway. Literally negates flash and would be broken

I'm guessing he's not going to answer this but from what I've seen, most of the characters that ended up on Breaking Bad had bit parts on X Files over the years. And yes, Vince did take mental notes when working with an actor while directing or producing for the time he would ultimately be writing his own series. So based on interviews, I believe he did specifically get exposed to Cranston's talent (again, as well as many of the other actors from BB) via X Files.
&gt; I played Varus before it was cool broDid you also [get rekt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest) by Arminius before it was cool?
I'd say so. You can't freaking attempt to set somebody on fire just because they won't let you steal from their store. This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard and it infuriates me that they want to be taken seriously as protesters. I'm Asian and I am absolutely heartbroken for these business owners. I can understand throwing rocks at the cops (to an extent) but keep your beef with the people it is with...
I email them the resume along with my notes from the phone screen. We might have a chat if they really like the candidate. Best practices vary from company to company, though.&gt;  ignoring me because I've been dinged.Some companies have a policy not to notify candidates they've been rejected or provide feedback of any kind to avoid potential discrimination suits. It's shitty, but it's more a shitty company thing and not necessarily a shitty recruiter thing.Recruiters are also human and sometimes forget things. If I wasn't able to make and sort task lists based on my email inbox, my desk would be covered in post-it notes.

Total. The retreating Iceni were blocked by their own support wagon train, which also happened to house their families. Many of the Warriors and there families were crushed when the Romans deployed their Calvary on the retreating Iceni. Tacitus recorded not even the women were spared. So an army of a little over 100k plus the wagon train, which stretched the far end of the valley. 
Your chosen power supply comes from a low quality manufacturer, and has low quality components. Because of this, it has bad voltage regulation and ripple suppression, meaning it doesn't put out very clean power, which can decrease the life of your components. The unit I chose has a better manufacturer and better components. As for processor, the Xeon has 4 more threads then the i5, which makes it ideal for content creation. Many(if not most) programs for content creation(music, video, photo editing) support multithreading, which can speed up your work considerably. 
Moles of H2SO4 = 150,000g / 98.07848 grams per mole = 1629.387486 moles.1629.387486 x (2 moles NH3/1 mole of H2SO4) = 3058.774973 moles of NH3.25 atm x V = 3058.774973 x 0.0821 x 293K. Divide by 25 on both sides. 25 atm on the left side cancels out.V = (3058.774973 x 0.0821 x 293) / 25 = 2943.189984 Liters of NH3.-------"If 45.0 Liters of natural gas, which is essentially methane (CH4), undergoes complete combustion at 730 mm Hg and 20°C, how many grams of each product are formed?" Equation I came up with:CH4 + 2O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2H2OI'm confused because I'm not sure what the constant of mm Hg is. I believe I must convert Methane liters to moles, those moles to CO2 and H2O moles respectively, then plug them into the Ideal Gas Law equation. Am I doing anything wrong?  
I know I sure as hell wouldn't go looking for it there. Just the smell of Family Dollar makes me hate myself a little.Side note, why do all of them smell exactly the same?
Yep she's in good nick as it is. I am unhappy these bikes don't come with an RPM gauge so I can see how the gearing suits it for now. Have to go by noise :/
Wasn't a student at Queens but from my experience most people living in these areas aren't from Belfast and a lot of them go home at the weekend to get fed by their ma and da. 
Hi Leafygreencarl, your post was removed to keep the subreddit clean. This was probably due to it being redundant (i.e. a thread discussing something that is no longer an issue).If you would like this to be reversed and your thread re-approved please reply to this comment.Thanks,  valiantiam
I checked new egg and that's all they have, and they started shipping to Australia a while ago so I might buy some parts from there, some others from Australian shops.
You're completely right. It has to be the right time and the right approach. It's much easier to do it with dread. By the time you reach level 5 you usually are where you want to be.

I named my 12 year old Dog, Indiana when I was very young as I really liked the Indiana Jones Movies at the time (and I still do). Also, she was born on Independence Day, I was there to witness her birth which was amazing. 
I laughed at my friends for years for having sunburns. I had never had one - at least when I did they never hurt and would be gone the next morning. Then I lost some weight and felt comfortable in a sleeveless tee which I had never worn before. I sat out intentionally tanning. My forearms and legs got a nice tan...and my upper arm and shoulder burnt. I was in agony for fucking days. It didn't even look like this pic and it was so bad. I rolled all the skin off thinking I was supposed to. Holy fuck. Nothing helped. 
It's always mentioned but the Graffiti Wall along the Raritan and 18 is cool. You get to it from Boyd Park, or by squeezing through the locked gate in the park behind the river dorms. There are some homeless camps along the way so be wary, but I've walked down it numerous times and never encountered any problems.

Shame, if he were at any other club than Chelsea he'd be rewarded for his good form with first team opportunities. Instead his coach will see this and think 'wow, well done lad, you've earned yourself a loan to League One'
it was a play on her being in Seattle and being a broncos fan..  The timbers are the MLS rivals of the Seattle Sonics, always super fun games.  Furthermore, the Timbers fans are known as the TImbers' Army.
Hmm . . . the first time we were pretty unambiguously on France's side.  The second time, well, there were two Frances; we were allies with one, and were technically fighting the other, except that they secretly wanted to merge with France-1 and be on the same side as us.This . . . was an awkward situation.  We may have actually been European for a while there, it's hard to say.Loafers are a kind of shoe.  Not tennies.
took an nes game andi covered the hole where the connection pins are with clay. then i poured liquid rubber silicone onto the game. after 24 hrs it pops right out and nothing gets stuck or ruined.  then u have a perfect mold of the game
"Excuse me." *He says hurriedly, not waiting for a response as he pushes past Laura and dashes up the steps, taking them three at a time. He throws open the door to Tay's room and rushes inside before looking around the room for her. He sees her on her bed and quickly wonders if it's alright to do this, before moving next to her and taking the amusphere off her head, cutting her connection to ALO. He's kneeling next to her bed, waiting for her to wake up and cupping her cheek with one hand while he pulls out his phone with the other. He glances at it long enough to dial the emergency services number, and quickly requests an ambulance at Tay's address.*
A lot of the yuppies grew up playstation. The 360 had huge appeal with younger folls while the older ones got ps3. I recall a survey that showed the ps3 owners biased 5 years older than the 360 owners. With the ps4 it might be a carry over where they got a spny machine again. I know all the low 20 somethings were fond of the 360 and they got xb1 as well.
the start is a bit slow, but if you can guess the ending you are legit a pshycic. Its was mostly just really fucking fun to watch and it owned its "trashy" nature like a boss.Also the first 30 seconds are pretty sweet.
Her name is Katsumi, and she is a cartoon character I created.  She may very well be my wife someday if this bitch Sandy from my school continues to friendzone me.
Also do you know how you fix bad knees. You exercise them. They're are plenty of low impact leg strengthening exercises in fact, enough where people have made books, articles, brochers, manuals, training regiments etc....

I've looked at the [drafts from 2000-2011 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/34ffrr/when_belichick_drafts_a_player_3_rounds_too_early/cquficg).  Overall, the Pats are tied for third in getting the most talent (by Total CareerAV) out of our drafts, despite being the most successful franchise in the league in this period.  This is a combination of BB being able to accumulate picks (via lopsided trades) and being above average (9th out of 32) at getting CareerAV for our pick value.  The only reason this graph makes us look bad is small sample size including our two worst drafts (2007, 2008).
This is outrageous! Disneyland, Paris isn't even close in the rankings. 1.Magic Kingdom, Walt Disney World, Florida.2.Disneyland, Anaheim.3.Tokyo Disneyland.4.Tokyo DisneySea.5.Disneyland Paris.If they can't get it right with amusement parks, how can you trust them when it comes to fairytale's. Of course, most popular fairytale? Noah's Ark. I loved it as a kid. My Grandma bought an Ark offered at the Arco (I just got the word play) gas station down the street and with every fill up, you got a pair of animals. The people who made the top ten list, probably just got Noah and Darwin mixed up because they looked the same. They must have thought the Ark was the HMS Beagle. 
There's a little kiosk on the SE corner of Martin Place and Pitt that is really good too, called Brooklands Coffee Co.FWIW, I've been working on Martin Place for 3.5 years now, my regular haunts are:* Steel Espresso* Mecca* Brooklands Coffee Co.* The place Gladys uses* Taste Baguette (next to that other place - does Campos Superior)* The Coffee Lab (name?) Pitt St end of Hunter Connection* Palominos* Loaf &amp; Devotion (very cheap coffee in the afternoon)* Due Mondi at Wynyard. The $7.50 bacon &amp; egg roll + large coffee is good value, but make sure to ask for the roll toastedThere's also a place that does Toby's Estate but I can't think where it is now...
As a moderator of /r/GrandTheftAutoV, I've noticed the same thing. They tend to advertise their crew as much as possible (even in their videos; the logo in the corner and then like 5 seconds of the logo again at the end).I'm not saying there's anything you guys can do, but /u/MagmaGuy is not the only one to notice this trend.
oh man I've been fantasizing about throwing a chair at this asshole barista in my coffee shop for day, and I don't seem to care about the consequences. I'm rapid-cycling and I'm of the opinion that the excess energy from hypomania paired with mixed state of depression equals violent behavior. I swing from being jovial and the life of the party to a bitter contentious mood that catches people off guard. I've lost almost every relationship I've had due to this pattern in the last three years, it's fucking lonely as hell.
They should have done gold jerseys, with red and white stripes on the sleeves, collar and waistband, and white numbers outlined in red. Y'know, like a [certain popular jacket](http://i.imgur.com/Ytf3H7m.jpg?1).

&gt; Timothy also equates homosexuality with sexual immorality.Sure. Paul says all kinds of shit.  Like women should be quiet and make babies.  Oh, and he wrote a book on how to treat your slave.  Does he define your moral universe?...Tell me what Jesus says about homosexuality.  Go ahead.
How is this not taught in the US? I feel like every other civilized country has taught this in school by the age of 14... It was in the first year of highschool for.Really, personal finance in general is pretty basic math.
Thanks for your response. Yes, I plan on adding my own sentences. But having something to start with would be nice.I'm not paying any attention to the "timeline". I'm in not hurry. What I'm trying to do is to break through a learning plateau that I've been on for some time. Language learning is a lifetime adventure.I actually don't need to learn any vocabulary. I just need to learn to say things in a more native way. I plan on using anki with the sentences. In order to learn anything I find I have to learn and forget it a ton of times before it sticks.
"They make a solitude and call it peace" is now one of my favorite quotes. Fuck, where did all the eloquent English speakers go? What the hell is our poet laureate even doing?
The way I see it, it's rough that the Caps beat us, but they honestly played better, especially on game 7. Our real enemy during the series was our coaching staff.
I bet you already know these, but You Got A Killer Scene There Man is exactly what you're describing, even more than Smooth Sailing imo. Also I would argue that I'm Designer is the dark version of Smooth Sailing/YGaKSTM. I've always felt like most Era Vulgaris songs are kind of a dark mirror of songs on Lullabies and …Like Clockwork.
What if we just voted for a local independent candidates to go to government instead of the big parties? The big seats would be allocated by a person's experience/expertise and then from a  lottery within those candidates. The leader/speaker would be from a lottery from all candidates. Maximum 10 year terms.Would that not be more democratic?
hey guys! Im looking for some opinions.&amp;nbsp;I want to color my hair again but I dont know which color to choose.

New update is good but this new map, i dont know. Its not like bad or something but i thought it will be inspired by old rust map... i cant find any place from old rust its mess. Sorry guys but im rather stay in old rust and wait for custom maps.

Oh, you had so much more on them. That deposit is a contract for a similar vehicle at the same cost. That dealer would be fucking screwed if you had lawyered up. Taking the refund absolves them of blame. You had every right to say "I don't want a refund, I want the vehicle involved in our contract".
I really didn't think that /r/videos or the other defaults could get any worse, but once again they find a way to surprise me. I was so happy the other day when that guy got gilded like 62 times for calling out all the racists, but unfortunately it appears the majority of people on this site still feel the need to spew hateful bullshit 24/7.
&gt; I myself AM a telemarketer and own a telemarketing business. Anyone with common sense would look at what my company does as "telemarketing" whether he wants to acknowledge it or not ... I do believe that a majority of people would consider what I do as telemarketing. (contrary to what the other guy is saying)"**The argument is not whether or not you are a telemarketer. It is not whether or not you are, by definition, a telemarketer. I'm not saying otherwise**"I don't think he understands much. I've gone from feeling sympathetic, to not at all and now back to sympathetic again, all in the 5 minutes of reading this thread. Poor bastard is in way over his head caught in an infinite loop. Incomprehension, delusion, condescend, rinse, repeat. Sounds like he'd make a terrific telemarketer.
frigging hate that.The last time I got dismounted they at least gave me a parachute, which caused me to float half way across the zone. At least there was no SPLAT.
I'm sure you're a "less regulation" type so why does it matter? There are tons of affluent, private equity, what-have-you firms who hope for their Madoff moment. They buy up functioning companies, borrow off the equity, then fire all the workers and liquidate. There is no moral standing for that manner of destructive profit.I believe in community, in "United we stand." You want a functioning society to run on the whims of a few.We will always disagree. Your "charity" means nada. We can all brag about what we've done to play catch up. It's time to play "let's figure out why so many people need catching up."You don't have a "right" to smooth highways, inspected beef or filtered water, but I bet you're glad the people before you in society decided those were worthwhile places to put public funds.Your type complain about what doesn't work, but you never see what does work. And every solution is "private profit, public bailout" and we're all fucking sick of it.
Fun fact: while it's widely thought that UV exposure plays a role in melanoma, the most common mutations present in melanomas are not mutations that are of the type that would be induced by UV, which naturally has led to the question as to whether or not UV exposure actually is a risk for melanoma.Squamous and basal cell cancers though--it's all about sun exposure.
No. It's not her fault. And rapists aren't "devoid of any self control". They are just people who decide to commit rape. There's only so much the government can do to protect you from criminals, especially if they aren't criminals yet. 
How much are the blue, purple, and yellow enchants going for these days. I have a few hundred of each still. Should I try to sell before the Xbox transfer since there is no chat box?
Holy shit. I translated this quote from Russian to English on my livejournal when I was a teenager and was this type of girl. That's fucking hilarious.
I think we'd like some sort of proportional representation even more but unfortunately all of the three major parties refuse to consider it. Only the Greens do, and how much likelihood is there of there recommendation on that being taken up by the others!
Thanks!.. Art seems like one that would be fun...So here is another random question to anyone who can answer:I have played a teeny, tiny bit of TS2 and noticed that everything takes FOREVER. Is it still that way in TS3?
welp, the u joints are pretty important, but if you break an axle while driving, you could wreck the  car at worst, or   trash the differential at least. best not to drive it at all IMHO, get the axle fixed first and then worry about getting the u joints done.
So you want people who disagree with him to not down vote him because he showed up for an AMA?I'm not on board the hate train now that they've corrected the issue, if anything I feel better about Valve. I just hope they don't pull this stunt again, or if they do we see a MUCH better system.
I realize we are mad at them, but they do this each year?  If so, I'll be stockpiling brand new phones when they come up for $5 again.  Only brand new ones though, I dare them to reject those.
It's entirely a matter of style.  In the end, you're dealing with all of the same maps (diffuse, specular, normal, etc).If you want it to look painted, paint it.  If you want it to be photo-realistic, use photos.
I know the term "bridge troll" is thrown around a lot these days, but fuck is that the mug of a mutant that lives under a crevice and steals coins from children under threat of being eaten or what?
I'm sorry you are feeling this way, its a really tough adjustment! Big hug to you! Can someone come and hold the baby so you can take a nap, take a long shower, or go get a haircut? Getting my haircut when baby was 5 weeks old was magic! A friend had thoughtfully given me a gift card for my shower, lovely lady that she is! Just sitting in the chair and not doing anything, just letting someone take care of me for half an hour was incredibly relaxing. And then I was actually happy to get home to baby, because I had had a break.  Just something that makes you feel more like yourself and not simply your new title of "mom"?   Or do you feel like you are experiencing depression? If so please talk to your doctor. Either way, you are not alone. It is so overwhelming to go home to a completely new reality, and be responsible for someone you love so much, but that is simultaneously exhausting!
&gt;The players themselves bring a negative image on magic.The problem whenever this happens with nerdy things is that most of the more socially aware fans avoid public events because they cringe at it just as much as other people looking at it.So what happens is that you don't really see the "normal" fans as much because "negative image" fans keep them away. It's a self-defeating cycle.
It's fucking ridiculous IMO.Why I as someone who knows what's the craic and has to do this, is starting to piss me off. I'm getting friends asking me why their phone doesn't last the day and trying to explain the above is an effort in futility and something I shouldn't need to do.Especially so with Lollipop and me repeatedly telling users that a factory reset (which from my anecdotal evidence seems to work) is probably their best "fix."
Really wish I was 18 sooner so I could vote for him. There's no other presidential candidate out there who I share my political beliefs so closely with. Right on!
Because it will set in motion a chain of events that would probably lead to a coalition with the SNP, giving them a platform to implement their vision for Scotland.

It's  dated (very - my copy was printed in '77...), but for how a simple CPU functions and a general introduction, Malvino's Digital Computer Electronics is still rather good.  There's no LogiSim or Verilog at all, of course.   
The school.actually has a pretty decent non fear-mongering campaign.  They're saying sure it won't kill you but it could still cause some problems which I think is a reasonable claim to make especially for inexperienced college students.  But the fatal vision is pretty ridic.
Dude, so-called "hot" blondes suck big fat donkey penis.I remember when I used to think they were the "hottest."  That's when I believed there was such a thing as "most attractive."  There isn't.  Everyone has flaws.  There is what you're attracted to, and what you're turned off by.  The reason I was even attracted to them in the first place was because of their presence in the mass media.  There were always hot blonde bimbos running around on TV being featured as "the best," or hottest.The more you narrow your attraction criteria in an arbitrary, irrational manner, the less opportunities you have.Actually receiving interest from 7-8 brunette hipster chicks is doing better than 95% of the male population.Also, as you pointed out: "party" chicks are so dumb that any decent human being would want to ship them to a desert island after spending 5 minutes with them.
&gt;I think all came back positive except for GAD antibodies. In that case T1 is an odd diagnosis.From **[labtestsonline](http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/diabetes-auto/tab/test#what)**:&gt;If no diabetes-related autoantibodies are present, then it is unlikely that the diabetes is type 1. The insulin dosage is not high, more like T1 levels, but I'll let the T1s comment on that. The goal of 160 is a bit loose, especially if your post-prandial test is not at your peak time.What are your typical carb loads in meals?PS.&gt;I don't recall the results and they were never sent to me,Ask for copies, either printed or email, of all lab tests including past ones.

Don't blame Telstra - Ziggy stated 15 years ago that Telstra's copper was "5 minutes to midnight" (his words). That's why they started rolling out HFC, which got canned when the NBN deals were brokered.Now the NBN has been scrapped, and we're left with a network that Telstra has been doing minimal maintenance on for the last 15 years, due to a planned obsolescence.Abbott has then gone ahead and balanced Australia's future on this dying network. Oh, and did I mention they sued TPG for rolling out it's own fibre once they canned FTTH NBN? In the end, it's the government that's fucked the network, not Telstra.I WAS paying $230/mth for 10/10mbps business grade connection to my home in the Sydney CBD, 300m from the nearest exchange.Now I'm sitting in my flat in South London, enjoying 152/12mbps for about $69/mth, and they're planning to upgrade me to 200mbps within the next few months!
"I am aware and I did not take it as an insult. I simply feel that the game is not for me." *Zaffre says, ditching the frown and instead resting on a neutral face.*
&gt; Well yes and no. It hasn't been in flux for actual marriage participants. You're either being naive or dishonest. I give benefit of doubt and suspect the former.&gt;Agreed that the institution changes, SLOWLY, in response to environmental factors, just like other things that evolve.Marriage law has changed a multitude of times just over the history of our nation alone. I suppose depending on your definition of "slowly" marriage seems to be almost static... however if you bother to educate yourself you will see the definition of marriage and its use as a social institution is constantly changing all over the globe - yes, even in the U.S.
It seems silly if they know I am talking to them to repeat their name (they know who they are)ALSO, sometimes I do it because I have no idea what their name is, and either don't care or am too embarrassed to admit I don't know it.
No kidding. I remember when I was their age and I had many of the same ideas and views. Not that I have become a very conservative person in the 20 plus years that have passed since then, but I do have to shake my head at the fact that I know I used to sound just like them. I think it must be something that a lot of normally intelligent young people go through. 
&gt; He was well worth all the bullshit he gave us.How will you feel if the Title IX investigation leads to serious penalties against the university?
Oooo what if they like did that, and then made it like a little more streamlined so it fits in your pocket better as then like instead of a bag because that would be annoying to carry around, it had like a little straw on it!...wait

Tell him to shut up. We may be players who beat a hard game few really play and proud of it but we're not arrogant pricks that we're going to put a new player down.Thing is, you're supposed to use a weapon YOU like and feel comfortable with. It doesn't matter if it's the claymore, uchigatana, etc... max up defense, nothing wrong with that. Act like a pro? With all due respect how can he expect a new player to do the crazy shit pros do? Practice makes perfect and frankly he's just way into over his head in his arrogance for him to pretend you to act like a hotshot. Remember, fashions souls for life but if I'm playing through the game and I want to do it quickly I'll use everything at my disposal.
Serious response:    Would love to meet a nice girl at a public library or coffee shop when I'm doing work there.  Unfortunately it's always all old people in their 50-80s talking about nothing, who seemingly have nothing to do all day.
I dunno dude - Post-snip, my wife drove me home and I spent a couple of days chilling on the couch. I understand it's subjective, but personally? I felt like I'd been dropkicked right in the meat n' potatoes. For my $0.02 - If there was ever a part of your anatomy where you want to exercise a little extra caution...Don't let the trolls keep ya down, brother!
Bucs on the clock 5 mins ago... watchespn *just* aired it. Do I even bother sticking to WatchESPN and trying to not get spoiled, seeing as how I'm *5 minutes behind*? Ugh. :(
Well generally in science we know if we aren't sure of something. Name a time where the whole scientific community was totally off base. So the Earth being flat doesn't count because that wasn't supported by scientific evidence, that was the church. 
You remind me of something that Adorno and Horkheimer wrote in *The Dialectics of Enlightenment*. They asserted that all laughter in the cinema becomes a 'parody of humanity'. We fight on against the current, sir. To the dawn! 
I like that too.   What if they are fighting wave upon wave together.  Then you hear a shot ring out, and Yasopp falls to the ground.  Usopp turns around to see Van Augur standing on something (we don't know what Raftel's terrain looks like yet so I'm not speculating) and then they fight?  With Usopp getting the narrow victory and Yasopp apologizing for being leaving and not being there for Usopp and his mother?  I really want a heartfelt reunion for those two!!
So fox is actually quite liberal and everyone knows Bush was illeterate, whats your point? i dont see anything of relevance from your statement. when the protest first started and it meant for something maybe your statement would have some relevance, but seeing as how places like Baltimore, and Ferguson have degraded to riots, much like the L.A. riots i think the fact that a mob tried to burn someone, and even if he was exaggerating, his business, and many others have been destroyed. it might be racist but i mean if you think about it, look what happened during the L.A. and Compton riots, and now Fergusen and Baltimore. tell you what, shit like this never happened during the we are the 99% protest full of white people, or for a bigger cause like protesting against the vietnam war, except for the incident with the marines, and you never see asians protest, so yeah might be racist but you dont see anyone else doing what they do.
Sort of. STV is only proportional-ish. In particular, it's only proportional within each riding; it's not proportional across the entire country. So parties that get broad support across the country, but thin support within any particular riding (like the Green party) would still get screwed.STV's main benefit over MMP is that it works without formalized parties, which would make it a good fit for municipal council elections.Regardless, both are miles ahead of FPTP.
"Knowing about that" and understanding are not the same thing.Many "know about" calculus, Einsteins theory of relativity and many other things - but don't understand them. 
"It said something next to the text box about an asteroid."You know when you fill out something online and anything with a red asterisks needs to be filled out or else it won't work? Yea...
I'm not saying anything about "should." I'm just pointing out a fact. Certain types of news stories sell. "Racist cops harm minority" is a really popular story. Nobody yet knows what happened to Gray to cause his injuries. But, it is being put into the "racist cops harm minority" folder, which allows everyone to make a snap decision based on pre-conceived notions. 
If we give the isles Kessel, there pick will be in the 20s. That's not a great pick in most draft years. I'd want a bit more than that although strome is great.

The dogs in the promotion were all adoptable dogs from Sit With Me Rescue and Ottawa Dog Rescue. Most of them were adults and adoption applications could be discussed with their handlers if anyone showed interest during the visits today. They mention in the blog that the visiting dogs can be any age or breed, and which rescues they were supporting across Canada.

Hahaha dude you don't know me, or what I do. I just wanted to see if I could make you mad, and I was successful. I think I hit the nail on the head with that last comment. Have fun flaunting your hand outs around. Edit: By the way, "Outta", isn't a word. And I don't have peach fuzz, I stay clean shaved. It looks more professional.

For the lazy, May 12.    EDIT: just some key points from the article.  &gt; For inspirations, he name-checks Portishead, Massive Attack, Thom Yorke and “old ’60s psychedelic shit” like the Kinks and the Stooges. At one point, he breaks into singing Cream’s “Free” and calls T. Rex’s Electric Warrior “perfection.”    that's interesting. can't wait to hear this new sound.  &gt; hitmaker Mark Ronson also contributes on the project.   I can't wait to hear this, especially since I love what he did with Bronson's Baby Blue.    &gt; A$AP Rocky admits he’s only skimmed Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly: “I got about two songs I liked.”    This kinda upsets me. I mean, to each their own, but I was hoping Rocky would be a fan of a hip-hop album so highly acclaimed by nearly everyone. Then again, he said in an interview that he doesn't care about reviews. I was just hoping he'd be a fan.
No you're not :P I like Joel as a character as well, and seeing his character development adds to my liking to his character. Some of the things he says are just cold, but that is part of his development, as I just said above. It's just for me, Ellie just comes out a little on top. That's all.
I was at a good friends wedding about 6 years ago and a group of us guys went to track down the groom for a drink before we sent him walking down the isle.  We searched around this giant house and realized he was in the bathroom so we quietly turned the handle and burst the door open to find him standing up facing us with his pants and underwear at his ankles, wiping his ass with both hands between his legs, wiping from back to front.  I think we all stood there for a good five seconds wondering just what in the fuck was happening and then burst into raucous laughter.  I have no idea why he was doing it this way, or if that's what he does every time. Before we could ask all of the obvious questions we were summoned outside and the wedding was under way.

Amiibos are basically action figures of Nintendo characters originally intended for Smash Bros, where you could tap the figure's base onto the GamePad and play against/train an AI player and then save it onto a small chip in the base by tapping it onto the GamePad again. In HW, you can tap TLoZ amiibos (Link, Zelda, Shiek, Ganondorf) at the title menu once a day to receive weapons for that character. In some cases, they can drop upgraded weapons (I got a Triforce Spinner from my Zelda Amiibo the first time I used it, but since then it's been lots of rapiers). Non-Zelda themes amiibos drop other random things, ranging from 1-50k Rupees or various materials. Amiibos can be found at your local game retailer for ~$13 each. 
I vote for who does the least for niggers and it's usually republican, all of these people saying they're voting for other shit parties that don't even equal 1% of the populations vote are stupid. Nearly all of the country wont change their vote between the two parties so you choose the less shitty one.
Never said it was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Misquote.  And I'm not arrogant, it's just a pet peeve.  Being arrogant would be saying this must be an embarrassing way to find out you've been saying it wrong you're entire life.
you might be dif but I have always had 30P/30C  ~45 mins before and after my workouts. throw in the fat that  you will inevitably have to eat to get the protein and carbs and you pretty much have a meal split in half (for a cut)
The mantra "It's my body and it's nobody's business what I do with it" is often spouted by female pro-choice activists. Pro-choice being a liberal stance. 
[](/abbounce) Like right now, I'm running a script that's wandering through all the PLounge comments ever written, correcting and updating their information. Another script grabs more as they're posted, and another assembles lists of user activity levels and sends them to [a webserver](http://mlplounge.science/stats#/week) where anyone can see them.Just the _idea_ of working with this much sheer data (3393019 comments at last count) is just mind-boggling. As late as fifty years ago it was unthinkable. And yet here it is, sitting on my hard drive while a number of scripts whir around it, working their magic.And I built it all.
Yes, because everyone can just have those things.. its just that simple! I don't know why you just think that the girl HAS to be at blame somehow.. and you mentioned a situation that she was 'helpless' because no one was around so she is dumb. Honestly, even if people were around, most of the time people don't want to get involved and would be likely to ignore that something was even happening. You are getting at me as if I am acting like its a simple black and white situation - but honestly you are.. you're saying that if someone doesn't have someone around them and something happens to them - they are dumb. But it is just simply illogical to have someone with you at all times. The only person who should be held accountable at all is the person(s) who committed the rape. 
Exactly. The Eagles won't do stupid business. These guys have six figure salaries. They don't wanna fuck that up with one trade. If the trade is right they will do it. Everybody relax and let the professionals handle it. 
Exactly. I love the Daily Show and say what you will about it being a satire news show, but John really does his research beforehand. I love to see episodes where he tones down the funny for the sake of pointing out serious issues. Whenever I don't hear laughter for a good few minutes I think "oh shit this is gonna be a really good one!" Not that all his episodes aren't good, mind you.
This is huge to me. I can spend tens-hundreds of thousands on analog gear and a fancy SSL board with a 24-track......But it doesn't matter to someone who is going to stream it over Spotify out of a mono iPhone speaker.    If I'm recoding some smooth jazz that is getting pressed to vinyl, then yea I can understand the analog appeal...But for the vast majority of shit people listen to nowadays, there's no point in all that crap since I can do it all in the box.
The article mentions that a sequence could show the Joker killing Jason. But what if [that set photo from awhile ago of the tombstone of Richard John Grayson was really about Dick and not his father. Maybe in the world these movies are making the Joker kills Dick instead of Jason. And maybe what prompts the flashback is Bruce looking at that Tombstone. It's all speculation but just a thought that popped in my head.](/spoiler)

Without any idea of who Paul Elrich is, I didn't say you couldn't make any analogy you like, I said your analogy was irrelevant to the current discussion, and then when you expanded upon the analogy I further showed how irrelevant it is.  If you wish to offer relevant discussion then I'd suggest you do so.
I suppose so, yeah. A VPN has many benefits like added security, geo unblocking etc but if all you're doing is watching movies and all those movies are on Netflix then yeah might as well pay Netflix 
Yeah, this happens to me when I'm in a large deficit. Pretty sure it's a mixture of focusing so much on nutrition and the lower hormone levels from cutting hard.
I'm somewhat inclined to believe he did, or at least that he is from the area. I've got family from Wisconsin and most of them have never seen the sun or heard of summer, as it only lasts 4 days between brutal winters. It was probably just a tragic accident on vacation. inb4 someone tells me you sunburn year 'round. 
I don't know about a genetics doc, but rheumatologist, pain management specialist, orthopedist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and neurologist are the specialists I've gone through in the last decade since my diagnosis. 
&gt; The relation between power and sourcing extends beyond official and corporate provision of day-to-day news to shaping the supply of “experts”...In this way bias may be structured, and the supply of experts may be skewed in the direction desired by the...“the market.”  As Henry Kissinger has pointed out, in this “age of the expert,” the “constituency” of the expert is “those who have a vested interest in commonly held opinions; elaborating and defining its consensus at a high level has, after all, made him an expert.”  It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail.*Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media* by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky

When saw this kind of thing when I was a kid, I told myself that when I was older things would be different and the u.s. would evolve and women would be treated better.   It is just so fucking disappointing that i am 36 and it is still overflowing toilet level awful.
It's just my opinion but if the product he's asking you to make is in direct conflict with what you actually want to produce for people I think you should say no. If you bought organic gluten-free snacks at whole Foods then found out the same brand manufacturers Cheetos, would your opinion of their brand change?
Hardly a new suggestion, there have been dozens of opinion pieces pointing out the same thing. Biologists seem to love their barcharts - I think the temptation is to hide variation by plotting messy data as barcharts with SEM error bars and boom, tidy looking figures.

Um, but a Ferrari is made to be a symbol...A Ferrari has always represented something more than just specifications and top speeds. When you are in a Ferrari it isn't about pushing physics to the limit or to claim the top track time. What I think its about, is the persona, the character that a Ferrari bestows on the driver. When you are driving in one, it doesn't matter if you're going 5mph down main street or 201 around the track... because you know that you are in a marvel of human genius and luxury. As long as you're in the driver's seat, you are elevated to something beyond what any one person can achieve alone. /fauxphilosophy

The only way to have download history linked to Harmonix and not to Sony/Microsoft, is for Harmonix to host, sell, and distribute the content themselves, from servers that they would have to maintain. Since obviously that didn't happen, it IS tied to Microsoft and Sony. And Harmonix can't help you, as much as they might want to. And my point is not to take it against Harmonix as if it was their fault.
I know if you look on the Korean Beauty subreddit, they really seem to like Centella, and I think Sample Hime in particular has a lot of great things to say about it, as far as clearing the skin. It is not quite as active on that sub, but I think if you do the sub search there, you will probably get more results. I just ordered some COSRX Centella toner, but I haven't ever used it. 
I cannot be vaccinated due to a mast cell disorder, I've had 3 near fatal vaccine reactions no one is willing to come near me with a vaccination on a 40 foot pole.  My children are at a presumed risk for vaccine reactions.  My son has a suspected mast cell disorder.  We STILL vaccinate him.  It's a delayed schedule, we were in there every freaking month when he was younger.  But he'll start kindergarten with almost every vaccine (he'll be missing Hep B).  Parents who CHOOSE not to vaccinate make no sense to me

Well I should've used more broad search terms and it was mainly for effect. I've broaden the search to "playboy drunk car", [here](https://www.google.com.br/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;client=ubuntu#q=playboy+b%C3%AAbado+carro) are the results. Some include "Drunk playboy runs over five", "Drunk playboy crashes porsche after leaving club", "Drunk playboy kills cab driver and injures two", "Friends and family of cyclist killed in hit and run organizes protest march". The list is endless.While probably not all of them are driving the father's porsche, I can assure you without visiting the links that not a single one of them ended up in jail, and I can even risk saying that the majority didn't even pay a fine or bail, being condemned to voluntary work, of which they do not work because they or their parents pay someone to testify and say that the guy is working.I'll edit the search terms in the original post, thanks for pointing that out!.
Frankly I don't care who is in my washroom, if they're staring at me while I pee, I'm gonna be angry.If I'm taking a crap...well, I have to wait until they leave anyway. 
Drinking on a reserve one time two highly intoxicated natives tried telling me and a friend that snorting crystals works, that they did it all the time. I found it pretty funny.
She removed two of her videos. In one she was showing her boobies and in other one she had her pic with some crappy wannabe gangster song. I will try to find mirrors. 
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking! I'm usually pretty good in heels, but I think 4" for 6-8 hours may be pushing it a bit, so I'll have the Bobs under my table for the reception when my feet start to hurt. :)
I think the trade in value trick works on a lot of people. Like my friend who wants to trade in his car and gets told by a dealership that they'll pay him 7k for his old car and he gets really excited, hasn't even heard any numbers about the car he's buying yet. He's actually a really smart dude too. It took a long time for me to get him to understand if they give him 7k for the car but he ends up paying sticker price for the new car then he didn't really get 7k for his old one. 
So what are the advantages of Hurd over Linux?My guess would be that it's easier to secure it since most of the stuff (including X) runs in user space. Are there any other major advantages besides being different?

If anything, I think our conversation has shown me that teachers suck at communicating their value to society.Given that, privatization might be politically possible. However, I think it'd be a bad idea. Things like health and basic education are so fundamental to society that I don't think they should be private.

Let's say your run lasts an entire day, DR will take you about 30 zones further at best. It's a decent little bonus but definitely not something you should rely on. When it's available go ahead and hit 8-6-9, but I wouldn't go 15 minutes without using any skills just for an extra 10% DPS (that'll take you less than one zone further - health increases by 15% every zone).The strategy for a deep run depends a lot on whether you're gonna use an autoclicker or not. Either way, I never saw two people saying the same things about skills, I think everyone has their own way of managing skills depending on many factors.I don't even know how *I* manage skills, I just "feel" it. Looking at the screen, my current DPS, cooldowns, etc., I just (kinda) know what to use, but I'm totally unable to explain it.
Awesome profile......you are a lucky man /r/massivetalk8787! Insert stupid crossfit jokes.....How's her snatch? Does clean AND jerk?But seriously.....how is her snatch?

I will echo what others have suggested.My $.02 My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was "free", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k. My wife constantly gets complements on her sapphire btw.
&gt; Contrary to Israeli daydreaming, there are is no legal difference between major settlements bordering Jerusalem or deep in the West Bank. Leaving aside even the law, no Palestinian government will ever agree to allowing the entirety of what Israel sees as the "major settlement blocs" standing as part of a two-state solution because it makes territorial contiguity and connection of the major Palestinian cities of East Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Ramallah impossible.Out of curiosity, what did you think of Bibi's ["let the settlers become Palestinians"](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/pa-settlers-can-become-palestinian-citizens-1.276727) idea? In short: the Israelis living in the small cities of Gush Etzion, Aa'ale Adumim, and Ariel (what the Israelis refer to as "major settlement blocs") would be given the choice to become a Palestinian citizen or go back to Israel.Both Bennett and Abbas hated it.
I think the largest problem with the Autistic vs Dead argument is that its more "would you rather risk Autism at X%, or risk measles/mumps/rubella at Y%" If Y% is small enough compared to X%, it would be illogical to get vaccinated (I'm not saying this *is* the case) Its the equivalent of the depression medicine which may cause death.  You don't ridicule people for risking death because they are taking the depression medicine. The chances of dying because of the medicine is "cost-effectively" worth the chances of helping their depression.
Nicely done, I couldn't rake mine to save my life haha. You said you were having trouble with the keyway when you tried to SPP it, is this the one you meant? If so, that's the exact same profile as the one I have. It's quite similar to the standard yale profile, so considering I'm so used to that keyway it would explain why I didn't have an issue with this one. You should try and get your hands on some yales to practice on, they're a ton of fun. The most common profile is the 1A (called the Y1 in the US). It's intimidating at first but you actually get used to it very quickly if you pick them enough. :DAnyway, that was some nice smooth raking, very calm and controlled. It's nice to see.
Unfortunately. Perfectly functional societies getting screwed up because the system of unmitigated immigration worked for the USA. Well plenty of other countries became successful without mass immigration.

In many states, Game Wardens have near-mystical search powers. If you take a look at what they're there to do (enforce fishing restrictions, etc) this makes sense. It's made it to a few high courts and has been upheld to date.In other words, if you bring illegal material (and yes, genius-- pot is very much illegal in Indiana) with you to go camping, you can expect a bad time.
risk your relationship and lose the remotes except for that one. she'd have to learn eventually. it's a minor inconvenience to learn, and when she learns she'll never knew how she managed without it.
Safety play is less dependent on man coverage technique. It's more reading the offense and reacting. CBs have a similar responsibility in zone coverage but in man it's more being able to mirror your man's movement, without being fooled by head shakes, shimmies, false steps, etc. It's a much more reactionary and instinctual thing than watching the play developing in front of you and reacting to it. In order to stay with a sub 4.4 40 running WR, a CB needs elite speed and agility (hips). If he has this, most teams are willing to ignore poor tackling ability. A safety is normally playing off and can get by with lower levels of athleticism, with a lot more focus on his mental ability to read the play and tackling to finish it off

You've been hit by the circle-jerk downvote train I see. Just remember that parts for this phone and every other phone are sourced from multiple fabricators and assembled and tested by tired, underpaid workers. There are many points of potential failure in even the best designed engineering masterpieces. Odds are, your phone will be fine like the overwhelming majority of ours.
I know what you mean, it's just one of those phrases that has always annoyed and frustrated me, know what I mean? I think part of it is because of my depression and insecurity. Honestly, and I just now, literally 35 seconds ago realized this; when I really *really* think about that phrase, it scares me
When you account for the difference in first-time offender and habitual offender status or three strikes laws, it comes out a lot more fair in terms of sentencing. In the US, men's prisons are far more prone to making convicts into career criminals, who tend to get harsher sentences.
It's actually really good advice.  Even ignoring the NSA, the recipient could always forward it, or someone's account could get hacked, etc.  I always assume my emails are public, and it's served me well so far.

&gt; So you and anybody that think like you, don't really care about gender inequalityI feel like you're trying to push a bit *too much* into your net. Someone not caring about a specific thing doesn't imply that they don't care about a situation under any circumstances.You just seem to be making a fair number of assumptions about the other party.
I agree with you. It's easy to say "oh the nutrition" when becoming vegan means facing ridicule and hurting family ties. His parents are low carb.He might be scared to be a joked about minority and scared to let go of cheeseburgers. It's hard to grasp how easy this is and how much better making ethical choices feels from the omni side of the fence. 
&gt; One thing that never stops with these people, is having no regard for peoples lives.Mostly if it's brown people (or poor white people), if it's brown people damaging/stealing presumably white owned stuff then doubly so.This tweet I saw earlier is quite good:https://twitter.com/philippenis/status/593096697917505540
Faker has maintained a 100% competitive win rate on a few champions main one being leblanc (ezreal too I think) even while his team was playing piss poor. im not saying you are completely wrong either, "talent" may not always equal success but it sure does help. I'm basically trying to say that while they may be braking up their winning roster I do think rekkles is much better than steelback and yellowstar and rekkles were a dominant bot lane. If fnatic wants to play better internationally I think its the right risk to take because bot lane was their weakest point.

He's not.  A few other posters have said he's alive.  He's apparently a poor homeless Brazilian man.  That's just hearsay but whoever it is definitely alive because you can see him moving.
I think men (and women) are more able to express that desire, especially with the development of more reliable birth control methods like condoms, the pill, and abortions. Who the fuck cares if a guy doesn't want kids in 1850, he's shit out of luck and going to have 18 kids just from having sex with his wife (also, it was beneficial to have kids to do domestic work). So I'd imagine that the rates are about the same, but the ability to actually follow through on no kids has increased.
I couldn't tell for sure what my top comment is, but I can almost certainly say that is was a stupid joke that played into a popular circlejerk, edit- significant derp

Honestly, I have had fun dodging (or trying to dodge) them and feel they really bring some needed champion diversity in ARAM. However, instead of nerfing the cd or range, can we simply make them more visible? Sometimes in the heat of a team fight, these tiny snow balls become more invisible than actually invisible bugged nidalee spears. 
It won't last forever, once Team BR is launched there will be measures in place to stop pre-planned teaming in solo queue BR.  Think of it as anti-matchmaking, anyone you play with gets put at the bottom of your matchmaking queue, so you will rarely play with the same people again for a long while... I can't wait for this system, will be so many complaint threads on reddit.
What sort of build do you want your damia deck to go?- Combo?- Soft-locks/pillow fort- Hard-locks/control- Battlecruiser?- Goodstuff?- Theme/Tribal?- Stax?- Other?
I think you can compile for iOS in C++, but it's not often done. Android actually has a C++ SDK, but you have to call the Android Java libraries when you do it, so there's no real point. Unless you're a real masochist and like C++. 
It really depends on what you like. I like fruit-forward IPAs for sure. King Julius is sooo fruity. I finished the growler and just sitting here, my mouth tastes like I just had a big glass of orange juice. There is also no evidence of any alcohol. For me at least, it is one of the most perfectly crafted brews I've ever had.
Yeah my ex told me once that she was insecure because I was in shape and that it made her feel bad when women would talk to me.  They didn't even have to flirt, a female cashier could hand me my change and say "have a nice day" with a smile and she would get pissed.  She wasn't overweight though, just daddy issues.
&gt;A ship filled with climate scientists looking to show that ice was decreasing at alarming amounts didn't actually know there were f-tons of ice there to trap them. This doesn't sound in the least odd to you? Shouldn't scientists know wtf is going on today?Absolutely not. You're suggesting scientist should know the behavior of sea ice? Do you have any idea how easily that could change due to ocean currents and weather? I mean come on, you honestly have to be fucking with me. 
Her nerve endings collectively screamed, forcing her back into consciousness. Disoriented and alone, her eyes focused on her own naked body, her wrists and ankles duct taped to a rusted chaise lounge, and a hose leading from a half empty gallon of bleach directly into her vagina.
&gt; All "Government" means is those things that we, as a society, do together.No, in reality people elect political elites from a pool that is chosen by those same parties (illusion of choice), and then that elected person does whatever the hell they want, regardless of what voters think.Majority rule is minority tyranny.
&gt; legislating morality is an incredibly stupid and counterproductive thing to doExcuse me, but what? At some point we must either legislate based on some notion of morality or have no law. All of our law is a contractual form of social morality.

the cost of materials for one printed 3d item would far out weight just giving it to the poor. easier to give old/used shoes, costs far less, hell even simply making a mold and somehow injecting goop like crocs would be cheaper and more efficient.also, someone did do this, can't remember who tho atm.
That sounds great to me. The older I get the less I care about my job as well. Mind if I ask what line of work you're in? My job is repetitive and can be boring, but it's also stressful and I think I need a change. 
He'd never go back to Old Trafford.Also, if United do go after a central midfielder, I'd rather they find a replacement for Carrick than pick up a more forward-thinking player.Edit:  Would people really rather see United sign Pogba than bring someone in capable of taking Carrick's place, since Blind doesn't seem destined for that role?Big names are nice, but quality players who fit the side are better.
If your parents are paying your student fees, they have a right to know if you're failing your classes. Either way they're going to find out.&gt; I'm irresponsible and lazy. I didn't write one of my finals and I missed two of my midterms. I doubt I would have done much better if I actually wrote them to be honest. I don't study. I don't go to class. I don't go to labs/workshops.To be honest, it sounds like you're just not ready for university and I would recommend moving home and enrolling in a community college. You need to get your act together. Missing not only two midterms but a final? Treat university as "training" for real life. If you can't even be bothered to show up to class or to exams, then I'd imagine you probably won't show up to work either. 
My girlfriend and I were in Hawaii on Maui. I took her up to the summit of Mt. Haleakala to watch the sunrise and proposed to her there. [Unfortunately several years later we got divorced, but we are still friends. Still, it was a cool place to do it :).]

The Iranian Hostage Crisis was probably the biggest factor. This was from 1979-1981. 9/11 just refreshed what was already there. Orientalism probably had a big part in this. There existed an idea that Muslims were very different from those of us in the Christian West and so it was pretty easy to become attached to the idea that it was Islam that was responsible for the Iranian Hostage Crisis rather than any political issues. Those feelings were ignited again with 9/11. This is explained in greater detail in [Edward Said's books.](http://www.amazon.com/Edward-W.-Said/e/B001H6V71M)
Blacks in America have had an unimaginably tough time. It has created this "opressed-for-generations-on-generations" culture who have certainly been left behind. There's no denying that. So where do we go from here? What is the problem? How do we fix the problem?

"Come to work with a positive attitude" is part of the job description for pretty much every job you'll ever have.  Try getting to work with a better attitude.  If you need to get up earlier and work out or something to get through you "bad morning time", then do it.  It will serve you well in life.
I'd have to take the train up a couple of stops from Penn Station ....Hmmm...really wish I had known about this earlier in the week so I could have planned for it.
I remember seeing an interview recently and it seemed Rekkles went out of his way to put down steeelback's play when rating top ADCs... must have been after his job then. Sad to see Fnatic playing this game.
Yeah, like the other guy said, only some go to college prep schools and the rest are pretty much not going to go to post secondary schooling unless it's trade school.
Some of these are oppressive boogeymans or repetitive game-samers, but some of them are just good old-fashioned fun. Rite of Replication, Ruination, Reliquary Tower. Sigarda? What about Uril?    "Fun is mandatory. Tighten up that smile or there will be consequences. No items, Fox only." etc.    EDH as a sanctioned format is a dumb idea in the first place.
I don't think it's that simple, I think there is more to it than "blacks are more violent" which is what seems to be the assumption there - there is a social aspect, which is an intangible unquantifiable value.  I don't think there *is* an easy, uncomplicated way to look at it without then inherently making an unfair assumption,  or at least seeming to.

I have done a lot of testing with stevia. One of the surprising properties is stevia is more hygroscopic than sugar so I found some baked goods are better and more moist with a little stevia mixed in. The downsides of stevia is the bitterness and it sucks with texture. The Splenda mix works way better for texture. You can try what you want, but I sell my baked goods so I need consistency  which means lots of testing. If you are baking, you are also using a lot of fat so I wouldn't worry about calories as much. However, I would say you could substitute up to 1/3 of the sugar with stevia (not the baking mix, but regular stevia) with minimal negatives and possibly more moist than sugar alone.
My clan was in the middle of a war when this happened. Immediately things changed. They started having zero star attacks and then began dropping hugely instead of attacking across. We destroyed them in a war that was previously close. I also know that people cheated in the last war we were in. They knew exactly where bombs were in original bases. Clans that don't cheat will benefit greatly from this.

No, for many reasons.You'd be defrauding CalVet.If you use corporate funds to pay personal expenses, you have to declare that as income.A C-Corp is subject to double taxation.  With an S-Corp, you're required to take a salary.  If CA is like many states, real estate broker commissions must be made payable to the licensed broker.  The broker's employer can't receive the commissions due to the broker.  Did I mention fraud?
Me and some of my friends were tripping because classes had been cancelled due to a snowstorm.  We were going on a walk, enjoying the snow, and this random SUV goes flying down the hill in the snow, and tries to make a turn into a lot which it obviously couldn't.  The girl driving tries to gun it like three times, and keeps smashing her car into things, but won't stop.  We just got the hell out of there
Are they cloned computers?  Did you sysprep them properly?  I've seen this when there's a large number of identical computers on the network.  Every so often(typically around every 15 minutes), they'll have a browser election.Some things to check:* Make sure the clients are domain joined* Try setting up a WINS server and pushing that setting out with your DHCP server* Set up an old computer as a Linux Samba server.  Don't need to create any shares on it, but set the OS Level to something stupid high, like 70.If that doesn't solve it, get a Wireshark capture during the next storm and post a link to it here.  I (or someone else here) can look at the packets and determine what the hell is going on.

Yeah, again I'm sorry you missed the point of the podcast serial. Maybe you're too obsessed with it's first season and don't understand that it will have a second one with a different topic. 
&gt;So because some (not all) politicians in the UK are pedophiles, the government can't point out something another nation is doing? Exactly. They need to clean up their own house and shut the fuck up. They demand the same from everyone else, but they don't want to live up to their own standards; therefore they are hypocrites and make light of not just their own crimes, but any other wrongdoing committed by other nations too. Furthermore, this is as war has always been - it's not about "who's right" it's about "who's resources we want to grab" - so Britain and the five eyes and you, who will trip over himself to have the last word, can eat a barrel of dicks.These people do not want to do the right thing, they just want to sell off their own selfishness as righteousness. You're a fucking tool for following them.
I'll second that. Unfortunately, the people these uneducated adopters are adopting from aren't really helping them **become** informed. Fibbing isn't really helping anyone. I've seen too many instances of a dog being re-homed because of misinformation.

I think it's hard to judge what is propaganda by anyone at this point.  Everyone has an agenda.  Although I recall a very enlightened and eye-opening account from a St. Louis County LEO during the Ferguson unrest, and would love to hear something like it from the perspective of a LEO on the ground here.
Who is getting bullied on FPH? The person being 'bullied' would have to be present. I feel the sub represents a desire to do away with the bullshit notion of fat acceptance which is fine by me.

Ah... right, you can change it. I totally forgot about that :P Thanks for the answer. I forgot to put this on the main post (I knew i'd mess something up) but my NNID is my chosen name, and that's what appears during the game as your name, and I don't think I can change that. If you've got any more help, i'd love it :P
It's only a problem if you don't handle the question "why did you leave job X?" adequately.Did you leave each job for the same reason?  The hiring manager will be looking for a pattern.  If you left each short stint for a unique reason then probably not a red flag. 
Honestly I'm not entirely sure who they were talking to cuz I'm not super familiar with reddit and the finer details so I just jumped in because the idea seemed absurd and I wasn't about to let someone try and shut down the conversation with a hot button word.

40yo guy here. It took me far too many years before I realized that a woman who can't find a single friend of her own gender should be avoided at all costs.

I don't know why but a guy not being able to make any guy friends sets off *more* alarms in my head.

As for your second question, that is indeed correct and you should absolutely read Normal first. That's what I did and it was much better.In response to your third question, [HF](/s "even Gilgamesh isn't a threat to Sakura in that form, her power is far too immense. There was never really a need to protect her, since Sakura would end up protecting Rider instead. In addition, being around Sakura when she's in the form of "Al-layl" is extremely dangerous and somewhat sp00ky and only Assassin is willing to do it.")

I would be a fairly simple task using an Arduino microcontroller and a stepper motor.  You could program the the Arduino to dispense food at regular intervals or when the bowl is empty.  The stepper motor is easily controlled with the PWM pin.  You can find Arduino's on Amazon for around $20.  You could likely use a small stepper motor salvaged from an old inkjet printer if you have one kicking around.  Better yet.  Here is an Instructable from someone doing something very similar.  http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-controled-dog-foodtreat-dispenser/
I started with that kite about 8 years ago, now I have 12 4-line fixed bridle kites and gave the snapshot away ages ago.It's good way to start.  You won't feel much power, but you'll learn the wind window and figure out your line management when launching and landing. It's really best to do all that before jumping onto anything 2m+ that will have real juice in the right winds.btw, 2-line kites are measured by their width across the canopy, and 4-liners are measured by their sq. area.  So the snapshot is 1.4 meters across, but is only a 0.7 sq meter in 4-line terms.Do try to find some clean smooth wind at some point, nothing is better than a steady breeze from the open ocean.

His contract with Detroit is up. Babcock is considered by many to be best coach in the game. Babcock will be a free agent and can definitely "cash-in" on the market. Babcock also feels that he can set a higher average for the rest of the coaches by getting a large deal. 
Thanks for the quick reply. Just to restate, this new chip set is easily the best thing on the market right now. As soon as there is a substantial price drop I'll definitely be picking these up unless there is a more interesting chip out at that time!
If I can throw them off 10,000 times, I can only assume that means it never kills them or does damage. Otherwise, they'd be meat after about ten drops.So, let's see, ten thousand falls off the Empire State, all survived without damage? I choose... myself! What a kickass ride that'd be!
You're not the first person I've heard say they don't like Misty Valley arc but I have to admit I thought it was pretty good :pJust start from beginning and then if you really want to skip Golden age (I strongly disuade you from doing) go straight to end of eclipse.

LOL! If FockSmulder actually believes your garbage, then that's sad. The VAST majority of the time I talk about Harper and his failed policies. Why? Because he's been the Prime Minister for the last 9 years and done tremendous harm to this country. I barely even mention Trudeau. Then you get upset to hear the truth about Harper and reply with your shitpost spam garbage about Trudeau, even when it's completely off topic. You've been warned about this by the mods and you were even banned for it. Then you immediately cried to your buddies on Metacanada. http://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/32uq7l/lucky75_has_a_strange_definition_of_offtopic/
Well. If playing is something you want to do, then you should do it.Shell just have to accept that you won't always be doing stuff together.Some time apart from each other is usually good, since spending time with each other all the time can get tedious in the longrun sometimes.
I'd love a Robot Xwee, but my only aged side is full.. and the other one takes another 4 months to be able to take painted pets. I should've created my Cybunny on that one... &gt;_&lt;
The CPUSA has had several members in elected office, including the Washington State Legislature during the 1930's and in the US Congress from that state. I'm pretty sure they've had other state legislators as well. 
It's literally a shooting gallery lol. Also found out that a jolders can kill clear across that tunnel (standing well back from C) without even having hammer forged or send it. I would have loved to see the look on their faces 
Wait a minute though, I've loved stronger than gravity (or "stronger than terminal velocity") shower heads! Everytime I try to shower at a friends/neighbor's/relative's house it feels like a trickle from a low hanging rain gutter panel. Tired of "trickle showering", I could pay someone to hold a 2litre over my head and save way more on water and get better pressure than 90% of American shower heads.

Gonna back this statement up. Textra seems to be well worth the new pro price, and I happily paid as soon as I got the pop up.Unless your issues with textra are just coincidentally timed with the new pricing.
I have done exactly that already. Palat's front foot remains on the ice the entire time until it makes contact with Glendening's skate (skate on skate contact). He leans into the hit, he does not propel himself forward in a jumping motion. I do believe that that was Kronwall's intention, to turn into the hit and hit him with his backside as you said. But he's too late for that and that motion is what propels him in a leaping motion directly into Kucherov's head.
That's good news! I'll try sending one in. Did they still have minutes left on them? I suspect having minutes might have them claim it was still activated.
Don't be too scared IF you put the effort into completing. You can't half ass it unless you are some form of prodigy. If you finish med school you can look at realistically paying the loan in full in &gt;10 years while living quite comfortably. I felt bad for my brother who is a doctor and on his last year of residency until I learned he is looking at ballpark of 250k annually when he finishes. Still not enough for all the time and effort put in but the 400k in loans or so will be gone quite quickly. 
Buck is my favorite. I can't wait to get a garden gnome of him.

But anyway, whatta guy. 
Hi, well-known Orca pilot here.You *don't* make money in an Orca.  That's not what it's for.  It's for *after* you've made all the money.Hope that helps.  :)
Have a full time career. Have a life. Personally, I do this kind of stuff all the time in my free time. It's incredibly rewarding to build these types of things and see your hard work working at the end =D. Also, for many younger folks (I'm only 25, but hey!) - this is an excellent opportunity. Maybe you don't get money for your time, but you get an excellent piece of material to add to your burgeoning resume/portfolio!
Yep, we live in Trinidad. They have a national exam at 11/12 to allocate high schools. It's hugely competitive as there are only a few good public schools and not nearly enough space in them. She has definitely started puberty, I really hope she doesn't get her first period next week.
Has California ever not been in a drought? I feel like they have been in a drought my entire life?Anyways, I'm sure it would hurt a little bit agriculturally, but that mainly just hurts the farmers.  That doesn't hurt the rest of America.  There really arent that many farmers these days, so it doesn't really affect a lot of people.  California is an agricultural power, but its not like it runs everything in the state unlike some Midwestern states.

Yeah, but as long as we're putting holes in the wall on the other side of the globe, we'll never really stop to consider the costs to fix it. We'll just keep sending more hammers.
It's not stupid and stuck up. Eating a full meal on a train or bus is not only disgusting and unsanitary (it causes a huge vermin problem) but anti-social and uncivilized. No one should have to be subjected to someone sitting next to them and cracking open a large oily, greasy meal with sauce spilling and dripping everywhere. Nor should they have to put up with seeing some slob smacking his lips or dealing with the smells.We in NYC started having this huge problem of people bringing in full cartons of fast food, etc. onto the train. Everyone was doing it--from the Yuppie Wall Streeters chowing down on an Egg McMuffin in the middle of morning rush hour to the hoodrats cracking open a full carton of Chinese food. Thank God, the MTA cracked down on that crap real quick.
But they agree on the most pressing issues which are the ones I'm most concerned about. Anti-lobbying, the drug war, and getting rid of US involvement overseas. Also Sanders wants a more centralized education system?
There's a difference between dropping ashes on the ground and the butt of a cigarette. Hopefully no one here is complaining about the ashes and only the butts.
You should try [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/). It's free. Pick a language and there are probably courses for it. It's not super advanced, but it does a really good job at explaining why it works, rather than you just learning what to do by rote.Edit:typo

My albino and bronze cories treat each other as a big family,  but they're both corydoras aeneus with only those superficial color differences. I couldn't say definitively if they'd be alright, but sticking to the same kind is probably best, or getting two groups that are both large enough of you want variety.

There are a lot of places where plural Marraige and same-sex Marraige present different legal challenges.  Marraige is a contract between two people.  The contract law behind this goes deep and would have to be worked out anew for plural marraige.Let's deal with just one of these cases: survivorship.  Our laws deal with survivorship in a marraige assuming 1survivor.  A person can elect when starting social security to have dual survivorship so the SS is paid at a lower rate but is paid for the life of the person and the spouse.  With plural marriage I could marry perhaps a woman and her daughter, claim SS with survivorship and expect both them to receive my check after I die for the length of both lives.  This is a loophole that would have to be addressed; perhaps with a step down table reducing the amount further for each additional spouse, but whatever the answer, there is a bigger change of law required to adjudicate the variations possible with plural marraige.

Wrong, it wasn't a gamma bomb. Nowhere in the film is it implied its a gamma bomb. Green often symbolizes misfortune in literature, this incident in his past is the culmination of his misfortunes. The gamma ray blast in his lab simply "awakens" or "releases" this trauma.

No worries, I'm testing out the login, logout idea at a single RES in Solo to try and get some larger whales to spawn more often for now.

&gt; She's a first year student at an unaccredited university with no data and an unrecorded, hearsay conversation as her justification. She's says facts matter, but she didn't introduce one fact during her entire 4+ minute rant.That's it, here opinion is empty. While I support African Americans having diversity of opinions, some are basically just, "the black one". For all their talk of treating black people the same, they themselves are put on a pedestal for saying the same nonsense as their white equivalents and are protected from criticism. It's like Christians with S.E. Cupp or MRAs with Christina Hoff Sommers.I would honestly love for their to be a republican who is black that doesn't cash in on being a "black republican".
Fast charging works by two way communication between the charger and the battery, the battery will assess the state of each of its individual cells, and tell the charger about their charge level, temperature, and wear state. The lower the charge and temperature, the faster it can be charged without damage. There is also wear leveling between cells.   Fast charging doesn't reduce overall battery life by much overall because of this. It's just opportunistic. If you had a dumb charger with that much wattage, yes, it would damage the battery, but the way this works, not so much.

I'm sorry but what do you mean by effective dates? I'll show you my math and you can tell me if I'm mistaken or if there's something I didn't take into account.I arrived at my unit the 24th of October, 2014. BAS right now is $367 a month, although I think it may have been less at the end of last year? I'm not entirely sure on that. I was counting November, December, January, February, and March as the months I should have received back pay for. So $367 * 5 is $1,835. I received $922 of back pay.

it can be difficult. i live in Melbourne; i finished my french classes last year. You do see the occasional french backpacker here when you're out on the piss but other than that, it's slim pickings really. Of course there are meetups, as people have mentioned, and there is the alliance française, but as a 21 year old dude i feel a bit out of place... from what I've seen, these sorts of things are mostly enjoyed by middle aged women. So, to study, I mostly read. I read novels and the news for at least an hour or two every day. I would strongly recommend 'liking' some french news outlets on Facebook. tv5monde is great because it's a 24 hour news channel that you can stream. I also listen to a lot of music in French and it can be great to help you learn! Gainsbourg, Brel, Hardy, Dutronc... there is so much great francophone music. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj-AzuH6XXo this is probably my favourite album of all time.

Not me. Unlike Adnan, I know where I was on January 13, 1999 and if pressed, I could prove it, particularly six weeks after that date. But, if given time I'd be able to prove it now. In all seriousness, when you take a closer look at how many people were in close proximity to Woodlawn High School between 2:15 and 3-4 pm and would be in a  position to gain entry into Hae's car, it's not so hard to narrow things down quite a bit.
Just to add to this. I'm glad I did it this way. All it took was doing that commute once in a car to convince me to never do it again. I probably would have quit if it wasn't for the bike.
In [this thread](http://i.imgur.com/rCqTYMQ.jpg) (which also had a GGG response and the same kind of comments) I was suggesting:"With 5 (or more?) corrupted items equipped, leech applies to chaos only."...which should be pretty concise.
I love HSC but I don't know that BaseTrade should try and mimic its atmosphere. Maybe they can take away some ideas but I would rather them just further develop their own brand. 
I don't know how into boarding you are, but I have some shock pads and soft wheels to put on my board to smoothen out the trip. We have cash and camping equipment we are bringing, just in case something goes south (and will never be TOO far from civilization hopefully) The winding roads are a huge plus, on a board they are very fun. How much worse are they? We can deal with some cracks and such, but crumbled roads or gravel would force us to turn back.
Sound advice, but I can't think of what could be causing pent up anger. I'll have to think hard to figure it out if your assumption is correct, I think. Thank you for the advice, I'll be looking out for what it could be.

We got married at 26, but have been together since 22.  I did, but thought maybe things would change and I'd want to settle down in the father/husband role.  I think the people I work with have caused a possible enlightening.  I work with a very social group.  Always going out, to events, bars, different cities, vacations.  I hate turning them down, because I truly want to go with them, but feel obligated to stay at home so my wife isn't left out, thus in turn makes me hate having to sit at home with her.  It has torn more and more at our marriage, and we have talked about her being more social; I'm met with the same answer, "I feel awkward around your friends because I don't know them".
I dont know if he was the best owner of a sports franchise but it's crazy how much hate he gets for not keeping the islanders in nassau. He tried many different plans that all got shot down by either nassau county residents (through vote) or politicians.
I have an odd story. When my wife's elderly aunt passed away we buried her and life went on but one day about 6 months later my 3 year old granddaughter was playing in her bedroom and my wife went in and was talking to her. Somehow Aunty Alma's name came up and my granddaughter said as casual as can be "oh, she's right there in the chair" (a chair in the corner). This sort of thing happened a few more times over the next year or so. She was the only person who could see her but she was there nevertheless. This story still creeps us all out.
I don't see it as boosting per se since one of you must still earn the Goliath  legitimately and are agreeing to destroy it. It's the equivalent of calling an AI Warbird or drone and destroying that (which is also possible).

Amiibo: MarthIn Box or OoB: I would prefer in box, but out of box is completely fine, too.Packaging: I-if you could pull off Japanese packaging it would be great, but again I couldn't care lessReason: Fire Emblem is probably my second favorite video game series to date. Since all of the other characters are rare/shaping up to be, Marth is the only one I won't be able to get practically. (Because Ike is getting a restock in the summer and I have everything set up for Robin/Lucina page monitors. Because of school, I have a WAY smaller chance of finding Marth anywhere.)

You don't believe two teachers were fired for setting up a kid to get in trouble time after time with the intent of getting him expelled? What kind of school did *you* go to?
Also keep in mind (although this could very well not be the case at all here) that your source text isn't necessarily infallible. It it's clear from the context that the author misused a word (for instance they might have meant "recipient"), you can absolutely fix it in your translation.

What, no waterbending Pearl opinions? I always saw it as being more dancier, plus she's *Pearl* and blue is in her color scheme. But I guess that would be Lapis, lol.
THIS, ladies and gentlemen, is why you never criticise a parent for a crying child. 1) You have NFI what is going on with that child (hunger/grief/autism/whatever)2) There is no magic off button.3) That time you remember when your parent told you to STFU and you did? That was AFTER you developed to the point where you could do that.
Sometimes "one stupid thing" is indicative of larger underlying problems and insecurities.  If you have health coverage, at least look into what mental health services are covered. 
Yeah, fair enough. I remember finding a useful site dedicated to mover reviews and ratings, but this was a few years ago and I was researching cross-country moving. May not apply to you, but could be worth a Google. Sorry I don't remember the name.Yelp too obviously, if you trust their curation system.
in a country where I'd guess that 90% of the accidents are due to hazardous road and driving conditions (accidents while avoiding potholes or dogs or somebody overtaking from wrong side), even I would strike against such draconian laws if merely meeting with or causing an accident landed me in jail.further, landing in jail in India will be the beginning of endless harassment and bribes even if you're not at fault.  I am not sure how draconian the proposed law really is, but if it is like it is being made out to be, my sympathies lie with the striking drivers too.

Yes, it doesn't. But they've still had a bad experience and deserve support of their own. It's just on a more personal level. They're not being discriminated against by American society as a whole. 
Thank you for writing this. I dumped my first beer the other day because of heavy phenolics. Really depressing as I couldn't really nail down where it came from. To make matters worse, it was a lager that had been conditioning for 2 months. All you think about is how much water you wasted, energy on the fermentation chamber, and the full days work to produce that product. However after reading some of the posts here, I'm starting to feel better about it. 
I guess it was a cascading event: Minecraft 1.0 is released, word of mouth increases to unfathomable levels, companies realize this, and then all hell breaks loose with demographics and shit.
See I'm going to call bullshit on this.  Every single girl?   Where the fuck do you live?    Do you know like 2 girls?   If they were assaulted then they should have come forward.You can't claim lack of action, if you fail to report it.   
Youtube basic up, theres two seasons of it. Its a documentary where two BMQ courses were filmed. It's slightly outdated but it should give you an idea.
Neck hairs where? Do you mean the hairs that grow on the back of your neck towards the sides? I use an electric trimmer to neaten those up whenever I remember.
You are correct. I only searched for myriophyllum and that didn't mention SA, I apologize. I still can't find videos with clear water and heavy vegitation where angelfish live though.  If you find I, can you let me know here or in a PM?
If words hadn't escaped me after she mentioned the boyfriend this wouldn't of been half bad. First time I've ever done this, and you only regret the chances you don't take right? 
&gt; But a dictionary hardly seems to be a good reason for making laws to me.Of course. I think there'd be a lot less objection, if sodomite relationships were given some legal recognition not using the word "marriage". Probably some people objecting would even *support* the legal changes if they didn't focus on sodomy to the exclusion of other relationships (eg, brother+sister, monks, hermits, nuns, non-sexual close-friends, etc).&gt; Which might be ok if it was two 70 year old men we were talking about, but we're presumably talking about a straight couple. The woman is well past menopause. Do you feel they should be banned from getting married by law?No, they can still attempt conception in the manner described (man depositing seed inside the woman). They will fail (most likely), but that doesn't change the fact that they have still made the attempt.
Fortunately it wasn't my regular OB - she wasn't in today and the advice nurse was worried enough that she got me the soonest appointment she could, no matter which OB it was with!  The only thing she did that impressed me at all was actually look at my drug allergies - she told me she was giving me a script for Tramadol and DH panicked a little and asked if I had had it before (I'm related to opiates) and she said she'd made sure to check.  Otherwise?  I'm really, really glad she's not my doctor!

Countless times Iv had AFK's and useless teammates in strikes PvP and raids, no mic, shitty attitude, too young, squeekers who talk to much shit, people who talk them selves up too much, people who are so narrow minded and say that their strat is the only strat that works for what ever event (mainly raids).The last thing I want is to use matchmaking for Trails, I have a couple friends I play PvP exclusively with, and I met them online so don't make excuses that you can't find people to do it with, theres a LFG site even. Trials isn't you average PvP event, its for skilled players not for you throw together pug team in matchmaking, and when I fight in trails, I want to go against a team that I know will be a group of skilled players. There are just to many trash players in crucible, I can honestly say that Im usually first in the list with 1.0-3.0 (20+ kills) KD majority of the time while my team rarely gets over 1.0 KD, I also know that this is the case with a lot of good PvPers.

The Bowdoin stop on the Blue Line is about one block farther from most parts of Mass General than the Charles/MGH stop on the Red Line... not really enough to make a difference, in my opinion.  And it's downhill from Bowdoin to MGH.  
Looking through his blog, he's probably starved of social connection. He doesn't get along well with his peers, and it is clear that he lacks the sense of tact necessary for his presence to be enjoyed. I'd hazard a guess and say that this is really his attempt at standing out and garnering some attention, at least subconsciously.He's not narcissistic though. At least, not for his age. That's just how we all were at that age. It just seems narcissistic because we outgrew it.
I've seen entire ATs of mine get obliterated by a single infantry AT because the people on my team were total shitbags--grenading each other and trying to tip over tanks.I don't "play" the RTS anymore, and I certainly don't check in on my ATs anymore (I almost threw my monitor out my window the last time I did that). I just send my cheap ATs at the nearest enemy capital and never look back--just so my soldier gets experience. Using actual, important ATs is nothing but frustration and wasted time.I honestly don't know what I expected from a F2P game, but I should have realized the trolling would be functioning at epic levels. People are shit, anonymity makes shit people even more shit, and anonymous shit people with power over others makes for a shit quarterpounder with shit-cheese and shit pickles.
How does an INTJ get around doing car sales, without feeling too much pressure, as well as annoyances from dealing with greedy ass people who throw their money around.

I don't know what you're seeing to get it, but I don't believe that YouTube actually has 60FPS videos of 1440p footage. Searching '1440p 60FPS' [only turns up these results](http://i.imgur.com/wIt7X3Q.png):  - First result: 4K footage. Only 30 FPS.  - 2nd, 3rd result: title claims 1440p 60 FPS, and that's probably what they were recording at. YouTube's quality options only go up to 1080p 60FPS however.  - 4th and 5th result: title also claims to be 1440p 60 FPS, but unlike the previous ones, they are available at 1440p. Only 30 FPS however.As far as I know, anything above 1080p will not support 60 FPS on YouTube's end; they will downgrade your footage to either 1080p 60 FPS, or 30 FPS.
I read [this article](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-philip-quotes-relive-65-1445185) just the other day, there are some *amazing* quotes in there&gt;To President of Nigeria, who was in national dress, 2003: “You look like you’re ready for bed!”#&gt;To a woman solicitor, 1987: “I thought it was against the law for a woman to solicit.”#&gt;To Scottish driving instructor, 1995: “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”#&gt;On Ethiopian art, 1965: “It looks like the kind of thing my daughter would bring back from school art lessons.”
Yeah that's basically what the guy in that video says too, he was better than Ronaldo and the expectation was for Rooney to get even better but really he's just stayed at the same level while Ronaldo has overtaken him. Since this thread is about players that "*completely* lived up to their potential" I would say he didn't, he could have been more.
A couple of things. I see quite a few people your age on this subreddit talking about saving everything they make for their future. This should be done in moderation. You work part time and should enjoy your time now. As a 21 y/o freshman in college I wish I had enjoyed that time more. With that being said you should not be spending all you money on video games. Especially, as whiteraven said, it is more than you make.
but he is a character who is made to be awkward. I love the video and chip is one of my favorite characters in all of comedy, and love Jim Norton. I just didn't think it fits in this sub, that's all
Like heart &amp; grit &amp; friendship like those mighty Calgary Flames who play completely sustainable hockey but it's alright because they have intangibles!
I feel like the most decadent cakes are flourless cakes, mostly tortes. EJ's Garden Bistro used to make a fantastic one before they were out of business for whatever reason. Trader Joe's has one. I have a link to a [three ingredients recipe here](http://www.gimmesomeoven.com/flourless-chocolate-cake/).If you opt for a typical cake, I agree with /u/betty-x. Sweet Frostings makes a really good cake. They made my wedding one. 
Mine started hitting back.They're good, too. Little bastards learned from me, as I did from my father, and he from his father. Bit of a tradition in fact.Ugh, now I miss my grandfather-- the hostile old coot.
That one lady has the cellphone I had when I was 13 so it checks out. Seriously what is she doing with that dinosaur. It probably has like a 3/4 MP Polaroid camera. No way those pictures are coming out clear. 
No problem, I dont mean to sound like im promoting for them or anything, but if you like this, zedge has a lot of really cool star wars wall papers on there.
There are only two type of DL stints... 15 day and 60 day. The numbers represent the minimum amount of days you must spend on the DL in order to swap an eligible player into that roster spot. It is not unusual at all to expect a guy to miss 60 days, and still put him on the 15 day DL just in case he progresses quicker than expected. Unless a player is going to miss most (or all) of the year, you'll most likely opt for the 15 day DL as opposed to the 60.
No, it would be projection if I was a recovering addict and assuming RDJ behaves the way I would behave. Pointing out common behaviors and experiences of most addicts is just stating long-held psychological beliefs. Do a google search for the causes of relapsing, and stress is on almost every list. 
Robert DeNiro recently held a press conference to draw a circle with an "X" outside the circle to indicate the position of Iran's Navy relative to the circle of trust.
Actually I don't care that it's legal, because drunkenness, greed, and lying are all legal too. That doesn't mean that I don't believe that adultery is wrong, that it shouldn't be practiced because it is harmful, and that I am allowed to not support that behavior in someone else.
&gt; It's champion guerrilla tactics, but at the time was considered lowly and dishonorable by the Romansbasically anything that didn't serve to further their own interests is considered "lowly and dishonorable" by basically every ruling elite and society everywhere.
/r/DunderMifflin is leaking. There are surprisingly many people as obsessed with that show as I am, to the point where seeing "Vance" in this context would prompt writing that quote.
&gt; That Way We’re All Writing NowI'm not sure who "we" is, but apparently I'm not a member of this group.  Must be those daggum kids, with their hippity-hop music and their stupid hair.  If only they'd get off my lawn.That being said, the analysis provided was certainly interesting and insightful.
It's almost you can disregard history and reality to make anything, like creating an art piece that portrays her death in a significantly different light.
No worries, I am specifically referring to the Little Nahanni. That is the river we are doing the majority of our expedition on, then joining all the commercial tours that reach Virginia Falls until we get towards Ft. Simpson for evac.But, right on for knowing! This place gets more incredible the more I learn about it!**EDIT:** I've been updating the site quite a bit and may have been unclear, so I'll go over it all again. Thank you again for pointing this out!
the rapper says "1994".  #94In the 1st clue CM says "1985".   #85.  Philip Dorsett and I'm sure  many other WRs have that number.So....#94?  Who wears Jersey #94 in college?
You're right my friend it isnt, which is why i'm asking the question, some people add the -ded to words and i never understood why, ill post some links in a little bit
They gave lantern a hitbox. (it's also causing creep block by lantern.) It was a bandaid fix.  Big enough champions can still stand on it though Like Sion/Alistar/Seju and the likes.

Not sure what those are exactly, but I would have a look at https://www.stylusfinepens.comIt's the only store in Edmonton I have found to sell high end writing tools
Your original question wasn't too clear, I did some minimal research though. If you are in a rent controlled apartment, then you are actually right about this. Your rent can't be increased by more than 8%/year. If you are not in a rent controlled apartment, then sucks to be you...
Am I the only one who finds posts like this one to be a bit silly? We all know this isn't *typical* behavior for a 3 year old. Claiming this as a reason for not wanting children is nothing like saying you don't want kids because they cost a fortune, constantly shit themselves and generally drain the life from their parents.If someone were to say that they don't want dogs and referred to one of any number of the vicious dog attacks that occur every day as their reasoning, I suspect that a few of us here (myself included) would see a problem with that logic.I guess I just don't see the point in posts like these, other than to say "See!? Look! Kids are **evil!**". But kids aren't generally evil, and so this isn't a good reason to be child-free, IMO.
Dude, I've told people several times I'm not good at the game nor have I ever tried to show off how I'm good at the game.The purpose of these videos is to make people laugh – yes, I know not all will laugh, but some do. I don't think I'm good at the game nor do I think the rest of the people are losers.
Oh awesome yea mu doctor said that I she could reduce my dose or I can take that for a little bit and see if my body adjust to the higher dose. I'd rather give it a little bit my BF is aware so he's keeping and eye out It's just been so long since I was this  happy I just want at least enjoy it for whatever it's is 
There is only one instrument, the synthesizer. The 'sounds' that come with it are internal programs that configure the synth to generate music in a particular way, they are not MIDI data. It's a controller with a synthesizer built in, not a computer full of virtual instruments.Are you perhaps referring to the patterns of notes that can be used with the arpeggiator? That's the only thing in there that is like MIDI data that I can think of.
Because it was an impossible task and mankind couldn't move forward until the old the covenant was fulfilled. He has done this, so that we may not be held to the impossible standards that came before and damned by them.
Yup...was one of Chris Farley's problems besides cocaine and hookers. His close friends had said he would break down about wanting to lose weight but was scared people wouldn't think he was funny then. 
I'd love to see a longer game of blood money any day, but I feel the game mode itself is perhaps more dependent on team competency  than any other barring the squad style rescue/crosshair. Unlike crosshair/conquest/TDM, you rarely if ever have a close game of blood money, one team usually establishes a lead and then runs with it. I'd personally like to see a high ticket blood money server if only to see if the matches are one-sided due to the game mode or due to the time/ticket limit of the normal matches. I can't see round timer being an issue on blood money, but I'd say increase both!
Does pay include stock options? Seems like a lot of CEOs are doing the "I'm so great I only pay myself a dollar a year" thing while taking millions and millions on stock options.
..we are in agreement, the Elio team has been able to pay salaries for many years without a physical product to sell...it's actually a very clever concept...reminiscent of that Nigerian Prince that often used to email me....what ever happened to him?  ..he's not on the BOD now is he?
First off, r/dataisbeautiful has turned into a living example of the phrase, "There are liars, damn liars and statisticians." Its also become a cesspool of political hacks trying to use halfass data and analysis to forward some political agenda. And that is why I'll be un-subbing. Secondly, did it occur to the author that the immigration process may be a filter for Asians and Indians? That these immigrant pools consist of more ambitious, better educated or wealthier members of these ethnic groups? Thirdly, does he realize that proportionally speaking, Asians actually DO speak about whites the way "whites" talk about blacks? 
That's an article by a blogger from before the season even started. Garth has said half a dozen times since then that CCL is the first priority. Which is why he scheduled no friendlies this summer. 
"Ladies and gentlemen on board the flight, I hereby declare that it is my intention to sabotage this aircraft with a bomb. If anyone has objections please do kindly charge me down now or forever remain silent. Thank you" 
Who really cares? Does that question even need to be answered? If you are in the US you need to tip, this is not up for discussion. It'd be like dumping a bottle of ketchup onto the table or intentionally tripping your server. You can get away with it but no one that saw it happen will be interested in speaking to you again. 
I made skittlebrau tonight. It was ok, but not amazing. In some ways it was better than regular beer, in some ways worse. However those skittles taste great after they have soaked in beer for 10+ minutes. 
Does the team have any more opening? I'm pretty good at all roles and have been looking for a team to join. I'm diamond 5 and my IGN is Kokoma5000. Add me if you wanna play
Maybe Amethyst was trying to go for a more Jasper like appearance, but just didn't have enough "material" to work with and rushed herself so she could only do the leg and arm.
INDONESIA WAS GOING TO ALLOW TO CHAN AND SUKUMYAN TO WATCH THE BRISBANE GOLD COAST Q-CLASH BEFORE EXECUTING THEM BUT THE UN STEPPED IN AND TOLD THEM THAT WOULD COUNT AS A WAR CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY!
The real fear is that even the presence could create an escalation of force from protesters and rioters.I have shot a gun several times. I have lived on Fort Carson and off of Fort Eustis. I have been shot at in several different countries including the US. I am also conflict and first aid certified. (not meant to be snarky or anything, just wanted to present my qualifications.) 
Yeah I shop at an Asian market. Wicked deals on produce. We don't even have a section. For example if you wanted frosted flakes and coke, you'd just go to the section with the dry goods and the section with the warm soda instead of an "American" isle. It's not really catered to the white man though, smells like fish.
That's actually a really nice stance to take on it. I get annoyed when people complain that analysis of a work of art goes beyond what the creator intended. It's somewhat the point of it, in my opinion, and Breaking Bad, and more recently Better Caul Saul, have been great vehicles for that line of thinking.
I'm pretty much suspending any other non-vital life activities until after reset, so... It just might work! Also, I got glimmer maxed out and a solid amount 'banked', so I'm hoping that won't be an issue! Thanks for the help and see you in the Ironing! 
*She looked at the money and key.*You're too kind. Are you sure I can't just make the money working? It doesn't feel right if I just take this money.*All of a sudden she felt sick. She grabbed a rubbish been and vomited into in.*So sorry Ma'am. I d-dont know what just happened. 
Vindicore, some mean NC and TR told me that he would downvote all your posts because of me. Just a heads up :3I like the idea personally, but it seems unlikely this will ever be added :(
You know, I was going to set the Remind Me bot, but I figure it wasn't sophisticated enough to tell when the Jays were facing left handed pitching. But lo and behold, Saunders just happens to be on the bench today the first time they face a lefty since his reactivation. Must just be a coincidence. He must be in dire need of a rest day.
Big Bang hasn't released anything new in 3 years. That's 1/3 of their existence. Most groups release new material at least once a year. Groups have debuted and disbanded in the time Big Bang has been away. If you think this is crazy look up the kind of things EXO-L/Exotics, Bielibers and Directioners do on a daily basis. Or Cassies and Beatles fans.
i'm no professional of course, absolutely talk to a wealth management advisor but it's something everyone is planning for, which is why this shouldn't be nearly as bad as 2008 when everyone was all-in in the stock market. 
&gt;It was unclear Thursday how many of the Baltimore rioters were raised by gay parents.Well it sounds like this needs to be investigated before we make a verdict
Actually if condi necro can spread 50 stacks of bleed on epidemic...And their elite spec joins the great sword master race. Melee cleave! As long as they don't make it siphon based (because those balance numbers are awful) it might be viable. Maybe they'll be shout necros!!! Lol.
That would never happen, we didn't even want to expand to 14 (but we did because TAMU + MU brings in $$, and because we knew the B1G and/or PAC would try to expand even if we didn't)
Why can a dog consent to another dog but not to a human?    And what if I am? Or would you prefer if I sliced its throat and had it for dinner? I wonder which one it'd prefer.
As of now, Sable does not want to make a FNaFb4, as the third one not only gave her a lot of stress (and a few health problems), but also a group of "fans" were rushing her to get it out, disrespecting her, and all-round being asshats. As such, she said she is done. She may make a FNAFB4 later on, but it's extremely unlikely to the point that we really don't even have a sliver of hope for an "official" FNAFB4.
&gt;Although I have a job I have a really hard time not spending money on things like games.Life's hard. Set a budget, stick to it.  Search for jar method or envelope method as two ways to see your budget and if you can spend money. If you can't control your spending, you're in for a lifetime of debt.
Yeah, I'm not like that. I get that there are people who would rather have an iPhone over an android. Whatever. But the dude acted like an ignorant prick from the get-go.
Op, you and I are on the same page. I've managed to have an aversion to sex. So it sorta bothers me hearing about women I like fucking like rabbits. Call me a judgmental asshole. You have your lifestyle and I have mine. I kind of almost want to gtfo America. Is it an American thing? Obviously not exclusively but our culture just goes off the fucking rails without even thinking about consequences. Real life isn't like reality TV. 
Growth is critical because today's investments are based on assumptions of tomorrow's prosperity. I hire you to build my factory because I think lots of people are going to buy widgets next year. If I don't expect the economy to grow, I won't build my factory and you don't have a job. No expectation of growth means no investment. That's a problem because around 20% of all current economic output is related to direct capital investment each year. If there's no reason to invest for the future, we suffer an immediate contraction.
I thought this was great, with headphones on in my room it really shat me up when it started glitching. I also love how the film raises the issue of our dependency on computers and how our lives could be ruined from our laptops.
Verifying now but It's just weird that the game won't start because of a file thats not really mean't to be in the game. If anything is deleting it harmless? because I clearly see a dsound file in the main directory. 
Giant-Size Astonishing X-Men #1 should be read after Astonishing X-Men #24 because it resolves what happens to the bullet, that's probably what you're missing. The bullet is then brought back to earth by Magneto a bit later in Uncanny X-Men #520-522 as an effort to show he is on the side of the X-Men again. Then there's a kind-of epilogue to the Breakworld storyline with Uncanny X-Men #535-538, Breaking Points.
You could balance YPLL of HIV and STD factored with % likelihood increases against YPLL factored with % likelyhood increase obesity-related disease. I suppose that's too advanced for this sub though. 
I know , I told you I said I could be wrong, but if the game is coming here and both versions do come out, you will be able to download the other one as dlc is what I was trying to convey
It's not about suffering because the baker wouldn't make a cake, it's about causing an opposing faction to suffer, wielding "protected class" not as a shield, but as a bludgeon.    It's disingenuous at best, cruel and hateful at worst.
&gt; You realize that this discussion is about people becoming citizens and not people that are citizens right?Uhh... it is? I think you should probably go and check the title of the thread again. This is about children who are born on American soil, not immigrants who are traveling to the US to obtain citizenship.Yes, the parents of those children may be traveling to the US to ensure that their child is born with US citizenship, but that does not make the child an immigrant. The child is an American under the law.
Are your other jobs on the list in similar fields? I'm pretty confident I'll become a cop, but still, it's not smart ot put all your eggs in one basket like I am doing. 
Just posted this in another thread with the same issue. I had the same thing happen to me after I got mine pierced and my piercer told me to use Bayer Aspirin. What you do is crush up the aspirin tablet and put a drop of water on it in order to make it into a paste. Then you leave the paste on your nose ring for about 15 minutes and wash it off with distilled water. Do this each day until it goes away. Worked great for mine
I don't think any teams will meet until the border starts to shrink, except for maybe Team OP and Team Meri Xmas. Team OP clearly has the advantage, but never underestimate Xisuma's cunning. Meri is pretty smart too, and I think Meri Xmas might shoot Team OP off a ledge or something with their limited arrows.Team Dead will craft their anvil and golden apples in this episode + find more diamonds. They upgrade to Power II bows and maybe Sharpness II swords. They'll take a bit of damage from their reckless exploration of caves. (Shoutout to Team Dead for having the absolutely funniest episodes of this UHC. I don't even feel nervous because of all the jokes they're making)Team Falsehamster will finally find diamonds in exchange for their leaving all the iron ever in that cave system.
We would be open to modifications/clarifications for other countries, especially for the UK, Canada, and Australia (since those come up the most often).
That's it. That is FUCKING it. Are you serious? Time after fucking time Supercell has shown incompetence and just blatant retardation, completely fucking up their whole game. But this time they have fucking crossed the line. WHAT THE FUCK SUPERCELL? DO YOU HONESTLY THINK I CAN PLAY A BROKEN ASS PIECE OF SHIT GAME LIKE THIS? I cannot believe the complete lack of an uproar this update has brought. 0/10 this fucking glitch is a complete game breaker.    /s 
You know that Nuts &amp; Bolts wasn't made by the (most of) original team of people at Rare, right? *EDIT* Not to mention Nut's and Bolts was well received by critics and even some fans, but Jontron painted that game in a negative light for everyone to see. As a game, it's fun, but it's not Banjo Kazooie.
LA (new) and MA are highly sought after states here. I'd be interested in both. We already have some solid vendors for the others (NV could be interesting too though)
Haha, you haven't discussed mechanics a single time man...all I've said is he should try to work on it, which you declared impossible! Unthinkable! His head would explode for God-sake!
I'm not really into that kind of thing but I could see how there'd be a market for it.As with any hand-crafted item, know who your demographic is, and make the product appeal to that demographic. Would you sell them on Etsy, or do you vend, or what?
They are histamine antagonists. They stop the effects of the system that produces Histamine, which is a chemical released during allergic reactions and is the cause of the symptoms in most cases.Those you mention are second generation antihistamines, which means they are less likely to cause secondary side effects like drowziness, because they have difficulty bypassing the part of your brain that filters blood to reduce its chances of infection.
I quite like [DM Minion](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.goatheadsoftware.dm5e) and [3D Virtual Tabletop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taponfire.threedvirtualtabletop)
Yep, I remember reading the DwD epilogue where Kevan is walking through the snow in King's landing. Not sure if they'll have the snow for that scene this season, but man it would be awesome!
Newsboy/flat caps, cowboy hats, fedoras, berets and panamas. There are all kinds of hats out there. If you poll MFA you won't find too many venturing outside ballcaps and beanies. Ball caps provide little sun protection which is one of the only utilitarian reasons to wear a hat. They're ubiquitous, draw little attention, usually carry some kind of slogan and work nicely as the graphic T or Dad jeans of headwear.  Beanies are great for keeping your head warm when it's cold. Why limit yourself to only 2 forms of headwear?  If you look at how people are dressed in NYC or other major cities you'll find a lot of variety in headwear, a lot of it worn very well.

Try out FoxFi or PDAnet, they're on the play store. I know they have Bluetooth tethering, and FoxFi *might* be able to do wifi to wifi I'm not sure though. If you're rooted you can use Wifi Tether Router which does wifi to wifi.
The new meta is a lot of fun, if not a little bit rough around the edges. Although getting used to a more dynamic pace over the more cautious classic mode may take some getting use too.But hey at least my scout plan is useful again! :D
At least 3000 a day. Active 6 days a week biking or running. Walk to work. Standing desk. Walk to do my shopping, etc. Lots of carbs (bread, oatmeal, fruit, veggies), protein, etc.5'11, 150 pounds. 
This deck is favored against face hunters because of cards like Unstable Ghoul/Armorsmith, Whirlwind and you can race him or deal massive damage with a charging Frothing.Priest is actually a counter according to Zalae who streams this deck 10h a day
This whole thing seems like reaching, to blame the guy's death on the department. He shouldn't have been being bullied but I don't think it had anything to do with his death. It was an unfortunate incident that they are using to get up on a soap box about a separate issue.
I think so--I made a Japanese account at their site but I can't tell if it's keeping me logged in, giving me anything, and the app's pretty buggy.  If I try to start their Triad game it sticks after the loading screen.
&gt; perhaps lacking mental capacity to do so.Not even that. Plenty of smart guys read this and think they understand it when they don't. Hell, I was that guy about a year ago. I like to think I've moved past that thanks to a lot of introspection and tea, but I occasionally still catch myself either doing or about to do something unwise.A lot of it is from guys who spend a day reading the sub, think "I know this now!" and get out there to fail spectacularly. I would bet that this is actually *more* likely to be an intelligent person because they tend to assume they have a high ability to quickly assimilate and process things, even when the things are relatively difficult concepts with a lot of subtext.
I definitely will!By the way, I uploaded the assets I've used [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=627c341e532ac3de!25037&amp;authkey=!AFVH3y0JmNRC1NM&amp;ithint=folder%2c) if you wanted to poke around.

Reddit is pretty firmly against witch hunting, which exposing his name would only do. Maybe on some other platform, but it would get you shadowbanned on reddit mad easy.
I feel like it's a pretty average show but for some reason I'm up to date on all the episodes and would like it to be renewed.It's sweet and nothing special but it's something fun to watch when I get home from work.

You can't get rid of them when using cl_crosshairstyle 2.There are already set to the least visible settings aswell.So get used to them or use a different crosshairstyle.I use 2 myself and they don't really bother me much anymore (still sometimes touch my screen trying to remove the dirt spots though -.-).
Thank you for your reply :). I really appreciate it and I'm happy to hear that you've been taking the steps to healing. I've been too scared to tell anyone but I told a friend this morning and it feels like I'm getting a little lighter. I hope this isn't a temporary phase but I'm the type of person who really hides it all inside and I know it's not the way to go. You keep fighting too!
It's amazing that when I try to stream it from ESPNs website it just keeps taking a shit and not working. Yet illegal streams are high quality and work just fine. Idiotic.
I'm a BKA and my gait  is pretty normal. If I wear long pants most people can't tell I've got a prosthetic.Stairs are a little tricky but once you get the hang of it it's pretty easy.
You're welcome! I wish it wasn't donor-dependent (or required so much money to get that level of donations), because I could use one every couple weeks or so.
Hey I hoesntly don't mind if you don't have any plan or agenda. I'd view this meeting as a way of putting an actual plan together. I say the only thing you absolutely need to bring is your Sanders Spirit ;)
There is no downgrade, but hydrants, benches and other props are missing. Basically all the things that would increase the poly count and might be destructible
It's only about 1m wider, the bunks are out since they're going to be a module, which makes the middle look big, and there's now a walkway to get past the cargo in the back, the rest of it looking "bigger" is just a really narrow FOV in the demonstration.
shitty answers has nothing to do with people being drawn to them.in fact shitty answers like (u live forever) are what draws the people in the first place.
"Can't have your cake and eat it too"yes you can...in fact, that's generally the order it goes in.You can't *eat your cake and have it too*, though...
The only rta I've ever used is the subtank mini, but it's pretty good. The flavor isn't quite as good as my freakshow, but I like having a tank when I'm out and about. Plus, you can buy the pre-built if you're feeling lazy. 
"im gonna wear it for at least 10 years, it's like $7 a day it's not really that expensive" says my spain friend when he's buying $25000 watch which is equivalent to his half a year salary. i think it's really the European attitude when it comes to fashion choices.
Everything.  But I'll be more specific.  Let's see... The dumb comics that have purple guy as an anime character.  People who voice the dumb comics that have purple guy as an anime character.  The porn.  The roleplayers.  The Five Nights At Fuckboy's roleplayers. They're worse.  And Smike.
Do you have any of their policies that *weren't* blown out of proportion by the yellow press? Can you read policy websites, or just newspapers with big headlines with small words?Go on. *One* policy that *wasn't* in the papers. They have hundreds. Didn't you find *one* in your searches through their policy site? Or didn't you actually read their policy site but just accepted tabloid sensationalism as news.I suspect you did, and that's far more frightening than renationalising a railway.
i have a question about non-drum samples.  think one-shots of a piano, bass, harp, what have you.  as i understand, folks just load these up into their sampler and play.  but this causes undesirable effects when playing keys further away from your root, shortening or lengthening your sound.    if there's not really a way around this, what's the point of all those one-shots in sample packs?  is there a "good" way to implement them?  seems like they would be a real boon if it weren't for this limitation.  thanks!
Please link the blog post, I would like to read it.  I would especially like to see your source about how most immigrants are well-connected, rich, or exceptional in some other way.In the past few days I have asked many people like yourself to give me a true explanation of why black people struggle to prosper in America.  Asking how black people can make a change to the better themselves and also how society can change to make it easier on them.  I have gotten such a lack of response to the point that I don't even think you guys know need and what in order to prosper.
The specific style bonuses like crush, stab, and slash only tell you how accurate that weapon is using that attack style. Generally a scimitar is good for training all three melee stats. (Attack, strength, and defence.) You can expect as follows - accurate = attack exp, aggressive = strength exp, defensive = defence exp. You also may have a controlled attack style that Benefits attack, str, and Def at the same time but at the cost of lesser exp quantities. If you have any questions feel free to pm me, my rsn is Slayer Cam.
Can a teacher sue the parents of the child that assaults them?If I were that old guy I would have just taken my lickings from that bitch, and then fucking retire with the lawsuit winnings.
Thanks for your help!I had a feeling that might be the case. I may still go with the Cradlepoint router and just share the files off my computer. I have a coworker that does this but I was wondering if there was an easier/better way with a central HDD. 
Believe it or not, there are more than two versions out there, so I'm not sure which one you have. My PAX 2 doesn't have Simon, so it could be similar to yours. If you hold it between your hands and roll it three times, do you do get a cool light display? If you roll it three times more, do you get a Knight Rider sweeping light? If so, be sure to hold it horizontally and shake it, then hold it up to your ears and see if you can figure out what song it is humming. ;-) 
They will get the rose garden version for sure, no scuzing the deck with brushes, no indie 500 around the crushed house, no sugar cookies, no ode to the sand fleas while marking time in the grass in just skivs.
I go outside and enjoy the world. I run, mountain bike, skimboard, wakeboard, snowboard, or just hang out and explore with friends. I play and listen to music, and sometimes I just read a book for a while. 
Double Ha! This is totally me too; buy, learn, teach, lose, rinse, repeat. I love complex games with lots going on, despite my complete inability to hold multiple variables in my head, calculate options, consider future permutations or monitor competitor strategies. None of which seems to interfere with my passion for boardgaming. When I win, it's usually both an accident and a surprise :) 
Once, my friend was wearing a slightly short skirt with boots -- nothing ridiculously inappropriate, just a regular skirt -- and she saw her teacher looking in her direction while telling another student that she shouldn't dress like a "slutty slut slut." My friend stopped wearing that outfit afterwards.
Because he is coming up on his contract expiring and if he left Detroit it would be the end of a dynasty era in Detroit. Also he's arguably the best coach in the game currently.
Be Here Now by Ram Dass is one of the greatest books/experiences I've ever had. It opened my mind (and many other minds) in incredible ways and set me on what is becoming a life-long path.Here is a great review:http://endofthegame.net/2012/03/31/beherenow/
I have five years semi-clean after being on crank since I was a kid. I use gear and a vicodin every once in a while. I drink socially but that's it. What's your question?
* You can write MVC Applications in VB.NET * Case sensitivity is user preference.* Yes, VB.NET is unique in its syntax, but  that's not necessarily a bad thing. In my opinion learning a different syntax can make you a better programmer. * a+=1 easy * Source? I typically see job listings for .NET developers instead of specifically stating one over the other.* How so? * Regions are available in VB.NET. I'm pretty sure this is just a Visual Studio feature.The main reason is your first reason. It's not for "real" programmers.

This guy in my neighborhood had an almost-as-glorious malamute.  I used to see them on walks all the time, and whenever we crossed paths I went in for the cuddle and called him a werewolf.  Then I didn't see them around anymore, and found out he had died of heat stroke.  I have been paranoid about arctic dogs in non-arctic climes ever since.

Just got back from 2 months in Europe with the other half and the pros outweighed the cons. Chances are you have a lot in common anyway so finding things to do won't be an issue. In saying that, don't expect every day to be a cake walk. you'll have days where you argue and wonder how you'll cope for the rest of the trip. You seem to be in a position to have the best of both worlds, you want 2 months and she wants 3 weeks.
If (okay when) Duncan plays 7 more playoff games he'll have started in 246 games in the postseason. That's the equivalent of three full seasons worth of basketball. EDIT: Which is impressive as fuck. These numbers aren't just a guy going off on a good run, but just more insane Duncan consistency.

&gt;Yeah, it went from none to 22.Fortune 500 wise the first female CEO was in 1972 for the [Washington Post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_women%27s_firsts).&gt;Shareholders like to see women CEOsDo you have any evidence to support that?  Because I highly highly doubt that.  As shareholds only care about the stock price going up, they care less who is the CEO and care more about performance.&gt;Well, if there were a lot more women CEOs, suddenly that rare value proposition (wow! a woman CEO!) becomes a lot less valuable (meh, she's just another CEO). If she's not as valuable to the company, they would strongly consider paying her less. IE, more women CEOS=this pay gap closes.What makes you think the pay gap will close here especially when women tend to out perform men when it comes to making money for a business?  If anything companies will pick up on this and that pay women more than men.
There were probably 1000 better ways I could have gone about doing this, but hey, this way worked lol.I didn't do as good of a job on this one as I did on the original, I was trying to rush it, this is the final product for those who don't want to watch the video to see the emblemhttp://imgur.com/4i6qRfQ
As an architect you should remember a feild contractor only does contracted work . If a wall was added after the ramp was deleted you better pay the said contractor to remove the once relevant and very required Ada grab bar. 
I put some of these in my backyard 10 years ago. I watered them weekly until the first rain and didn't water them any more. We've had a drought here for the last few years and they've spread everywhere.

There's a lot of programming options, yes, but they're all incredibly easy to use! You don't have to edit everything at once. Maybe you just want to change your color set, or maybe you want to switch from Tilt Function to Speed Function. You can access these features separately and quickly. You can program any feature in under 30 seconds.Out of the box, the default modes are freaking dope too, so even if you don't want to program at first, you can still get the full Element experience. Then just program it piece by piece as you get more curious :)Full disclosure, I am on the Emazing marketing team, but I really want to educate the community and help everyone figure these things out! Lots of new technology to sift through here. Ultimately these things are just going to be so so awesome for gloving.
Two things I don't care for:People complaining about children. I think we've all been stupid once or twice when we were younger, and I just find "cringe" posts that elevate OP and others above children of all people to be needlessly antagonistic and cruel.Children. I also hate hypocrites.
&gt; little frustrating to have so many promised from the kickstarter slipUnderstandable.  I wish it was further too.  I've just seen a lot of hate on the game and feel it's a bit unfair to the developers.  I doubt all this negative stuff from folks will keep them motivated to improve it.
Probably a good idea to have adblock turned on - http://watch-series-tv.to/serie/king_of_the_hill Has all of the episodes except 'The Honeymooners' and 'Propane Boom'.When you click on an episode, it's going to give you a bunch of links. I use the ones that say gorillavid.in, and they always work for me.
Job postings and events that aren't just protests to protect buildings. Also trends/changes in policy and law, and just personal stories I think would be pretty cool.Also what area of VA are you in? I just moved to the Hampton Roads area for a job in preservation recently.
I enjoyed it and even bought the soundtrack, but I think it was about 2x longer than it should have been. I've noticed that is pretty common in Bollywood movies.
No worries at all. I run a Lumia 1020 that I got a year ago, which was out well before that. The hardware is amazing, even almost two years later. The real shiner here is the OS. Its smooth as hell, which makes the hardware shine even more. The way WP is designed is such that you don't need the newest tech to make it beautiful.

Yeah. Abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym. When you lose weight (really, when you lose body fat), your muscles become more defined i.e. you can see where they start and end and what shape they make, which is different than if there's a layer of fat covering them.

Protect is actually really good when you're soloing. Have a look at your defense before and after you cast it. WHM version better of course, but PLD version better than nothing!At 50, I rarely solo anyway, so I dropped it and took fracture for the situational times when I need to do as much DPS as possible.The other 4 as the other poster already mentioned: Stoneskin, Mercy Stroke, Foresight and Bloodbath

You've been conditioned to think this way. We all have. Hell I was walking down the street the the other night and passed a group of white teens, thought nothing of it. Then later I passed by two African teenagers just laughing and mucking around and for an instant, a split second, I felt a tinge of shock inside my stomach. Like some pre programed fear came over me. There was absolutely no threat from either group, but I reacted differently at a level almost beyond my control. 
That's how I'd do it. It could start with a couple of criminals making comments about it or confusing the daredevil for the punisher when confronted by the former. This escalates to where daredevil is investigating the killings and then we have the first daredevil/punisher meet and of course fight.

In their argument that NC has some of the better beer laws in the south, the distributors are quick to mention that breweries can get out of the contracts if they want. But the way they do that is by having to buy their own brand back from the distributor, who usually sets the price. And some breweries have done that and switched distributors before, but I don't know the specifics. 
Identify why rape occurs and seek to correct the thought patterns and behaviours that lead to it where you can. Why do these men think they can just take women and treat them like objects they own in such a horrible and violent way? 
Sweet picture of a human being who, due to circumstances we couldn't even begin to speculate on, is reduced to living on the street and resorting to means that must of us couldn't even imagine. Lol.

Except for the migratory fish populations that get cut by more than 90%. Those are still screwed, even with fish ladders. That in turn leads to changes in the flora upstream (because they don't get a huge fertilizer dump from the hundreds of thousands of dead salmon), which affects everything.
Bad idea. Then you still have the problems we currently have where that's the law. For instance, [this person](http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1495928/images/o-TRANS-MAN-facebook.jpg) in the womens' locker room. How long do you think it would take for him to get pepper sprayed? What's he supposed to do, unzip his pants and show off his genitals? Yeah, him unzipping his pants is gonna end *real well* in that scenario.Not to mention the inverse, how badly trans women get treated in male bathrooms, what with the high rates of sexual harassment, verbal abuse, and physical assault. Do you really think [this person](http://www.qwoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/yollada-nok_suanyot_thailand_2012.png) is gonna be able to take a dump peacefully alone in a locker room full of guys?
Link to articles written by people of color explaining whatever point you're trying to make.Also read up on the history of the "model minority" myth.Here are a couple of links, for YOU to read, and hopefully understand a bit more context and get an idea of how to proceed:http://www.seeding-change.org/asiansforblacklives/http://time.com/3606900/ferguson-asian-americans/http://www.racefiles.com/2014/08/20/why-ferguson-matters-to-asian-americans/
In current polyamorous situations, A &amp; D break up, becoming metamores (lovers of their lovers).  They remain with B &amp; C as before.  I don't see how this is terribly different from current business law, but then again I'm coming at this from a different angle compared to most here... I'm polyamorous and have seen these situations constantly, but I'm not sure of the current legal frameworks.
Yes, but the amount of inflation won't be proportional to the wage increase. Plenty of goods and services have some minimum wage employees involved with them. For instance, when you buy a $20 DVD, part of the money you're paying goes towards the salaries of the cashier, the store janitors, etc. So, if those people get paid more, stores have to charge more to cover the extra labor costs. But if you double their pay, the DVD won't cost $40, maybe it will cost $25. That's because part of that money also goes to the factory in China that produced the physical disc, and the actors who produced the movie. They are not tied to the minimum wage, so the amount of money they receive shouldn't increase.
This is the passage I always open the book to to read to people from, the first half of what you wrote ending in "... every human group is a society of island universes." It was so significant and profound to realise that, and also to appreciate how articulately it was put forth. Love his writing. 
Sure, people can't always get their dream job. But no one is forcing them to work at Hooters specifically. In my home state, there is a bikini coffee shop (actually there are multiple). You guessed it, only women work there... in bikini's, year round. They're also not forced to work there. They applied for that job. I understand jobs are difficult to get sometimes, especially ones you enjoy or want to pursue, so you settle for a while or for the long run. But you still get a say. I'm a woman who has never worked at Hooters, and I've had plenty of other jobs. I chose not to. Being degraded is losing your self-respect, your dignity or being humiliated. If they're choosing that, that's really their problem and not a problem to women as a whole.
Eh, but that can be valid. There are certain skills that should just be taught by schools because it's the best way to make sure that important information is taught to most people.The way I look at it, school's not meant to teach you everything you need to know, but it should teach things that everyone needs to know.
The screen thing is stupid, the differences if any are so tiny and unnoticeable that it shouldn't matter the scratch resistance however is night and day. Also the aluminum is less likely to scratch but any scratch you get is permanent where as stainless scratches can be very easily polished out. I think you made the right choice (same as mine!)

&gt; I imagine you have never actually played with people that so called "lean on that shield."Do what? Going to any fight anywhere on any live server will find you absolutely surrounded by people that are getting kills solely because of the excessive durability of the HA. Both allies and enemies.
I had one down there too "oh, rolling! And wondrous tastiness" Turns out, they aren't cakes... I thought they were too, even though I knew it didn't make a lot of sense. If you look close, there are eyes inside of them, I think the tops are corks and the icing is wax or something. I don't know for sure, we didn't have those in my college. 
I personally just get tired of surrenders on games that could be won. I am talking about games where you individually may be doing bad, but maybe someone on your team is fed. I've been 13/1 before and had my team surrender. All I needed to do was die and I could have carried with ease. This of course was on Assault, but it happens in conquest too. Where one person may be doing bad and then others, without looking at the rest, agree. Those surrenders are by far the worst feeling ones for the person fed. If mid and solo do bad, they don't even care what the hunter does sometimes and just surrender.
A girl I used to be friends with (emphasis on the "used to be") seriously tried to justify looting/setting buildings on fire. She said it was the only way they could get on t.v. and that they had no other options.I go "You know they televised the peaceful marches right?"She responds "I can't argue with you there."I'm like, you literally started this conversation saying it was the only way they could get the world's attention...
that is exactly what i was thinking... the 2e book "skullport" details all sorts of goodies in an underground city full of shady business and what not.
Nova doesn't necessarily deal the kind of damage other assassins do.  Where she (and to a less extent, Zeratul) are best is being behind the enemy to clean up as they retreat.
Dazed would make a great coach for CLG. All these haters on reddit need to get over themselves. Honestly who the fuck cares if hes a scumbag, it doesn't make him any less knowledgeable regarding the game. He is a great resource for CLG to use to improve their team and imo they made a great move picking him up. There are assholes in the world get over it.
I used my firepit when my pup was 3 months. She stuck her nose close, got a good whiff of smoke and never got too close again. You'll be fine. I've had the fire pit going at least 10 times now, no issues.
"Are you going to be using the ~~weird~~ word midget in your comedy sketch?""I certainly would like to.""You can't. It's a bad word. It's like the N-word.""... No, it's not. If you're comparing the badness of two words, and you won't say one of the words, then that is the worse word."-John Mulaney
It's never on them to start something. It's always on other people (read whites) to give hem things or do exactly what the SJW dictates. Want more trans representation in comics? Don't start your own comic. Force a company to make a trans character for you. Bonus points if you demand they make an already established character trans and stick it to the fans of said character. Want more black movies? Don't go make films. Force a studio to make black films for you. Again, bonus points if you can get them to bend the race of an already established franchise. It's never about doing something for yourself. It's always about taking from other people.

That's exactly the way they want your brain to understand it. "It's only $6 every two weeks for a couple of easy pulls! That's just a sliver off your paycheck, hardly even noticeable! And it's so fun!" And a year later, when you are still having fun with the game, you will have spent (26x6) = $156. Well over that $40 you wouldn't even think to spend up front.
No worries! I really wasn't offended at all. Ramping down production so it makes no sense to try to drum up sales. As long as people realize I'm active until the end of the month ;)
Yes, in total, but police killings are massively disproportionate to actual racial demographics. Source: http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/08/police-shootings-ferguson-race-data
Mine was weird like that. We had plenty of couples like that that never progressed past passing "do you like me?" notes, but then we also had people fucking in bathrooms and giving handjobs under desks and shit. Like an odd in between point between elementary and high school
The purple bodies are obviously the spines.  They don't look anything like a bacterium.  The small yellow ovals are the bacteria and the stringy yellow stuff is their extracellular matrix (slime).
Depends. Very depressed INTPs are the most nihilistic people on the planet.Don't understand what you're trying to say about INTJs... edit: okay, I kind of get it... yes, unhealthy INTJs tend to be neckbeard asshole types. Nihilism and existentialism are separate things though.;.. they aren't both different types of nihilism
I kinda wanna get an fn 5.7, maybe in a  few years if I end up doing law enforcement. It would be kind to me in arthritic old age and I wouldn't feel under armed with one. Slap a silence on it and I'm set for life. If I ever owned an AR or glock, it would could duracoated purple or something. If I never needed to worry about "civil chaos", a black rattle can would unfuck it suitably. 
Just to add that saying "some" make it found like just a few. It's in fact the vast majority of infected that are asymptomatic. Different studies say different things but that all seems to agree on 65-80% (often quoted at up to 80%)Tally that up with that 50% of 20 year olds and 80-90% of 40-50 year olds have at least one of the herpes viruses its hard to avoid it especially as you grow older.It really is one of those viruses you can almost assume you have until you've tested negative.

Yeah, we'll stop 'em! That nuclear-armed, vestigial superpower will be no match for our few million dollars and the extra training we're helping provide.People are talking about pushing back the Russians in Ukraine as if it's the same as pushing ISIS out of Iraq. Sure, we *might* be able to help beat back a universally-condemned ragtag mercenary coalition of religious fanatics using a few million in targeted aid and some low-level military and training assistance. But just what the hell do you expect Canada to actually accomplish with a similar strategy against the Russians, right on their strategic doorstep?And since we're whipping out our dic- I mean *majors* to see how big they are, I have an honors degree in polisci from UBC.

Ever since I was a kid, I've had a recurring dream of a plague about once a year. It starts as me finding out everyone is getting sick with rashes and hives all over their faces. I go through extreme measures to stay away from the infected people, but always end up at my grandmas house (where I lived as a child), in my room, with infected people knocking down the door. Then I get so scared I wake up in a sweat. This dream has bothered me since I was around 5 years old, and I'm now 17.
i own a real one and judging from the pictures, they got a lot of the details correct. however, the zipper handles are wrong. the shape of the bag also looks off; the real is a lot more slouchier when worn, whereas the fake looks more blocky.
Well your positioning during fights really depends on your build. I've been going the full tank route, and am able to stick in the middle of fights getting as many stuns off as I can. With the AP build you've gotta sit back and poke more so than being the primary engage. I'm gonna keep experimenting with Bard and you should too :) 
Sorry it took so long to get back to you. I'm using the cutting attachment.  The o2 control valve is all the way open.I too thought it might be starving the cutting attachment, but it does the same thing, even on a different set of bottles, with different regulators and a different body.
*Mixxer is a little inexperienced but she puts her heart and soul into DJing for the couple with Duke always nearby for support. Both in snazzy suits and shades.*
I enjoyed sabotaging the other factions through crappy choices in their quests. Do X or he dies? Nope, he dies - he was important in their faction.I stack the deck for the Dominion!
I feel like this everyday. As a fish, all these humans believe we are inferior. I mean they give me sickening cat food as treats. We should have whatever you had this day and rebel. You are a sign, a vision, of the future. Send me funds at the Atlantic Ocean and we shall rebel against those shitty humans who kill women like this fishman here. But, he is not evil, he is a hero, in fact we all have the strength and power to rebel these humans. Get ready and get all your weapons. THIS IS A REVOLUTION
Pray without ceasing. Trials come in all kinds of forms and suffering isn't gradiated. You and I aren't living as starving third world orphans but our worries are still lessons. We all need God, wherever we are. :)
When I'm losing I just start jumping around like a jack ass and my oppnent useaully kills themselfs out of  boredom or trying to chase me down. People think just cause you stop attacking and try to run down the clock you are trolling. I'm not but I'm sorry in For Glory
I actually have lived close to farmland before, I just didn't connect the smell with the farming season. Although I would love to know when the official season starts, prior to this past weekend there wasn't any smell.
Unfortunately, thorn and felwinters DO need to be nerfed. I love thorn. Awesome gun, but if 90% of players are using the gun, half of them just so they can compete, then it's OP. There's a large variety of guns in destiny, but you wouldn't know if you had only seen IB. I'm not saying thorn should go back to how it was bc it was useless before the buff. It just needs to be more balanced with the other guns. As far as felwinters goes....Fuck that gun. It doesn't need a nerf, it needs to be destroyed. 
Do you own a gun that shoots fire back at you or something? There's no way the spark inside the cartridge would be enough to light anything on fire outside the chamber.
Yeah, it's a shame, apparently game cartridges don't fully update all the systems components. I even bought Cooking Mama: Bon Appetit to update to 9.2, but it didn't solve the issue : / . Being -4E really sucks :/Edit: " SSB and any other game update somehow prevents exploits from working, as they don't update the browser" . I even tried the SD card method that didn't need the QR camera function, but it lacks a browser update and as so, it's also undoable.
My gym makes me terribly light headed during summer and I sweat like a water fountain. Doing that in an *even hotter* environment, with the sun? HELL NO.
1. Posts MUST show evident regretAll links must clearly show a person expressing regret, not just show an act of failing. Regret needs to be clear on the person's face, or portrayed through body language. If you have a gif that shows someone failing, and DOESN'T show regret afterward, it doesn't belong here!
SMB Photography is AMAZING!!! Highly recommend they are super nice and great to work with. Quick turn around time for our engagement photos (about 1 week) and they turned out amazing. Very understanding and willing to work with what you want and able to customize packages. 
Unless you're going to write books, the only thing a divinity degree is good for is the priesthood.  Not a high-paying career in the least.So why someone who had no intention of writing would get a masters/divinity is beyond me, let alone spend $100k in student loans to get it...

I thought I always liked BDSM from porn first, but I remembered once when I was about 6 I used to tie up my teddy bears to chairs with ties and dressing gown ropes and stuff, and my mother came in and found me one time and asked why and I said "it made my willy go up!" - very embarassing! Luckiky I think she was just relieved I didn't say "killing is fun!" or somethingBut yeah, her little boy did in fact grow up to be a mustachiod leatherman, so there ya go 
They ate his leg regardless. THEY were the bad guys. It wouldn't have stopped at Bob. If Rick hadn't done what he'd done, they could have gotten anyone else. 
Aye, 2 accounts is allowed. I'm doing it right now in fact.Here is the [official ruling](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Multiple_logging-in) on it.Can't come up with an AFK moneymaking method off the top of my head.
If it was Will Carolyn Rodney F3, they would have to vote for somebody. Not Will obvs, but I would guess probably not Carolyn ether (she flipped on Shirin and Max, she flipped to the Blue Collars, she wouldn't work with the girls, she and Shirin hated for each other, and she would be seen as riding Tyler's coattails). I think the 4 on the jury are more likely to vote for him than Will or Dan or Carolyn, or Sierra. 
How about society in countries where you become an adult when you're 14? Are they adults in the US because they're adults in their country? Or how about countries where you're an adult when you're 20? Are they not adults? The world and society in the world isn't based around the US. Maybe look at a map for once in your life and realize that the US isn't the only country on the planet and the world doesn't follow American laws.
lol when I viewed it on mobile; 160 RMS was splashed all over the screen;it's barely noticeable when I pull the page up on my laptop.Easy to miss*reviews specs againdamn son, it got that FLAC playback
I meant that it was actually pretty good. Some stuff in there is not backed up by any research and is a bit bro-sciencey... but overall it seems like a good idea to give a shot if you need a little spice in your arm day.
No problem! Best of luck learning the matchup! Also if you haven't yet you should look at cunningkitsune's guide to fox. I'm on mobile so I can't get at it easily but it shouldn't be too hard to find.
Amiibo: VillagerIn Box or Out of Box: In boxPackaging (US, EUR, JP, Doesn't Matter): doesn't matterReason: *Really* want Villager (I love him in Smash), but I can't justify spending an insane amount of money to get one. :(

Absolutely. Emazing is a leviathan with no boundaries. FL came to them several times with the idea and they constantly turned it down. Then released FLs shit before they had the money to. 
Hi all, here's one batch of Bowmore that I wasn't terribly keen on, the Tempest Batch 5. I've mentioned in a few other posts that it's not nearly as good at the 3rd batch, and I'd say I prefer the 12 to this one also. However here are my more specific thoughts about it.**Nose**: alcohol, rotting fruit (cherry or strawberry), some caramel hiding in behindwell that is a bit off putting...**Palate**: alcohol, weird fruit notes - not in a good way, like rotting apples in the fall**Finish**: lingering, all of that rotting apple *not* goodness sticking around**60**/100revisit with press - 1/2tsp water to 1oz**Nose**: pears, caramel, brine, light peat**Palate**: peat, indistinguishable fruit**Finish**: funky ash, plumOverall, very improved with the press! Still not a great dram, not one I would want regularly, but much better than what it was.**75**/100
I don't see the problem? They got the card they wanted. Whether it's no longer part of a set or not doesn't matter. If you're playing a market to make money, you've got to expect to lose sometimes. 
For breaking and entering, trespassing, whatever charge they decide fits the situation. It is likely a misdemeanor. You would be charged by the District Attorney after the police submit the report. 
my "travel logistics gone bad" version is I get on a plane...and can't get off. the plane flies indefinitely, and I am trapped there for days and days, going around the earth several times and never reaching a destination. I don't think I could ever stay on the ISS, it's like the living incarnation of that dream
They lowered her base damage across the board and raised her ratios in the last set of annie changes, it was to push her out of a support role and into a more mage role. We all know how that turned out. Her stun is just too good (and her auto harass)
Check out my post history.  I recently built in an RVZ01 and I highly recommend it.  I took quite a few pictures so you can get an idea of what it's like working in a SFF case.

I cheered a fair bit along with everyone else but it wasn't my idea. There were a few prominent dudes in the cell that were the most vocal/most supportive who initiated all the cheering, so they definitely get the credit. But I'm happy we made that night a little bit better for you.
Brunch, but I saw a picture of one the other day and it looked a bit bare.

You know, I wouldn't go that far. From my point of view, she was lead to believe that her personality and the way she carries herself wouldn't mix with the rougher straightforward and sometimes crude nature of the people on the podcast.So. Yes. A bit ill informed. But not completely unreasonable. 
its a known bug when there is a bad internet connection. its possible for your computer to miss the part where the smoke is supposed to blume so your client says there is no smoke there. there is video proof online but im on mobile so i cant link sorry.
There were droughts in California before. Do you consider those times to be massive slumps or simply recessions not particularly related to the drought?
I get the feeling that's what the plan is though. Stop Judgement Day from happening and pull an X Men Days of Future Past and reset the series. John being a Terminator will probably be "fixed" at the end of the movie too.
Every time someone mentions pb blaster and Cherokees I wonder if I'm the only one that could take the jeep apart with just the tool kit that loves in the back
Thanks again :)  Yeah I think the non-windowed version with more sound isolation will be perfect for you.  It is indeed a quiet case, I was surprised at how quiet it is! Also, with the built-in fan controller you can lower the case fans' speed for more silence.
Although a fine gag OP, it was too long as as soon as the orc says "something found in a forest" I knew it the Dwarf would pick the Elf. The joke could be re worded and cut down by four paragraphs youll have yourself a joke for the table.
Ah OK that's what they mean, thanks! I do find it easier to land those almighty crits w/ fatebringer compared to other weapons. What peek do you use in the other row? Explosive rounds?
they won't it is in the fine print. Even if the package is insured it just means if the retailer will provide a replacement they will ship it for free. Happened to me last year with my $200 bong
My favorite part is being asked if I want to join a queue to get into a 4 player match that can't be joined until it's over. Or the "interaction menu". Most of the things in that menu should be assigned to keys. Inventory, Outfits, Emotes, all should have their own keys.GTA V is a great, well done portGTA:O is console port garbage
UF just rarely had a "go to" guy to take those shots was the problem. Florida was very much about the "team" and we've very rarely had a single guy who could create and get shots like a Durant/Westbrook. The fact that Florida did so well with only the occasional Bradley Beal type player is why you guys are so lucky to have our coach. 
&gt;"Came here to say THIS" comments get massively downvoted on reddit because they don't add anything to the discussion. In reality, they get downvoted because it happens so often and people get sick of it. I'm not trying to call you out or anything, just letting you know why this probably happened hahaAnd as we all know NFSW posts are the height of stimulating discussions. Heh. *Stimulating.* 
Well, I can see how it doesn't match some of his older projects although unlike some I've enjoyed his X-men (well some of it anyway). Anyhew if Daredevil is any indication he'll excel at this gritty solo type project.
&gt;And if you're in college, it probably already existsI think a lot of people are getting in to it now that we're aware of Euro-style not pure luck-based games; a board game club started at our university this year and they seem to be doing really well.
&gt; if it's ported it generally lacks the polishThey picked a pretty good example to counter this - Candy Crush is pretty polished.  If going forward more high profile games get the same treatment then that will be a significant boost.
Ziggs and Orianna have passives that make CSing easier. Malzahar is very easy to farm with once you buy some AP and have a few points in his E. For other AP champions, consider taking the Butcher and Arcane Blade masteries to deal more damage to minions. Other than that, it really does just come down to practicing in custom games or play norms where your goal is to *only* CS while avoiding harass and unfavorable trades. CSing in PvP will become second-nature the more you practice in PvE or a game without any distractions.[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/) is a guide you should check out. It's worth at least skimming but also very helpful if you go through it. There's also a CSing infographic floating around out there; I'll edit this comment if I find it.Edit: [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/orWUCKH.jpg) the infographic. Turns out it's the same as the guide above, but easier to read.
What is poly-substance abuse? Is it like all the pictures on r/drugsarebeautiful when people show off their excesively high amount of drugs and drug variations?
Not a SJW.  Not a feminist.  Not a MRA.  Not HAES.  Not someone who promotes an anorexic diet plan.  Not the extreme left or the extreme right.  Not a "special snowflake".  No one who goes too far.Someone level headed, fair, driven, knows what they want out of life and who has the same interests as me.
A RAW file is not a photo, it's a collection of digital data that can be edited and processed into a photo. When you "view" a RAW file, you're viewing it already processed, with various editing decisions already made by whatever software you're using it to view it. The difference is that when you make changes, the software reprocesses it from the RAW data.
&gt; Many people would like to have some form of social and cultural stability.And there's nothing stopping them from doing so.  Since the society you live in is defined by the network of relationships you have with other specific people, and isn't some abstraction that exists "out there", all you have to do is choose with whom and on what bases to form relations with others.  If you want to reengineer the entire external world to match your preferences, though, you're SOL -- no matter how much you *want* the external world to conform to your vision of an ideal society, it will never actually be possible to bring this about.&gt; When you reject the universal you crater into subjectivism.But subjectivism is a correct description of reality.  Ideals and values exist only in the minds of human beings; they can be useful tools for building one's own particular life, but attempting to universalize them will create only unnecessary conflict and wholly avoidable misery.
Hey Vince, awesome to see you do an AMA finally!  It's great to have you.  I know you're probably getting flooded with question but I have one specific to this reply.  I'm late to the party but I really hope you get a chance to read this.  Do you think it's possible that's the reason why Water White is such a deplorable person and as George said, 'a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros' is *because* Walt isn't pure adulterated evil? What I mean is that, in way, I look at someone like Walt as worse than a Joffrey because we know that Walt is capable of being a good person.  For someone to 'break bad' in a way, is almost more 'evil' than someone whose heart and soul are dark and evil from the get-go.  It's like, we don't expect any better from Joffrey whereas Walt has sunk to personal lows far below whatever moral lines he had set for himself prior to the show.  I hope that makes sense.  
Definitely head on over to the tech support forums on the official website. They probably have a lot more potential info and help for you there. best of luck!
I play a lot just with my fingers, but if I use a pick, I do something like* .46 for acoustic / strumming* .73 for electric / lead* 1.14 for bass(or so I think. all my picks are from couches and bar-tops and have the letters mostly worn-off, so I google "dunlop picks" and matched the colors)
Neil almost doesn't count since he's been an obsessive blogger/tweeter/press junkie for the better part of 15 years.  You can barely escape the intimate details of his personal life if you follow him at all.I mean, I'm only a very casual fan, and know when he got divorced and remarried, name and age of his daughter, where he lives, his dogs' names (and when and how he got them), who stays at his house on the weekends, where he's at right now, and I could go on and on.  Did you know his first writing gig was a biography of *Duran Duran?*  All that and more, and I don't even give a shit.
Sure, I can link you to games where I have done similar things with TB. The point remains, however, if you did it with TB, you could have done it better with a different carry. Also, radiance TB is just plain bad, so I am going to have a hard time taking you seriously. Not to mention 16 games on a hero hardly makes you an expert.
The only rta I've ever used is the subtank mini, but it's pretty good. The flavor isn't quite as good as my freakshow, but I like having a tank when I'm out and about. Plus, you can buy the pre-built if you're feeling lazy. 
Tripping at a festival. Everybody was like Whoa dude check out those Northern Lights. I saw shimmering crazy lights, decided it was just me tripping, because everything was shifty. Told them, no, that's just a car dealership down the road and some light pollution. Turns out to really be the Northern Lights, and I dismissed them. Then I cut my finger, and my friend's girlfriend, starts to suck the blood from my finger, right in front of him, in an overtly sexual way. I was too awkward to know how to respond to that particular bodily fluid transfer so I just froze unable to compute. That wasn't as weird as the time we saw a UFO tripping on the beach, but that's not as interesting really because there were no abductions, just a weird silent bright light hovering above us for a second before flying away.
This is probably because a server wipe is coming and everyone is using up their ammo, wait till tomorrow after wipe and re-evaluate.    Unless this is Battle Royale you speak of, then it sounds like you're not very good.
Steam is cool for getting the word out to tons of people, but I don't want to give them any of your money.If there is a separate standalone app and a steam one then will you get 100% of the money spent in the standalone?
Hey man!  You do a fine job and have a growing fanbase so you're doing something right. To be honest that opinion grew out of the Challenger Series stuff with you and Phreak where it was a little less strict/professional as LCS comes across as. Sometimes comedy was forced/stretched too far. I will say I have steadily warmed up to your casting over the Spring Split, kind of like most people describe Deficio's casting.   I hope yours is as well good sir and keep up the hard work.  Maybe I'm just salty about your dance moves being a bit better than mine :\^)
The rover drove up to the outcrop a few hours ago, the first images from its navigation camera are coming in already, but wou will probably need science camera images to see if there are signs of mats...
I love off-roaders and muscle cars, but I also LOVE my Supers and Sports. Being able to drive that fast and accelerate that fast while dodging traffic and other racers just brings and incredible thrill and satisfaction!!
I think Margaery still has some morals about what she does (the technical kid sex aside), in many ways probably who Cersei was when she still loved Rob and was willing to hold back during the long summer.
What I have learned during my time with two Radeon 7850s in Crossfire is that it isn't worth the bother.  I don't think I have played a single new release title without some sort of massaging necessary to get gains out of Crossfire.  Even in some mature titles, like Skyrim, it massively screws it up and you need to go hunting through forums to find a profile that might fix the issue (Assassin Creed: Brotherhood profile worked for Skyrim).  I wish I had just sold the 7850 at upgrade time and bought a better single card. 
I'm a few months into my first stick of arko, looks like I haven't used any at all. Wonder how long this stuff lasts, I have 2 more sticks to go through.
They are legit.  If you replace 1 side and the other side has any significant wear you should do both.  That's with a normal car.  Now you have a Camaro SS which means it most likely has a limited slip rear, you must always replace those rears at the same time as differences in height from side to side will cause premature wear and failure of that dif.  The clutches in it will burn up if they are always wearing on one another. Also performance tires wear out by 15 to 20 k with easy driving.  I was going through tires every 10 to 12 k on my corvette driving it like it should be driven.Tldr: You gotta pay to play bro.
The thing is that we expect a lot from Goetze and he sometimes meets that expectation or falls slightly short of it, rarely exceeds it (mostly because what we expect is the moon). Weiser has the benefit of no one expecting shit, and anything he does is received with a "holy-shit-would-you-look-at-that!" level of incredulousness. He has had a couple of good games and that's literally it. Wait till he has to shoulder all your hopes dreams and then judge him against Goetze. 
I've heard of the issues that both the Nvidia Shield and the N9 are facing as a result of that chip (I owned a  Shield myself but i sent it back due to massive stuttering)
You're right. I really shouldn't have turned this into something about entitlement. I just wish that people would voice their opinions in a more civil way. That's all. That was what I intended to say in my original comment, and I stand by that.
Joe was sterile after the tar &amp; feather incident - even tho they did not castrate him. Emma had lovers on the side to get even with him for his babes on the side.
Well they use ~~vent~~ teamspeak. But they have about 100+ people in one channel and don't allow you to talk. And all there orders are said over Platoon chat. So...
i drink tea out of a spurs mug before or during the game.  sometimes i try to dress in silver and black even though i usually watch the game at home. that's about it. and it's just for fun, i'm not superstitious. 
I got my IPA in hand. Let's fucking do this shit. Here's to some great picks for the Browns and hopefully busts for the Ratbirds, the Bungles, and the piece of shit Squeelers.
&gt;The people of this country have voted to remain in the EU. They have voted to allow none English speakers access to work in this country. Ensuring they are not exploited is the right thing to do.UTo be fair, that's like arguing that when Scotland voted no to independence they requested that more powers be transferred to Westminster and Trident be renewed. Its just not the case.
The scene where Walter points to Jesse and reveals his location to the gang, from Ozymandias, I'm sure Aaron was like "Bitch!  He was right, I am going to die."
If we do anything, we should announce a campaign of some sorts to change Gamergate's name to something else that is has a much larger scope. Incorporating all of those involved in Gamergate to participate in things outside of gaming.Gamergate has largely moved beyond gaming anyway. We still cover gaming stuff and it's usually our top priority, but we're also interested in other nerd culture and the random bullshit our opponents put other people through (Shirtgate, Vitamin World, etc).

The plague that had spread there was not nearly as bad as in India. There were few enough infected that the colonial authorities were able to manage the outbreak when it first arrived years ago. Now there are some places in the countryside where the disease is still active, but otherwise Indochina seems safe.
Yup, definitely go for the "hard" styling waxes if your hair tends to be a rebel haha. Actually, the *only* Western product that has somewhat worked for me was the [Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shaping Cream](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/151655731507?lpid=82&amp;chn=ps), but I wanted to give these two styling waxes a try. Anyways, I hope they work for you as well!
&gt;why do anime characters look like white peopleWell, sometimes they are white people, and other times it's a fictional setting where races don't matter. And sometimes it's just an art style thing.&gt;and why do actual white people look like giants?Do they? I mean, [Baccano has a mostly-white cast](http://i.imgur.com/KBtzQNx.jpg), and none of them look like giants.

Agreed! I first vaped out of an MFLB. I've owned the Vapir NO2 and now the Arizer Solo. It's like comparing a brick phone to a blackberry to an iPhone!
As far as I know. Use a vpn. Not sure on a torrent program but utorrent (I know they have had some issues). Go to a torrent directory aka pirate bay or kickasstorrents. Download. I know there is way more detail but I'm mobile and I do all that on my phone and stream to my TV from that. 
iv and skew in my mind are two separate things.  a single implied volatility often refers to the iv of the atm strike.  skew is how that iv is represented in the otm strikes above and below spot.  skew morphs over time but it's general structure stays intact.  for SPY that would be negative IV the higher you get in calls and higher IV the lower you get with puts. 
That's the airline's problem, I'll go where I please. I paid for my ticket and they didn't provide facilities. What are they gonna do? Throw me off? Turn around? 
There's been a lot of sound and fury about these quotes, but I think it's referring to the idea that the differences between men and women are socially constructed and not innate. I don't see any direct relevance to trans people.
If you want to build up your milk supply, try renting a hospital grade pump &amp; pump every 3 hours. Had to throw milk out I produced so much. Apparently there is something about the hospital pumps that increases supply verses regular at-home consumer pumps.
Push the slide bits down around the cork, and pull straight up while turning slightly. Very useful with weak or damaged corks.(Remove the foil first)
Them having Jim White was bizarre, I think Neil Reynolds is okay though, I listen to the sky NFL podcast and he seems sensible, though sometimes toes the party line a bit. 
It does seem like my coworkers are more positive about furries than the general public. I feel really sorry for that guy that lost his job for being a furry. It's such a different experience from what I've had when my coworkers learned.
We're due to pick up sub-attributes counting for rainbow dungeon qualifying soon, which means his Ronia team can do it easily: Vamp covers blue, Lilith can pick up light, and either CDD or Zombie Dragon handle wood.Ronia + Beelz pairings can handle Legend Plus, and doesn't require any more +egg investment than most teams do.Assuming Ronia is his primary team, he needs to counter the things she's bad at: skill binds (Andromeda leads pack 80% and so does this fine), Fire or Dark absorbs/binds (Andromeda has nothing to worry about here), needing heavy damage every single turn (Andromeda is NOT good at this).Light Kali can handle the third as a tertiary team, but I see no reason to worry about Andromeda.  Her big weaknesses (combo guard, water binds/absorbs, longer dungeons) aren't problems for Ronia, so his two main teams cover each other well.

FE7 Isadora, she is just so bad and she is pre-promoted.FE8 Seth, cool unit but i hate using pre-promoted units.FE:A Anna, her lack of supports and bad growths make her pretty weak.
To be fair, they've probably seen Payton at his best, which the vast majority of NBA fans and writers haven't.  He's got just as high a ceiling as Wiggins, and a worthy #1 choice.
i believe tina commented on something like this a while ago. i think it was something to do with how it is a default setting for the bot they used and just never changed it.my first assumption was that cursing is often used with trolling, attacking or other things that are more banable. the only thing that comes to mind as why someone would curse not for those reasons would be for an exclamation (what the fuck was that?!).
If you are on the lease, you should inform the complex's management of the dog arriving. That you have no part in it. This will at least protect yourself for the time you are there.
You're not educated,you just butthurt because finally Indonesia enforcing the law,you wouldn't care about those non western people getting executed in other nation before,and now like your government,you try to play hero which actually makes you look more like protecting criminals,and of course that should be expected from a penal colony state.
Depending on trim position, you may actually require positive pressure *forward* to keep the nose from coming up too steeply. Depends on the engine too.
What kind of loser team is #1 in the draft and takes more than 5 seconds to submit their pick?!?What the hell else have the Bucs been thinking about for the past 4 months?
I have Raiola ATM and wondering which of them I should upgrade to. Debating because I have 87 Sitton and considering doing Pouncey and Boling over Mangold. 
&gt; everyone thinks he's a genius.Whoa whoa whoa, people are giving him some credit for the team's success the last four games- but ain't no one talkin bout him like he's a genius. In fact, people are worried that he'll get so far in the playoffs that they won't be able to fire him this offseason.

Phillips Longboat porterPaddock Wood Barrel Full Of Monkeys (lucky find)Red Racer IPA and copper aleAnd I may crack open this bottle of Mikkeller "I Hardcore You" on the weekend, not sure yet.Was *this* close to getting to Nine Mile Legacy last night, but the wife was tired after dinner and killed that plan.  Little bitter after that still.
I used to work for the Coast Guard as a technician, they had a main base 30 minutes away from where I worked, the only other people I would see are mechanics. I would go down to the hanger and just spend every shift fixing the telecommunication devices (ie, antennas, GPS, Radios, and Wiring) on [ridged hull boats](http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/folios/00029/images/frimg24.jpg). It would take me 7-15hrs per boat depending on how well the previous technician before me did their job. That was what I did, and I did it well, any free time I had would be spent making an extra workshop for engineering purposes (made custom shelves, put in new equipment, empty out the old electrionics to make room, etc). Anyways, I got the same shit from my supervisor, "Oh, we don't see you all that much maybe increase your communication skills..." I'm like, dude, how can I do that when my whole shift is just me working alone on a boat and you guys are 30 minutes away from me? I never understood that.
Maybe, but a lot of it is really basic. Don't get me wrong, I have seen some good fights, but the fighters cant be that good or else people would start getting really fucked up. Thats that realm that has been around probably since people started. Plus I'm not really allowed to have much to do with sport fighting.
Right, that's true. I just liked that this anime appeard to have siblings without heavy incenstual themes. I'm not against that, but it's often overplayed in anime and it would be nice if they showed a representation of close siblings that weren't romantic. (Not saying other shows don't do this, and not against where this show went.)
Can you explain to me why you can't use the starter decks?I am also just getting in to this game and am not sure how the "sets" work in building a deck.
You're in [luck](http://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/34b14w/buying_guide_divers/) budI'd look into the Seikos to stay in that price range, although I don't think you're going to be as attracted to the aesthetics of those.

I would be more inclined to recommend a desktop vape. At that age most portables may be difficult to deal with filling, think dexterity. I'm middle age and enjoy my E-Nano so I would recommend a log vape. It's easy to load and the small amount is just enough. Here is a good video about the E-Nano. Maybe have her watch it and other reviews of vapes to help determine what she may want.https://youtu.be/Y388LqgVY-s

I'm pretty sure I don't even want to watch and I don't follow CFB enough to know anything about pretty much anyone but still turned it on.  The withdrawal is real.
lets be fair, considering that current Buddhist horde start strategy revolves around converting to Sunni and dunking Muscovy ASAP...the worst that happens is nothing changes :D
A bit of context- I'm wandering occupied space, and happened to find my way to Themiscrya. I'm not used to seeing more than the brief blurb on a local faction, so I was rather surprised to see this unique faction in an unremarkable system. Does anyone happen to know if there's more to the story here?

A Tmo user here. Just got the phone last Saturday, there was a 78 mb update when I set it up, but I haven't seen the 5.1 update yet. If also like to get my hands on the change log.

No spoilers please. I won't be able to watch it until tomorrow morning.
Well that's kinda disappointing. Although is freesync/gsync really a benefit when you're above 90hz? I thought they'd have the greatest effect when you're going above and below 60hz?Probably going for an ultrawide then. This was my last hope for AMD's freesync 
I watched the first season before reading anything. After that, when I started AGoT I had so many "ohhhh" moments.Then my wife started watching and it's been both fun and frustrating watching with her.

Are there areas of your prison that do have uniforms and only part of it isn't getting them? Are your janitors leaving laundry baskets with clean or dirty uniforms in them in areas your workers aren't permitted to? I previously had a problem where I would build my main prison, and then I'd build a smaller area for the protective custody prisoners, including their own laundry area. However, all the delivered uniforms would go to my main area's laundry room (it seems uniform deliveries always go to the first laundry you build) leaving none for the protective area. I would end up having to zone the area that wasn't getting uniforms to shared so that the workers from the main laundry area could go put uniforms on the beds. Since then, when I'm building, I always make sure to leave new areas un-zoned until a worker or janitor comes in and puts uniforms on all the beds (and hopefully leaves behind a laundry basket with some extras in it) so that uniforms stay evenly distributed.

Looks good on you. I have the same problem with the binder digging into my armpit (it only happens on one side, for some reason). This might sound stupid, but  try wearing it inside out. That eliminated the digging for me. It seemed to be caused by the large seams sticking out inside the binder.

You mean she can buy a 10 million dollar home instead of a 5 million dollar home right? This is about how women ceo's are making MORE than male ceo's :)
Lol, we should get Sterling as we lack an out and out winger(on the right side) Sterling would be a great signing as he is special, he's only 20, would be another great investment for the club like Dybala.
I agree, I rush into dumb situations instead of paying attention to my spacing. It's a bad habit from playing this game terribly for years haha. Thanks for the response!
Don't chew my head off, I only want to learn, but how can we know that macroevolution is a thing, like if it's scientific? I mean I haven't heard of any transitional forms being found, and we certainly can't observe macroevolution in a lab like we can microevolution. Hopefully that makes sense, like I said, I'm genuinely curious! 
Of course protests are absolutely justified in the case of injustices that we've seen in the past few years.Burning down a CVS and cutting fire hoses is not a protest. I don't know how you could protest the police without being a nuisance to or endangering innocent people, but burning down buildings  and tipping cars is definitely not it.
Because your house and kid still smells like smoke. I'm not talking shit about smokers because I do. But I don't do it in my house or my car. Why should my child have to suffer because i smoke.

So a few months back I was drunk and said I would eat a terrible towel if the Steelers take a Corner Back in the first round.I am a man of my word be it drunken or not. So I'm a little nervous about the draft tonight, and my digestive system.
Everyone likes different things.  I fucking love NJPW, and I think it's the best promotion out there. But do I get pissy and pompous if other people don't like it?  No, I don't. I accept that people have different opinions. That diversity in taste and diversity in styles is what makes wrestling so awesome. 
When you're depressed, support that's there for you isn't always obvious.The person in question has a number of medical issues going on besides just the emotional aspects. They have legitimate reasons to be sad and upset even without getting into what happened a few days ago.What happened to Tina has hit me so hard that I'm on a train barely keeping myself together. I am still so worried about Tina, and I am also worried about my friend, because more stuff happened to her yesterday and I haven't heard from her since then.I'm actually terrified.So please. Please. I know you're all good people and that you're compassionate. Please continue to be so.That's all I can ask for at the moment.
1. He misspelled beam and steel.2. circlejerk3. As some redditors explained, a material doesn't need to melt to lose stability due to how thermal energy and basic  physics work. Technically, when something is heating up it is beginning to melt. Solid + thermal energy= particles move faster, looser and that solid goes into a liquid.
A lot of this. If your looking for icons, look at font awesome and icomoon, both free. One of the best things I ever learned was white (empty) space isn't bad, make a whole lot of it, then shrink it if you need to. You should learn bootstrap or foundation or both. If you want to get a little more advanced, d3.js is definitely worth learning.
Thing is we can afford to spend a lot of money this summer and then the following year we won't need to spend as much because the squad will be complete more or less. I say go ahead and get them all!
I'm not great at this kind of stuff, so correct me if I'm wrong.1 tonne = 2,204.64 pounds2,204.64 pounds of lift = 96,171.14 newtons. Therefore we would need 96,171.14 watts (at 1n/W which seems quite optimistic) to generate lift on a car, would we not?The highest capacity battery pack available at the moment that I know of is the Tesla S battery pack at 85kW. Assuming the 85kW could power the engine(which it can't), it would last approximately 45 minutes.This doesn't take into consideration many, many other factors such as the safety of having a battery powered car run out of juice at 10,000 feet.I could be completely wrong on my math, because I don't know much about physics, but the practically of flying cars is just not there, and likely never will be.
I have one information telling me that we can't scrim at the moment, and another one telling me the contrary.But with all the trainings/operations at the moment, I don't think we can do another thing (Cobalt Ops, 2 weekly trainings for SS, 1 weekly training with JEST, 1 weekly operation with KAIN).Next training is Saturday afternoon.
Played a couple of games tonight - it worked fine but I'm on board with Satellite Grid being redundant.I actually felt like I wanted Shipment From Kaguya.  The original Wall of Weyland sat on one piece of advanced Ice, while this one kind of wants advances on a few cards, to make things cheaper/bigger as needed.  Kaguya helps by stacking two things at once... may give it a try.
24 is still quite young for a keeper. He definitely has the talent in him to become our #1. It's a bit hard to judge him now because ospinas done well to keep him out of the starting xi. Honestly have no idea how Wenger will deal with this in the summer. I would personally go for lloris and keep woj as a backup. 
As I said, there's been little to no trouble at most facilities that allow this, like in California or . So there's not much lowering, if at all.Also, trans people tend to pass when they switch locker rooms, so they tend to be more at risk going into the locker rooms they look like they shouldn't be entering. Allowing transgender people to use the facilities they want cuts down on harassment issues (but will not eliminate it, as I've said before) and is generally safer for everyone involved. If you could clarify your point about lowering quality of life... someone might see a penis or vagina and then what, get offended? Am I missing something, there? I'm trying to understand what sort of issue that will present that isn't already present within the original locker room. 
I have an Eevee with HA, Gligar HA, Dratini HA, Phantump HA, Gothita HA, Sableye with suckerpunch and recover, Meditite with Bullet Punch, Skrelp HA, Shrromish HA, and a bunch of 5iv rotoms that are not ideal.
From what I see all the spots with no signs of grass and just dirt are completely dead and just going to be bare spots. Anything that is attached to the green blades of grass should still be fine. What Im not sure about is the brown grass no where near any green.The fact that I can still see the lines of edges of the sod make me believe the sod wasn't installed properly anyway.Sod is mostly dead. Final answer. You could try reseeding to fill in the bare spots if you dont want to tear it all up but im not sure when the best time for you to do that is. You may also have a problem with your soil which would may have cause the sod to die in the first place and could prevent seed from germinating in the future.I suggest a soil test and try to get some info from someone that knows more about lawn care in your area.
He's better than those, but we need a significant upgrade.. someone who can literally carry us. According to ESPN it's 18 goals, pretty sure they're legit..Plus if he's actually available for the £12/15m like a few reports have stated, I'm pretty sure many teams will be after him.. just not to be their main guy.We should be going all out on Depay, if that fails (prob will) then go all out on Martinez who is afaik a Liverpool fan.. if that fails again then Walcott, if that fails again then Menez, if that fails again then Vietto/Benteke etc.
His gimmick is basically 'never gives up, never stays down, never loses clean' - aka John Cena 2.0. He could be great on the mic and the best wrestler in the building, but that predictability kills any interest or likability I might have for him.
I was in 6th grade, age 11, when I first experienced a pregnant classmate. It's really weird to think that the baby is the same age now that his mother was when he was born.
Domino isn't eating or pooping. She was totally fine when I left for work at 8 this morning. I force fed her water, mushy pellets, and pineapple juice. I also massaged her little belly, and cleaned out her scent glands. She's awfully mad, but I'm trying to help. She's been sitting in her litter box without moving. She even let's me pick her up without a fuss. I'm really worried. The vet closed at 6. Any suggestions on what else I could do? :(
I don't think c and 0.999 999 999 999 999 999 999 9951c are the same... c seems extra special. I don't think it's even possible a particle like a proton *to* move at c. Wouldn't it be at rest in its own reference frame? Also, do photons (traveling at c, of course) even *have* reference frames?
Yeah, it is a disproportionately large number of side scrollers. I guess I play a lot of side scrollers anyway so I didn't really think about it but I can see how it would be frustrating if it's not really your thing. 
I'm not sure why TB was so triggered by one person on this subreddit using the word 'cunt' for his guest (which I couldn't even find on that page) - when his other guest used it for some of the users of his own website, even though they weren't violating any rules.
Co sign. I have spoken to many bus drivers, cabbies etc and casually asks what impact they think self driving cars will have on their jobs. They all looked at me like im crazy.I guess some people woild rather shy away from the truth then confront it.
It sounds like you haven't actually played a lot of kz. You'd need to install a dedicated server and set up the KZTimer mod on it. Playing kz w/o the mod, even if you set the right server vars, would be incredibly painful.
I'm actually stalking a semi celebrity. He took a picture near promo poster of himself. And I'm trying to find the spot. We want to replicate the photo. That's all. 
What does this even mean?  Is there something preventing you from creating a Steam account?  Even if all you can do is bank transfer, Steam accepts PayPal, and PayPal will draft from your bank on-demand for free.
The problem is it's *too* easy to remove a prediction.  I recently removed love from my vocabulary, and it still hasn't returned to the right places yet.
Don't talk for all of us please. It's totally normal to research basic customs when going abroad. If you disagree with it is one thing, but you just seem like an arrogant and ignorant idiot if you don't tip.
I don't think so, I am confident it has to due with management options. We had plenty of foreign players who were in the first team in previous years and was never a problem, in fact in terms of language and adaption it would have been more easier for him to adapt while in the first team considering we have players like Sulej, Fejsa, Samaris and others.
&gt; it forms an organization to do those things. That is a government.That could be a business, or a non-profit.What distinguishes a government from other groups is that governments have the legal right to use coercion, to force you to do what it wants.You don't need coercion to build a road or plant a tree or construct a school, etc. You don't need government at all.
&gt; Hernnstein &amp; Murray's The Bell Curve, 1994[Hardly a credible source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve#Criticisms)&gt; There's virtually no disagreement about these facts except in some circles in the social sciences. Genes are highly predictive of personality, intelligence, social outcomes, and behaviours.Interesting that you're citing sources from the 1980s and 1990s--when the human genome hadn't even been mapped yet--as your proof that genes predict "social outcomes" and "behavior."  Of course that's nonsense, and such a link hasn't been remotely proven.  Even now we don't have a clear understanding of which genes would cause personality traits such as impulsivity.  Also, with the exception of the Bell Curve none of your sources are arguing that biology alone is determinative.Again, nobody in the modern social sciences says that biology doesn't play a factor.  But the idea that *only* biology plays a factor has been thoroughly disproven and discredited.
&gt;Are these greatly exaggerated/made up comments for karma? I think you have your answer there. To be fair, I do see these comments on youtube/other kpop websites where people are *literally* crying their eyes out. Probably shittily written exaggeration.

That would be why the "UNCHOSEN' part. Sometimes you wanna, se what would happen so you cut it off for something you wanna know about the results of.Not any different from have a god mode option in a video game.

It really depends on the crime, the country, the treaty and the "mood" at the timeIn the Knox example - she could definitely be eradicated, but it's not a sure thing for Italy if they try. There's a provision in the treaty with Italy that says that America is not automatically obliged to extradite if she has a constitutional protection (double jeopardy) but it doesn't exclude the possibility.In the second case most definitely he could be extradited. Freedom of the Press only applies for what you do on American soil. Depending on the country a request for extradition for a "treason" offence would either be close to absolutely certain (for close allies) or a massive political hot potato (for no so close allies / outright enemies). And yes they all have very convoluted language put in place to deal with these exact sort of situations.
It would not be so weird if the word "Catholic" had meant "people who kick puppies" since it's first use.It doesn't really matter, though.  I am using the Catholic definition of marriage to answer a question from a Catholic point of view:&gt; I can't see how homosexuality comes into the picture. Gay marriage is not false because it is against cannon law, it is false because it isn't marriage at all. We can't reject gay marriage, because there is no such thing.I am simply replying to the OP's question.  I am saying that you cannot compare a "marriage performed by other religions" with "gay marriage," because the latter does not exist, *from a Catholic point of view*.
I think 20 percent odds on Immunity is a little generous, considering the fact that we have seen barely any games from Immunity as well as the fact that Australia is not exactly known for counterstrike. Something more accurate would be 85-15 in favor of NiP, in my opinion.

###I mean Significant amounts of Mexicans, and really most of the Mexicans living in the US were those who decided to stay after the US annexed Mexico's northern territories.
So true. Shitting on independent cinema and up and coming directors is a classless move. All actors and filmmakers were "inexperienced" at one time. Usually until someone took a chance on them. Even RDJ. It'd be nice if he took a chance on someone too.

I know alot of guys on here dis on scooters, but you cant help but have a good time putting around the community in one.   I had a 150cc for a short time, and even though it was the most unreliable pile of chinese crap I've ever owned, it was still a blast when it was working.
I can understand that the mayor likely though he was being helpful and didn't mean to cause offense but it does put fault on the victim based on her actions. That is victim blaming.All this sort of advice does is work to make the victim feel at fault and work to make people blame the victim because, again, she should have known better.I can't even imagine being this woman and hearing those comments from the mayor. 
&gt; No snakes hereThis is a common misconception.  There are actually [two snakes](http://pacificislandparks.com/2010/03/17/snakes-in-hawaii/) found in Hawaii.  The first is the Island Blind Snake.  It is the size of, and looks like, a small worm.  You've probably seen them and just thought it was a worm. They are not dangerous.http://pacificislandparks.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/puhe_08242004-026_rambra-cropped.jpg?w=600&amp;h=420The other is an extremely rare Yellow-Bellied Sea Snake (that is dangerous, but so rare that encounters are almost never reported). I must be lucky because I've actually seen one of these (not my picture that follows).http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4aas0AQ601rw6hhbo1_500.jpgBut ya, no regular snakes.
It just doesn't make sense in this case, the story was very much complete in the first game despite a weak ending. The added dlc are just (in general) new enemy types and a few missions that play off of these new enemy types and a separate story line set way before the games actual story. 
Should probably look at Costco or expand my grocery options! I buy a ton of thighs as opposed to breasts. Been looking at seitan or wheat gluten to make myself as an alternative.
People are forgetting that Matt Smith (supposedly a principle cast member) hasn't featured in ANY of the promotion material. Maybe the twist is that he is the real John Connor?

Thank you! Some of us don't have a million God damn hours to find a group all the time. Make it a preference. Those who have all the time in the world and their friends can take an extra hour to find a group for a raid....and those of us with limited time can have matchmaking.
it's pretty bad how shameless everybody is about it too. we get it, they pay you to "emcee" the show and in return you flood the station with their shitty songs. or fuck it, only play music from bands on your own station's self promoted concerts. 
Buen ejemplo del retorno a las bases de Aceves, fichado por Iberdrola y en el caso Bankia, en donde también "al retornar a las bases"  tuvo su puesto, ha terminado imputado por la comisión de delito de apropiación indebida, falsificación de cuentas anuales, administración fraudulenta o desleal, y de un delito de maquinación para alterar el precio de las cosas.
Except most people just crack the window and, if you're lucky, put the cigarette in the hand closest to the window and kinda aim their breaths that direction. Which, in reality, doesn't do much. Unless you've honestly got your head halfway out the window, at least some of the smoke is going to stay (as evident by the strong smell... if you can smell it, there's smoke in the car even if you can't see). Especially when the person isn't taking puffs. 
Well. Don't exactly take my word either. Go there and find out for yourself if you want a completely unbiased view where you can depend on your own eyes and ears and not something written on paper. 
Last time I picked them, same thing here. Slasher Duo win because they're backed by horror movie tropes, so as long as I can survive ~12 hours (a night and some change) I'll have nothing left to fight (other than the slashers, so I have to make it look like I'm only a tertiary character, or they'll kill me because horror movie.)My second pick is the Aliens, because 4 for 1 stealth fighters is a steal. I'm a little worried that the Predator has his built in nuke, though, so this is going to be a road trip. Good luck everybody else!Edit: After reading /u/Reilic 's educational piece on the wheezing General, I think I've got to pick the same strategy. Dropping the Aliens, picking up Grievous. Not only does he have lightsabers (and may be able to block blaster fire with them) but he has a high powered blaster pistol of his own. Not much out there that can stand up to plasma fire.

[chinese subs] (http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/tGB4I2w7TxE/) are out! Watching now.....  EDIT: another great episode.  [spoilers] (#s "I couldn't figure out who the killer is. I had it down to 2 suspects and both were equally suspicious.  Another amazing performance by Jang Jin. It was funny seeing him play as a Korean American. His English was so broken that the cast teased him about it. And LOL at Hani's reaction at the end. ")
If I register the plates ahead of time and it is a rental how does that not stop the next person that rents that car after I am done with it to run up a tab under my name?
I agree, so it makes more sense to satisfy those consumers that will be relevant in 20 years not those who will be dead and who barely know how to use the technology anyway. You have to appeal to the passionate niches to get a passionate following, not just the general consumer.
Yeah that was also a tad odd. He tried to just completely devalue anything that was against his perspective to the point that it makes it hard to really care about his perspective. It is something in a single sentence just seems like poor word choice but when surrounded with everything else he says makes his perspective kind of useless. 
For any device that uses a single 18650, such as the IPV Mini 2, Sigelei 50W V2 and Mini, etc, using the onboard charging is A-OK. What you want to avoid is using the on-board charging for any device that uses two or more 18650 batteries. When you've got multiple battery cells in a device, both cells have to be charged at an equal rate in order to be charged safely -- this is called load balancing. Most multi-cell devices on the market are bad at load balancing, which can lead to cells being charged unevenly. Best-case scenario this just means one battery is charged sooner than the other, but worst-case scenario this can cause the fuller cell to discharge into the other, causing the cells to overload and catastrophically fail.
I'd choose that one if it had lte support. My provider has been nice to me lately, so I have 16 gb of data a month which I will use till the last spill :).However, the camera, how good is it? I mean the 1520 has a camera that is mind blowing and I don't know it for sure, but I thought the 930 had the same one.And yeah the phone was probably slightly abused, it didn't show phantom touches when I bought it, which is a shame. Otherwise I would have reconsidered....Yeah and to ask more, I actually don't really know, I mean windows phone still is really speedy so that won't be a problem, however the screens dpi, is it bad or is it good enough? I might consider a 3g phone since I don't really play any ingress ( duh android only :/ ) anymore so the fast speed is nice but not really necessary.Thanks for your help already ;)
Man I'm glad my name's not "Ehrmantraut". Not that it's a bad name, pretty bad ass in fact, but I'd probably spell it wrong at some point! Imagine how embarrassing, my own name!
There is such a difference between public sector unions and other unions. If you cant grasp that difference then you shouldn't be commenting on the issue at all. If you are simply unaware of the difference, then take a moment to educate yourself. It will stop you from making terrible comments.
At this bar, your drunk. Perfect, buy a bunch of drinks and  ask for a few some empty shot glasses, see if she'll help you taste test differnt drinks for market research, strictly scientific. Your welcome.
The school.actually has a pretty decent non fear-mongering campaign. They're saying sure it won't kill you but it could still cause some problems which I think is a reasonable claim to make especially for inexperienced college students. But the fatal vision is pretty ridic.
you are allowed to have two accounts, interact between them, but not allowed to bot with them, as far as i knowStreamers do this all the time. Only hurdle i forsee is the ip dual logging issue.
Hey thanks for the reply!  There was a cabelas that went up near where I live and I bought a few depthmaster III there from the bargain cave.  ~100 bones for both of them.  Im thinking of getting a few more depthmasters since i have used them in the past and the reviews are alright.
do footballers never, ever take pay cuts in order to get first team action in a topflight?i'd be really surprised to find out cambiasso is making the most money he ever has at liecester.
'The Moment' chose a form he'd find comforting except, being a Time Lord machine, went the wrong direction and chose a form from his future by accident. Since the next person the Doctor will be around that he's comfortable with is Rose, it chose to appear as Rose.
It's mostly to either cause a fumble (when you squib it bounces of the ground and sometimes it's extremely hard to predict the path) by bouncing off a player, not give a chance to the other team to get setup, or to start the clock with a slow runner so the chances are slimmer that they will run it back for a touchdown.
No dude....just puke all over the other guy. Fight ended everytime.Trust me nobody can come back from the shame. They'll get this look on their face like "OH MY GOD, WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO TO ME?", and then they'll get an angry look, just for a second tho. That's when the disgusted look appears and then they do the "OH FUCK GROSS GET THIS SHIT OFF OF ME" dance and try to shake the puke off. That's when you laugh and inspire everyone around you to laugh them into tears. Trust me dawg I've done some shit.
&gt; just like a lvl 10 guy can't put more than a scratch on a max level character in other gamesIf you're going to compare EVE to WoW you have to acknowledge the fact that a new player can be max level with pretty good raiding gear (-10% or so compared to the high-tier raiders) in less than a month. The fact that you repeatedly stress the difference in timeframes between EVE and other MMOs and then go on to say that EVE has an "end game" doesn't really make any sense.
It's ridiculous, had the heading been "discovered DK windbox tech" it'd be up voted to the moon and analysed meticulously, but instead it was a joke that obviously went over everyone's head and now he's "breaking" rule 1???
If someone is targeting people of another race specifically because of their race, then it's a racially charged attack. How does your common sense spin it so that you can honestly say it's not racist? I'm dismissing your opinion because it's really not a valid opinion. Racism isn't a word with a wavering definition. 
I can honestly say that I don't recognize a single name on this list of guests, apart from a faint recollection of Stiglitz, so I'm pretty interested in this week's discussion.

I hang out in /r/learnprogramming a lot and I see *plenty* of people who "just need help for my final project" and it appears they have learned absolutely nothing in the class at all. Including how to declare variables.
I would reroll it. God-tier imho is aggressive ballistics, range finder, field scout and crowd control. I got CRAZY lucky with my 3rd hammer and got this roll this morning after 8 motes. If you prefer stability over range, I have one with persistence, which REALLY shines those moments when you run across several people at once and need to keep that trigger squeezed. Good luck!
The charge speed goes down as charge level goes up, that's why they advertise the first 60%. See my other comment to learn why.   90%-100% is the slowest part for this reason. 
Actually, I use a Nexus 4 but joined this sub to learn more about the phone before buying it. You still didn't answer what phones you got before to save so much, and actually I'm genuinely curious since I'm considering a new phone. 
&gt; Not winning a championship this year doesn't decrease how great a teammate and how unselfish he is, would it?no. he's playing with house money there. he can only benefit from winning one. just because it's not much weight, doesn't mean it's no weight. and re: malone. well, yeah, malone was the third best player on that laker team, at best. missed games in the playoffs too. duncan's still a big piece of the puzzle for the spurs.

Without opening the whole "why are blacks charged for so many more crimes per-capita than whites" can of worms here, another relevant element that needs to be factored in how many times more likely blacks are to be charged for crimes full stop - ie the percentage of black hate crime charges out of all black criminal charges and the same for whites because blacks get charged for crimes much more often than whites do generally.

227 - Having my first ever level 70 character with a build that I copied from the forums. Sure it wasn't mine, but it gave me ideas on how to go about making my own build. I enjoyed the hell out of the Righteous Fire Marauder for a first character anyway.
&gt; Is everyone in ranked games amazing?No, but they have gotten to level 30, which puts them far above a lot of the population. Using ranked queue as a random distribution is incredibly flawed, which is what that guy was trying to do.
How long have you had your ears pierced? I've had mine pierced about 20 years (I was fairly young and had them pierced with a gun) and had no problem going straight to a 14g. I think it mostly had to do with the fact that I have had mine pierced for a very long time. You could always start with a 16g like suggested. Also stretching should never hurt. When I stretched to a 14g all I felt was a slight pinch and that was it. As for being nauseous,  it's just your nerves. When I first started I was super nervous I would mess up and felt the same way. Good luck on your stretching journey!
I've been off reddit and the internet for the majority of the day after you yelled at me for wanting to spend money :p. It's easier when you don't see all the pretties.

It is dumb. Casual Pint has been doing it as well for close to a year now. Not only did they increase their prices across the board, they added tax as well. Increased everything around 18%.
Yep. I practiced for a couple weeks before the audition with the pieces that I had already learned with my previous teacher, and the audition itself was maybe 15 minutes. I played a little bit of each piece, answered some questions about myself, and then I got the email that I wasn't accepted. Then later that evening, they sent me another email saying that a teacher had opened up a spot in her studio if I was still interested, so that is how I squeaked into a piano minor. I auditioned right before my last three semesters of college, so I really had to get in that semester or else I wouldn't be getting a minor at all, but if you have more leeway, definitely take more time to prepare.Another thing you could do is ask if any of the masters students teach. Depending on their skill level, that might be enough to keep you busy for a while or at least it could help you better prep for an audition.
I find no one trustable by name alone. There are words and actions that can reveal how trustworthy they are within minutes, but names alone are no basis for trust.
What makes you or your friend think he can just go guard or reserves? They have the same standards (which is pretty low btw). He had 2 years to remedy the situation and didn't/couldn't- see ya. We are not civilians, we have standards for a reason and it's really not hard to meet them. I couldn't do more than 15 sit-ups before I joined and it took me one month of doing sit-ups several times a day to get up to 80 a minute. If he truly lived blue he would have passed. And for those who are advising him to get VA disability benefits, you are the problem. What disabilities could a linguist have from being in the Air Force? Take the clearance, training, and the benefits you've earned and make something out of it. Don't fake injuries to get money for life. Fucking people have no integrity nowadays.
To be honest, they're probably a bit less bias than say... a subreddit devoted to the game.A lot of the comments made good points such as 1) Cable as a whole is a shrinking market. 2) The general audience won't have any connection with the game and the viewers who do follow the scene would rather stream it anyway.
In Germany, there are three types of school that someone can go to once they hit a certain age (like 5th grade): Gymnasium, Realschule, Hauptschule. Gymnasium normally leads to college because they are taking college prep like coujrses and finish by taking arbitur which is like their version of ACT/SAT.  Realschule is the next step down and these students typically find a job right after school like an apprenticeship. It is not normal for someone to go to college out of Realschule. Hauptschule is the lowest level and a lot of immigrants are at this level. If you go to hauptschule, you are pretty much going to be doing an apprenticeship out of school or work low paying jobs. People out of hauptschule are generally never going to college. When the time comes to decide who goes where, the student's teacher decides which school a child is capable of going. This decision is discussed with the parents during a meeting.

you must not be an eve player then because her ratios have not gone down (in fact they scale higher now) and the reason why she was picked mid was *because* of her passive. Going into stealth gives you blue-buff amounts of regen and it's uncomfortable for a player to see a champion go in and out of vision."Did she go roam, or is she regenerating mana?" 
AFAIK Epic uses Unreal and Unreal Tournament games as their testing grounds for the Unreal Engine, if it doesn't perform well in those games, they go back and fix it so it does.  I remember reading about how a lot of games using the UE3 right at launch got a boost after UT3 was released because of a huge set of improvements that Epic introduced while developing UT3.  I expect we'll see a UT4 out of the new engine in a year or two (come on give me the weapons from UT'98 GotY and the modes from 2k4 and forget UT2k3 and UT3 ever existed!)
Area 51 got its allure during the 1950's with aircraft testing being done. On-lookers thought it was extraterrestrial life and a government cover-up. The news spread from there, and the rest is kind of, well, history!

I don't know why I get so nervous about it. I'm a SAHM for a number of reasons I guess we both just need to work on being proud of it. I always make excuses and explain in a way why I'm a SAHM. She's only 9 months at this point but maybe I'll become more comfortable with the idea as she gets older. 
*You still are a giddy glorified fan*."Community Hunters" are fans, "established" (whatever that means, whatever you seem to think it means) or otherwise. You're slightly less of a nobody than anyone else in this topic, congratulations. You're still coming across as majorly self-important.
Love the idea but not a fan of the the way their video only focuses exclusively on abusive cops. I get it's the ACLU and all but still not all cops are dicks and their pr campaign could be a little broader than just targeting the popo imo. 
A public service has a lot more aims than efficacy and efficiency. It has the aims of making the manager's life easy, for example, which means keeping low quality staff and not pushing for efficiency if it annoys the staff below them. It has the self interest that means that no manager will ever suggest an idea that makes them redundant and it has the crucial lack of competition which allows all of these things to go unpunished. Where a private company goes bust, a public service gets extra cash to 'rescue' it.Look at East Coast mainline. National express paid £175m a year for the franchise plus the cost of numerous upgrade projects. They couldn't make a profit, and dropped out (to much vitriolic abuse about proftieering and so on).A public company takes over, and pays roughly the same amount (adjusted for inflation) but without paying for upgrades, and is lauded as a huge success.

My wife's brother says that he met Jeff Bridges on a chair lift while skiing Big Sky somewhat recently.

Definitely look in to Hunt the Truth. It's fantastic, much better written than any of the TV style stuff they've been trying to do, and a lot more rewarding for people deep on the canon.I'm from the UK. You?
The "149" is a good catch, though.  What we need to do now is look for a script that calls "148" instead, just like how the UFO script calls 149, and we will find out how to activate this 2nd UFO object.

I think that might be too much credit for the GOP.  Most would let the needle-exchange expire and offer some crass, oversimplified explanation why it's all their fault and now they get the consequences.
Not all countries that are "propped up" by America tend to do very well. Countries like South Korea and Japan were given privileges most countries won't get from the US because the US wanted to establish a cordon sanitaire around communism. Democracy is good but overrated, economic development is required to build a functional democracy.
Ah so your uni must have been closed quite a few days this past week? I've spent a lot of time in Baltimore and even if it is a hellhole it's still sad to see all that business going down there.
Where in that article does it say that they are using a different GC than the one in Core? All they are talking about is that they have different GCs for different tasks. No where does it say that the GC engine is different for CoreCLR. In fact, this article can't even comment on CoreCLR because it's talking about improvement to 4.5, which was *three years* ago. We're now going into .NET 5.0 with Core and Full Framework.
Calgary. They have terrible possession numbers (the last 7 cup winners were won by the teams that have beeon through five since 2010) and have to go through Anaheim and one of Chicago/Minneosta. They're also missing their best defenseman and have a young team. 
You should watch the end part. There's also always some "last words" from the person who got voted off, and sometimes they're fantastic.Also, if you really really don't want to watch that far, you can look on Wikipedia, where the voting history is usually posted.
Hahaha...what? Pimply boys? Claiming sexuality? Sheesh lady...this is movie night...jaded much? I think you are the one taking it to the induction/brain wash level. Not sure how introducing my girlfriend to something I love is so bad. I guess because she loves knitting and she asked me to take a class with her because she wanted me to try it out was a bad idea too. She guided me as I knitted, she corrected some of my mistakes, and it was a blast. Was she inducting me into the world of knitting? Or are two people that love each other taking part in what the over person loves to do? Now she is watching something I love. Were going to open a bottle of wine and watch. I can't wait to share this with her. Maybe she will pop my pimples as a bonus. 
A trans women attracted to men is straight and gay if attracted to other women. Vice versa for trans men. Easiest to look at it this way: trans women are women and trans men are men so their sexuality keeps this in mind. So in this case a trans girl would be gay for being attracted to another girl.

Not true at all, at least where small percentages are concerned.  I use the same dropper in mixing,  and know for certain that 6 drops is 1% in a 10 ml bottle.  If I want something at .33%, 2 drops it is.  I mix the same recipes multiple times, and have yet to notice a significant variation in any fo the batches.FWIW, I determined this by dripping into a 1ml syringe until it reached .5 ml (30 drops), then repeated the process with 2 other liquids to verify that it was consistent.If you are measuring by weight, you are not going to get more accurate then "a drop" anyway.
I only know two Buddhists, one practices Chan, the other Nirichen.  Both read and listen to music.  The only thing they say not to do is: don't cause pain, physical or mental, in your pursuit of enlightenment and knowing.Not to say people of other religions are super diligent in what they should and shouldn't do.  But this is the first I've heard such a statement.  
I could write something up after I finish my exams, but I would suggest looking at the [model here](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?redirect=1&amp;mid=81cf92a3e03098a5cc90be332989df6e). It is the closest to scale model that I found and I used some of the dimensions as a comparison while I was working on my own project.
My polygon experience is the following.  I had been hearing good things about it forever and I started actually visiting about 2 months before GG erupted.  I wasn't overly enthralled with their content so when they flipped the logic switch it was pretty easy to drop them from my RSS app.
I agree.  In fact, I would say Sanders has a *better* chance of winning the White House than Clinton because a lot of people will see her as bringing a lot of baggage, and find some reason or another not to vote for her.  Sanders, on the other hand, has a cleaner history -- plus he has a very clear set of goals he wants to accomplish.  And as you put it, he is dynamic and energizing -- exactly what we need!And hey, good to see another democrat from a red state :)
I remember American rock and roll being exported and emulated by Japan and Europe starting in the 60s.  I don't need to be 50 years old to know that it was most popular in America, and that any backlash it faced (in America) were trivial compared to the backlash rock and roll received in communist nations and the middle east.  
And have that viewpoint reinforced daily by fledgling liberal new media organizations like salon, daily kos, gawker, mother jones, etc, with their constant whataboutism and reiteration of "white people are bad and privileged" messaging. 
I suppose that's a fair point. I myself have never had memory issues with Chrome but then again I have a lot of memory (16GB), and on lower end systems that's definitely a consideration. I myself am not a very tab heavy person (at most I'll have twenty or so, but even then only briefly).
I hope you realize that the source to your link is the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI)  and they're a well known Israeli propaganda organization.

Okay so you already know that you don't want to be in this rut anymore. Seems like you are currently stuck in this vicious cycle. What if you could take small steps towards getting back out there? I'm not saying completely quit smoking but what if you set little goals each day(every couple of days) and only allow yourself to smoke up after you complete the task? It's obvious that you care and that's huge! Also do you have any close friends that could help you with keeping on track...not like hovering over you but just like checking in? Sorry if this is intrusive-I'm new on reddit😄
Huh.  I've never played that game, but have heard it talked about a lot, and have never put that together.  You win a prize for telling me the most fun factoid of the day.
Going to guess:  PHI gets #19 for Bradford.  PHI trades #19, #20, Evan Mathis to Jets for #6.  (OR this could be to CHI for #7 with Bokyin instead).PHI trades #6, 2016 1st, 3rd-round pick, Fletcher Cox, and Mychal Kendricks for #2 overall.
I would like to join as well. I have 1 trigger. I can make it tonight not sure about tomorrow. Will have to check on that.character name khoalaplayer id kumkhoat
Ok this is a weird one for me. I've seen some scary shit. I'm not really a fan of sick shit like saw but whatever. Anyway. For some reason Event horizon is the number one movie I can think about that scares the shit out of me. The isolation. That creepy ship. The message at the beginning. The fucking hopelessness of it all. For some reason. Even tho I know it's ridiculous - that's movie makes me shiver. 
I'm guessing it has to do with:- Allston being a largely transient population so its easy for people to come and go and not get recognized.- This intersection has a long history of buskers, homeless, and gutter punks so it's conducive to that sort of "lawless" crowd- Allston is less policed than many other neighborhoods- It's halfway between the dealer and the buyers?Honestly, I really started noticing these people coming in only about 2-4 years ago.  It's largely coincided with the return of heroin.
A lot of people in here seem to think that dodging out of parries is the only useful dodge but there are plenty of other ways you can utilize dodge. You can use dodge to get out of a 2v1 sandwich, disengage from a fight, manipulate distance in your favor, and to make the opponent miss.I think that the footspeed and dodge(excluding dodge out of parry) is enough for the maa. I'm not a stellar player or anything but I do just fine without dodging out of parries.
&gt;He actually posts Holo this weekoh thank godSounds like a good week im glad ur test went well, i didnt know there was a sexual assault month, you have friends ;PPretty shitty week for me, mom was in baltimore for riots, shes safe but i got myself sick worrying about her ive had a stomach ache and headache ever since tuesday
Yeah, that approach isn't really going to work either. You're basically still saying "GTF over it" which... he can't. That's why it's a phobia. Saying "look at that guy, why can you be like [example]" is basically just going to make people with anxiety have panic attacks and stress themselves right out. Giving someone concrete actions to manage the stress/anxiety in a way that mitigates the reaction is usually more helpful.
See, I can talk to you.  What you're saying makes sense.   It's just the widespread misuse of the concept that makes me avoid it.  a person can't seem to have any sort of discussion with many without shifting definitions coming in to play to muddy and obsuficate the issue.

We'll we're all workin' late so they ordered a few trays.  Brisket, pulled pork, and ribs with sides of biscuits, slaw, &amp; cornbread.  A few sweet, mild and hot sauces to go with it!  So full bleh...so good tho.  We're in CT..so can't imagine it's as good as yours but it surely satisfied a lot of people!
So disappointed when I went online after seeing this thread for the first time, and my pristine Kuruma (I'm not an asshole PVP guy. If I PVP, it's either for Bounty or that fucker deserves it) got fucked by his, seemingly, normal 9mm pistol. Tires, doors, hood, windows, everything got fucked and I was left with a burning wreck.Guess who had to pay the bill for that damage?...

That bites. The chapters near my house actually has a really big science section. Not sure how it compares to the religion section, but at worst I think they're about the same size.

Not falling for what? Are you afraid that there's a conspiracy to make you think that My Little Pony is kind of okay for a kids show? Seems unambitious for a conspiracy.
Mention the honeybadger Alison Tieman getting kicked out of an expo and getting a lifetime ban from the expo orgs, meaning she can no longer promote her comics in a significant amount of conventions. She is a gamer, she was negatively impacted because of gamergate. 
&gt; but then it makes all G2A locks useless as wellSo make two countermeasures: Chaff and flares. The current flares stay the same, while chaff is ESF only and only affects lock on A2A missiles. &gt;Plus, that does nothing to actually fix tomcats. My favorite simple fix is to give them much less ammo, even maxed out.This doesn't solve the air zergs rolling over the continent. Also, I do believe that making tomcats dodgeable via VTOL maneuvers would add some depth to the airgame- we'd have to practice more evasive maneuvers than the reverse maneuver, that's for sure.
I have GTA 5, Advanced Warfare, Fallout 3, FIFA 14, and Modern Warfare 2. There's probably more, but these are the ones that I can remember at the top of my head.
I'm not exactly sure why people are keeping to powers of 2. Possibly because that's how the netcode/game is optimized.And, to be completely honest, the difference between 64 and 128 is already rather small. Increasing the tickrate by 10-20 would be almost negligible for the extra bandwidth and processing power required.
The victims of many serious addictions are gross at first glance but if you were born with different genetics, had a different upbringing or dealt with traumatic experiences then that could easily be you or the people you love. You simply don't have the understanding to be empathetic or your just not someone capable of being empathetic which is what I find disgusting.

Hmm thanks for the advice guys. I just downloaded a PDF that went over the basics of canditos program and it seems pretty promising. Do you guys feel that a good pair of weightlifting shoes would be necessary?
I'd put a sitting area with some potted plants and maybe a small barrel water feature or something. Everyone needs a bit of nature and a couple of potted trees and the sound of trickling water can fool you into feeling like you're out in the woods somewhere - or at least relax you as if you were.Besides, a few potted trees and some water will lower the heat index of all that concrete.Do remember to water the plants, however...
so you had money you were stealing (why else hide cash while declaring a bankruptcy), and then you had your stolen money stolen from you.... Kind of sounds like karma.
Congrats on graduating, hope you have a wonderful graduation :-)Been severely depressed the last week or so, I seem to just drop into it from time to time. I'm trying to decide whether or not to tell my best friend how i feel about her, knowing that if it goes the way I think it will I'll have lost not only a best friend but also everyone else I hang out with. I think she likes me, but idk if it's worth the risk. We're supposed to go see the Avengers tomorrow, we usually go out to movies once or twice a month and at least watch a movie almost every weekend together, but I haven't heard from her since yesterday and I'm afraid she's going to cancel on me like she has before.(Sorry to be down, I just needed to get that off my chest)
I agree. I mean it's a funny gif just by itself but I guess when you think of it as a dude running in a full sprint to get the tent's booty that's what makes it.It's kind of like /r/me_irl. Just the idea that all of the posts are sad people makes it funnier

At the moment I am watching through Awkward, which is terrible and im not at all the target audience but its great. Faking It though holds the title for best shit tv show I've ever seen. 
Yeah seriously, you need that for yourself. Yeah today has been my mental and physical vacation before I break my spirit doing a quantum problem set tonight. My spine actually feels like it can move now, fancy that.Last day of class tomorrowww fuck it all
That's why so many moved to America. Things were SOOOOOOO good in Europe that they decided they needed a challenge. See, back in Russia and Spain and England and so on they were all billionaires. Where's the fun in that ?
&gt; I still don't understand why anyone votes labour these days, after Blair and Brown.There are people up north that will always vote Labour, because their family historically has. It's a great system when people vote against their interests because of generational pressure. /s
I cant name them off the top of my head but i think some kooky religious nut made this big article about how Harry Potter was pro-gay or wanted to make kids gay. While its bull crap the examples thrown out there are interesting- one I can name was that Harry was brought out to a secret place hidden from society known as Diagon Alley- a.k.a not straight... I dunno. Its funny though!

&gt;When I first read this, it gave me the impression you were *not* an atheistI'm not. Is that a problem or do I still have rights?&gt;When you said this in the first comment, it didn't seem like sarcasm (still doesn't).It's not sarcasm. Am I allowed to disagree with atheism?&gt;My argument was based on that passage, since it appeared that you said that most, if not all, atheists actively search for this sort of content, when the reality most don't care, they just don't see the point of religion.That's your opinion.&gt;This led me to believing you were a neckbeard.That's your zealotry.
No, it really [doesn't](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2VhSXJG3C4&amp;t=13m0s).As with any other cat, if it is knocked back *during its attack animation* it will restart its attack, but if it knocked back at any other point (during its attack cooldown period) it will not automatically reset (go right into) its attack. Yukimura, on the other hand, will.
I had a teacher in highschool that broke it into 10% bins and made it my goal to get 1 in each bin, cept 2 for the 100% bin. The teacher was so pissed about my abuse of the system she gave everyone in the class an extra 'assignment' after the final exam that the whole class got 0 on just to screw me. Had to get the principal to undo the whole thing and i believe they just threw a 10% penalty on me for being a jackass.Not worth it btw. Way harder to accurately get into each bin since the class only had 11 items there was no margin for error.
to be more specific, it is between 5-9 years to be considered to be fully caught up, mind you I am sure there are those who have above average abilities and do this faster.From what I am reading if you are a child who already has exposure to our alphabet, you are at a head start and if you have been formally educated(in your first language before moving), are a bright student, you will also be better off towards grasping English at a faster rate. If you have never been educated to read and write in your first language a student tends to  need extra help. They also advise families to speak in their native languages in the home. I wish I was bilingual 
I'm not distracted as often, more focused on the present when I want to be, I don't worry as much, I'm more social, and I enjoy the small things more. Along with the aforementioned changes to my mentality, I've noticed some pretty decent gains, though I didn't lift before quitting and haven't been trying to bulk for too long. Last I checked I was up about 6 pounds from my starting weight. I'm gonna be trying a bit more seriously to gain since I had a fever today, probably lost weight, or at least didn't gain any. And my fashion sense has improved a lot since starting my journey. 
Doesn't work the other way for wealthy people. Right wing policies may be best for them economically, but they may recognize the underlying inequality and be motivated by moral and equitable grounds.I'm well off, but I'm also left wing. Because it's *fair*.
The Marcus Mariota drama is so fascinating, Eagles offering two first a third and three good players : Cox, Boykin, others. Chip Kelly will make tonight interesting, this much I know. Even if he doesn't get MM I see him doing some crazy shit, trading players etc...
I think either Charles or Bethany pushed her off the roof or was there when she fell. The Jenna Thing was after her death because it was Jenna's mom who married Toby's dad and I think it was implied that one of the reasons Toby was so sour was because his dad married so soon after they either split up or she died
I've been hooked to this game for the past few months so most of my free time that I don't spend on reading is dumped into either playing this game or recently, to this subreddit :D
I generally agree with your sentiment, but your anecdote does seem out of place. As a teen, were you really asking person person to make you great, or instead, were you just asking for helpful advice and tips? I have advice to ambitious youngsters would be   1) Know who your personal heroes are and articulate why,   2) to lots of people who have 'done it', especially different people with conflicting stories of 'how to get there',  3) Be aware of self-native bias when you listen to their tails,   4) finally, understand correlation v causation. Also, PLEASE get yourself a camera stabilizer when you talk to the camera. Or motion track the image in post. Red Giant has some great plug ins to FCPX that help. http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Flycam-Hd-3000-Steadicam-/321740738311?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_15&amp;hash=item4ae93e0f07
That's assault - she was throughing objects *at him*.  At that moment he is 100% justified in using force to defend himself.  He can get fired, yes, but he cannot get charged with assault.
Is it confirmed that the last episode this season is the music video? lowkey I'd be bummed if it was, even if it meant breaking a traditionI'm still secretly hoping that it's a serious challenge with a winner and a defined bottom two though because I don't like the music video challenge as it is either! Especially last season with the producers using the episode to kick out a queen (Darienne) for free, so it's not even like an actual showdown between the top three
Unfortunately that just doesn't make sense. There has literally never been a law passed or repealed that wasn't supported at least implicitly by the majority. Civil rights can only improve for minorities if the majority wants them to. It's just a necessary condition for democratic society to function. How else would it work? Who gets to decide what laws should be legislated if not the majority? To argue your point, you have to argue that democracy is fundamentally flawed. Otherwise, we can talk about the morality of nudity and what society might look like if it was allowed, but that's a whole different thing than saying it should be legal. Sure, in a completely different set of circumstances it may be justifiable, but not in the world we live in currently.
I vaguely recall a bit in the books, can't remember which one, where it describes the ratio of the Monolith dimensions as 1:4:9 but also continues the sequence for higher dimensions.
 A chick in one of my classes said "I don't believe because I don't understand how monkeys could just decide to walk on two legs and lose all their hair.
Other teams haven't got shit on by nV. When I mean shit on, I mean as in how NiP plays against them where they look like C9. TSM has recently been dominant in EU for the past month online and lan. Fnatic is great but you can tell they are in a slump from their break. 
She basically breaks the game, or in my experience at least. She only has limited use, but she levels up and kills so quickly that it really isn't even an issue. An angelic robe would be nice to save for her, because her HP is a bit of an issue, though it's not necessarily 100% required. Did I mention that with a crit she OHKOs the last boss?She's also cute and has great paired endings.
I'd love to see them do a heist based comic run with them, in particular. I mean, its great seeing them go up against Flash, but their powers are so versatile, it would be fantastic to see them utilise them in a multi-part comic that doesn't just involve them fighting heroes. Maybe breaking into Bell-Reve?
They use it. The real question is, why they create addicts, then wonder why they are addicted. I sent 10 90 bottles of Hydro to a Kinny's Drugs from my Dads closet. He could have been killed for that nasty stash. THEN they put him on Oxy..... Ughhh...
As an English teacher, it means so much that Vice finally shed some light on my pain, however Im a little disappointed they didnt ask me to present the report.
For the same reason we hold certain athletes like Messi to some high-degree of artistry. The point is to put the ball in the net, lots of players put the ball in the net, but he does it *beautifully*.There's nothing wrong w/ a campy action scifi action flick, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate a rare achievement like Verhoeven's for being something rare and special. A lot more people went to see Independence Day, more money was made. People were entertained, but Starship Troopers did something special and it's not a problem for folks to acknowledge that.

Gonna make the suggestion to switch $ and attributes. It will allow you to stock up on some more ware. Effectivly picking up the lost attributes from the swap in the progress. Things like a synaptic booster and smartlink will do wonders for you. It would also let you grab a munch of other utlity items, like a vehicle. Mechanically i dont see much illegal, sub optimal yeah. But outside your qualities being overspent not being illegal. You can onky have 25 pts of positive or negative qualities. You are currently rocking 36 if my napkin math is correctIf you could sort the licenses into the attached sins that woukd be helpful.

Shes getting flack for many reasons that black people understand...but also because she got her ass all over television for 15 seconds of fame.  Disgusting bitch.
Had a similar game in twisted treeline hexakill.....We won 98kills to 103. If I remember right. It was almost 2 hours long.Long story short, the pushed to our base slowly over a hard fought game. I respawned in time to lux ult a triple kill and save base, then get a double a little too long after to get my penta as we pushed them off. and slowly, but surely pushed to their base ftw. Hands down the longest most intense game I've ever played. 
YESSSSS finally another hoarder of shining pokemon. I have a feeling that we are contributing to the recently rapid rise in prices for the shining cards.
It is difficult to imagine what an artificial super intelligence would do living alongside of the human race. Would they even care about us at all? I imagine that this would be like us having pet dogs and teaching them to be obedient, but why go through the trouble of teaching our species to learn physics, math, and writing?Maybe they would like to provide the best possible living arrangement for us and install some form of simulation where we can live in peace with other life forms like us because that is what makes our species the happiest. What if they determine that humanity is happiest when there are still discoveries and advancements to be made, thus providing hope to each and every one of our existences. This might result in them lovingly putting us in a place where we can learn and discover all the mysteries of the universe all over again, another earth perhaps.Guess it wouldn't be the worst thing ever.. 
0 to 3 easy? Bah! Lies! That was the worst. But once they clear the 4th trimester it gets better. 5 months is pretty cool. A human starts to immerge from the crying floppy sleep sucker. Just hang in there.  We never did schedule but we do time based routine. That helps, they like routines. 
Your abs are small muscles by comparison to everything else, they are still there and will appear as your body fat decreases. I wouldn't spend much time focusing on ab work directly as there are better exercises you can do for strength and calorie burning than crunches. Stick with the diet and keep working out and your abs will show up when your body fat percentage is low.
DANG YOU PGI... I told myself NO NO MORE not until some changes to maps and better yet changes to UI... But the Mauler... Would just need the Bushwacker and Axeman to complete the Battletech Cartoon collection lol....
See thats the thing, I can not reproduce the issue on demand, it seems to be when my laptop is under heavy load (adding support to your initial idea of the ram) but then again it might just be coincidental as I always have several things open and it works fine. So I am still torn. But since I have the Retina Macbook the RAM is soldered onto the MB so I can not simply remove it myself. 
Look up how your state handles primary elections. Those are the first hurdle, they decide who gets the support of the democratic party. Tell your friends about him, donate some money, consider volunteering in his campaign. Then vote for him for president.
Oh, I understand now. Thanks for the clarification. Also, I just noticed now that the shield on the subreddit banner is downright breaking the rules. Metal on metal is a no-no. They should probably fix that!

Well, your argument is wrong. Jesus says in the bible that not one iota or jot of the old laws is invalid. There are many things the bible specifically prohibits that you do not bother yourself with. One of the  most egregious examples is from the New Testament, words attributed to Jesus himself, where he speaks out against divorce. Most Christians have no trouble at all with divorce. But because they are massive hypocrites and because their religion has warped any sense of morality they may have possessed, they do rail against equal rights for gay people. Out of bigotry. Out of hate. They then pretend that they are not being immoral because they lyingly claim to follow the bible.And I am supposed to respect these Pharisees? 
Dude, the guy had a back injury that no one knew he would recover from. Don't sit here and tell me how it was "the best thing for both parties if he renewed". All of this is assumptions from your point of view.Furthermore, him renewing for an even more extended period would still up his price further. So I still consider it a shitty move by him. 
Satire is explicitly protected by US laws. It's a little easier to make fun of a public figure and get away with it, but there's nothing preventing satire of non-public figures.
Hmmm I can't think of any puns that relate to the number 26. There's one awful joke though: What's the best thing about having sex with twenty six year olds? There's twenty of them (please don't hate me, I didn't come up with that joke)
Honestly just get whatever cheap Whey protein you can, they are all essentially the same. If your in the USA check out optimum nutrition or bodybuilding.com's own line. They're generally quite cheap. I don't personally suggest to most people to use protein powder till protein requirements become difficult to adhere to with solid food. For routines I'd suggest you check out Stronglifts 5x5 or Starting Strength. You can also handcraft your own later, but that requires you know how programming works and your own needs.

New England is one of the more expensive areas of the country, so pay is higher there too. If you can't crack $100k with a master's there, you're gonna have a hard time.But remember, it's all about the degree. There are plenty of STEM bachelors' that are going to outpay plenty of non-STEM masters'.
Wait, hold on. Why should pedophiles not be accepted for who they are because pedophilia is a mental illness, but transsexuals should despite that gender dysphoria is a mental illness too?
How interesting! I'm planning to move to Nashville by the end of this year...so if he's not already adopted by then, I might go look for him. My car's a 94 though, so it's probably a little more cramped in the backseat :(
I'm torn on Lightning Berserker too, it's a solid one drop but I also run dragon mantle for the card draw and prowess/heroic triggers on the swifty and crusader so it very rarely gets pumped for more damage as I don't have any left over mana.Edit: Also, dropping a hammerhand on a swiftspear turn 2 is a great feelgood play
It was absolutely their intention. In 2005 they already saw Blackberries, Windows Mobile, etc. that were gaining a foothold. Android originally was closer to those platforms than to its current incarnation. What was on the initial Android alphas? A full load of Google services, and Google Sign-in for everything. Data was already their #1 business. To think they didn't do it for that is absurd. As much as I love Google, they're in it for collecting data.They only OS's for smartphones were Blackberry (proprietary), Windows Mobile, and Symbian. Yes, it was kind of annoying to support both. But, the purpose of Android wasn't to unify development. The purpose was to make sure Google was the core of it.They didn't envision Play Services, but they did envision being the center of where everything you did took place. That was demo'd first thing.
Don't try to prove it is a myth, offer them a way to solve the problem: male tax. Every year government calculates what the current wage gap is and taxes men more and women less accordingly so that wages even out. This is an obvious solution to the problem.
&gt; Especially when they got a booth at a trade show.? We never got a booth at a trade show. Not sure where you got this info from! The only time we ever attended anything was at a fan convention (Canterlot Gardens, not a trade show) where we ran a casual tournament and had a panel where people asked us stuff about the project. No booth, not selling anything. We at no point ever during development asked anyone to promote us, asked anyone to interview us or advertise us. We accepted interviews and invites to things we thought would be fun. It was far more attention than we ever thought we would have gotten, but either way we thought we may as well keep working on it until we're forced not to (then we were forced not to). In a way I personally take it as a compliment on the quality. Actually I take Lauren Faust coming to work with us  as a pretty good compliment. 
Lubbock would be two hours out of the way, so definitely Thompson park, Amarillo instead. Baca park in Albuquerque is great, as is Roosevelt in Abq, but Roosevelt is congested and I got kinda confused playing there without a map. But it is nice.
&gt; She rubbed almost everyone the wrong way during the season, why should Will be any different.It's pretty clear in her ponderosa video that this is just something she does, too.  Jenn and Hali were both kinda talking shit about her in her own ponderosa video.I am absolutely not saying she deserved any sort of abuse for being an annoying personality or anything, just that it is something that helps to understand the situation a little better.

You're right, you can only ship to the traveling merchants in the trade depot. A vendor may only come 2-3 times a week. As you unlock more vendors, shipping becomes more regular.
No, he graded out 24th out of 79 guards without including his final 2 games, which he scored highly."Despite the poor start, Boone’s PBE has improved to 97.0%, 24th out of 79 qualifying guards."That is through Dec 13th.  Not in the final 7 games.  He graded out 24th for  the entire season at that point, which again does not include the final 2 games he played in.  The link I referenced is dated Dec 26.Learn to read the numbers.
I thought it was someone else. Told everyone watching with me and they were like, what? That's stupid. I bet my friend dinner that it wasn't Diggle. And then I was right and they couldn't believe it. Free dinner!
Yeeees. Now you are twice as Gryffindor as anyone else! xDNo. But not just one of the mods can access the Sorting Hat account and sometimes people who got already sorted are still in the inbox of another mod. 
This will always be a possibility.In 1998 A&amp;M knocked a much better KState team out of the NCG.  And it happened a few other times as well just in the Big12.It is always a possibility.  Right now, a Big12 team will almost have to go undefeated to be a lock into the playoffs. However, the problem (in this scenario) comes with an 11-1 TCU team not having a final quality opponent to play and getting leapfrogged on the last week by a team that won a CCG.  This is the problem with the Big12 scenario in my opinion: You play less games overall and don't have a final week boost going into the last rankings.Sometimes it will work, but it puts the Big12 teams at an immediate disadvantage.
I Identify a lot of my story on that.  I pulled away a little bit because I was afraid of the LDR since I was moving to another country and that fear came right at me, but much stronger.I cannot say anything else than the obvious: Don't break NC. If she really wants you, she has to realize that on her own. There is no way of convincing her now, her mind is already made.I wish I never pulled away, and it hurts so much now. I know how you feel.

The action is SO smooth. Plus it has a rotating bolt, like an AR. Nice trigger too. I have the 12g with a long smooth barrel and a short, rifled slug barrel (can't recall exact sizes off the top of my head.)
Take what you're hearing here with several grains of salt - despite what the Solas obsessives around here insist, his importance to the plot isn't really underscored by his romance much more than it is by his conversations as a friend.Not to say it doesn't figure into it at *all*, but it's not the holy grail of characterization some people seem to be trying to make it out to be
Sometimes when on a nature hike, I get tired of carrying my penis around so I leave it on the trail and pick it up on my way back. One time an animal or person stole it so I attached a squirrel tail to my groin. Found my penis a year later in a Wendy's drive thru. 0/10 would not recommend a sex life with a squirrel tail as genitalia. 
Yea, $31.5 mil of his $126.7 mil contract has already been paid out.The remaining $94.2 million is chump change. http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/chicago-bears/jay-cutler/
It's just a broad "stick your finger in the wind measure". It doesn't say if a film is good or bad or if it's particular feminist.What it does say is that all things being equal, a film should have a diversity of gender and on average films are as likely to have two women discussing something other than a man as a film is likely to have two men discussing something other than a woman.The fact that films so frequently fail the Bechdel test, to me, is an indicator of inequality of gender.

Is this for Luminato in Toronto? As long as you pick the correct wireless system to work with, you should be fine. Regardless the receivers should be travelling behind with the same team that is broadcasting the signal for streaming so you're only transmitting a very short distance.  Location audio does wireless on location all the time with battery operated receivers. Completely doable especially if you don't need a lot of channels. As for transmitting a mixed down signal across the city to a broadcast room somewhere, either via satelite hook up or via lte cell signal using whatever the video crew is doing.  
You can debate, but it is not old and tired. There are very definite issues with stale prose and word choices, and there are issues with overall pacing that you do not find in his first three books, where GRRM is at his best in both creating a world and relentlessly pushing through thrilling plotlines.EDIT: I also really dislike the idea that "arguing about opinions" is pointless. With proper support, you can change the mind of someone who is somewhat open minded, or in a more public setting like this, you can at least convince an audience to believe you more.
Have patience dear presser, the glorious Zero Day will come. We, the grey faction, grow strength with every color flair purged. We do not feel sadness or regret through the purge, as they are the wet stone that hones our mighty blade. Do not forget that grey is the color of steel, and steel is our resolve!
Woah now. Let's see how his handling translates throughout the rest of his career. He's a wizard in every facet of the game, but best ball handler...ever? This is disrespect to white-chocolate.
This is nothing but a lame file hash check.And it takes the data from the loaded modules list, so I could delete (fill with junk) my entry, manually map the DLL, or use a hash changer (or change it myself) and done, bypassed in no time.If they want to stop cheaters they'll have to try harder.
I mean I'm an attorney and I'm only making so little for about a year, then my contract mandates a significant increase, so I'm not really worry about the future of my salary.
I have, actually. On Ting anyway. In the Ting APN, I set the APN type from mms to default,mms and the protocol and roaming protocol from IPv4/IPv6 to IPv4. I don't know which one actually fixed it (probably the first one), but that's what the fixes for 4.4 had and it's been working for the most part. Data still feels a bit dodgier than CM11, but toggling airplane mode usually fixes it.
I always find it funny when mathematicans try to argue how ridiculous that thought is while we do have imaginary numbers, are calculating in infinite dimensions or do use the concept of n+1. It's not like we're not having 1/infinity or after-infinity because it's so absurd or ridiculous - The concept is not any weirder than squareroots of negative numbers. If there was a reason to have after-infinity, all we would have to do is to define it, like we defined imaginary numbers that sure as hell will never be found in our empiric world. We don't have after-infinity because mathematic conventions say that it doesn't exist, because we don't need it and because it's not part of the mathematical system that has evolved over the times. Yes, the concept of something "after infinity" can only ever be contemplated in a theoretical concept, but no, that's not the reason why it doesn't exist in math.
If that's true, that's awesome and you are awesome.  The commercial always kind of made me smile every time I came back to town and saw it.  It was clearly cheesy and low budget, but it had a certain sort of charm to it.I could swear I saw it on TV well after 1998 though.  I know the Garland Theater has played it for the early showings for years too, though.
Yes, it's just that I feel like I've never really gotten involved.... done anything.... or just chat with anyone here...... It;s been like I've been aside myself on an island... watching everything go by....
There are different traits you need to be born with to do (probably) anything at the highest level. Do you think anyone can be a chess grandmaster if they just play the game a lot and study? Of course not.
My dermatology needs are different than yours "severe psoriasis" but I get excellent long term treatment from Dr. Phoebe Rich and Dr. Jill Moore at Oregon Dermatology and research center. Dr Rich seems to be doing more teaching and research lately but Dr Moore is awesome. I have heard good things about ohsu dermatology but no personal experience.

It wouldn't be that useful. I really can't think of any other actions that only target devices besides control device, which I guess could free form some penalties on the other Decker by turning off their fans or something.
I think I see the problem now. You don't understand that the person leveraging long isn't necessarily holding all their trading capital in bitcoin. Because if that trader were, then even the 5% leveraged long trader would also be 95% non-leveraged long simply by holding Bitcoin.
There's another good point.  You may want to read [Acts 10] to see where God "changed his mind" with regards to the law.  It's too long of a story for me to briefly tell here.

Wow, that's crazy. Are you buying mostly clearance items then? Because by my calculations Amazon is going to be taking a ~20% for the sale, plus another ~20% for FBA. So if you're looking to earn a 20% profit margin yourself, you'd better be sourcing everything for at least 60% off what it sells for on Amazon.
It's no weirder than the lady that stood behind you taking a picture of you taking a picture of your bus driver hugging a teddy bear.  No worries mate.
Captain FalconOut of BoxIt's the only amiibo that I purchased, since it's the only one that I wanted. But my cousin came over from Guyana and  thought it would be a good idea to throw it into the fireplace (along with some of my prized pokemon cards.) It is now completely destroyed, and I refuse to buy a second one, especially when I would have to pay wayyy over MSRP.
&gt;For now, we recommend using Messenger as your default messaging app.Sounds like they are just doing system level message grabbing like CM Voice+.  The frequency that group MMS is mentioned makes me think it will be improved in Hangouts at some point.
Depends how you define dangerous. Both of the fighters are coherent after 15 years of boxing, but a running back has a three year career and linemen get severe brain damage from headbutting each other at the start of every play

Are shock pads worth it? I have a Globe Geminon and am planning a long ride/camping thing over some potentially cracked roads, and want to be as safe as possible. 
Lord Grafton approached Mero as he passed under the shadow of the Seastone tower. Alone but for Anguy Stone, captain of his guard, who kept his respectful distance, Gerold slowed his pace as he reached Mero and said, "Lord Baelish, it is a pleasure to have you as my guest, despite the circumstances. I hope you can forgive the air of chaos and melancholy, but it seems unavoidable when so many lords arrive all at once for such a somber occasion."
No. To carry on the above example, lets assume I lend out the $90 on a five year basis, 5.36% interest. One year into the deal, I am paid. Going with 5.36% so that way the borrower is paying me back $21 a year. There's a lot of rounding going on here but here is what it looks like for the most part.Account | Debit | Credit---|---|----Cash | 21 | Interest Revenue |  | 5Note Receivable | | 16The $5 in revenue isn't created, but comes from the borrower. If you're talking about the person saving their money in the bank, it works on more or less the same principle. Lets say 2% interest a year on deposits.Account | Debit | Credit---|---|----Deposit | 2 | Interest Revenue |  | 2There's no currency being created here, but there is credit created. The bank doesn't "literally" create currency anywhere in the process. 
Do you have a source for season 3? Me and the Mrs are currently halfway through season 1 so we would like to watch season 3 probably in the next month. Seems a bit strange that season 3 hasn't been added yet. 
Shes getting flack for many reasons that black people understand...but also because she got her ass all over television for 15 seconds of fame.  Disgusting bitch.
Well, since Chrono Trigger is my favorite of all time, how about my second: FF3? (Or FF6, as some people choose to call it.)  It's also an SNES game.First game (one of the only games, come to think of it) that ever made me bawl like a baby.  The story is amazing, the characters are loveable and unique, the villain is pure evil, and the sprites themselves tend to be pretty cute with expressions and whatnot.edit: Oh, how could I forget - if you wanna get kinda weird, check out Earthbound (also SNES; I'm old).  That game is like one long fever dream, but it's absolutely dripping with memorable charm.
my beard is more lumberjack than hipster.  Lumberjack is the 'redneck' equivalent of the pacNW.  If i were to walk into a hipster dance club and start talking at all the skinny boys with pretty, light hair beards that accentuate their facial features, they would quickly relocate away from me.  Trust me, one of my roomates is a pretty boy hipster.  He spends an hour primping to make his beard look just right way.  Spends more time on beard than his hair.
At least once or twice a flight for me! On FAA safety audits a few years back they determined that crews average about 5 mistakes per flight. Obviously most are minor and you have a second pilot there to catch the mistakes so they hopefully don't amount to much. 
I don't have a lot of advice other than what everyone says that she needs to be separated from Monica and needs intense therapy, but I just wanted to say that I'm, not necessarily excited, but just think 'finally!" of a "big+little" relationship not going from 0-"omg I looove you" really quick. I always found it weird how much my high school classmates gush about their new bigs or littles and how much they adore them when they met them literally a couple of months prior. I'm not bashing sororities or anything, I think they're fine if that's your thing, but to me it's just bizarre and a little hard to believe that two people who were strangers can really love each other that quickly. I'm not saying go psycho-obsessive, but I always wondered what happens if the designated big and littles just don't click. Do they get different ones? Or is there like "research" done on the new members to see who gets to be their big? I've just always wondered since I started college.
Yes defiantly.  Don't like the phrase love at first sight, but it was sort of a love in the first 5 minutes sort of thing.  I was afraid I was feeling over the top and obsessive after the first date but luckily he felt the exact same same way.  It was like all the love songs that had pissed me off in my frustrating youth made absolute perfect sense, he lights up all the reward centers in my brain and forces me to be be happy.  All I want to do is be with him all the time and vice versa, there hasn't been a single day I haven't seen him since the day we met.  Hope to get married if it's ever legal.
&gt;How long has it been since I've done suspension bushings? Hmmmmm, might not hurt while I'm at it.That's exactly what led to me replacing every single bushing in the rear end of my E36. That includes subframe and diff mount. I think it started with a bad wheel bearing and just spiralled out of control. The look on my friend's face when he came over was priceless; subframe, diff, control/trailing arms and bolts scattered all over the place with only a pair of ebrake cables hanging off the car.
Thanks guys, I told someone and they loved my idea but I guess ots good that I got second opinions. So I should just sorta mix your advice together right?
Awesome. Well I think I have a better design now that uses smaller engines. Those big things were overkill but I didn't have the smaller radial engines yet and I really had no concept of how to build my lander right-side up

It's very very rare to need as much as one week. Added onto that, if their coaches believe there will be a problem, they should already be adapting their sleep schedule beforehand. 
That whole point is refuted with jailbreaks. A jailbroken ios device can do everything an android can, but will also crash a bit more often as an android would. Another commenter said something about looking into Nexus phones and forgetting Samsung so I'm going to do that. 
There are actual watches that work like that.  They're called [automatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_watch) and there's a pendulum that moves when you shake it that winds the watch for you.

A friend of mine from high school lives a couple of miles from this church. He says it's a small church with older members. They've regularly got signs like this out, against gay marriage and abortions and the like. He and his husband have fun making fun of them. 
I would LOVE it!!Can you do full CNC cutting as well? I know it wouldn't be free (or even cheap), but I do have an idea I want. Getting it past the wife is another story but.... 
Having viewed many of my old faves on the big screen (I was too young to see them in the theater when they came out) he's got a point. It *is* a different perspective, the film's atmosphere plays out a bit differently and you notice things you'd never seen before. I managed to tense up during a showing of Alien even though I'd seen it a hundred times at home.It's just unfortunate that the moviegoing masses have no sense of decorum any more, and that the lack of awareness (or lack of giving a shit about anybody else) translates across all age groups. I've had a row of seniors who wouldn't shut up, i've had teenagers fucking around on their phones and people in their 30s trying to pick fights because someone didn't sit down fast enough *before* the lights had even gone down for the previews.I find the more expensive VIP theaters seem to not have these problems and if you go on cheap night it's the same as a regular movie, cost wise.
Les doubleurs québécois sont vraiment fantastiques et je suis toujours impressionné par leurs efforts au niveau des jeux de mots et des éléments musicaux comme celui-ci.
I see your point. If I really want to be competitive then I'm not doing myself any favors by limiting what I'm willing to fly just because somebody else has won with it. I just love the idea of winning with a list that is kinda unusual -- like Dom's 2014 Galactic Cup list (3 OGPs and Fel) or Rick's 2014 U.S. Nationals list (Whisper, Fel and Yorr). But the reality is that I am probably not able to play enough to develop, master and win tournaments with a particularly unique list. So I should consider embracing the archetypes with demonstrated effectiveness. Thanks for the comment. 
"Quite," responded Ludwig, his face turning bulldog-like. He looked up then, changing the subject - somewhat. "Erebos is...?" He really needed to write a list down--tomorrow, maybe.
I had a similar experience watching myself die while meditating but it did not bring out great compassion. Just that I need to mentally prepare myself for this moment through the practice (which can be seen as compassionate towards others since the practice benefits everyone). I think for me, personally, I did not feel great compassion for others because I know that I will never experience others around my crying or being sorrowful or upset. The reason for this is because it is an illusion/delusion, my mind creates these people. I don't know what they will *really* experience plus it won't ever exist for me anyways. 
lol DSotM, worst Beatles record, Rumours, Chicago, NASA pillow, 2001 soundtrack, fucking Black Keys, Album of the Year 2009, Random Access Memories, Arctic Monkies, Alan Parsons, Who, Steven Miller...  for the love of GOD don't tell me that's the white album... the wall is hilarious.  Good post.Edit: Surprised there is no Flaming Lips or Tame Impala.
&gt;Don't care about k/dOr do.Most of the player base is really bad at the game, so they circle jerk each other off about how stats don't matter.If you want to do that, go right ahead. If you don't, don't let them bully you into their way of thinking.If you want to care about your stats, do so, if you don't, don't.
The way I understand it, if you are with Wind you can pay an extra $10 per month to extend your service to all of the US. That actually might be even better than their Canadian plan... If it actually works the way they have made me think it does it'd be the perfect thing.
Experts aren't always right.For one LAN event, one particular one said "Fnatic vs Penta should be 66/33" or something insane like that when the odds were 80/20. Fnatic crushed Penta, as expected.
I just tell them it's to go, pay for it, then eat there anyways. Especially with how many people eat their during their lunch break, I think the server thing is profoundly stupid.Quite literally: Ain't nobody got time for that.
This shouldn't have made my day, but it did.The Lazarus Pit must seriously be getting to Ra's' head, because that man is full-on nuts if he doesn't think Nyssa will behead Oliver in his sleep.
The wings are different top and bottom, so I wasn't sure quite what to do about that.    [Lines](http://i.imgur.com/UGOjv6O.jpg)    [Attempt at coloring](http://i.imgur.com/Wo2bwTd.jpg)
every shiva i've done the DPS always get behind shiva because raid awareness and so the tank doesn't get extra stacks. (keep in mind this is for solo tanking which I think is the standard now anyway)I have been in parties where people bitched if the tank didn't turn her around though but it's easier on both tank &amp; healers for the DPS to pull their heads out of their ass and actually get behind shiva. you have so much time to see her sit there getting into position and start aiming her bow that if you don't move its your own fault in my opinion.
It's not his damn business or right to bitch on Oliver to be saving the city in his own way, and Oliver practically handed Laurel to Tommy as an adult in the beginning of the season. He and Laurel slept ONCE, and that was because he was so whiny and paranoid that drove her away.
Because he's made to duel and push. Generally top lanes are pushers while junglers have to roam around and commit to ganks and teamfights. Aatrox can teamfight moderately well, but he's not as tanky as the top picks. However, Aatrox can push down an inhib turret and the inhib behind it while the rest of the enemy team tries to teamfight.
When you use `$('.foo')`, you get one of those.The `this` in jQuery event handlers is a regular element. If you want to turn it into a jQuery thingy, you just have to pass it to the `$` function.So, if it's a regular element, `$(element)` will do the trick.I highly recommend to learn how to use the dev tools. In the debugger, you can easily inspect elements. There are videos on YouTube which explain how to use it. Just search for "chrome dev tools" (or "firebug") and you should find some.
There have been plenty of AAA games that have had their entire development cycle be less than 5 years made by studios that have less revenue than mojang, and they are immensely more complicated than adding a few features to minecraft and fixing some bugs.  Mojang has heaps of money, it's time they start hiring more people and putting out more than tiny feature updates and a few bug fixes every few months. 5 years and still no final word on the MOST ASKED FOR FEATURE THAT THEY PROMISED is unacceptable.
Doesnt seem very worth it at all as a first major item on NP. He wouldnt have any other item that could benefit off the cd reduction, his skills have relatively low CD + only ult can take advantage of the spell vamp. Would take you what? 20-25ish minutes of pure farming without deaths? I'd rather build up some early ganking items or something first.I really do not see the point in getting it unless you're a utility NP, but even then, you're bound to get it as a lategame item.Edit: not to mention heavy farming is pretty ineffective in this patch. Might even take you 30+minutes if you dont participate in teamfights so i'd rather he build something that enables him to partake in fights early. 
The defacto currency is going to end up being resources in stacks. They've said in an interview that they are planning on making resource stacking possible in inventory to allow for this. It will essentially be the same as gold except that it will have a use outside of just purchasing power in game. 
Hopefully soon it'll have a new paint job. Despite being told to not do so, I'm going to rattle can it satin black or flat desert tan. Haven't decided which yet. I plan on buying a Comanche this summer, so I might paint the XJ satin black and paint the Comanche flat desert tan if it needs paint (which it probably will).
Get a tiny house, min wage job, explore the country. Hike, ski, bicycle, read, learn on your own. Small house= more opportunity to experience life instead of slaving away. No mortgage. No bills or minimum bills. I want to try it someday soon but im stuck on a bloody island haha
I don't either, but people will fight tooth and nail to praise console. I honestly can't stand it anymore, in comparison to pc. The last game I bought for console, probably the last game I will ever buy for console, was bloodborne. Which is fantastic.
Because you talk and talk and talk and talk, but you never have anything to say. And when you do have something to say, you don't give me enough time to think about it. 
I can imagine that there are quite a number of forces that can work to trigger earthquakes, it's not necessarily a matter of ruling any out, especially in regards to "tidal forces". But as far as picking the major players, I'd be inclined to take the Sun, Earth and planetary alignments into consideration, not for gravitational reasons as much as the less widely understand but possibly quite potent electro-magnetic influences.
From what I've gathered, the drive uses electricity to function. That's why they're talking about using nuclear generators to power the device. So I don't really see any energy production possibilities.
Every year I tell myself I'm going to watch the entire first round, and every year I give up trying to listen to some idiots talking for 9 minutes before every pick.
Veo que no sigues las enseñanzas de nuestro amado maestro Monedero, el habla con Fernando Berlín, de Bondad, Amor, Amistad, y de coger distancia con el sórdido mundo de la política.

&gt;It's more that you're reblogging something solely trying to call attention to yourself and create the illusion that you're part of AH. I thought it was the part where his goal is to put out a video a day and his argument is that RT is making too much content.
I don't agree that there would be an increase in rape and sexual assault, and even if I did, that is only a reason to discourage nudity, not to mandate that it be restricted.
Huh. I need to think on that video.&gt;Hamas isn't going to disband nor is that relevant nor should that be a condition for someone serious about two-state solution. It would also be very hypocritical given that Likud is the political descendant of Jewish terrorist groups like Irgun and Lehi.Somehow I doubt that Hamas will moderate any time soon. I wold love to see them do so: ending political violence between Fatah and Hamas would make a unity government easier to maintain.
\#justUSthings just like how corporations decide everything that the US government does. Just like patent reform was stopped because lawyers didn't want to lose out on the money from law suits for frivolous cases. Americans really need to realise they can change all of this right now, if they just took an interest in how their own country is run. Maybe even make a third party instead of just 2 corrupt political organizations. 
Just to make sure you're not going to be disappointed, you've got the Felwinter's already right? B/c I don't think it's available this IB (I could be wrong though).  
I kinda like moist, actually. But it is common enough that my husband looks at me to make sure he hasn't offended every time he says it, regardless of how often I remind him it doesn't bother me. 
People find all sorts of excuses to complain about. The flavour of the day is what sticks.People didn't use the term ticks in 1.6, instead they just used the blanket 'netcode' excuse.
I'm past feeling guilty- I just would like to be able to tell her "I love you" in spite of the fact we have no relationship due to her mental illness.  Ok- writing that out is strange.  I guess there is no way to do that, huh?
Other countries see it too. It's just more pronounced for us because we're a pretty small country (population and economy-wise) so a smaller amount of money coming in can do a lot more. Also the Canadian dollar is weak making it cheaper to buy Canadian assets. Also, we have a huge immigrant base in Toronto making it feel "safer" for foreigners and immigrants to invest here. 
I mean, everyone has preferences. I'm also allergic and I think both almond milk and coconut milk are gross, plus I don't want to contribute to almond farming. I don't understand why people are so judgy about this. If you like it, drink it. I don't, I won't.
People need to STOP withy the false equivalency. I love Bernie but a Clinton would be infinitely better on every front than ANY GOP candidate. Let's all remember that.
There's oppression all over the grocery store, if you look hard enough. Why is it that there are more white eggs than brown eggs? Hm? Why are there more choices in white bread than in wheat? Why are the paper towels predominantly white in color? Explain all those, hunh?/s
Even if they're not added via DLC, they're going to be in Smash 5, that's almost certain. I must say that it's better for them if they wait Smash 5: The players will really know them by then.And the problem with DLC is that some people may be unable to buy them, or just don't want to. But for Smash 5, the hype they'll produce will be incredible.I'm pretty impatient to see what they could do in Smash, but I'd be a little bit sad if they got in the game by the back door.
You've noticed a few women desired you but what is that? It doesn't mean they are going to sleep with you or that they even will want you in the long run. Avoiding women is not the answer. 
Hmm ok. I'm honestly pretty happy if i make about 40-45k haha. (Happily mid class).Anyhow the road I should take would be JAC -&gt; Apply for apprenticeship with random electricians?I'm still scared about the job security of electricians in Toronto since I read somewhere (i think it was reddit actually) that it's starting to dry up and moving to Alberta is much better. I want to stay close to my family preferably :p.Thanks for replying too :).
That's actually untrue and so is that riot is doing 'something for us'. It's a free to play game, the business model relies on the customer loving the product, they aren't just doing everything as a cash grab but they also aren't doing us any favors. If you want chromas, you will buy them. It's not a ploy for cheap money, the cost of developing the skin has nothing to do with its final price, the price is set at a level where it matches the value it has to the player, because their business model has buying as a choice (and they want it to be a choice that feels appropriate to the content's perceived value). basically it's just as wrong to say chromas are a cash grab as it is to say chromas are a favor from riot. 
I remember reading a short story about some rouge jupiter-sized planet that swung through our solar system and knocked earth off its orbit and out into deep space.  Within a few months, it got so cold that the atmosphere literally froze all around the earth, down to a 10 foot deep liquid oxygen/frozen nitrogen snow.  The few people that remained survived by heating pockets of these gases and creating breathable areas enclosed in strong tarps/balloons.I know people freak out about "the end of the world" but short of something catastrophic like being ejected from the solar system or being nailed by an unstoppable comet, the human race will have a hard time dying off completely.  Sure, all out nuclear war can kill BILLIONS but there will always be survivors.
Make sure they know the dangers, document that you showed it to them, and if they go ahead, push for cloud vendor diversity (even if one is just a backup option). 
You have no idea how much we appreciate it. We have made it a goal to try to now asking for donations for as long as possible. It warms us to see the community moving to take the initiative to make sure we can stick around. That really means a ton to us, and what we are doing here.
Well, I guess it kind of is? Pain and pleasure are all just the brain doing its thing. Of course all the blood and poo tell you the brain has pretty much lost it after a bit...
You may want to put a brake on the 10.5 for the Omega. While the can has a lifetime warranty, the brake will save a ton of wear on the first baffle, saving you time without the can down the road. Also, you said it's your first can, heads up about putting suppressors under hand guards: It will get really really really hot. The can will reach 900 degrees in a few mags, and then radiate into the hand guard. Hopefully that isn't an issue for you. Have fun, still waiting on my omega. 
Both occupying the last spots in the first half of the table, and both getting eliminated in quarter finals of the cup makes for a really poor season. That was surprising to me. I would have predicted at least a Europa League spot for one of them. 
http://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/actuaries.htm#tab-6&gt;Actuaries should expect strong competition for jobs. Actuaries make up a small occupation, and the relatively high pay and comfortable working conditions make being an actuary a desirable career. Students who have passed at least two actuarial exams and have had an internship while in college should have the best job prospects for entry-level positions.From my experiences that's a fairly accurate assessment. Internship vs no internship on a resume is night and day.

I rode Greyhound from California to Michigan, and had no problems at all with people riding the bus. Most of them just want to get to their destination like you. And my bus had ex-convicts on them part of the way who just got out of prison that were riding the bus home. It was interesting, but absolutely nothing happened and it was a dull ride all the same. 
At any given time I run at LEAST 3 Virtual Machines on my desktop when I'm working...  So the extra memory/cores is useful there..  I'm sure the Xeon has more abilities tied directly to virtualization these days as well, though I don't think VMWare workstation is capable of using those abilities.
Former believer here. What I find interesting is that in the Bible, God allows divorce. What most people ignore is that he does not allow remarriage after divorce. This keeps marriage sacred, and limited.

The Happy Vegan Burger at Angry Chicken in Kreuzberg, Berlin. Korean-fusion fast food place and it's SO GOOD, I've never eaten anything like it. Kimchi-tofu-polenta patty, wasabi-nori-mayonnaise, gherkins, and a sweet potato bread bun. And only like €5, not too bad.

One of my history textbooks used BCE/CE rather than BC/AD and I thought BCE was 'Before Christ Existed' and CE was 'Christ Exists,' which seemed like a really unnecessary change. I figured it out after a few more weeks in the class.
Awesome, thanks for the info.I definitely don't have the greatest hearing, I have been to way to many concerts without hearing protection, but these headphones don't even come close to hitting an uncomfortable volume. If I have them plugged into my motherboard, they aren't near loud enough, even at max volume. Plugging them into my speakers (Bose Companion 2s) makes a substantial difference, but there have been a plethora of times I have wanted more volume when listening to music in the three months that I have had the headphones.

Even today, most people in western europe do not speak a romance language.Most of the countries and people in western europe are germanics who spoke germanic languages.And even in france/spain, it took a while for local languages to be subsumed by latin languages.What you are stating is simply wrong and easily verifiable...
Very much apples and oranges.  Basketball is also a game of skill -- that doesn't mean it's comparable to go or bridge in anything but a superficial sense.Go is a game of perfect information, similar to chess or checkers.  Bridge is a game of imperfect information, closer to Poker.  In bridge, you have a partner. In go, you do not.  Nobody ever masters either game.  I have no idea what "cognitive training" entails.  I find bridge to be far more fun than go.
Haha, yeah I've always liked creepy type things. But what really strikes me about glass eyes is that every one is unique and the artistry/glass work that goes into them is so fascinating.

I am already aware that if they bring out two versions you can buy the other one - I'm trying to explain to the OP (who was confused over why there's confusion) that it's not clear if we're going to get two versions, one version, a mega version, whatever.

Girl you are speaking my language. My hubs is about to be out of town for two weeks and one of the things I'm looking forward to is me and the kiddo scrounging up what the hell ever we want for dinner.

Art History degree holder here. I have not closely studied obesity in ancient cultures, but I have studied depictions of fertility. To my understanding, the Venus of Willendorf is pretty widely accepted as a fertility figurine. Across many societies, ideal women are depicted with large breasts (ability to nourish a child) wide hips and large belly (to carry a child) prominent pelvic/"V" shaped area.Prehistorically, "Attractiveness" of a woman was determined by her ability to reproduce 
the opponent can't force you to do anything. If they sag off you or take off the right side, you still have the decision of whether or not to shoot it/ go left. The difference is that when you intentionally foul at the end of the game, you can only foul the player with the ball. The offensive team has the ability to control who shoots the free throws, and therefore can control their own destiny.When you hack-a-player, you remove any control that an offensive team has whatsoever. You punish them for even daring to play a bad FT shooter, even if that player is only in there for defense.
Hahah what about the Sword of a thousand truths? But seriously, is that a good enough reason? I have a tiny hunting knife thing but I've been using an arrowhead for carving which doesn't even have a handle. Do you think that'd be acceptable? I'm not good with this whole law stuff.
If we trade him it *must* be for a first rounder or a very, very early second rounder. We drafted him in what, the very late second? There would be no value gained 
I appreciate your criticism but it *was* a consideration.  I'm aware it could be a long time before POS changes come into effect but the two main reasons for not moving back to c5 were the scores of capital ships we'd have to move, and having to set up dozens of POSes when they were only going to be removed anyway. It was certainly the lesser of the two objections but it was still a good one. And of course, the capital ships problem was recently taken care of :)Edit: I did also say "TDSIN moving to a c5 any time soon hadn't even been considered yet." Which I think is required for context to your quoted section.o7

You might want to try using a gel instead of a cream moisturizer. They absorb quicker and are much lighter under foundations so they don’t disturb them.The primer depends on what type of skin you have 
Also, not sure who you spoke with when you called your card company, but now that it's definitely an issue with your card, either on their end or Mandarake's, you might want to call and get in contact with the Fraud department specifically. If there was no apparent hold on your card, you might not have spoken to them when you called them up. It's possible that they denied charges, but didn't place a hold on your card, so a normal CS rep might not have seen it. Either way, if you have the time, it can't hurt to give it a try and hopefully it will solve the issue. 
What are we trying to achieve with this straw poll. its going to end with one player feeling bad and feel a sense of unwelcome. The line up is what it is.
Only an ignorant moron would assume police DONT receive training in dealing with dogs.

Her gauntlets form around her gems as well as her hands, and I guess both can be summoned at will since her body is just a projection.kinda like if pearl threw her spear, she wouldn't appear where her weapon is, she would just summon it.
First of all, I want to say I'm also very proud of the way the TPP sub handled today's scare. I sincerely hope we can continue to show this much unity and solidarity in helping people who need it in the future.This seems like an interesting solution. I imagine people won't check TPPKappa as much as they check the TPP sub, so if there's ever an instance like or similar to this again, could I suggest putting it on TPPKappa, but then posting a link here to the post on the TPPKappa sub? That way people are alerted should anything like this come up, though the discussion isn't happening on TPP.
A-School is 14-26 weeks depending on if you're AT or AE and then you may have C-School. A-School is in Pensacola. C-School is in a variety of locations depending on what platform you get orders for.
He was probably just trying to fit in at Chelsea and City and Luis and Raheem let him figure out how to be himself last season. Sadly I think his body, after 10 years of being a City of Chelsea player (assuming he was cool when he was at Cadbury Athletic and Villa) developed during those formative years thinking that he was an ass and shit, and it'll take a while for it to adjust to what he became last season.
I don't deny that their website isn't great but as someone who has worked in web development for awhile, redesigning a site of that magnitude is not easy. Especially so for a highly popular news website that generates a shitload of different kinds of content every day and doesn't have a lot of money to invest into IT.  
That is exactly what I was thinking they were when I first got them in game, and have a strong feeling they just threw them in there to patch up some holes. Frenzy is an odd design choice too, which doesnt do anything aside from insta-kill you.. Perhaps that was related to another transformation mechanic that they benched and later found they painted themselves into another corner with..
Failing a comfort test means that she feels less connected to you. If you care and love your LTR you should not be failing these tests. They are genuine queries from her to you that checks if you love her. You want to *pass* them, not get a high distinction.  E.g. She tells you she wants to spend more time with you because you have been working late and at the gym a lot. You *do* take her on a bush walk on the weekend and enjoy some sandwiches together at a look out. You *don't* tell your boss you need to go part time and cancel your gym membership.

Anything MMO on mobile will have P2W feature. What makes it good is if you can also win by not paying.For example: Order &amp; Chaos Online is known to be big in P2W. But I have a capped character, with good gear and did not P2W. Just takes dedication. Took me around 4 months of farming to get it done. But in any MMO that is normal :)

It matters because I'm too lazy to look up each player and their specific heritage. I don't know who in the New Zealand team is a Maori and who isn't. Maori's and Polynesians can look very similar and I can't tell the difference between those pretty similar looking racial groups at a glance. Just like in the Australian team, I assumed Will Chambers was indigenous when he could easily have been an islander. In this instance whether you look 'white' is a relatively accurate distinction between the non-indigenous players and indigenous players in the Australian and New Zealand test squad.

i love it.nothing is stopping the ps4 repeat NOTHING. I think we all know by this point Nintendo will have to go third party with the sales the wii u are pulling and Microsoft is losing money faster then a fat guy eating popcorn at a movie.it will be great to see sony and valve facing off as the two big players.
Still, if you're new, you should not worry about stones. They will do a very small difference, compared to stuff like evolutions and superbs. So it works out that you just put on whatever stones you find until rank 90+ when you get the second scout slot and you get Marineco then to get superior stones for your already finished lineup.  And besides, it's not very likely that the stones you'd get from the legend pack would be any good. And if they're not that's a lot of money down the drain :D
Mine was at a Walgreens! Dude was calmly impressed, and we had a nice pep talk about the merits of owning one. He was definitely inspired to look into getting one. 10/10 would Apple pay again
En terminos practicos, creo que si preguntasemos ahora mismo a los votantes potenciales si su opinion sobre Monedero es positiva y si preferirian que Monedero no estuviera en la direccion de Podemos, las respuestas serian no y si, respectivamente para esas dos preguntas, para una mayoria. Quiza no es tan mala noticia en cuanto a votos. Estan los incondicionales de Podemos y el resto, la mayoria, a los que los medios, con su brutal campaña de desprestigio, han convencido de que Monedero es deshonesto. El poder de los medios es brutal, y en este caso, los ataques han funcionado de maravilla para crear una mala imagen de Monedero. Con este panorama, el efecto de esta dimision probablemente sea positivo en cuanto a votos.

This might sound counter intuitive but if I could go back one thing I'd do differently is level up the not so great champs first.  Your bolt and iron man at 3/1 (with masteries) may not be *great* but they should be able to win matches consistent after the 10th.  At that point as long as you're keeping the streak going the 3rd match is of a bit less consequence; I think that's where the great champs shine, because you could probably leave your 2* Hawkeye at a low r2 and he'll still be able to pull out wins consistently - but with better scores due to his lower lvl.
Some Rare sniper rifles can roll explosive rounds. Has testing been done with that perk? Does it follow the same ratios? Has anyone tried using it in pvp?
You probably don't need to wait the full 3 weeks.  I just read a conversation today with Lyle McDonald and he talked about two weeks. My guess is you could do it faster. maybe the sooner the better.  Get the water weight increase and possible intestinal distress over with before the long work days.
* The enemy team complaining about each other to my team is what I LIVE for.* HotS can take it easy on the skins because their skins suck. LoL can go nuts on the skins because many of them are actually really fuckin good.* "Playing bad = you literally CAN'T PLAY, sucks to be you." Yeah no thanks.
The universe is so unimaginably huge it is probably impossible to find it's true center.   Therefore, one can define the center arbitrarily.   Might as well define that center as the earth, so we can say things like "star xyz is q light years away".     If the earth is then the center of the universe, the son revolves around it.  
Exactly. I had to leave an abused home and move across the state to live with a man that I barely knew (my father). I worked hard in school, got good grades, etc. etc. and with that and my poverty, the government is paying for my education. BUT I still work part time while going to school and have no family support. If my financial assistance disappears, I don't have anyone except myself. For someone to say I'm privileged educationally is laughable. I have been nearly homeless multiple times in my life. But I am very grateful to live in a place that allows me to make money, get a paid education, and all the rest. I have the privilege of living in the USA as opposed to developing countries that don't allow women to have the same rights as men. I'm glad I am living here in the US. 
Yeah I have a similar problem finding people. I don't really know how to meet new people, and I find it really hard to ask them out. But I try not to worry about it too much.I think just do your best to feel better right now. In the long-run you'll be happy that it happened.
A funny prank, but he'll know for sure if he's like me. I can taste the difference in a blind taste test between filtered water and tap water - maybe it's just here in Los Angeles but tap water has a distinctive flavor!
We're kind of comparing it to western cinema though.... we might be content if they try slice of life live action. Trade off is it's the most absolutely boring anime out there
Since you're a beer drinker and beers taste kinda sweet to me due to the carbs, maybe try a Riesling? Also, totally aside, but have you ever drank a mixed drink with beer? Ie a shandy?
O I see, my fault for the assumption. Then you should meet some straight males in the process. I'm just saying I can bring a friend over with me lol :).
I once had a supervisor (Canadian) who had a very soft handshake. Definitely not due to timid personality, it was because he had a close relative who had parkinsons disease or something of the sort and so he was taught growing up not to try and "win" handshakes because it could cause someone severe pain. I agree it is good to have a solid handshake, but if your success at a job hinges upon something as trivial as a handshake, you are likely on shakey ground already IMO. 
I can't speak for other countries, but in the United States teachers can get in a lot of trouble for talking down a student's potential, even if it's just to the parents. Tell a kid's parents that s/he will never make it through college and you could easily end up out of job and the parents don't even have to try hard for it. It's ridiculous how far a complaint can go here now-a-days.
Very sound reply. I would do that, I really would. The problem being is that I will get kicked out if I get caught again. And I tossed all but 8 of the pills..I deffinately dont want to be an opiate addict
Buy a used license, do the co-install thing, and keep on keeping on. You can still use PT10 for everything, and still be telling the truth when they ask if you have 11.
Probably not relevant, but if you're willing to go for single action rather than double, you probably have a lot more options (mainly in cheap foreign-made SAA clones and reproduction "black-powder conversions" guns) in that price range.In the DA options, the other comments cover it pretty well. 
Don't you think it was the nature of a series like X Files that had a very large, regularly rotating cast..it needed a lot of novice actors to produce..it's only natural that *some* would go on to some level of success. Vince did mention that he wax exposed first to many of the BB cast through X Files episodes…being a young director and being exposed to a very high amount of actors would definitely give you the opportunity to take notes and keep some of them in mind for his own eventual series.
Yeah but aatrox has very little else going for him with hos his kits designed (aoe and a GA passive as well as bring a sustain tank tbatcan do damage)The only other thimg he can do is splitpush, but why would you sacrifice a tank, in the tank meta, when you can get a zed mid, who teamfights better, splitpushes better and is just generally stronger, while giving less up in the meta
Jesus Christ, I'm just saying that according to the Bible, gay marriage is wrong. He thinks the Bible is true and according to the Bible, gay marriage is wrong. That's it.
Oldboy. If you're up for a hell of a psychological thriller, this is the one for you.Edit. The korean one! NOT THE AMERICAN ONE, OH GOD DON'T WATCH THAT ITS AWFUL!
I wouldn't call him a quack. He is a respected surgeon and faculty at Columbia. He's just failing to uphold his hippocratic oath of doing no harm by lying to people on TV while asserting his position as a doctor.He's an asshole, not a quack.
It is plain black. He actually had an advertisement for expensify.com taped to the back of it when it was still on the stick. (I did not receive the stick or the advertisement.)
place knife in right hand, place fork in left. Cut food. Switch knife to left hand. Switch fork to right hand.Even after all these years I cant loose the habit fully.
The issues this sub takes with him boil down to two points 1. Sanders is more of a Social Democrat rather than the Socialist.   2. He is running for the Democrat nomination. There has been a bit of back and forth over what he actually supports and doesn't support but most of us agree his isn't the revolution taken human form. However I agree with with you that banning all form of conversation on the subject is just stupid. If we wanted to avoid link spam we could have just made a stickied Bernie Sanders megathread. 
the content drives us Ben. any content is awesome! the size/scale of it does not matter! personally, IDC what you guys say at a live event just as long as you do not leave the rest of us face-palming the delivery. no more boring 30 minutes of baddies dog-fighting. no more FPS noobs throwing out comms so bad to be re-enacted in vmemes. i mean we had like 30 people on TS watching that shit and half of them were non-backers. there really isnt a good way to damage control that. its fine to say "well they make a hell of a game, they just dont play worth a damn" for like 5 minutes... but after 30 minutes... it was painful to watch.... negvotes inbound im sure, but ya. those were not good to watch at all!    now technical difficulties get a pass. those are kinda funny &amp; more than anything endearing.
Unless you're from the UK because we use whatever the fuck we feel like. For example we use MPG but sell fuel in litres. Oh yeah, I like the rest of Europe, we use miles. 
Haha! I had a similar dream. First, I gave birth to a baby that looked exactly like my husband. I mean, exactly like he looks right now. He had my husband's face along with his beard and a baby body. I was so upset by this, I was crying hysterically. I didn't want a bearded baby. Then I dreamt that the baby somehow turned into a white lab puppy and I had to breastfeed it. I remember thinking in my dream "why the hell am I breastfeeding a puppy?"
I'll answer from "political" perspectives: THE LEFT: an unarmed teen had racist police snap his spine and let him die. So people are protesting this innocent man. Poverty and racism are to blame. THE RIGHT: a black criminal ran from the police and had an injury some time during the arrest. He also had a prior spinal injury and was trying to hurt himself inside the police vehicle. So rioters are using this as an excuse to rob stores and destroy things. Lack of family structure and liberal policies are to blame.THE CENTER: someone died in police custody. Certain people are upset and a protest then turned riot occured. Millions in damage. 7 cops in the hospital. Hundreds of arrests. Nothing is accomplished. 
I expose my son to religion. In fact, I expose him to all of them, one at a time obviously, in an effort to educate him so he can make his own life choices about what he wants to believe. Yes, this also includes the knowledge that some choose not to believe at all. His father and I are Christian.Does this mean I'm indoctrinating my child? Because I tend to think we're doing the opposite and opening his mind. And no, he will not be forced to believe.
I remember working extra as a clerk in a pharmacy during my studies. During a campaign, we would hand out free paperbacks to anyone buying anything against the flu. Breakfast at Tiffanys, I think it was.I lost count on how many people, mainly middle-aged men, who simply said 'I don't read' in a pretty brusque manner. Dude, it's a book, and a pretty good one, and I'm giving it to you for free. Sure, maybe you don't have much time to read, but to simply write it off as something that you could never envision yourself doing is like saying that you never have and never will listened to music.
pretty much any hiking park. all of the big east bay regional parks have secluded areas without much/any traffic. sunol, redwood regional, the ridge, del valle, lake chabot, brushy peak, etc. it would be more difficult not to find a spot than to find a spot.
If you're rank 3 now, you'll definitely hit 5 if you keep at it at this pace. Even if you slowed down a bit, with the various rep buffs, you should make it.And buy the 12 hour buff whenever you can. It never hurts to have it. If you only have a few motes, then only buy it the last couple days, but otherwise, get it every time.
Please sell chromas individually. I would much rather buy one chroma than be forced to buy 3 at a time. It also gives us the option to get really cheap skins which would be very nice. I don't even care if it's like 250 per chroma and the bundle gives you a better price.I really just want the flexibility to buy one thing at a time. Chromas are a really cool opportunity, and it's a shame to waste that by forcing them into bundles. I would be equally unhappy if I had to buy 3 normal skins to get the one I want.
I have to say, their hardware is solid and almost worth the price if you have it. I don't like the way they integrate their environment so that once you start down the Apple path, forever will it dominate your computing, but if you throw some Linux distro on it that's not a concern.
Excellent, glad to see some traction on this idea. I have a friend who works in the O's ticket office. I've reached out to him for media / PR contacts. When he gets back to me I'll share it so we can get something going...
Always use your student discount at grocery stores and get your 10% off. Use apps like pcplus, checkout 51 and Snap to save extra money. Meal plan and set up a meal prep day so you don't impulse buy food on campus and around town. If you go out to dinner with friends, eat first so that way you will only want an app or a dessert instead of a full meal.
Now keep in mind this is NOT on a Node YET.This is just normal ADSL2+.This is purely just Telstra working their asses off to remediate and re-route tens of thousands of phone lines here (they're working on every corner and fibre is being pulled through all over the city).
I'm optimistic, too, but FWIW, I seem to remember Bacari tweeting something optimistic like that right before Stauskas, GRIII, and McGary declared for the draft. So I'm not sure how telling that tweet may be. 
I was just responding to the assumptions you made in your earlier comment. It wasn't your feedback that bothered me, rather how you presented your opinion as facts, backed up with broad, inaccurate, assumptions. I don't really have a strong opinion on either the song or the shop name. Buuuut...not only pregnant women and new moms buy stuff for kids and babies. Anyone that knows them could buy something as a gift (more likely with luxury products, like handmade accessories). And not everyone prefers the music of their youth. You're probably right that a lot of people won't notice the reference, but most people don't have bad associations with the song either, so its just a cute phrase. No harm done. 
Its super important to keep in mind the Sexual Assault vs. Rape terminology, it might make all the difference in interpreting the stats. I just think its really important to note how widely ranging the numbers can be. 
I feel bad for both Winston and Mariota. Both are really good raw prospect that could benefit a year or two on the bench but we all know they will be thrown into the fire right off the bat.
haha, of those i like princess bride, but who doesnt?i bet i can play a game with you called "name movies i have never seen" you name popular ones that i've never seen and i'll name you movies i've seen that you haven't lol
I would say that's a fair assumption. Kubrick's The Shining is the biggest example of an adaption he hated that  I can think of. Later he was involved in the miniseries version of it.
Our children will experience Materialist / Physicalist culture almost every day of their lives. It's a culture of deceit, envy, and ugliness that attempts to reduce men to petty, vain sacks of meat.They -deserve- to experience the culture of the Church whenever it is possible. It is a culture of Truth, Charity, and Beauty founded in Sacred Tradition that elevates the human condition.
Close enough where I know basics and I interact with people that know it well, but not close enough that I would feel confident advising anybody on the subject.
You can, but they hold your NFL rights for one year.  After one year you can re-enter the draft.Probably the most famous case is the Bucs drafting Bo Jackson (after him telling them not to).  He sat out the whole year and just played baseball.
I went into a datacenter that had such poor cable management that they propped apart the cables with wire hangars and strung an oscillating floor fan to them in order to vent heat.
Exactly, people bought a Wii-U because Nintendo is still making those kinds of games.  All the big titles for PS4/Xbox are typically M-Rated adventure/shooter type games.Nintendo has maybe 1 big adult game a year, whereas Sony/Micro have maybe 1 big "everyone" game a year.
There are going to be assholes because there are assholes in everything, but as long as you are willing to communicate and take advice, most people are going to be okay with that. Just let people know at the beginning of the match that you don't have much experience, than you should be fine.What knowledge of competitive tf2 do you have right now? Any?If you don't, no worries, I'm just curious.
God this feels amazing. After all the cheap shots from Mayo, Zaza and Giannis. Seeing their faces for 6 games made me hate all of them. Glad we are embarrassing these shits on their home court.
Weight IS just a number, it fluctuates throughout your day. That is NOT an excuse to say that when you are overweight, however. You're still too heavy. If they say that just rephrase it as "You have too much fat". See how that goes :P
So I'm gonna feed off this post because I know if I make my own I won't get much back. Just have a quick question. Got put in a race playlist where it was a 1v1 drag race. This guy took off a good second or two before it says go. I even still got the jump start. Hacks or just a syncing issue?
Im 18 and worked in Japan in a ski resort for four months with most being people ten years older than I am. The shittiest thing about it was the fact that at first no one ever took me seriously because of my age. Work, going out, and especially skiing. Showed them up when the first dump came down, hola. 
Lovie Smith: Should we draft Winston now?Bucs GM: Nah it'll look bad if we do it right away. Wait a few more minutes so people think we're thinking like smart people.
What are you using to benchmark cs:go and what fps are you getting right now?  Using 3dmark to test a CSGO overclock is kind of pointless. Record a demo where you run around the map throwing smokes and looking at the textures, then use timedemo to play it back. Open the console and look at your times/average fps when it finishes. Do this for stock settings and see how each component changes your fps.

I really like this. Sadly, I have not much Pathfinder experience. However, in the current campaign I'm in, I'm trying to roleplay more. Like, actually stay in character, like I'm acting. It's kinda fun.
Happy Birthday :D Hope you had lots of cake!I know I'm quite late, but if you still have the Bog Shanty Background available, I would love to have it on my main (hullahoop14). NC backgrounds are uber gorgeous.
I'm not so sure that it is a kombi. I thought the same thing as you at first but if you look at the other pics OP posted the cabs rear window has that curve and I haven't seen that on a kombi.
How about hypothetical head? Because he wants his suit changed 4 times at his wake and that he gets his dick sucked also. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UYfEpSgbfNE
Can't help much regarding courses but I grew up in Raleigh. Well really Raleigh and I grew up together. It's a great smaller city with tons of stuff to do.  Enjoy!
I live close to that dog walker and my neighbors use him when they're away on long days. He must be magical, the dogs he walks are always so calm. My dog is reactive to other dogs, and he's really nice about it when we cross by each other on walks.  
I just recently maxed all 8 landing craft and my warriors so it's a fun little competition to see if I can beat some of the resource bases on my map. I currently control all 35 or however many are on a radar lvl 20 map and it's fun when it gets taken back because gold means nothing to me so I don't mind throwing a full army at a base to see if I can win it back.[my toughest resource base so far](http://imgur.com/byyPF0C), the guy that was trading it back and forth with me lost a couple times and I haven't seen him or anyone else try in a couple weeks. 
All the medical questions and problems that can come up. You have the colds, stomach viruses, allergies, regular check-ups, eye exams and dentist and orthodontist. Then add in anything specific to your child. Learning disabilities, physical problems, anxiety, ADHD, the list can seem endless. You get good at fighting with insurance companies.Still the pros usually outweigh the cons. 
Uh, as a medical professional in a hospital who lifts the obese who are only there because of their weight related health issues, I'm not obsessed with their weight and it doesn't affect me, at least not morally or emotionally.  I'm not about to pass character judgement on someone just because they weight a lot.  And I'm not "ruining my body" any more than a competent mover or construction worker - I know how to lift heavy things.
This is why people can't do HM content and then complain that Progression raiders are elitest and consume content too quickly. But, catering to idiots makes more money.  As the top players leave, after 6 months of clearing the same raid, expect the over median player level to drop.  
Hvis 8/13 er uudholdelige at være i lokale med, så ville jeg måske også kigge lidt indad. Har selv gået på teknisk skole og det er bestemt ikke alle, der er lige behagelige, men måske du også lader dig gå på af det. Men når det så er sagt, så skal du bare fortsætte. 8 uger er ingenting. Tænk, hvis du engang vil være kraftværkstekniker og skal efteruddannes. Vi har brug for viden i fremtiden (og elektrikere), så det er bare at klø på og holde fuckhovederne ud. 
It hasn't been until recently that these feelings have really been uncovered.  I'm getting to the age that everyone is having babies and I'm feeling a bit backed into a corner.  Do the traditional thing and follow suit or pack up and become the traveler I've always wanted to be.  
Maybe new Exotics for it, instead of already available Exotics? For example, do the Level 34 Last Array mission only using a Sniper Rifle, and Rasputin's Hand drops(Rasputin's Hand is a suggestion for an Exotic weapon posted earlier today on this sub) [Rasputin's Hand](http://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/34gdtj/suggestion_new_exotic_weapon_rasputins_hand/)
I work in surgery, we are allowed to have our phones on us. However at no point would anyone taking a picture with them ever be acceptable. There is a department camera that is used and only the doctor or nurse is allowed to use it and not once has it been used on foreign body removals. However we do laugh at you when you're under anesthesia, that part is the same.
Instead of giving her ult some mana cost, what about adding 1 sec delay to her W/R second cast? Tbh, I'm okay with her dmg as long as they punish her mobility.
Coinbase seems to be the most reputable.  But I do not like the idea of logging into my online bank account or credit card account using my credentials.  I may have been born at night but I wasn't born last night. :)
The thing is that he's not the only coach to have commented on that and he also said it's just something we have to deal with. It's not like he said, "Detroit is a bunch of dirty cheaters." Why did so many people get so upset about that?
I see what you mean. I think this whole thing comes down to the fact that money makes corporates interested and smell gold. Which in its turn could completly slaughter the modding scene. So i hear ya. Though, people who mod a "dlc:ish" thing to a game and gamers get alot of playtime out of it. And enjoy it, dont they deserve some sort of gratitude? The paypal donation thing seems to be a cool thing. But what it could be is that all mods just cost like 1 dollar? Like a travel ticket thing, you enter our domain, you pay our toll?
What harms not others, should not be prohibited by the government. Government intervention should be minimal internally, and non-existent internationally. Think, don't feel.
Aren't morals subjective though? I mean, one person can believe something to be immoral while another believes it is moral. How can that be "found", as if it were scientific fact?
I went to a charter school during high school, I still consider it one of the best decisions I made. We had an excellent community also, everyone pretty much knew everyone somehow. Everyone (assuming the school specializes in something) has *atleast* 1 similar interest. "Bullies" or "Jocks" just didn't exist. Lots of people like to compare test statistics to show why charter schools are no better or worse than other public schools, but that means shit when your school specializes in something that isn't going to be on a standardized test anyways. It means something when the child doesn't hate going to school, can seriously focus on a subject that very much interests them, actually have a say in how the school functions, have small class sizes, and doesn't feel left out while also getting the standard curriculum required.**Tl;Dr** - I think most charter schools are like this, it's just the culture that comes with most.
But what argument is there in this? I mean I think this works both ways- there's no content in a "HUR DUR DUR RONALDO IS BETTER DUR HUR HUR" post. You just have you head entirely up your ass if you think this content has any depth.
I think it's pretty reasonable. You didn't have an intent to kill somebody, and you're probably not going to do it again after FIFTEEN years. That's a looong fucking time for someone as young as her. 
~~If I may, what's so terrible about Cherry MY switches?~~~~I've never heard of them, but~~ that keyboard's layout looks pretty awesome. Reminds me of a Sun workstation's keyboard.Edit: I'm stupid.
Mine never creaked but it clicked under load. I spend almost a full season trying to fix it. I tried cleaning/greasing changing the bearings a fair amount of time. Every time the clicking sound went away for a while but always came back after 50-100km. It was driving me nuts during climb. My LBS worked on it at least 3-4 times as well. There was no correlation whatsoever with riding in the rain or dirt. I  finally solved the issue by switching the crank from the original S-500(I think) to to a force 22. So far, it's been about 1000km without that awful sound. Apart from that, it's a great bike!
Arguably yes, but a bolt-action rifle is perfectly possible to own legally in this country. You just need a clean police record, a doctor's note to say you're not mad and a couple of character references, which isn't actually that unreasonable really.
1. Place toilet paper roll on the holder.2. Unroll entire roll being careful to pile the paper neatly (a decorative basket may help).3. Poop.4. Wipe anus with fingers.5. Wipe fingers on toilet paper that is closest to the cardboard tube.6. Roll enough paper back onto the tube to cover soiled paper.7. Repeat steps 4 through 6 as needed until anus and fingers are clean.8. Change roll when completely rolled back up.
Thing is they never promised moddability. They can do as they please. Its not like cities skylines where modding was a headlining feature. Its not like it matters much, it'll get broken pretty soon I'm sure.

Thanks for the feedback! I have a dog named Riley and Quinn... So those are out but some of the other names may be possibilities. Thanks again for taking the time to respond! 
That would be nice. Unfortunately we have entire political parties going out of their way to remove electoral power from minorities.How would you propose disenfranchised individuals choose political targets when they are gerrymandered into districts which put those targets well out of reach?
That's awesome, and you're totally right. I think my head is still trying to get me to justify having at least one when I know that's just not going to work
What started as a 1 roll only on my alt JP account ended in 9 straight gold eggs in 10 rolls. 2 Pandora, lkali, 2 Loki, idunn &amp; idunna, meimei, ronia ..... Now I'm scared of rolling next pcgf on my main NA account.[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LeOEQvn.jpg)
Is that just a joke because it's Illinois, or does our state actually prohibit NFA items? (I'm not new to guns but I don't own any yet so I haven't looked into this)

That is what mine reads with the timer disabled. I have 4 greens (1TB) that never had the issues above, their timers shipped disabled.Who knows the rhyme or reason, maybe some batches get the timer turned on and some don't. I've heard of people finding the drives with 10 or 15 second timers instead of 8.
&gt;One person per comment in a thread of 2k comments apparently is a lot of people to you.But they're YOUR comments. If one person is coming out of the woodwork for every single comment you're making to say the exact same thing, you have to consider the fact that there might be a pattern and you're tone of voice is extremely off putting and, again, obnoxious.
The first thing you need to do is learn to fly to buy a small RTF like the Hubsan X4, they are around $50. Once you've got a few hours on that invest in a small kit, couple hundred worth, and build that. If you can master that, then you are ready to start 3D printing and designing your own stuff.I'd suggest jumping over to /r/multicopter and reading the vast body of information there.
If I was on my Pc right now I could link, but I'm on mobile at the moment... Alright hold up. Do you happen to know what exactly the name of the cannons are for the F8F-1B? It's uh AN/M3 20mm cannons right? Oh.... Alright you are right there is no evidence to suggest the F8F-1B had an option between 20MM and M3s my bad....Misread info on the variant last night lol.
My old math teacher once called my friend "Dog shit on a sidewalk" and "A wart on a toads back" then proceeded to throw the garbage can down the hall in a pit of rage. Gotta love catholic school.
I hope this doesn't mean "whitest" as in wimpy or lame.  Anderson Cooper is probably the most bad ass reporter in the entire industry.  The dude's fairly hardcore.
Sorry what is a CV? Cover letter? I meant my resume. I've had a few instances where I upload it and then the site will sort my resume into fields. It asks me to check that it placed everything where it goes. It never does. My experience, everything gets all fungo'd. I'm assuming that's at danger of happening too when I'm not prompted to check its been sorted properly. Is this not how it works?I've actually never gotten a job from replying to a company's website, so this is all new to me. Only from networking and referrals. Unfortunately, I'm moving to a new area where my contacts don't help.
Yeah the social commentary got a little too Family Guy-esque for my taste at times, though I kinda wonder if Comedy Central had a hand in that. Thankfully, they seemed to ditch most of the commentary as the show went on and went back to the goofy nerd humor we all know and love. 
My track coach was calling role on the first day of practice. There was a Chinese guy who just came to America and didn't have an english name yet. My coach came to his name and said, "What the hell is this? How did you even make the team?" He also picks on him a lot.
Oh come on. A lot of people say "friends" when they like someone because they don't wanna say anything more because they're afraid of scaring them off. 
Ohhh you'll end up getting a stronger battery lol. This whole thing is a money sink but fun. just one step at a time and education to go with it. I actually won a bigger battery and it's a block/box lol. Didn't think I'd like it but not charging it 6 times a day makes me like it more. If you even have a question, and I actually know the answer, feel free to ask me! I'm only about 2 months in but there's a ton of smart people here in this sub. 
Lisa Lampanelli was in my class (although, very briefly I think she dropped out because she was touring or doing a play). You're never too old bud, I think she's in her mid 50's and has a career already.
well the smell and taste is stronger in concentrate forms , but the smell from dabbing it is far less pungent than smoking a joint ! and it's a perfect pain medication with the right strains.
It's not perfect, but I can get 4x4k rounds in one game... Fairly good. Could def be better tho.Anyway, my point is that I get 3ks not because I aim better (although I usually do, it's not like I have nades or gamesense) but rather because I stand still and don't spam. I am ultra consistent on pistol rounds, always a double or triple kill, sometimes a quad. Gun rounds I am far less consistent - this is because all the other players limit themselves by addadada spam on pistol rounds fucking with their accuracy, but they don't on gun rounds. Anyway, my point isn't that I am decent, it is that against my equals, I rek shit on pistol. Always. 
Never thought I'd hear that in my life, but you're entitled to your opinion. While Larry isn't awful, since I've been watching most of his episodes, I feel as if his jokes are not as funny and his personality is bland. The satire Colbert used was more intelligent and his personality was far better. I find LWT to be very hit or miss. What I do like is that he tries to have both sides represented, but sometimes fails at it. For example he had an all black panel and every one of them agreed with the riots in Baltimore and one even said the mom shouldn't have disciplined her child. Then there was the episode with some anti vaxing old lady and while she blabbed about some statistics about autism no one even refuted her ideas, with the exception of another guest calling her dumb. Then there's the social media, but I won't get into that.
1. Maybe not the same, but I'll add a comment.  A vendor I worked with sent their techs out with their per diem loaded on pre-paid visa cards.  The techs were good guys, this was one of my favorite vendors.  But a 19 year old cabling tech may not have the credit, or money management skills to use a credit card for business use, or even have a credit card at all.  When they got back from a trip, they'd turn in their pre-paid cards to be reloaded come the next trip.  
I never understand most 'concept' cars, but with some refinement I could totally get behind this...not that it would ever come to the US. Right now we're searching for a DUV "Dog utility vehicle" and nothing has quite hit all of the marks I want. Alas.
.... Do you even know what DPI stands for? Or at least in what context it's used?It's used to quantify the distance between pixels, meaning it's not only dependant on resolution but also screen size. If you wanted to get a DPI of 1080 on a 27" screen you'd need a resolution of about 28000x15000, or 420000000 pixels.
Ugh, same thing happens with my cat. All her damn toys end up under the stove because for some reason, she loves to get ALL of her toys out. She can't just play with one.    I swear she has ADD
Yeah but I'm coming from Philly suburbs. The easiest and quickest way to NYC is picking up a train in Jersey. It'll take me 30 min to get to the train station (and this will be at rush hour so probably longer) and the trains only come so often. The train ride itself could be anywhere from 60-90 minutes long depending on which one I catch. In the city, I might be able to use GPS, but with my luck it won't work.  
Well, if the small infractions still count as a bounty then we are all screwed. Hopefully those change to a fine and when you dock, you can pay them off. 
The few people on this obscure site/subreddit would eventually tell others (who hasn't heard of FNAF by now honestly?), who would eventually get to the fanbase.
Becoming a super alien killer during an alien attack in various houses I have lived in and places I have visited. Never make it to final boss because I wake up. 
To be fair, you won't actual be evil if you side with them. I believe it is said that the Noir storyline will be focused around being the good guys who are part of an evil faction and trying to chance the faction from the inside. Which actually sounds way more interesting IMO.
As a casual reader, I want the guy that bought the last 5 copies at my LCS today when I got into the store to roll in a bed of cacti. Because of him, I won't be able to read the story until my LCS gets the second printings in (however long that will take). 
"Collection" and "Complete" in the same sentence... only possible if you own at least one of every. single. LEGO. set that was ever made.Unless you're talking about collecting all of each theme, then, maybe, possibly, you could put the two words in the same sentence sooner. ;)
[Easy](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/zemir-begic-gave-life-for-wife_n_6249302.html) and hardly a peep on reddit. Don't try and pull this bullshit, reddit is massively anti cop and has a huge SJW population. Any time this happens there is only excuses and white blaming for everything that happens in the black community. On reddit any mention of black on white racism garners the same "aww poor under privileged whitey", fucking repulsive SJW's are the worst kind of racists around.
No, I'm saying that within the context of this whole conversation, "white" privilege is "white American privilege". You keep making assumptions about what I'm saying, and I feel it's only in an effort to get a "gotcha" moment.
Teaching/tutoring? If people are comfortable talking to you and you're generally pretty personable maybe contact a local senior center/library/community college and teach basic computer literacy. The people that show up will actually want to be there so they probably won't shit on you.
I internally side-eye anyone that talks about how good it is to be "non-PC".I feel like what they're really saying is "I don't care if I offend or downright insult someone or a group of individuals. My right to speak trumps your right to be upset about what I said."
It's a good defense, really.  Because someone will eventually come around and change your entire perspective on dating, which in many cases, takes a rare person to accomplish for someone.
Ya it's a store fine i get that but don't call a section "just for you" and the post the three same games under each heading. And my gripe is that there isn't alot of variation. As is shown when I play mortal Kombat and get suggested the crew, dark souls and border lands...same games i hot suggested from GTAI have a us account but now I have to log in a someone else to play games when it should be a global market.

Get them cheap stress balls and tell them that if they must fidget you much prefer if they play with them as they are silent. Hopefully that helps a bit... 
I'm convinced this is how our brain prepares us for the worst case scenario so that we have some kind of 'experience' dealing with it if something goes wrong.
Makes sense. Do a map for the general populous, not the specialists. (Personal note: I've enjoyed the visuals as much as the gameplay, when watching the playthroughs, so I'm happy either way)Though I must admit, the malign part of me want to see a map especially tailored to bring Z to his knees. Z seems to enjoy the extreme challenges, and I'm sure, at least for a one off, you map makes would enjoy putting the hurt down and provoking a Z death :) 
It's the truth that women face certain dangers that men don't, but mentioning that fact is not a statement of support for violence against women, it's just mentioning an unfortunate fact. Don't shoot the messenger (mayor). Sure, both males and females can be raped, but in light of a young woman who was raped, the mayor made a point to address women, and there's nothing offensive about that, except for those who tend to make being offended their lifestyle.
 ive decided to do a nuzlocke, but i think after i finish i will try a few solo runs with bred pokemon, ill see how that goes.Thanks for the input everyone!
I could not go back and watch them.Im a night owl and they were on at the perfect time for me. Late as fuck when im just looking for crap to watch before falling asleep.
Drinking my first one tonight while watching the draft.  The gose is literally the best I've had.  Did my shopping tonight too, might have bought too much for my match, not sure how I'm gonna fit it all in the box!
Yeah, I play the pilot and just sit behind the first jet until it's time to land, easy but boring.Still haven't successfully completed though. Randoms getting ran over, shot - last night three of us made it to the beach and the last guy parachuting went splat...FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

I cooked the ones in the end result the full 25 minutes. I made some this morning and took em out at 20, and they were a great soft boiled type consistency. Just enough to hold their shape, but not overdone.You'll just have to play with the times to get it perfect. I've found that 18 to 20 minutes is perfection for my tastes.
The stats are definitely different.  The problem isn't whether it's *likely* to be trans, the problem is that we all assume that we're cis until proven otherwise.  It may be unlikely, but it should still be considered and that consideration shouldn't be stigmatized.  I think that's the point the article is trying to make: if we take off the pressure to *prove* our identity, fluidity and uncertainty can be a lot more comfortable.
I think you're right. If he wants to be seen as a flyer by all means. Cubs need 6th and 7th inning help right now.  So anyone who can not colossally screw that up I'm fine with. And I mean Edwin Jackson is still on the team. 
Hey, I made this gif! Always like seeing it in the wild. Edit: I went through a years worth of comments, and finally found where I [first uploaded it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1nvd1h/this_just_came_out_of_my_girlfriends_vagina_nsfl/ccmke0v)
You said it was basically murder because of the amount. It doesn't matter how much is imported because it is not all going to one person. It does matter how much is taken by any one person and what it is cut with. To say that they basically committed murder because of the amount is disingenuous. The crime is clearly not treated similarly to murder as several actual murderers were granted clemency only very recently. It definitely is drawing too long a bow.
Ah, could be. We had a couple of American students this year who were amazed when they got to Devon pubs because the only cider they'd had was Strongbow. Aussies might be more fortunate in that regard.
And the Liberal version of this bill is still very similar to the CPC's while very different from the NDP's.  Even if the LPC had a majority we would still be getting most of C-51 because this is the version the Liberal Party supports.It's not that difficult:  If the NDP gets elected, we get a gutted C-51 with some good parts left.  If the Liberals or CPC get elected, we get nearly all the same portions of the bill except now with ineffective oversight.
Yes. Actually better than the T-Mobile version, ironically.You will get 2G, 3G in metro areas, and LTE bands 2 (rural) and 4 (metro). No wifi calling and no band 12, but you will be in better shape than the T-Mobile M8. 
THE ELITIST FUCKS WHO ACT LIKE THEY'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS GAME SINCE THE DAY THEY CAME OUT OF THEIR MOTHER'S WOMB AND ARE ALWAYS SAYING, "YOUR ARMOR IS TOO LOW," "NO (INSERT WEAPON HERE) PLAYERS ALLOWED," OR ANY OTHER FUCKING DISCRIMINATING SHIT GET REALLY OLD REALLY FAST. HEY, MAYBE THEIR FUCKING PLAIN SKILL IS GOOD ENOUGH TO GET AROUND THEIR ARMOR'S WEAKNESSES. YOU DON'T FUCKING KNOW. THEY COULD BE AN ORIGINAL MH PLAYER AND YOU WOULDN'T FUCKING KNOW BECAUSE YOU BITCH ABOUT THIS SHIT AND THEN KICK IMMEDIATELY.
Lo de siempre: ambigüedad para conseguir votos PePerro-PoPulistas. Un apoyo a Grecia, como una defensa de la democracia venezolana sería contradictorio con dicha política. Tal vez la dimisión de Monedero haya que verla por ahí. Pero con CIUTADANS no hay nada que hacer: ya no queda sitio para quitarles votos a los PePerro-PoPulistas si no es hacerse más de derechas, más radicales de derechas, más de extrema derecha que ellos ¿Es ese el objetivo de PODEMOS?
I am not sure on the warranty part but for me to get a dent removed and have it painted I was quoted between $600-1200. Small shop and large shop prices. My dent is at an awkward spot so that's also a factor, I would expect at least $500 for a bumper repaint because they have to sand it, prime it and paint it and then blend it which is more work then it sounds like. 
It's lag, things like that happen all the time when playing people with bad connection, the ball will look like it's doing one thing then warp somewhere else
I wasen't saying I can afford them but ya you make a very good point, still though a sale is a sale and it seems Nintendo can choose anytime they want to release preorders and it will sellout, I just don't think they would care about whether or not people are at work/sleeping, it'd be nice if they did in an ideal world
Just a cap and gown :)And we were just having some issues and decided we needed time apart from each other. I feel like those issues aren't really there anymore though because the issues were about stuff that happened in our past relationship. And me and her have both definitely matured in the last 7 months.We've been holding hands for the past 2 days, but we didn't hold hands today. Idk I'm just analyzing the shit out of everything lol and I'm going to a party tomorrow night and she's gonna be there and just ahghahgag
While I agree the Bhopal disaster was a terrible tragedy, and that it's disgusting that the actual sufferers of the disaster haven't had their damages compensated. I would like to point out that Union Carbide purposely built that plant in the middle of nowhere so that any disaster would be mitigated because it was in the middle of nowhere. The workers at the plant erected shanty towns around the plant. I'm in no way blaming the workers for the accident, or saying that it's their fault they died etc, just felt I should point that out because I like sharing.
My dad is a mechanic and buys old cars off his clients and flips them. Sells them to other people for awesome prices. Doesn't give a shit about the games involved and he's been selling to the same people for over a decade. 
Is Kareem the consensus #2 on most people's lists?  I feel like currently there isn't a consensus #2.  I feel like Lebron is well on his way, but that is projecting that he wins a 2-3 more titles and plays until he is in his late 30s, which would mean he break a lot of records.
The Android Lollipop update for the Note 4 was just released in Australia. Do you recommend upgrading to make sure everything still works, or refraining to avoid potential problems at this late stage
Vastly so.  I don't know if anyone here remembers what EU3 releases were like, but to say CK2 and onwards have been an incredible improvement is an understatement.
As far as COD4 goes. There is still an active player base that peaks up to about 500 per day. Since the matches are player hosted, some have active admins that ban cheaters. Also there are servers with mods like prop hunt. Awesome stuff, cod 4 is best cod.
Thanks for the response bro.  Do you think the various compounds were necessary to acheive your physique?  I mean, do you think that you could have just ran test at 500mg and Mast at 700mg permanently?  Im trying to figure out if you think you needed all of those compounds.
I just made it up on my lunch break at work because he said he needed a Van Gogh script. Would people really enjoy something that crazy? I mean, I would, but I'm a fucking weirdo.
See. That description could also work for Gryffindor. Both houses value loyalty and friendship. I guess it'd be up to him to choose between valuing justice or bravery (adrenaline stuff).

She did, actually, which, thinking about it, makes it even more creepey.  She moved from Nevada to Ohio to live with her sister. She never talked about it again that I know of, we sort "lost touch" after she moved, AKA my father thought she was insane and didn't really want her around or talking to us, even though he saw what we all did and just passed it off as an aggressive stray dog. She's actually still alive, but she's in her 90's now. I've thought about calling her before and asking about what happened more, but I don't want to cause her to have a heart attack or something o-o. 
Black Driver decides who lives or dies.They will try to stay away from Lance. He already knows Diggle/Felicity/Laurel work with Arrow. Only Thea is the new member.
between the ages of 7 and 14, I had almost nightly nightmares regarding kidnapping, murder, and rape, because my father let me watch shit like law and order svu as a child. The worst one were when I'd be held down and I'd have to listen to the sounds of my friends, my very young sister, or my mother being beaten and raped. I still get flighty when I hear certain people screaming because of that connection. Nowadays, I have recurring dreams about some really stressful topics. One that rolls around every month or so is both my parents dying and having to fight my abusive grandmother for custody of my sister in court. Things that involve death in the family happen infrequently. between 13-15ish, lots of dreams where I'm forced to turn tricks, or someone I know is, and those were horrible. Some about being buried alive.  My formative years were very paranoid and not very happy.
I just pulled everything in that box. It was full of cabbages, chard and snap pea do it could have. I've come across this before in a few of my 30g smart pots. On those occasions I threw the soil away. This was from a soft ball sized colony do I wasn't as worried about it. I just thought I'd see what you guys had to say.

Heya! It does seem like TN has very few abdl's. I made a post myself here and got no replies.  I'm based out of the Johnson City area, how about you? What's up?
I assume you found that 8.5 second window through testing. My question is, what happens during those 3.5 seconds between the 5 seconds buff ending and the 8.5 second window to change your single target healing auto attacks into a party healing auto attack? Does it just give you the enhanced party buff even though you don't have the old buff anymore?
I didn't vote at all on yours, because I wasn't sure if you were trying to point out his hidden implication or trying to reaffirm his hidden implication.
Same here, dude. I don't see anything unreasonable about what you said. Trouble is, I expect there are plenty of hams on this sub that disagree with us.
Sexual and or physical abuse done by women.I understand, statistically guys are more likely and or more able to abuse women and children. And they should be punished for doing so.But women can also abuse men and children, both sexually and physically. Yet many people see it as a lesser crime just because they're a woman. The crime is the same, regardless of gender or sex. It should be punished the same.
Don't forget that Quarries and Mines also generate some coal.  And they boost your mining percentage a LOT, so by the time you can build them your mining bonus should be enough to easily make up for the amount you lose from Smelters.  I'd recommend maxing out Smelters and Mines whenever you have the resources to spare, that should keep you supplied with plenty of coal.  The hit you take to wood and minerals from the Smelters will cease to be relevant eventually.  Smelters also produce Iron and Gold, which you'll always need, and eventually you can upgrade them to make Titanium, which will MASSIVELY boost your production of that if you've got a good supply of Smelters to start with.  Once you unlock Geologists, they're very useful to have, especially when upgraded.  If your coal production starts to exceed iron production, it'll be hard to make much steel, so that's when you should probably back off on the coal or build more Calciners.  
I noticed the same thing. Between stops, the speed is merely an artefact of the timetable. But over a long stretch that includes stops and stations, the relative speed of two vehciles can be fairly compared.
Definitely go with the black vinyl. You dont need much and its super easy to do. All you need is a squeegee and a razor blade. That same thing happened to me on my '03 and it came out great.
increasing wages != more money in the economy. Quantitative easing == more money in the economy. All increase wages does is shift money around, doesn't increase the money supply.
Well we do like our oats. :) (I know it's a typo and you meant pat)It'd be quite funny if after trying to leave and being begged to stay, we pissed rUK off enough for them to dump us. Especially since as per last September it'd be against our will.I'd rather it ended amicably with cooperation and a genuine spirit of "we disagree on stuff so we should go our separate ways. Good luck!", but if it has to end in animosity, so be it. It just has to end.

The Balor bodypaint wasn't talked about by Meltzer or anyone. For the longest time it was a "wouldn't it be cool if he did it?" and people were talking about how WWE would never let him do it for a litany of reasons, copyright issues, company stuff, etc. Mets reported that, and it happened. That was all backstage talk before the special. He was wrong more times than he was right because it was pretty obvious whatever connect he still had at the company dried up. And that was pretty obvious around the Kalisto hairdresser thing. At least the AJ Lee thing made enough sense. I wouldn't be surprised to hear someone got pregnant on their honeymoon. But the Kalisto thing was so dumb. Point is, he was an ex employee. He had a source. It dried up. But he wasn't bullshitting from the start. That's how you seem to make it sound.

My mom, dad, cousins (im the youngest of the older cousins, i have a good bit of cousins that are at least 10 years older than me and a good bit that are my age group but still older and alot that are at least 10 years younger) aunts and uncles all smoked.  They weren't shy about it, but they always told me to go outside and play because of adult time (aka we are about to blaze a fatty). Then as i got older, they showed it it me and said basically that this was stuff adults did, like drinking a beer. It was always a normal thing. They never stigmatized it. It was just something that was for adults. I was never taught to be scared of it but i was taught to respect it as something that you got to enjoy when you were old enough.
Blasted out? Its called blown out. Photography has been a hobby of mine for quite a few years. I like his photo better because its a better representation of the scene.

&gt;We do understand it.No you don't:&gt;Evolution= Something came from nothing, on accident.The Theory of Evolution says nothing whatsoever on the origin of life. It requires that life exist beforehand as a prerequisite, and does not suggest a mechanism for life to begin in the first place.So I will repeat: *no you don't.*If you have genuine questions and would genuinely like to know how it works, then as a Biology graduate and a Masters student in Ecology, I'll be happy to answer them and promise to be more respectful and neutral than I am in this post. But let me reiterate once more: with a statement like that, it is absolutely clear that you do not know what the Theory of Evolution is about, and thus are not currently in a position to submit a meaningful opinion on the topic.
Huh. I had no idea you could change the transmit power level on these. I'll have to take another look at mine.I'll be pedantic here, but even if you lower the power, it's the unit itself that matters. The Baofengs simply have not been certified (by the FCC) to meet the requirements to transmit over FRS/GMRS frequencies.Now that's of course not stopping anyone from using them. I just think that anyone buying one of these radios should know this. Better to know this than be surprised if they find the one random ham operator who decides to tell the FCC (which, while rare, [does happen](http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Welcome.html). And just look at those fines!).

I don't think anyone can really even begin to answer that especially without input from Will. His outburst and the extent of his hatred seemingly came from nowhere. There has to be something more to his outburst other than Shirin questioning him. Shirin stated in her RHAP interview that she felt that there was tension between them before the outburst, but when she tried to talk about it with Will he refuted it. In an extra clip she also said she was happy when Will had to leave the survivor Auction. All of this hatred between Will and Shirin is seemingly new to us. Is it possible it had something to do with her identity? Certainly, I just don't think we have a whole lot to go on.

Any studies done on forward knee travel?  The reason I ask is that once you position the bar, you can only change back angle with knee travel (anterior/posterior) and stance width (which changes effective femur segment length).  I'm wondering if the forward knee travel is a more consistant diagnostic tool than back angle, as it has less parametric dependencies.

When the alternative is a couple deaths and/or continual bitching about lack of wards, of course it's acceptable to grab one! What kind of question is that?I also.. had this game the other night. I was on tilt from a traumatizing support match so I ragepicked Flint, but I kinda felt bad for it when I saw the lineup, so I bought upgrade and a bunch of wards.. and very quickly gave up on trying to out-lh our Sillyhat. Still had an item or two in the end, it wasn't so bad.
I'm currently in comp sci, and our second Java course professor told us this exact story, where they somehow made it to third year without knowing the BASICS of the language such as variable declarations and method headers/ blocks. No chance this happened in atlantic Canada?

I say this at the risk of being "that guy", but I'd love to see a print version of this.  I'd gladly pay for it, so long as the price was reasonable. Nothing will ever beat the smell of books, the feeling of a hardcover, or the crispness of new pages 
It's actually something I'm kind of proud of, to be honest. I work for a large GC in a pretty large market (DC, NOVA, Baltimore) and compliance is something that is important to us. We not only develop and build our own projects, but we do the same for third party clients, as well as renovating and remodeling existing buildings. Depending on how the project is designed and financed, we comply with FHA, ADA and the hardcore standard of the bunch, [UFAS](http://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/buildings-and-sites/about-the-aba-standards/ufas). After completion, every project we complete is inspected by the [EOC] (http://eoc.govmu.org/English/Pages/default.aspx) and certified as compliant. I really hope I'm not coming off as a know-it-all prick, but getting all this stuff right the first time is a BFD, and kind of a fun challenge for me.  
Great job on these!  Love the story so far!I hope you don't mind things pointed out but I think &gt;Maxwell and Jones led Durretts into the company building.Should be:Maxwell and Jones led **Borton** into the company building.
It will kill your firstborn and make you impotent at the same time. It's all a reflex by the body to ensure it doesn't ever happen again. Kinda of like huge iron safes falling from the sky, landing on kids named hitler. It's nature's way of population control. 
This is why I do not like this community. You were outraged that Riot would dare sell recolored skins, not less than a week ago. Now it's like "I'll buy it anyways if you are still going to do it anyways" ... How quickly can our minds forget?
Then whoever taught you the meaning of atheism was wrong. Just like a theist is anyone who believes in a god, and that covers a variety of religions and viewpoints, an atheist is the exact opposite. There are even atheistic religions, which only further prove that the word 'atheist' and its variations can be used as an adjective to describe a wide array of beliefs, or non beliefs for that matter.

Those rules are not a necessary evil, it's flawed logic. Adults have a much bigger potential capacity for assholeism, simply because we have been around longer and know how stuff works. What is a younger than 12 year old kid going to do in a lego that a reasonably healthy adult can not handle? I am tiny , but the skills needed for dealing with nasty adults do not go out the window just because the nastyness is coming from somewhere closer to the floor. I am going to confess to being a misantrope as well as childfree, so I would much prefer rules to keep all nasty people, and not just the younger ones out of awesome stores.

I don't think she was truly out of her depth even with Tyrion and Joffrey dicking around until Tywin showed up to show her how someone really leads a house.
I really don't think it's all that weird. You say in the comments that there is playful pushing and stuff, but unless you're an exaggerated version of Danny and his sister (From Friends) there shouldn't be a problem.&gt; People who browse reddit are also like, weirdos and not like normal people in society. Like, you have to have a few screws missing to be a redditor and like the content.Ok there buddy. Not to be a defensive "weird redditor", but this guy is off his rocker. I have a rebuttal for him:"People who are against two siblings living together are also like, weirdos and not like normal people in society. Like, you have to have a few screws loose to believe it's weird and to have a problem with it."You also state that in the comments that he was jealous of your brother. I mean WTF?! Who the hell is jealous of someone's sibling?
So it's like The Island, only instead of clones being used  for transplants who think they're going to a resort, it's about food items that doesn't realise they're food. Gotcha.

I've been in the process of transferring my money from BofA to Ally. While they don't have any physical locations (I use mobile banking almost exclusively, so this is no problem for me), they have stellar customer service, hardly any fees at all, 24/7 support, *and* they have really good interest rates for their accounts. As long as you aren't doing cash deposits, you shouldn't have a problem.
I live with my grandparents currently, and they're asking us all to move out in 6-8 months. (My mostly deaf mother, sister, jobless brother and his girlfriend who works constantly.) They both want to travel the world, and I guess they don't trust us to take care of their house while they're not here.So of course I have that to look forward to. I'm just trying to get my GED as soon as possible, get that first job so I can hopefully somehow help support everyone when the inevitable happens, while also trying to kickstart what I want to do in life, which is write stories.It's really great that you're going to college! :D Hope everything works out alright for you.
Yeah, everyone bitches at Stannis for "sending a shadow demon to kill his brother!!!", conveniently forgetting that, 1. He did so in self-defense as that same brother was about to send an *army* to kill *him*.2. His method involved vastly less loss of life than Renly's.3. Renly was going against all the laws and conventions of their society in doing so, whereas Stannis was in the right according to hundreds of years of tradition.Stannis does have flaws, and he has done some messed up things, but this isn't an example of that.
Williams can be found in some supermarket chains. It can be rubbed directly on the face like Arko, though soaking it is necessary and some folks don't like getting their hand all soapy.I prefer Arko.
The local cable provider in Los Baños always shows Pac fights live and for free so I could go home there. Alternatively, the management here in the office always orders Pac PPVs for the whole company to watch in the pantry. So I could also stay here instead.
Thanks, that's kind of what I figured based on intuition of throwing a sock with a rock in it in the air, but right now it seems to flip with heavier end up. Maybe the drag profile overcomes that. I haven't put heat shields on yet, I wanted to see if engines could take the heat if I came in shallow enough. 
Sounds good, it's kinda first come first serve so you can pick whichever class you want or we can play a bit and see where we think you'd fit best (I'm gonna let samsung &amp; general have priority since they commented before you though so it may change if you all pick soldier). Feel free to add me on steam and I'm gonna make a group once I respond to everybody's post to organize things a little better.
Dowling's career was weird.  He was durable in HS and first 3 years at UVA.  SR year he just had a ridiculous string of injuries then get healthy only to reinjure his hamstring at the combine.  Then at NE ruins his hip and career pretty much ended there since he was so stiff.As for Chad Jackson I'd defend that pick.  The guy had really good hands and was good at getting open and had solid routes.  most saw him as a fringe first and he apparently interviewed well w/ belichick(but it was controversial overruling by Bill apparently). Hard to predict your WR would develop a hamstring issue in TC as a rookie and struggle to play through it after missing most of camp then tearing his ACL missing 07 camp.  Everything went wrong health wise for the guy and if you looked in 08 when he finally had a healthy training camp he lost so much athleticism.
The female machine operator at my welding job technically works in the "same industry" as me, but earns $10 to my $13, not because of gender discrimination, but because welders earn more money than unskilled labor. 
You do not need to touch someone to bully them. They need to talk to a local attorney if they are thinking of legal action against the school and/or teacher
I am looking for Chip to go crazy and draft only quarterbacks, have thirteen some odd QBs and try them all. I forget who mentioned Chip making an all QB offense, but that would be super fun to watch and would actually make me watch an eagles  game
That's how I feel about the cheeseburger from a hospital cafeteria in St. Louis. My brother wasn't too happy when he found out that his appendicitis was what lead to me having the best cheeseburger I've ever had.
It literally makes no sense and goes back the days of where sky fucking high estrogen was considered a good thing. A lot shit from the 70s and 80s still propagates its ass around the culture even to this day. 
He was the clear #1 because he was the cleaner prospect, though Winston is a much better prospect in terms of talent. Mariota being clean off the field put him above Winston, though eventually Winston was able to convince the Bucs the off-the-field stuff was behind him. On the field, Winston is easily a superior prospect.
Okay, you make a valid point.Paying any field higher attracts a higher quality of people to that field.The question is do you think it will ever be economically sound to invest $100k a year into someone to teach our kids addition and subtraction? The job is just not that demanding.Do you think it'll ever be more economically sound than it is to pay $50k a year for that job and $150k (as opposed to $100k) for the genius at NASA trying to advance our civilization? 
Yeah MA is closed but they allow unaffiliated to vote. A little confusing. Prob a good idea to just register Democrat so you know for sure you can vote. I mean you can always reregister later.
Dude these bucks are fucking weak. Can't handle losing. At least the Bulls just whined when they were getting beat up, they didn't fucking assault people.
People make mistakes. Sometimes permanent ones. I mean my tats arent really "generic," but when I was 17 someone bet me I wouldnt have the balls to get a bic lighter tattooed across my heart, so of course I did it to win the bet. I'm 28 now and I really don't regret it. I only have 1 other tattoo on the center of my back that I somewhat regret; a biohazard symbol comprised of the earth in the center with various elements making up the 6 outer curves of the symbol. (i.e. one is an ice cliff opposite a curling wave of water, ones a potleaf opposite a curl of flames, etc). Also done when I was young, I went the cheap route (drew it myself, paid 350) but the tatto artist's rendition of it is mediocre at best (shoulda spent closer to 1k IMO, considering its complexity) but I hope to one day cover it up with the same design, slightly larger and with a much better execution. Besides, tattoo removal is fairly efficient these days, albeit expensive.
Simply put, it's taking this long, using both methods, so I say they're both fair game. However I have to agree that, if the PC release had led to the solution the next day due to code crawling, I woulda felt a little jipped. Basically, it's already proven so difficult, as long as I can watch it unfold here slowly I don't care how they find it.
I dunno. I'm European, and a lot of people, including Americans, tend to think I'm from the US or Canada. I think it's got something to do with being exposed to a language before you turn six or something. Thank you Cartoon Network.
But there are plugins that model how old compressors added their character. Digital compressor can easily sound "perfect" but most don't because modeling off vintage year gives that character to the sound. 
It's been about a year for me, and I still have trouble isolating the more subtle flavors and scents. Key ones like char, oak, caramel, raisins, vanilla, peat, smoke, and tereyaki/bbq are readily apparent, but most are still lost on me. I smell, or taste, and write down the first thing that pops into my mind.
Perhaps this surplus of synthetic drugs is MKultra 2.0, CIA gets foreign countries to manufacture these substances and addicts inevitably do the testing for them. No more slipping LSD-50 in prostitutes drinks for them.
Probably Ele again. D/D Ele has that hybrid cross where you can "tank" while doing effective damage once your "procs", in this case Might stacking, goes into play. You have "bleeds" in the form of... well, Bleeding and Burning. D/D Ele can stick both of those fairly reliably. Anything I say in quotes means that the term doesn't technically exist in GW2. I'd say the closest to Feral is still D/D Ele.No stealth though, unlike Feral. But you have a number of blast finishers so you can use one of those in an Engineer or Thief's smoke field and gain stealth from it.Edit: As far as the combo points mechanic goes, that'd be Warrior. I wouldn't say Warrior is close to Feral though. 
Round roast, locally sourced, with carrots, potatoes, onions, and mushrooms, simmered in home-made beef broth and 1/4 c. of red wine vinegar.  Sprigs of fresh rosemary, garlic, and bay leaves.  10 hours on low.  Dee-lish!  P.S. I never pre-brown/sear the meat anymore because I am super lazy.  Tastes great nonetheless!

I remember this interview where you and Liam were pissed with each other, you saw a cricket bat in the room and both of you went for it because whoever didn't get the bat would get hit. I know you're a huge football fan, but are you into cricket at all?

But guys, why would I play my [[Medomai, the ageless]] turns deck if I can't get more than 2 turns in a row... and no politics, why would I play multiplayer if it wasn't for the politics.
I think it's even dumber that they banned Porygon2 and PorygonZ from appearing in any episodes. Like, PorygonZ came out 10 years after the episode aired. Get over it.
1) would you ever go critical strike reds or lifesteal quints? Also your thoughts on scaling versus flat MR.2) I've played yasuo in every role, and support is by far the worst, but I have found a surprising amount of success on jungle yasuo. Do you think jungle yasuo is...well not viable but maybe tier 2?3) Do you go so much AD in the rune page for consistency in games?4) Is there ever a situation where you want to build anything but static shiv first? I find static shiv rush to be the only way to fly personally. 5) Do you consider Yasuo a tank buster?
But that's the thing, what if he doesn't have a friend to introduce him?And how is school not a social setting? You're with your friends and a bunch of people. You talk, you joke, you're... how should I put this... social? Yeah, that's the word I'm looking for. If you uncomfortable for someone trying to be your friend, I honestly feel really sorry for you. I wouldn't mind it at all if a girl or guy came up to me and introduced themselves to me anywhere... except the bathroom.
"We look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended, and we will participate vigorously in that debate." The 9/11 commission report.

Every single thing he says on Keys Open Doors with that beat behind him is insane. His Comedy Central verse is fucking nuts too, but there's so many that are crazy. Can't pick 1.Edit: if I had to pick one it'd be the whole Keys Open Doors verse probably
That's actually not that big... Like MadamNerd said normal is anything between 5-10lbs. Plus, the measurements as you get bigger are a little harder to be accurate. Ultrasound can be off by a lb or two in either direction.

The three tacos is a meal for one. The two steak things in the middle is another meal for one. The sliders would be an acceptable meal, and the two other things could work together as a meal for one. Not sure what they are.

I've had recurring injuries for the last 8 years. Regularly rolling my ankles, bung knees, painful lower back. FINALLY spoke with a specialist who did some tests and found my hips were angling forward and pulling my muscles tight across my lower back. The loosened the surrounding muscles, freed up a couple of vertebrae and has given stretches for my glutes and hamstrings to keep the hips free.For the first time in nearly a decade I am pain free. It's amazing how everything is connected in and around that hip area. 
My dad and I had watched that show about 10 times (maybe a little more?) Before he caught it. He backed it up so we could watch it again.Love going back to it and seeing how they put in all this detail. You get a lot of those "now this makes total sense" moments.
You'd have to get a roommate for &lt;1000. Most places near downtown are 1500+ for 1BR. 2BR's around Brickell start around 2000+ so that's likely not within your price range.If living near where you work is the most important (with your price range in mind), then you're pretty limited to living in Overtown / Little Havana / Coral Gables (listed in order of distance) with a roommate.You might be able to do 3BR in Brickell, not completely sure about this though

In the very beginning of the bible, god appears to be talking to others, so you could even make the argument that Christianity is polytheistic, but there is only one deity who deals with humans on Earth.
I hope he does add it, this is a really good quality fan item, not OP unless you know how to use it, and even then it's only slightly stronger than normal orbitals.  Great item
Nearly every house has a fridge and many have air condition, but it took only 15 years come up with a plan to phase out ozone depleting substances and the ozone layer is already recovering. Even in 1988, one year before the Montreal Protocol, DuPont wrote to the senate: "There is no available measure of the contribution of CFCs to any observed ozone change...".Today we have electronic banking and money moves with light speed around the planet. I wouldn't bet on greenhouse gases make it any slower.
Oh man or you play a team so weak that your coach decides that not enough fitness happened during the game so he makes you do sprints to make up for it? I wonder when I see these 9-0 games on the sub if the players on barca/real have post game fitness training. 
The only reason Jay needs to frame anyone, is if *he* killed Hae.So, are you saying that Jay killed Hae, a girl he barely knew, on a day he spent using Adnan's car and cellphone, on a day he met up with Adnan multiple times and spent hours with him, in a murder plot that leaves Jay with two cars to move around? Even though the cell phone, which is in Jay's possession (he's making calls), is nowhere near Hae when she's abducted? And even though the cell phone pings Leakin Park while Adnan agrees it is in his possession, minutes after he calls Yasser?That's absurd.

* I'll switch it up with a / 4,  I think at that point it will, even at 15 damage, only likely get a max of 5 successes ever, so that'd just be two rounds, if even. I'll add in a cooldown of however many rounds it applied for + 1 as a cooldown.* It'd require a fair bit of XP to get to 4, and that'd basically be when Aero's reaching her prime I'd imagine.
San Diego? IE? La? Orange County? If its dry I would get a swamp cooler they are cheap to operate and kick ass as long as its not too humid. If its humid don't bother.
Reading back what I wrote I totally sound like a cunt for something pointless. Sorry 'bout that. It's been a long day at work. But I kind of disagree as most of those accounts were dead in the water for a long time before people decided to scavenge for them. So it seems weird to believe that they exist as some sort of community account when literally no one cared that they existed for a long time until people 'needed' them. 
This is where Jesus takes the food forbidden in Leviticus and has Peter eat of it. Saying what God has made is clean and not for man to declare unclean. Thereby allowing Christians to eat the forbidden foods once again.
Wut.&gt;The BBB has ways to report stuff like this anonymouslyThe fuck does the BBB have to do with this? He needs to go to the local labor board.

I was worried for a minute about what a creepy guy with hypnotic powers could do to Misaki, but then it shows that he's scared of girls. Guess Misaki can still be Usui's. I just hope that the hypnosis won't be undone with 'the power of love'
You have to understand. I really really don't care. It's not a big part of my life. I just don't tip. I don't think about it. I have other things in my life that are more important to me than tipping. You being angry at me won't change that. I'm glad you like tipping. You keep tipping! It's good. I just don't really give a fuck. You have to understand sometimes people won't care about tipping as much as you. We don't really want to get into Internet arguments about tipping. It's kind of shitty to me. I respect that you enjoy it though. I mean no insult. 
Some. But there are plenty of rappers out there that talk about the hypocrisy of this. The necessity to make the most out of your situation. Big boi from outkast says Before you RE up, get a laptopMake a business for yourself, boy, set some goalsMake a fat diamond out of dusty coals" He's saying if you have a laptop you can make good out of a bad situation. It's people like you that take this art form and degrade it and blow it off when it is the word of the people. And yes the is occasionally references to violence that's because they come from communities where violence is prevalent. 
Just do it. Just cry. I went NC with my mom over a year ago and there are still days when i want to cry. Sometimes I just want my mom. I want to be able to.call her up and say, hey guess what your grandson did today! I want to share so many things with my mom. But i have to realize, shes never really been my mom. Its just who i wish she would have been that i want contact with. I miss my family all the time, but I realize she will never be the mom i need her to be for me to have her in my life. Good luck, and dont be ashamed to let it out. 
She gives me regular positive signs, but she's kinda _always_ given me them. It's really hard to seperate "her being nice" from actual romantic hints :D
(OOC: Not sure if you're talking about my coat, or someone else showing up. I'll assume the coat for now).*'He's bleeding? Whatever.

"Okay, if someone doesn't respond I'm assuming we're having a code NE-C89 and ditching this unit."Not that those words meant anything, but it might tip anyone who knew they were fake off. People who responded confirming a code NE-C89 were untrustworthy, though it was possible people would know it was fake anyways.  Edit: Just noticed the other response below.

&gt;What a fucking asshole. This is why I hate Stewart now. I lost pretty much all respect for him after the Ward incident (Don't give a fuck what you say, just watch the video I made on it) and then I saw how much of an asshole he is. I hope he never wins another race in his goddamn career.&gt;Guess what it also shows? Kevin Ward diving out of the way at the last second, Tony REVVING THE ENGINE, and WARD ON CAMERA. It was both of their faults, but mainly Tony's.Seems to be a little more than disrespect to a driver that irks you.
I hear ya.  I mean I never had pack luck to begin with and best I ever got was a TOTW Dougie Hamilton, but it was nice to have those contracts weekly.  Seems like after every game now I'm having to go back to the AH.
I love that people are becoming more aware of this and appreciate wrestling for what it really is. Fuck even I stopped watching around 2 years ago and only recently got back into it thanks to the *wrestling is not wrestling* video, and a small recommendation from TB.
Just make sure you get to level 10 on at least one character so you have a named legacy. Then yes, and you can even create a throwaway level 1 alt if you don't want to move your original character for whatever reason.

I've read all of Reed and Deconnick. They're actually very equal to each other. I do think Reed gives us a bit more in terms of Carol's characterization. Her personality and motivations are clearer. As I remember, the story did get kinda strange and scattered near the end though. I'm not sure what's available on Marvel Unlimited/what you've read, but Deconnick had a rather noticeable quality drop after Infinity. A lot of the current stuff is "generic superheroine in space."

There's a lot of ambiguous images. Here's the full video, putting it up on top: http://www.gfycat.com/JadedWigglyFlyImages are outdated, it's all on video.
Would you agree that evolving and changing are synonymous? Based on what criteria did you formulate your response? I've recently read about European Union regulators laying down groundwork for antitrust charges against google. They claim google acted abusively in terms of attempting monopolization of the market. Similar to the 1999 case against microsoft case, they are being compared. Microsoft was found guilty and forced to change their ways paving the way for Google to take over the market. Criteria used was lack of technological change in the foreseeable future and lack of substitutes. Airlines are in fact part of a rapidly changing market, they are changing as fast as search engines change, even on a quarterly basis.
Except I doubt that, because the top paragraph talks about promoting diversity. That sounds like minorities will get bonus points to make sure there is a diverse group to receive the awards. If it was just a demographics survey, I'd be fine with it, but it certainly doesn't look like it is that. 
Talking about max betting on LG or some dumb shit like that.  I mean, with the odds, placing something small on LG isn't a bad idea, but his post was just filled with the most obvious odd-swaying crap.
I think a combination of I, V, and VIII is what is most likely to be revealed about Kylo.    I think Kylo is Anakins grandson and falls to the dark side at some point in his training. He then becomes obsessed with Vader and the sith in general. They'll save the big reveal for episode VIII (possibly to Rey who might be his sister or cousin) in a scene mirroring Vaders reveal in V.    That's my personal favorite theory anyway, and would mirror the original trilogy and the prequels. 
I'm afraid I'm lost as well on what exactly you don't understand. Are you familiar at all with minecraft mods? If your not, then that makes a lot of sense, and I'm not sure honestly if this is the server you want. Most if not all mods either improve the UI, gameplay design, or simply add stuff to the game. The collection of mods I've chosen (as do most collections in all honesty) do all three. Furthermore my specific collection and configurations create a scenario that severely increases the difficulty of the game, although not without reward. What are you looking for in a server?
It's been talked about before and there is no reason for CBS to have Survivor air after the Super Bowl. Survivor is already a super successful show so it's pointless to have it be the show they show-off. Most likely you will see a newer show that has either started this year or will start next year be the show they show-off. That's how it works.
Dude you can do both... I work anywhere from 60 to 80 and get workouts in. You just have to be strategic and in the end you'll get more energy anyway. Which is great for being more efficient at work. It's the routine you need... Even if you break it for a legit reason like long hours one day here and there just keep it as much as possible.Any career that's lucrative will always be more than 50-60 hours a week.. Successful people don't get there with 40 hours a week. The trick is... Pack your gym stuff the night before... Be totally set to go and have a gym near work or home that has showers etc. You'll either go before or after every day you can. That prep takes 10 minutes.Any good habit requires investment to keep motivation. 
Tropical Freeze is what I'd love to play. I recently went through the original DKC with my girlfriend, and it helped her rediscover a long lost passion for games. It'd be great to to play TF with her and keep that ball rolling.
I want to start hoarding data. Is this what I want? E.g. build a small NAS machine that just focuses on storage size and redundancy/reliability. Any links, suggestions, tips appreciated. I'll be browsing in the hoarding sub, meanwhile.
You're not going to like the answer but here it is anyway.You can drink any beer you want, as long as you drink it on moderation. Moderation for someone who is used to just drinking whenever they want is likely to feel like not drinking at all.I love craft beer. I also love having visible abs. So I drink great craft beer maybe twice per month and only a couple bottles at any one time.Replacing food calories with beer calories is horrible advice. All calories are not the same. Beer calories are extra calories, which fine, as long as you enjoy them only occasionally.
So we're agreed. I suppose it would be foolish to assume we could just bide our time and wait it out? I'm certain contesting bans wouldn't fly so easily in other subreddits.
It's so cool that they are able to analyze this. My first one, drawn quickly, was about 100, but I got in the 7000's when I drew one slowly and carefully. Do you know what the maximum score is?
It's irresponsible and borderline child-abuse because, in reality, blowing smoke "towards a window" doesn't do shit and a lot of smoke will still be in the room. If your child has asthma, it'll make it worse. If he doesn't have it, it could cause him to develop it or at least give him some breathing troubles from time to time.

"When I started I took in the power so I could help my friends. The head of the Order back in Weewick, he wasn't exactly a good man and he is probably better off dead anyway.""Raymond is right to be worried, this girl hasn't done anything and likely isn't going to do anything horrible and what's the point if it drives away my friends."
I don't think Perception is completely wasted. I personally went with minimum Con and Int, raising Str and Dex to max and Res and Perc to 16 I think? Helps with deflection since you're in melee, and the interrupt boost is nice if you're using fast weapons that don't have great interrupt potential.
Actually the way it was originally expressed it was a rule about whether or not to view a movie at all. It's not hard to see how that leads to confusion about how it's applied.The fact that a over-simplified Named Test generates such buzz to me suggests more that people are easily manipulated by such presentations of information in general rather than it has something profound to illustrate.It illustrates one unbalance and elevates it mythic status, minimizing most others. It's not a great test, it's got great marketing. I'd rather endorse actual critical thinking and analysis than use cheap arguments for cheap points.
I love the Greek Freak and all, but that's a football hit. No way he couldn't stop himself and no way that was basketball related. He lowered the shoulder, and he should be glad Mike didn't get hurt.
One thing I still never understood was that Ultron was uploading himself into that machine. He was like 40%-60% done or something? Then they took it and were talking about putting Jarvis in. So does that make Vision 40%-60% Ultron? Did they somehow extract that part of the upload? Did we ever actually see them start to put Jarvis into the machine before Thor Frankenstein'd it to life? And it's nice that Stark had the time between Vision being born and the final fight to make himself a new Jarvis with a female voice.
I have no idea who you are, but I keep seeing your name on comments I like. This one had me cracking up: "Use your words" always funny to me.Stay awesome :D
Whenever  I hear this song it reminds me of his ibiza set where he started with [Deadmau5 - Fn Pig and transitions to this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehQVGeCiwtw). Say what you want about Armin but he sure knows how to put together an awesome set
Has anyone had any luck with any of Dollar Shave Club's new hair products? I was thinking of giving it a try, but I was wondering if anyone has had experience with it. I'm specifically looking at the clay.
I beg to differ...I love to work and I haven't taken a day off in 6months despite plenty of withdrawals in there...I'm also going back to school and it's not to quit but to get a real career I love...
Just my two cents:Is there any other projects you can use your PT wood for? I built my raised beds about four years ago using PT wood, at the time because of cost of cedar.  Despite the low risk of leaching, this year I decided to dismantle them and rebuild with cedar. I've now used the PT wood to build some stands for rain barrels and for part of a bike rack/shed - maybe there sre similar ways you can use your fence materials? 
Guess I hit a nerve huh?Didn't we just talk about not trying to mislead the conversation and stay on topic? Why are you projecting your insecurities so badly? You need to inject every single RT buzz-topic that you can because I called you out? Victim complex much?What happened to your Crimean children point? Gave it up already?It's genuinely hilarious that the only way you can "defend" (I use the term lightly) Russia is by finger pointing.Is your little mind so feeble and blinded by nationalism that you have to pretend that everyone who points out holes in your logic is automatically a defender of "the west"?
&gt; I think having loved and fallen out of love and having love only to realize that you fell in love with an idealized version of your partner that is nothing like her are two different things.That happens to women too.
Yeah I can't really see Rosberg getting back in shape any more this year. I think the real question now is who will be second. Both Ferraris have a very good chance of scoring some good points and fighting with Rosberg.
So you're used to 1+ hour of driving, no parking by 9am, and going home?That's about it north of Boston and south of Portsmouth.I miss Florida beaches.
Of course, but my point is that both facts are in the past and currently both clubs are competing for trophies. So either both arguments should be discarded, or alternatively both will be used.
No we do not. What happens is someone reports a post as spam which goes on the mod que. Mods decide it is spam and remove or ignore reports.there are bots that can be used to auto remove but we have none installed.
[This page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Km915kzKU-_LyyQlbF1rV_PtGALYhAFZ8_UJ6SPuYMU/htmlview?sle=true#) says they cap at +7, and I did get a Handicraft +7 from an Enduring charm.
Well what I can say is that internet explorer works fine at the time. It is a personal computer.It isn't involved with Norton because I contacted them and they showed me that it involves something with the DNS client and whenever the problem happens, just restart that under services.msc
There are no good reasons or bad reasons.  In the end it all boils down to, "I don't want to."  That's it.  No one is *required* to have children, cultural expectations notwithstanding.  You also don't have to justify your decision to anyone or explain why.  They don't have to like it or respect it, but they also can't force you to do it.Don't worry about whether you don't want kids for the "right" reason.  It doesn't matter WHY, it just matters that you don't want to and don't have to.
You definitely have the right to be pissed, but I think it may be in your best interest to keep your head down and try to get through these next 2 weeks without any drama. 
I just pulled my lone Gardein product that has been sitting in my freezer for a month and the only preservative is xantham gum. I personally am not that appalled by a frozen product with a lone, harmless preservative. 
Without passing judgement on anyone,  I will say this:   Having spent part of my life playing copious amounts of video games and then another part spending copious amounts of time developing a skill and creating something tangible that will (hopefully) outlive me,  I do find the latter to be much more fulfilling (although occasionally it is much less fun)
Everyone has an off night as far as Mario Torres is concerned, but Carlos has always seemed to inconsistent for me. I think DeGrom can go six, seven with a quick inning and hopefully we shut things down as we have all year.
Read the article: This is long term thinking in response to climate legislation and divestment campaigns. Research also showed that major oil companies have not sufficiently diversified their revenue streams.
It absolutely offers the truth. If I tell you that I am going to tell you the truth about something, I just offered you the truth. After today, I am not responding to any of these petty remarks. This site is becoming annoying.
Not just that match. Steel and DaZed believe shahzam threw matches before that and he never got in trouble but they did for throwing their match. They say he is notorious or was notorious for throwing matches back then.
If he never wants to play professionally again then sure, what could ever go wrong with telling the world that you are as mature as a middle schooler? 
It's definitely a pleasant photo. Simple, colorful; one thing that i might recommend is moving the subject (the barn) slightly to the left a bit. The rule of thirds  is seen here, but a little more would be perfect given where the lens flare is on the picture. Hope this helps a little.Overall a pleasing photo :) keep on shooting!
https://youtu.be/e5Ri76UodWM, if you think this is simple please lmk, but not all rap music can be generalized, just like not all rock music can be generalized. If I said "rock is just a bunch of guys yelling over basic guitar riffs" people would jump on me so damn fast, music isn't all the same. 
I'm sorry, I wasnt trying to point out how bad women have it and so men have no reason to complain, I was just trying to show that from a woman's perspective, a lot of his arguments would seem ridiculous.  Like I said, when I first started reading I thought he was being sarcastic.  I think you're being a little extreme in thinking that men are told all their lives that they are worthless.  Its not like all little boys are told that they are nothing unless the become president. Being recognized for what you do is good because it motivates you to create a name for yourself, even if its as small as rescuing kittens.  My point was that trying to DO things makes you a better person, trying to LOOK better only makes you more vain.
I have basically your lineup on vulcun except -shroud +sgares *edit - I realized I switched my shotcaller to Ska. I guess I went wildcard!! Too bad it was the only contest for tonights' CEVO games - I would of liked to enter a paid one.
~~u/b0rtS~~ just said stop worrying about other people's weight? How can I do that? It effects me and every other American. That's why I'm bringing up facts and **showing people** that obesity is an issue that effects **everyone around them**. If you are offended by facts, or don't care that people literally are dying because they won't put down the fork for themselves and others, you are completely misguided by my comment.I hate when fat people overeat and have no self control. I hate when drug addicts overdose and don't have self control. These two kinds of people are no different. They need professional help and/or someone to wake them up from their tiny reality that food/drugs will make them happy. Because it won't.
I'm really glad you say "let me... fail from time to time."I can't tell you how many times I have upset parents or even general education teachers because a kid failed and their anger is always, "WHERE WAS THE AIDE!" Instead of, "Why did he fail, what skills does he need to not fail in this area in the future, and how do we teach him to better cope with failure?" I think we really hinder independence by not letting kids fail from time to.I'm curious why it was important to you to fail from time to time.Thanks!
"Supposably" is actually a real word, and you used it correctly in your sentence. https://www.grammarly.com/blog/2014/supposably-is-a-word-but-theres-a-99-chance-you-dont-know-how-to-use-it/
I stand by it. All I have said so far is to support my claims. Do you have any rebuttals to disprove my arguments? If not, just stop trying to get in the last word. 
"I could tell she was making an effort to be nice to me, so I repaid the kindness by accepting the coupon graciously." I wish more people understand that concept! Even if it's not what you want it's so much nicer to graciously accept when someone is offering to do you a favour rather than awkwardly declining. It just makes everyone uncomfortable. It feels good to do something nice for someone else, so always yes and spread the positivity!
[](/ppcute)Oh I didn't realize you were one of the developers!  And yeah I was exaggerating.  It might be more of an issue than "wanting" I think at this point, though, since I am pretty sure Hasbro's C&amp;Ds scared a lot of people off of trying to make stuff.  I haven't been following very closely, but I'm guessing you won't be making your new game open source?And an off-topic question: Are you still involved with the fandom?  
Makes sense. What else do they have to match it up? I imagine it would be a nightmare to get the numbers off thousands of phones, then try to look them up. Probably best way would be to take the battery out and scan it, but still, that's a lot of busywork.
&gt; No. Rockstar should work on ways to stop people from using these mods and other in vanilla multiplayer.Sony is the one detailing the networks here. Its a moderate p2p network unfortunately meaning that someone who mods their ps3 to do these kinds of things (something that is already bannable offense to Sony) are out of Rockstar's hands. If you want it to stop get sony to ban the CPU number. That means to do this the hacker would need to get a new system.
I want to post something with this title, only it's actually vaguely cheerful with no strong emotions and no twist ending. Anyone who questions me will be subjected to a lengthy explanation of the word "may".
Cool, thanks for the feedback. I see now that statement could come off as I feel I'm above a dating site, which is not the case. I'll remove that when I get home! I'm actually out on an okc date so you guys have been very helpful! :)
She would have been fired eventually, though we would have been very nice about it. She wanted to leave amicably, on the best terms possible.It was strange, but she knew she wasn't going to get it and just wanted to move on. I suspect she greatly over-estimated how easy it would be to get another job.
Like I said about 2001, they had 2 teams in either way. So they weren't hurtin 2007, Oklahoma just took Missouri's place in the top 4 so it didn't matter. Kansas kept dropping in the polls after they lost and ended up at #8 before the bowls. in 1998 only one big 12 team was even close to the top 4 before the championship game so I'm not sure what you're talking about there. A&amp;M made a push to #6 in the BCS rankings, but that was only because of the help of the championship game win. Kansas St was still top 4 and the next closest team was Nebraska at #14. I don't think Nebraska was going to make top 4. 
Im kind of pissed off right now.  Obviously the voters don't care enough about their position to pay attention.45 people left him off the ballot entirely
&gt; She tried to steal $650k that was legally hisIn what sense is it rightfully his? Marriage doesn't mean that all assets are instantly joint possessions (though this may depend what country you're in).  For instance, a friend of mine recently got divorced. Since he owned his house prior to their relationship, his ex didn't have any claim to it. In this case, she won that money, not him, so it was really hers.
+1 on the kobes, my old Kobe 6's are my favorite vball shoes ever. Make sure to get low-cut basketball shoes though, you will hate mid or high-cut shoes for indoor.
The map is not the territory; words don't necessarily mean the same things to different people.  Assigning labels to things isn't as productive as just plain trying not to be shitty to each other.
That's one of those goals where if you don't score it, people will yell at you for not passing and being selfish, why take a shot from there?But when you do score it...
Yes, it is possible to roll an offhand without an ability.  However, unlike other armor slots that can only roll one third of your abilities, offhands can roll every single ability, and each individual ability is weighted the same as on any other item.  So, instead of picking from life%, CDR, resource cost, vit, etc. and four to six abilities, you're picking from those other stats and twelve or more abilities.
Goldberg shouldn't have left the WWE. We needed a badass like him to rival Brocks level of bad assness. I know he had nothing left to prove but there's no way they could've midcarded him with his level of accomplishments and natural athleticism.
There really needs to be a change though too, it does not help anything or anyone to act like it's not a girl, or anyone else's responsibility to not put themselves at undue risk. But I also get that these girls are often pretty fucked up in the head from traumatic home lives and upbringing. That being said though, if I go walking into a poor neighborhood in an Armani suit with diamonds and gold all over me and yapping into a new iPhone about how much the gold edition apple watch I'm wearing cost me while fanning myself with a stack of $100 bills .... guess who's getting jacked?
It was so obvious too.  Someone was just sitting in the new queue and hitting down.  If you're going to be shitty at least take some pride on your work!
She shapeshifts her hands to fir her gauntlets. In warp tour, her while arm glows before she had giant gloves, the same as when she shape shifts her arms. It's a cool little detail. 
We were only closed on Tuesday.  Monday night was the craziest. A bunch of stores got looted like 2 blocks from my house. I watched a bunch of people try to kick in the door of a 7-11 until some cops showed up and they ran away. 
A 2nd game file search which just popped up as a result of this post https://www.reddit.com/r/chiliadmystery/comments/34ggzl/the_search_for_how_to_unlock_ufo_instead_of_ufo/We need to find a script that loads "148" just as UFO.txt loads "149" - this loads a 2nd UFO object which we may not have seen yet
Damn, If i had known about this earlier, I would have been all over it....  Already have plans for the weekend.  Heading to Mines Rd around 4pm on Saturday if you want to join.
Eh, she learned early in life that her most valuble asset was her looks so she is just in self preservation mode and it is freaking her out a bit. She is smart enough to know there is a good chance one of the main reasons her husband married her was for her looks. I am not critiquing that everybody wants to be with somebody they find attractive but if it is the biggest thing then...well there is bound to be trouble.
I guess it could go like that. My thoughts would be that he just didn't care much for it and was distracted by the art and all that, and then it clicked in his mind and he went "wait a minute this was shit!".Oh and yeas a 4 is most definitely a harsh score, but we need those every now and then. People are just too lenient with anime and it leaves an erroneous impression of it.
Did you delete the old device info in the AW app? Delete all the cache assosiated with AW (I mean if youre at this point you might as well) So make sure no watch data is in the google play service cache.  Alternate between settings like turning off bluetooth on you phone first then watch, then try vice versa.Im sure you'll get it to connect after doing this.

This type of team is going to be the standard meta for a long time...Kang, Sylveon and Landorus together sit in a nice, strange pocket of neutrality.
You're the only one making a big deal out of it though. All you had to do was evaluate my bead and help but you rather get pissed off at a noob for not knowing the rules of the sub. Let the mods take care of that . Thanks 
No it wouldn't but that's what it would be closest to if a trooper was hit carrying a low yield nuclear device during an airdrop and the device was destroyed. It wouldn't be nearly as effective as an actual dirty bomb but it'd be the closest concept.
Maybe because when we look at all the "pity posts" on facebook from other fatties "hitting" the gym, it's just a cry for attention. Example: "look at me, I'm burning 200 calories, praise me!" I know it's better than nothing, but they can be making better life choices as well. ie not buying a fuckton of cheese, processed foods, crappy pre packaged dinners, driving to everywhere they go, etc.If she hits the gym to burn 200-300 calories and then just eat 600 more at home (at least for a meal), then she's not going to lose weight. She's just trying to get positive attention for getting up and going to the gym when she's not making any better life choices, you know?
Very sorry for your loss. Please be there for your friend during this time. Know that the hurt will never go away completely but with time things will get better. Many of us here on /r/motorcycles have friends who also paid the ultimate price and have an intimate understanding of what you are going through. Please know our hearts go out to you.
Letting customers go marginally above their limit, once, would make sense.But in the thread I was referring to (sorry, couldn't find it), a poster wondered why he was able to charge substantially above his limit.
Ah, a dragon that is actually a dragon and also not blatant pedo-bait.I feel like Sacred Stones was IS' apology for the boneheaded decision to give all the legendary weapons in FE6 so little uses, each got 30 now and the dragonstone has 50- neato.Of course that 50 is ALL you're gonna get outside of glitching the game, but it's enough for the main game at least.But hey, who doesn't want to glitch the game and create actual archsages using the Stone weapon?No one that's who.
So far, two bachelor/bachelorette parties are going on. Mama Salvatore is spiraling into full-on Ripper mode, and Enzo is acting as her errand boy. That's about it so far.
You need to plan your flight, and possibly add more stages.[Tsiolkovsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation) says the more weight we shed, the less fuel we need, so dropping finished stages is always good.The question is, how many phases does your flight plan have?1) Launch to LKO (~3500m/s)2) Mun transfer (~900m/s)3) Mun circularisation (~250m/s)4) Mun landing (~600m/s)5) Mun ascent (~600m/s)6) Mun return (~300m/s)Total ΔV required: 6150m/s (all numbers just from memory, they may be slightly wrong)And you want to do all that with some boosters and a liquid stage or two?I usually combine 2&amp;3 into one stage, and 5&amp;6, but the rest have their own stage.
You do realize many TBM's have left after learning about this nonsense. It is just to goofy for some to take, espeically when they find out he used the same rock long before he had the gold plates in a buried treasure hunting scam?
I won't have any student debt when I'm 24. Thank you US for your inexpensive state schools, low taxes, and private sector employers that pay 70K+ USD to 21 year old college B.S. graduates. 
And that is modern feminism in a nutshell. A white woman trying to use a minority woman for her propaganda and denying her experiences. And when faced with facts like there is a law that prevents discrimination based on gender, she reverts back into her cocoon and repeats her mantra: "we don't get paid as much, we don't we don't we don't" - never mind that women under 30 make more than men, never mind that women CEOs make A LOT more than men, never mind that when you account for same work same time same experience there is no wage gap, WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T. That's religion right there. 
Unless they integrate Hungary first.Man, THAT would be scary. One country owning a continuous border from the Adriatic Sea to the Ostsee, and from Danzig to Moscow.RIP Ottomans.
I've been playing 12 for the last three years, got given 14 out of pity the other day and wow its changed a lot. Might actually buy fifa 16 when it comes out.
I studied industrial and labor relations at Cornell! And I can't imagine how you would graduate with $120k in debt. Cornell has some of the best financial aid in the country. No one would ever graduate with that much debt.Talk to the financial aid office (do it before you commit, as you have more leverage!). I've never heard of someone graduating with more than $30k for four years. You should be able to get a significant amount of your tuition lowered, up to $5k work study a year, access to interest free loans, and even grants. Cornell is a great school and you will have incredible opportunities here. But no one should graduate undergrad that much in debt. And I doubt you'd have to. Call the financial aid office tomorrow! There is absolutely no way they'd let you graduate with that much debt and will work with you to find a far more reasonable plan.
Homerism is tolerable to an extent, and is definitely one of those scenarios.When it's this close, you're splitting hairs, and you gotta ride for your team.
Bought myself a new [fountain](http://www.absintheonthenet.com/Lady-Wings-4-6-Spout-Absinthe-Fountain-Set-p/lw4s.htm) to celebrate National Absinthe Day. Wife almost killed me.
That sounds good to me, however upon further research I've read that the fuel pump is unreliable, but if you're talking from experience I can't disregard your information. The only issue is my father is a bit strict and I doubt he'd allow me to purchase it(even though I'm of age to make the decision on my own :P) without being completely sure it won't be extremely prone to problems.
That is exactly what was going through my head when I watched it... Maybe they have mini-gravity generators or force fields to make sure all the water goes down the drain ;p... Or they could just add a little sliding panel in front... Either one seems viable

I pay $90+ for a new game before DLC thonot relevant to the issue at hand, but as an Australian I literally cannot afford to get the DLC if I wanted to lol
Just a heads up, KC folks: SunFresh has Hormel marinated pork tenderloins (1.15lb) on sale for $3.99 through Tuesday. I recommend the apple bourbon, or the teriyaki. Very grillworthy.

I would go with the Homestead Grays Bridge route coming up the road from Duck Hollow to the sidewalk. I've done this suggestion once and it sucked. The river trail from Duck Hollow ends before the Glenwood Bridge and if you keep going you're technically trespassing on rail road property and even if you cross that property and then the bridge it's a pain to get to the bike trail. 
Technically you can be sued or anything but, I think it would be pretty hard for someone to prove that you discriminated against them for any particular reason. Part of being a freelancer is getting to pick and choose your clients and, if it does make it to a courtroom by some miracle, you could always just say you chose not to work with that person because you felt they would be a difficult client, then point to the fact that they FUCKING SUED YOU as evidence.
That's the analogy I meant to go for, in fact it's pretty much the exact same equations between Ohm's law and fluid flow in pipes (change in pressure between the two ends of pipe) = (mass flow rate) * (pipe resistant) 
This is....this is.... MAGNIFIQUE we have a new artist people. These are drawings that even Da Vinci would envy. Oh what art, this is too much, we have a revolutionary artist on our hands. 
Hi Mykael.Unfortunately $10 is rarely enough to get two Limited Edition items. Very, very rarely. Pretty much never. Getting **one** for $10 I would consider very good luck.It's a very expensive game. $20 to $50 for two limited edition items is more realistic but even that is not guaranteed. 
Well its my first game and 3ds.. Im sorta new to gaming now.. I do love smash but i have it on my wii u and i already got bored of it so no point on getting on 3ds.. Tried code steam demo and didnt seem satisfying.. I know its hard giving suggestions but i dont mind searching for a demo or watching youtube review of it 😄
It's still a choice, it's just a stupid one. Just because one outcome is entirely negative and the other entirely positive doesn't make it not a choice.

Northernlion is pretty much the only Youtuber I watch regularly. ~~His voice is sex.~~ I love his BoI videos, DS videos, and "Let's Look At" series :3I guess I really like VaatiVidya too, again, for DS videos, and NerdyNummies ~~because I have a crush on Ro~~ because my secret guilty pleasure is watching youtube cookies videos.Oh and RRCherryPie... if you have ASMR you *need* to watch his/her videos. 
Look, I don't get housework done with kid either, and I take a shower only every other day either while he screams at me or after I bribe him with snacks or let him play with my phone.But still. When juice spills on the wall or the floor, you wipe it up at least. It takes five seconds and the consequences of not doing so are pretty harsh. Something else is going on here.

No. People will be too uncomfortable to get naked and cleaned themselves. Imagine you were a 14 year old girl, do you want men (or a "woman" with a penis) watching you clean your tits, vagina or ass? No. You wouldn't. There's a reason bathrooms are segregated by genetalia.
*As Xan rushes in the room sitting beside her and takes off the Amusphere, she reacts with a quick look to him, before letting another scream out, cupping her head.* "It hurt's! Please, make it stop. Xan, please." *Meanwhile, Laura swiftly follows Jason up, a little startled that he pushed past her without being invited in, but she was distracted by Taylor's scream and pain. She quickly set the cup down on top of her Vanity table and sitting beside her. Confused at what was happening. She had attempted to dial the emergency services as well, but Jason was ahead of her, so she dropped her phone while still attempting to comfort her.* "What is going on, do you know?"
I would keep asking him to explain it in simpler terms.  Play stupid, "What do you mean?" "I don't know that word." and so on.  Then when they get fed up with that say, "How about you try explaining it like a PA instead of a condescending asshole."

That might be because Darius scale better with defensive stats than health and also that nobody plays him enough to figure out what's decent on him. And really the build path and the cost of the item is pretty bad.
Speaking of which, I hate it when people say "cringey," "cringeworthy," or use "cringe" as an adjective."that's so cringe" is not a real sentence and you sound like a moron when you say it!
Nothing really. Honestly compared to how I used to be it doesn't even feel like anxiety anymore - even though I still can't go do the things I want to do I am MUCH better off than I was 5 years ago, so I think partly that's my reasoning behind staying where I'm at. "I feel much better than I did, and I'm afraid of going back down that road so maybe I'll just stay here a little longer". That's my mentality. I know it's bad, but there it is.

It's not "my" system.  It's Judicial Review in the United States under the common law system.Marriage has a long history in common law so you can't challenge the very idea of marriage itself.   It just doesn't work that way.  To do so would disenfranchise people already married.  Something SCOTUS has called a fundamental human right.This isn't some opened ended hypothetical scenario.

And god...."It's wrong, it's right, it's wrong, it's right"On top of all this, the music. The little drum breaks, the ground bass line, the piano, vocal melody.

I'm sure it's been said on this post already, but they gave the secret recipe for Duff away this season (26) when Homer became Duff-Man. Duff is: Schlitz with more water.

Voice chat replaces text chat as your only means of communication, keyboards are only used for text input in naming guilds etc. The UI is similar to the one in Skyrim.
Whatever Cisco saw and heard when he was wearing the sky-kids glasses, he said everything out loud for Barry and co. We know that Harrison Wells had a camera set there so he most probably heard was Cisco was saying, which he then told Bates to say in return for his freedom.
Thanks for sharing the link, but to me this is just some dispute for office space between Vice, a landlord and a music venue doesn't constitute Vice killing the "underground scene". Let's not exaggerate things. Shit like that happens in business.

That's the exact problem, the mod was fantastic 5(?) years ago and there is still way more content in the various different mods than in SA. Not to mention how H1Z1 is already way further in development than DayZ when it's over a year behind in development hours.If i ever feel like playing a dress up game with the added risk of being killed by an asshole, i'll get right back on that DayZ train.
I followed GG pretty closely between October and December of last year. I read every front page thread and all the comments (mostly, anyways) daily. I never seen anyone calling for the harassment of Anita or Zoe, or anyone at all for that matter. I'm not saying that they weren't harassed because they were. But it's not something that /r/kotakuinaction condoned and it's not what GG is about.

Would you seriously spend millions of credits on an Anaconda as a player, knowing that having the beheamoth means effectively nothing if someone shoots out - which EVERYONE will do - your magic juice box?Everything - Weapon damage, hull strength, shield strength - is still all subject to rebalancing and change. And change, I'm sure it will. This is just my suggestion on how to **do** it. Balancing it so that the numbers play out right, is up to FD.
Nope Grandma's bad. Real bad! The crying thing is is part of your recovery. They will come an go. You are exhausted, depressed and emotional. It is all part of the brain trying to clear itself. Screw on that smile and do what you have to. Good luck. You know you are tough enough to do this.  
Sanitize, sanitize, sanitize. Just keep things clean when you're doing it. Drink a beer. Relax. Keep it cool when fermenting. Try not to move it around while it's fermenting; any oxygen introduced will skunk it. That's about it. Yeast really wants to be beer, so it's hard to mess up if you just follow the steps.

I think it was mentions during 10's run. When they went to the AU. It was just a small comment made by 10 I think, something about timelords who used to travel between universes, and maybe made some of their own.But I'm pretty sure that going to a different dimension takes a hell of a lot of power, and that's something the doctor just doesn't have.
Can't copywrite looks unfortunately. Everything else that shares similarity that can be protected? China doesn't bother, their cars are only sold there, and the government doesn't give a crap about outsiders complaints
That's a lot of changes! I like it better but I  hope *you* are happy with it. Does it still match the weapons well enough for you, since that is what you were aiming for? Both greens were fine btw, in case you liked the old one better.I really like that silver metal dye though because it looks the same on the entire armor (the Aetherblade parts are often difficult to dye). Also the orb being another color is nice!

Tim Duncan loves the game so much that a couple years ago he realized he needed some things to change if he wanted to keep playing at the level he was playing at. I think he has done just that.Ultimately Duncan changed his diet to something healthier, like lean meats and vegetables. He started eating something almost like a cave man diet. Also, he started swimming and boxing in the summer during the off season. Not only did this result in weight loss, which makes it easier on his joints when he runs, it also increased his cardio and overall endurance. Timmy is a perfect example of someone who loves the game of basketball and wants to play it until he feels he no longer can contribute to his team.

I know we aren't going to bring every factory back - I understand that. But cars are made, or at least assembled, in America in Michigan, Ohio, Texas, Tennessee, Alabama... we can have some manufacturing here even against international competition. And there are things we can do to increase what we do domestically.And, even beyond manufacturing, the stronger every American business is the more truck drivers we need, and security guards, and custodians, and a hundred other low-barrier-of-entry jobs that cannot be outsourced. To me the more government gets out of the way and allows the market to operate freely, the more business-friendly environment we can create, the better every American will be.
I usually watch it on my comp on the CBS site around 11 PM on the west coast.  If you just go to the survivor main page and immediately hit "video" you should be taken to the latest episode.  Just don't scroll down, or cover the bottom half of your screen or something.  I've never ended up spoiled that way.
Statistically, the % of women who never have kids (hitting menopause without kids) has doubled between 1970 to 2010 from 10 to 20%, and it's 25% for college-educated women.Presumably, %'s for men wind up being similar.That said, it's certainly very location based. In a trendy urban area, having kids is almost *weird*. In a rural town, not being married off and with kids on the way by your early 20s is still considered weird.
To be fair, Jon Snow deserved to be removed as LC based on his actions. Helping Stannis was borderline but I'd allow it since Stannis saved the NW's bacon. But then going south to free Winterfell. Well, Bowen and the rest were well within their rights to off Jon.So I don't really think Cersei had any influence with For the Watch.

i dont agree with your mirage lurk position i think at GN2 it is much easier and more effective to be underwindow by going underpass and if you can get up and hide in the right of connector by the box. you will hear the enemies from either place and can just striaght up run behind and get the great flank. it also allows you to quickly support players if you start losing trades. 
Oh man, yes, I see exactly where this is going. Every weekend, my parents typically made coffee and breakfast. No big deal, right? I absolutely agree. After the "event" happened, I immediately thought there was no possible way there was any connection to my dream. I thought of everything that could dismiss the emotions I was experiencing. And to be completely honest, I had just recently played a video game where a nuclear bomb was detonated (Call of Duty). And I never once considered the dream to be "prophetic". Never used the word, I mean. Maybe having a premonition is considered to be prophetic, but it's not the term I would use. All I know is that the dream / nightmare occurred and weeks later, I had the exact same experience without the devastation. What made me post this story was that nothing was out of order except for the fact that some kind of blast did not happen.
The most recent Stsr Wars theory about the English language. Over complex and numbers pulled out of thin air.Also many theories aren't even original. They just point out the obvious storyline in a different way.
&gt; He likely had no access to treatment in prison, which would cause a more rapid decline.Not the case here. He had a very rich family, according to the Portuguese link posted in the grandparent post. He had a private cell in jail, which his mother paid for at a rate of up to $100,000 a year in bribes.
I was wondering, is it rape if she's drunk and asks for it? My English Teacher argued that it was but the rest of us were wondering what she was talking about.
I would be all for it if they added a hard limit on the number of practice attempts you got. I don't like only having two attacks either, but having any more I feel like would make it easy to have people carry a clan so I get it. But a handful of practice attacks would do nicely for gameplay and getting some insight on potential attacks without giving any real opportunity to completely 3 star a base. I have just been talking about worst case bad idea scenario of unlimited free practice. I like a limited implementation idea. Always wanted more chances to do war attacks and that would be perfect.
It's possible because this isn't about truth. It has NEVER been about truth. It is about feminist politics. You and I, as men, are automatically wrong, and automatically criminals if they accuse us of something--- just because a woman accused a man the man is guilty. That's how this sort of thing happens.
I think they're absolutely worth the price, thing it's though that they're not an ADV. Way too rich, just kind of like a dessert you know? Tastes awesome but terrible as a meal. Grandmaster and Castle Long are my favorites. Best bet is to find them in a B&amp;M so you can try before you buy. The one here actually sells them for 50 cents less than they are from 5P online.Oh, if you do buy it online that price includes Priority shipping so that "lowers" the price of the juice a little.
From what I can gather due to my recent failings with the females, act like some kind of thug drug dealer jerk who wears athletic shorts and jeans.  I'm the guy with the shoulder to cry on, the nice guy, the "friend" and now I am, I regret to say, a 21-year-old virgin.  The females shall be sorry one day.If you asked me this four years ago when I was young and innocent, I would have siad to be respectful, kind, and to always tell them how beautiful, perfect and angelic they are.  But alas, good sir, I am old and jaded, and with my level of intellect it is impossible not to figure out what is going on: Females are succubi.
Do go really thinks it's a good idea to take *any* imparing substance while diving? I don't care of weed tucking cures cancer, driving while under the influence is where I draw the line on the "miracle weed" circle jerk. 
They are not being "told". That is an outright lie, generally Shia and sunnis go to their respected Hamlahs. I've been to hajj. Shia Hamlahs take care of the individuals as a group and perform normal hajj while maintaining their Shia reference to mecca. Just like sunnis Hamlahs too. Some Hamlahs are mixed too. It's just preference in which the Hajjaj pick, not inforced by the state. They all perform hajj together no matter what sect or race. No need to exaggerate something that isn't there.I've been to hajj and Umrah I know how the system works in Saudi.
I think the comment means to say that the attempt at reform didn't do anything last semester. They sat everybody down in the chapel and gave a huge speech about bun-run related consequences and tons of people still ran. Zoo and circus occurring is proof that the reforms (or attempt at reforms) weren't effective.

I recently read something about nicotine. Never smokers who were exposed to pure nicotine (not cigs) showed no signs of dependency. I forget where i read that, it was a vape site but it linked to the study. There are very little studies done on the subject. Tobacco smokers become heavily addicted to nicotine for life though, thanks to the help of the nicotine delivery system in cigs that make it much more addictive than it actually is.

Also I think the coaches in nfl get their cookies up front, the boxers probably pay their managers/ staff out of their 100 boxes, so they don't actually get to eat all the cookies they say they got.

FYI you can go to just about any Goodwill (or other similar thrift stores) and get a decent keyboard for &lt;$3. It may not be a gaming keyboard, but it's a keyboard nonetheless.
Not sure. To even scrub toilets in an actual library, you have to have a b.s. in library science lol. I could poke and see what the hospital has that I could maybe do. And I'm HOPING that the internship I have to do for my graduation can be paid. It depends on here I go. Northeast ga medical is unpaid, but children's healthcare of Atlanta had some paid. We aren't partnered with them yet :(
Correct characterizing of A and B. The girlfriend called the VP during the altercation because she was scared and didn't know who to call. They've typically all been close knit. I've been acting as a middle man to deliver messages between the two and they're both devastated. They had been living in different cities and the make employee had recently started moving his things in with the girlfriend. He's now back in his home city and his boss is prohibiting him from traveling. How can he monitor and control this person's personal life and force him to disclose activities in his personal devices? 
Yes, I understand many people feel that way. Thanks for your response! I want to hear all the arguments for/against the name and appreciate your feedback. 
I don't care if you see that as immature. The value of the Chroma's are simply not 5 dollars. It's not a lot of money, and that's why it's being bought. But if you actually think about it, it's not worth the money, and people that do not play this game have all agreed. They laugh at the quality of the recolors and the price.But because you guys enjoy this game so much, you'd buy anything really.When normal people with no skill in photoshop create a chroma pack with even more colors, and the same if not higher quality, then that's a problem. And any person who isn't biased would agree.If I make a drawing which is garbage, but people buy it, doesn't mean that's the worth of it. Because I bet you if the price would have been lower, more people would buy it.http://i.imgur.com/C1v006v.png
&gt;Big Bang hasn't released anything new in 3 years. That's 1/3 of their existence. Most groups release new material at least once a year. Groups have debuted and disbanded in the time Big Bang has been away. BTS released their last song like 5 months ago and I saw the same responses in that thread.
I think this is what makes it so hard for me to understand. I can quite clearly see the shitty aspects of having a child, but never once have I looked at any interaction between child and parent and thought "oh thats what I'm missing." I'm sure there are unquantifiable positives, but they're so hard to identify that I'm just not buying it yet. 
Jamie Redknapp is a shite pundit, don't know why he has a job as a pun... oh wait he's employed by Sky, the home of shit pundits! Give me the BBC lineup any day of the week!
a**sian**dimen**sion**situa**tion**croa**tian**Why would you just pick **one** of those and assume all of them are spelled the same? Dalmatian is spelled just like Croatian or Haitian. You never see people writing Haition online when they mean a person from Haiti.
I feel like people play by One World rules all the time.  I never did in you're American season.  That was my very first ORG and I was naive to One World talk, screen shots and other strategies I deem "unfair".What I like about officially making a season One World is that I feel uninhibited in cross-tribe talk and can do better work with strategy.  I thought about the no tribe rule before, not sure if I'd do it Anarchy style or pure 100% merge the entire game style.Interesting idea tho.
Because it's an issue not just of race, but race and history. Power structures essentially, and never underestimate the way someone (especially a politician) will abandon previous viewpoints and goals when they get power. 
Being proud of a grey flair is like being proud of cowardice. It's like sitting back at home complaining about sports players performances when you've never gone on a field in your life. It's like seeing precious gems in a cave full of millions of rocks and deciding the rocks are the more valuable thing. 
Yeah, I knew I was bad at explaining. This is why I added the whole whitelist block thing. So it doesn't use our gold ore for a path or something. I'll add it in.
If you want strength of character emphasized, ["Titanium"](https://youtu.be/JRfuAukYTKg0) by David Guetta and Sia is about building yourself up in the face of adversity.

Fake! Those are black people in this video, and as reddit will tell you black people riot and destroy property! Why aren't they attacking the man in this video? Because it's fake!
&gt; Added a new hotkey for switching weapon sets on selected characters.&gt; Firearms will now reload when combat ends on alternate weapon sets.&gt; Inverted the Stronghold log.&gt; Improved the output in the Bestiary and added beast abilities.Awesome. I was hoping for these.No mention about fixing Transcendent Suffering or Battle-Forged, though.

Unfortunately for us right now, this NFL draft is srs bsns, and the streams are getting taken down...this shit doesn't even happen to playoff games...the fucking logic.
ive got a few...I'm the night shift at my store. im that, 'typical sarcastic coffee shop asshole manager'. if customers are rude i put a scoop of matcha in their drink. doesnt matter what it is. plain latte? scoop of matcha. caramel frap? scoopa matcha. 182 degree, no foam, no water, extra bullshit chai, you guessed it. scoop. of. fucking. matcha. also ive been known to steal a slice or so of bacon off a sandwich and leave it by the oven for when i come back. also ive double charged some dicks in the drive thru and then said my reciept printer was broken so they couldnt verify.
Avoid:* frames that have been painted over* bikes with no license sticker or no papers from the store where it was boughtGet:* Bill of sale and check their ID* Check that license paperwork matches ID* Call to check license # is not reported stolen* If no license (came from mainland or other island) get the original paperwork from the store plus a signed and dated bill of sale.You can also do the transaction at the City Hall after verifying the bike is not stolen and that you can put it in your name.
Sexually assaults (and implied rape) of another main character while drunk, while suffering a downward spiral of alcohol, dark thoughts and violence. He also hits a whore earlier in the book after experiencing post-traumatic stress. He finally commits suicide due to the shame, and to prevent himself becoming a worse man than he already is. 
as my favourite champion i honestly always wanted a rework for her, part of it is that she's only relevant right now because of the TP/Smite which is going away soon, and the other part is that i think she's also the only champion that transform but her moveset doesn't really change so to speak, her abilities just become more AOE but i would like a different moveset altogether. Other then that, once this TP Smite meta passes, theres no reason to pick her over someone just as tanky with more reliable CC like Maokai.  
Out of respect to Jirard, he exceeds my expectation in handling these events. While I myself still misses some of Greg's jokes sometimes (some solo episodes feel too dry for my personal liking though), I still think these new episodes are doing well.I'm still kind of surprised that some ppl couldn't let this go and just enjoy what we have, and show Jirard the support if you like him and his approach. Otherwise, well ... there are still other stuffs on the internet you might like.PS I am still concerned a bit about Jirard's health (regarding surgery) as I didn't follow his other social networks, anything to keep me update on that part, anyone?
Maybe that's the issue? What if instead of looking at it like the medium, you think of sound (or visuals) as your medium, and maxmsp is your paintbrush. I only use max when I have a problem that only max can solve - sometimes I have to use Logic, sometimes I have to work with live musicians.. It all depends on the project you're trying to create.
Anything brass, especially high-brass (usually the magnums and slugs), is worth keeping. At the shotgun fields look for Winchester AA hulls, those are among the best because if you're careful you can get a ton of reloads out of them before the plastic hull quits, though you probably won't find many that aren't worn out and being thrown away because most guys who shoot em reload them themselves. If you look at your walmart loads you'll notice they're maybe 3/8inch of aluminum or steel, not sure what they are, and cheap shitty plastic that doesn't take a good crimp. There's a reason why they're 25 cents a round.
Thats amazing! Great Job to the Doctors and I'm so happy for Mr. Norris I'm sure this completely changed his life and gave him a ton of confidence in everything from just going to the grocery store to actually talking to people. So happy for him.
I imagine the physical discomfort. But, at least here in Brazil, there is a big stigma and a lot of machismo associated with it. There is always the fear that they will like it and turn gay because of it. I had one acquaintance outright tell me he'd be okay with it if the doctor was a woman.
No. You are part of the "American Problem". It is this defeatist attitude and cynicism that has permeated politics. This is exactly what the people who got us in this mess want. It keeps them paid and in positions of power. Its easy to say "theres no point" or "my vote doesnt matter", but when there is a real chance at democracy before you, you don't act? You have no right to complain about the status quo when you contribute to it.
It's not ignored. The vast majority of players don't watch streams and/or look-up things about the game because wearing havel's and buffing a straight sword gets the job done
The architectural style you mentioned, Brutalism, was not meant to discourage riots. It gained popularity for its striking modern looks, along with cheap construction and insulation, in the early sixties. The major riots and protests were a coincidence as the initial plans began to take form as buildings later in the decade. Here is [an article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2013/10/18/campus_brutalism_were_the_buildings_designed_to_thwart_student_riots.html) debunking the myth. Also, a subreddit /r/brutalism if you want to see more.
My mom's a teacher and I've heard many a stories of teachers calling students things. I think the worst is when my second grade teacher was over at our house and I was sitting in the living room watching tv, next thing I know she says, "You know I really can't stand working at a school filled with little n*****s. I mean half of them are going to be on crack by 7th grade." Good news is she's retired so she can't be mean to students anymore. Then there was the time my mother came home and told me how one of her colleagues told her "I swear I don't even mind Mexicans, but this girl I have smells like sour bean burritos. I mean do they even bathe in Mexico?" She no longer works at the school and last I heard she works on the other side of the state. 
It probably wouldn't be that hard to do. Find the nearest water, weight for distance and cleanliness... I'll take a crack at it myself if it hasn't been done already.
You are an absolute joke of a human being. You find a high number threatening. It makes you doubt whether she'll find you adequate in bed. You believe a woman should somehow save herself for the day she finds you. Grow up.

&gt; People out there is so incredibly talented and I can not draw, I can not play music...heck, I can not even speak English properly. [](/fluttershh)Speaking of which, "people" in English is treated as the more popular of the two plural forms of "person," "persons" being the rarer variant.  In either case, your sentence should read like the following:[](/sp)&gt; People out there **are** so incredibly talented and I can not draw, I can not play music...heck, I can not even speak English properly.

[Spoilers!] Starscream is amazing. Mainly because he's an F-15 but also because in the movies I always felt like he was playing stupid. I felt his death was really dumb in the movies though. 
Dang, nice houses.  I always try to build something like those, and I just can't.  My house always ends up looking super plain compared to the default houses around me.
I posted in yesterday's thread tl;dr I don't have any experience but am gonna make a game symbolizing battles with coming of age more info wanted let me know but how powerful of a PC am I gonna need to build a relatively attractive side scroller
Yep, if he's innocent he's getting totally screwed over. Not his fault but you can't really blame the teams either. Just a tragic event for all involved.
I would like Dont Starve Together please. I have to say my favorite band is Alice in Chains. On the one side they have their softer songs like Nutshell, but sometimes I'm in the mood to rock out and listen to some heavier stuff and they give that to me as well in Angry Chair and the like. Then some of their stuff kinda speaks to em when I'm feeling down. And the vocals are absolutely spectacular! Layne has sucha an impressive range of expressing emotion. Thanks!http://steamcommunity.com//profiles/76561198069143941/

My point was no MMO that is relevant today has slow paced enough combat for a combo system like XI to work. Then you bring up crap from a decade ago like it had anything to do with the point I was making.
Me neither! It's the first draft for me, it coincidentally landed right before a holiday here in Denmark, so I can actually stay up late and watch it, without it impacting me tomorrow! 
Ian Rapoport ‏@RapSheet 14m14 minutes agoWhat package are #Eagles talking about to go to No. 1 or No. 2? Two 1st rounders, a 3rd rounder, Fletcher Cox, Boykin, Kendricks, more. Wow.Is this true? That seems like a pretty good deal.
The key is to have those wild and crazy experiences with one person.   The more you're with some one,  the easier it is to open up and enjoy everything. 
Theres a indepth intro at the start of the game to inform new comers of the story line. You wont miss out on anything important/relevant to this installment.
*Looks closer* The alleged forgery occurred on the deposition by Dempsey saying that he was not the father. The article's insinuation is that Amy forged it. But why would she forge a signature saying that the child was not his? No documentation is provided to back up the claim of a DNA test, either. I got duped by this, too, but I looked into it more and decided to delete the post I made earlier--If you look it up on CourtView, the final divorce is a dissolution WITH children. They do a good job of making it seem documented, but it's really just stooping down to (probably below) her level.  Not cool.
Having to get the XL model kind of killed the transportation part for me. Instead of bringing it places, it now just sits on my desk, and I really only play it at home before bed now.
I understand the presence on the "may" in that sentence. I'm not saying that this is definitely coerced, I'm trying to get a thorough outside perspective on what is wrong with my train of thought from folks who (I would presume and hope) have a greater knowledge of the law than I.That said, my confession was not spontaneous, it was due to prolonged stress and fear stemming from continuous questioning and false promises from multiple officers and seeing the k9 pulling in was the straw that broke the camels back that made me spill the beans.
He is an older dog-around 4. I have had him for 5 months and there has yet to be a problem, but I have no other indication of his history and prior behavior.      I will definitely consult a trainer and do my best to manage his interactions. Thank you!!
THIS! Although some friends threw a small gathering, not my mom. My boyfriend's mom keeps trying to ruin our move, which is a good chunk why I've been feeling so down. You'd think she'd want to have us around or something, but nah. She's just got issues. Unfortunately, she's someone you can't really cut out.Where are you going to in a few months? 
It's $13.99 over here (Illinois) and many liquor stores make you buy another craft item along with the Zombie six pack since stores are limited to one case per x amount of cases they buy of Alpha King, Robert the Bruce, and their assorted bombers.
&gt;Keep in mind that the American right left divide is very skewed rightward at the moment.&gt;Their far left is the center of normal politics, their center is the right, their right is the far right, and their far right is insane.
&gt; he's positing that someone created him.Hmm no.Getting theists to support their claims by using the Socratic method is not a form of claim-making. It's a way to get them to think about whether the claims they are making *make sense*. This question is designed to point out the problem with the origin of a deity. If a god always existed then why can't the same be true for the universe itself? If, however, it began to exist on its own, then why can't the same be true for the universe itself. Of course, the theist is free to say that there are an infinite number of gods that created each one in turn, and we're left with an infinite regress not much different than an endless cycle of big bangs and big crunches.Asking where God came from is not positing that God has a creator nor is it making the claim that that god actually exists - it's just a way to challenge people to support otherwise unfounded claims.
Thanks for the info. The engine is stock, but the person installed an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator. When I installed the fuel pressure gauge, I noticed it was running what that specific FPR is set at out of the box. I had the car tuned on this set up, and everything was in check, so I'll return the pressure to what it was before. I guess I shouldn't have tried to "fix" it :)Mpg has been pretty shitty, and my A/F gauge was near the end of it's rich scale just cruising at low rpm.

Yeah I plan on running it without the heatsink fins, but with the TC I'm not too worried about that.I think I'll be doing a simple 26g vertical build around .6-.8 ohms.
That's a fair point, and if this happened to a person who had just assaulted someone and proved to be dangerous that's fine... But this boy and so many others get this treatment after little more than a glance and a jog in the other direction. In the end he was charged for carrying a knife in his pocket. That was it... And that is actually quite legal in Baltimore.
Fair enough. I was more referring to sustained lift of longer than a second or two. One of the ghosts B fought in the early seasons could throw people around, so she knows how to handle that. The real threat is if he can get her up in the air and keep her up indefinitely to where she can't break free.
I was just going to comment Philly, I have been living here for a long time and I feel like not many people wear makeup... and when I do notice someone with a nicely done full face of makeup I am constantly thinking... "Ok, they must be a makeup artist..." etc!
I would start with a chemical stripper if it truly is solid wood. It will speed up the process a ton. You just have to be sure to wash it well afterwards. As far as adding glow resin, where exactly are you adding glow resin? Normally this is added to deep imperfections in wood such as wood rot, worm holes, knot holes. If you don't have any of those are you planning on creating your own? 
Right.  Fewer spots that are harder to earn.  More competition.  Breaking into a team would be more of an accomplishment.  It would raise the bar for players coming in to the league.  There are plenty of development spots for mediocre talent in USL.
&gt;"About 750 agencies contribute to the database, a fraction of the 17,000 law enforcement agencies in the United States. University of South Carolina criminologist Geoff Alpert, who has long studied police use of deadly force, said the FBI's limited database underscores a gaping hole in the nation's understanding of how often local police take a life on America's streets — and under what circumstances."http://www.usatoday.com/.../police-killings-data/14060357/It took me a few minutes to come across the article that explained that the database is far from a complete record. Its kind of crazy that it doesn't exist and isn't a requirement. Even worse is CNN is showing this all over the country.Anyone want to speak on how the Mainstream Media has incentive to blame the victim? These images along with the one of the mother slapping her son who was at the protests is all I see.
Stories and comments like the story linked suggest that responsibility in avoiding rape is on the potential victim, and not on the person who will be committing rape. If you tell women to not walk through a park at night, maybe that potential rapist will just end up looking elsewhere? It's a bandaid solution that ignores the real problem of WHY these people think it's OKAY and WITHIN THEIR RIGHT to force themselves on someone else. 
I want to love this comment, but I don't think we were good enough to open my mouth about it.edit: (So in good fashion I express my opinion while passing the buck)
Yes, that. I really did have a white shepherd/wolf hybrid though. One of the most intelligent dogs I've ever known, but her hip dysplasia eventually did her in : (

I have 8 gigs, so the slowdown is minor, but 100+ sandboxed tabs eat up more memory than non-sandboxed.Also, Chromes tabs get WAY too small when you have alot of them.
Most BWW's in orlando will not be showing the fight. Source, I work there. It costs to much for us to show and we have to hire security it's not worth it.
But 4 years of english literature in high school is NOT better than 3 years english + 1 year adulthood skills (filing taxs, resume/cv formatting, finding work, good loan vs bad loan, maybe even drivers ed (my high school didn't have this class)).
Huge truth.  I can't point to specific articles, however, it's been noted on the free press, tv, am980, etc, that the natural flow of the river has removed pollutants and encouraged local fish stock to return to whence they came from.  I say leave it, get rid of the damn dam, and tell the pussbags who complain that Fanshawe lake is too far to suck it up.  The smell is so much nicer now when walking the trails too!!!

Agree that he's a pocket passer but not that he only runs when it's absolutely necessary.  His wheels are a big part of that offense.  Dude was almost a 1000 yard rusher last year.
darn, I can't really tell what sets and numbers they are. I have a list of wants from Plasma-Primal listed. I'll just email you that list. Let me know if you have any of those. If it just says the same, I'm looking for the Reverse Foil. If it says the name and Holo, I'm looking for a normal Holo of that. I only have the typed out lists from back to Plasma. I'm looking for a lot of cards from Boundaries Crossed and before as well. Let me know if you have any of those. 
I think Kentucky is more realistically a 7th-10th place team, putting them at #1 is just mind-boggling. We're talking about a team that has just 1 player taller then 6'9, a team for whom the highest scoring returner (Tyler Ulis) averaged just 5.6ppg last season, a team that is returning less then 15% of their scoring from last season. They've got 3 solid recruits and a transfer who is going to get good minutes, but they're just losing so much. I think people get tricked into thinking that Kentucky was so far ahead of everybody else last season that they can regress significantly and still be ahead. 
Yeah, true... I think we need to lower Coyotes to 100 certs to make them "newb friendly." Also I do think that the potential for an interesting lock-on mechanic exists, and that it would dovetail nicely with the established practice of hoverfighting.
Is Utah really regarded as being part of the Southwest? To be honest, I wouldn't have classified it in that way, but considering I'm from the Midwest and there are so many different versions of what constitutes the states that make it up, I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. I haven't been to Zion, but I did pass through northern Utah on the train and remember it being quite unlike other places I'd been.
That's not a dress code, you're in a 24/7 dom/sub relationship and you abide by your master's rules.I just find it very, very sad when people are forced (or brainwashed)  into this. That they have to cover up because they're a woman.I mean, I get wanting to dress for your partner. Hell, I'm planning on surprising my boyfriend wearing babydoll lingerie and lolita stockings tomorrow. Other days I dress up nicely to accentuate my body, or just lounge in my pajamas all day. But I'd never, ever accept my boyfriend telling me what to wear or what not to wear. Fuck that noise.
I do find it clunky myself too, but I find with using a launcher it cuts down on the interactions with it. I also use NFC for most of my settings being turned on/off and hardly interact with touchwizz.
These corrections are good for a bullish market. It keeps things in check and you can't be upset about being down 1.8% today when they're still up 3.1% over the month, even after the correction. 
It is indeed. I will plunge into you with the **Cast Iron** force of my horse Cock. Its caulk will pulverize your very bones as my **Ingots** of Steel thump and clang against you.Deeply. 
Untrue. Our politicians run on platforms of gay marriage. We elect officials on issues that are truly non-issues. Fuck it you can married next issue please.
I agree everywhere here. 2xday about every other say, maybe 4 times per week. If it does start to burn me out I just cut back. It can be a grind. I don't find it that hard though. Get a routine and communicate with a spouse if necessary.
I can't imagine they left Tear and Narsis untouched, since Tear is a stone's throw from the border and Narsis right in the way on the road to Mournhold.

Yes HSV-1, the one usually associated with cold sores on the lips. But CDC does not recommended testing for HSV-2 either, which is the rarer kind and the one more likely to be genital herpes.
Just stick with Horus for now, you can clear pretty much everything early-mid-semi late game with him. All the good subs for DMeta is from the REM, so without IAP, its gonna be hard to build a good team.
I agree, the dog is doing this in multiple places along your fence line and you have kids and dogs to worry about.  It seems it is not the fence that needs to change but the dog's behavior.  A strong aversive may be just the thing.
No it wouldn't. Drug tests (when testing for marijuana) test for THC metabolites. Which are essentially byproducts of your body breaking down the THC molecules stored in the fat cells of your body. I have a degree in chemistry/pharmacology.
That is an incredibly sad thing to read. Those lines are very moving. Thank you for sharing this. Anybody can get caught up in drugs, and it is so easy dehumanize an addict, we see it in the media every day. This proves that we are all the same and it sucks to see one of us go down such a dark road. 
The only feasable answer I can even begin to think of is that he is trying to work out the algorithms behind the system, and the ones he has made himself give a different (wrong) answer to the ones the system give (correct) and he is trying to work out where he is going wrong....Even so, it is a long shot...
This will probably get buried. I'm not a teacher but this happened to a good friend of mine and it's fucked him up ever since. He tried his best on a report paper in middle school, and he got an F on it with a sticky note attached that read: "This F is a gift."A lot of his hesitation, self-doubt, and anxiety came from that situation. To teachers: your encouragement, discouragement, or attitude can change a young person's life forever. Please don't take that responsibility lightly.
Any political community or labelMost music cultures, example: I love reggae but I have never smoked weed, the fans often only like reggae because it is associated with marijuanna

I was actually so happy to have Aksor last week. I love to solo that. And I take my time and kill every frikking thing in my way.Some Nightfalls are a real pain to solo. I think the last time I solo'd Omnigul, I had nearly 400 kills.
Misogyny is not the straight up "hatred of women" as people seem to claim all the time. If you check most definitions of the word, yes the first line is usually "the hatred of women" but then you kind of ignore the second part, "*or* prejudice against women."Even the second line of the [wikipedia page for misogyny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) says "Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification of women."Saying misogyny is the hatred of women is the equivalent of saying homophobia is the fear of gay people. There are more layers/definitions to each of the issues.

Oh man. That's awesome. I'm in the U.S. and we don't have maternity or paternity leave. It's frustrating. Leave like this allows the parents to decide what works best for their new families. 
Serious question: Why didn't you just politely decline to work on this particular person's home? I mean, do you have an additional 'hazard' fee or something?
Let's not be naive, the lazy thing to do is to blame the big major faceless studios, when the truth is movie goers have such a high demand for franchise movies.
I have heard so yes but from experience microsoft sucks with PC gaming Games for Windows Live was horrendous. Also I was being very kind to UPlay earlier. It is literally the shittiest service I have every used. With The Division being online only do not expect to play it for the first month if you do end up getting it on PC because their servers will explode on day one.
Regarding (a), I think it would be bad PR for an entity like Snapchat to make it's wifi so self-serving.  That said, I'm surprised that kind of market hasn't taken off, assuming the technology is reliable and simple, as the above commenter stated.However, if Snapchat could set up two different wifis, then:  (1) the main wifi could be used for anything, and (2) the specific Snap wifi could allow all snaps to go to a central on-site server that distributes them at periodic intervals, or whatever would be necessary to reduce the load on that server or outgoing signal.

it's either how you approach it or the partners you're choosing, no? it's a fetish a lot more people are into than admit, I think. the repercussions of a mistaken or misunderstood scenario are pretty awful to pretty much everyone. maybe you haven't been able to establish the trust necessary with a partner yet? I'm a big creepy guy so it's kind of expected with me... 
You'll get there, just keep at it. Things do improve. Just stay strong. Get a routine going. Put a blue light filter on your phone, drink some caffein free tea, have a hot bath or shower, and cut out tech two hours before bed. Slowly you'll manage to get this under control. Goodluck!

I've never heard that term before, but it is a perfect description of what I do in my head. That aha moment where two, three, four, seven unconnected parts of the story that all come together at once is pure dopamine bliss. 
To be fair, there are fewer race/class/romance combos in Origins (72) than Inquisition (98.. not counting Scout harding "romance")  Yes, I did the math :P  as well as romance options, 4 vs 6Additionally a lot of the different Inquisition combinations give you small but interesting nuances even if you romance the same person over and over again with a different race or specialization even, while in Origins, there are mostly catch-alls (Morrigan doesn't treat you *too* differently if you are a Dwarf vs a Circle mage for example) so people probably have more initiative to do more romances for science! in Inquisition.  
Wow, that's an insane amount of muscle to put on in one month. You can probably see why I was skeptical as that rate of muscle growth is unheard of, even in beginners. No need to give me a copy of the Dexa I believe you. Were you a beginner at the time? Also what kinda of routine were you doing?

It is the striving for answers, and the search for them that fulfill us, not their acquisition.Even if curses do exist, they make no difference. They exist outside of our control, and outside of our ability to change them. We cannot change what happens to us, but we can change how we react to it. Curse or not, the answer to happiness lies within yourself.
I say the same thing about Gnome that people say about Windows 8. Just hit meta and start typing. Why do I need my dock visible at all times? Why do I need a lower panel when I can hit meta and get an overview of everything on a given workspace? Or when I can use alt-tab? Don't get me wrong, I've been playing with Plasma 5 and other DE/WMs and I like plenty of them, but Gnome feels really good to use, and it doesn't hurt that I think it looks ace as well.

&gt;problem solving, Excellence, personal choice, and thirst for knowledge aren't parts of understand ourselves and the world around us? are these not part of the teachings of the master race? Not quite how pictures of pc parts falls into that.&gt;your entirely too close minded about the culture of PCMR in a theocratic sense.No I understand it, I just think it's a petty thing to apply those ideas too.  If you don't think a week of non-stop posts about paid mods is petty, well maybe you need to rethink your priorities.  
I'm not sure exactly how many people there were in the U of T network.  Presumably it was some number fewer than 1-point-some-billion.  In any case, I think you've misunderstood how the privacy settings work.  Groups can still have their content set so that it is visible only to members of that particular group.  It's not the case that anyone in the U of T network can see any and all of the content in question. 
The Atari movie about the et games buried was really great!Also the steve jobs lost interview really made me feel a lot more for who he really was as a person. Like or dislike apple jobs was an interesting character and a visionary in the right place at the right time. I found the documentary pretty cool to watch. 
Obito should be older than Kakashi bc hey all graduated the academy at the same time (I think? Otherwise how did they end up on a team together?) and Kakashi graduated really young because he's a genius.
I agree, the narrative of "exploitative Asian businesses" makes very little sense in the context of shopkeepers in impoverished neighborhoods.  And it is likely that no, the person being quoted has no real idea about what the nature of immigrant business operations are--and vice versa.  And this is the real tragedy of these kinds of explosions--there is limited control and targeting, and the victims are usually people who are only marginally better off than those doing the "exploding".  
I have two.  Blazing Saddles &amp; Airplane.I grew up watching these movies.  There was a time that I probably could recite both movies word for word.  Airplane.....well, it had boobies and eight year old me loved that shit.  Still do.  
I can't think of any time when an emperor just woke up and dissolved his title, though. Usually the empire collapses because it literally has no land left, not because the emperor decided it. The guy who dissolved the HRE did have land left, but he also had two imperial titles.
Yeah I am more scared of not being a doctor.  I will admit I take off days but all I care about is putting in the work.  I may be number one in my chem department now but that doesn't mean shit for the future.
I don't know, I kind of like it. It's creepy and stuff, especially the full version, but the song's kind of catchy and the one girl's kind of pretty too. Of course, I'm from Michigan, we see this stuff every day...
hmm, I actually couldn't get any of the options I normally used working. Everything I could find that I used to use was abyss based, so without it being updated and public I couldn't get anything running.Normally I'd recommend MabiMods "mabinogi frontend" as the easiest way to go about this for a newer modder. You can get it [Here](http://mabimods.net/index.php?action=tpmod;dl) but you need an account on mabimods to see this downloads section and use any links. I'd keep an eye on this and try it out yourself, I'm getting some wierd installation path errors but it might be just because my OS is held together with gum and toothpicks at the moment...
That's a slightly more complicated one cos it's an away game being sold on loyalty points. You would've been able to buy during the "Friday 1 May from 4pm" slot for that game. The 4th May date is then for people booking additional tickets, but it definitely will have sold out by then - only cup games tend not to book up that fast.  Crystal Palace at the top of that page is a clearer example, and what you're likely to face when booking yours. Member sale for that one started on 9th April at 7am, which is when you'd be able to book.  I'm always on the chelsea website helping my mates book tickets, so you're welcome to PM me once the fixtures have been announced and I can confirm the selling details for you.

How does the overwatch and overwatch ban system work? I'm sure there are many good players that get reported even though they dont hack. And they may even be reported for hacking by the overwatcher?And also with the new overwatch on profiles, do the times you've been overwatched appear?
I hear you. Yes, I most definitely misunderstood your implication. My apologies. That said, Vietnamese nationalists had been fighting and repeatedly ousting Chinese fuckers for hundreds of years. It would be nothing new and they'd have a good shot at being particularly successful because the Viet Minh and associated militias were already scaled up and ready to go. KMD wasn't so dominant that they'd run rampant on Viet Nam. They had plenty of other things to deal with. 
Ain't nothing wrong with a Les Paul as your first electric.I'm not sure how they are with international shipping, but people here, me included, love Agile. If you're looking for a close to carbon copy of a Gibson without the price tag, there's Edwards and Burny. If you're looking for older used stuff that's still pretty reliable, there's Hondo, Ibanez, Aria Pro, Greco, Lotus, Cameo, and that list goes on forever.Personally, I really like my Agile. I like it more than my '09 Gibson LP Studio that I later sold, but failing being able to get one of those, I'd go with an Epiphone since they're in a very similar sort of quality window with a decent get for your money. I even picked up a factory 2nd Thunderhorse recently and love it to bits.
Philly would be a great place. Theres a number of venues with the most obvious being PhilaMOCA. They constantly have awesome events like Chiptune festivals and wrestling events. I'll have to look into submitting next year. I have a film about a carpenter and a talking table that would fit right in. This year is just packed with fests that are expensive and have deadlines right around the same time. 
Couldnt it also be said that after decades of anti poverty programs which seem to hold little account for responsibility, cultural trends which break apart family cohesion, and victimist mentalities. Only have served to keep people in a lower class standard? I admit this is some heavy speculation here, but it seems that every successful person who rises out of this, does so by taking responsibility working towards bettering themselves, ignoring whatever currently is in fashion, and believing themselves capable of achieving better than the hand they were dealt with at birth? 
Welcome to the fandom. Yet another innocent soul has been devoured by the Venus Flytrap that is Gravity Falls. I don't think you've missed anything, though if you haven't already, I would highly recommend checking out Starfleetrambo's OTGW/Gravity Falls comic, Garden Falls (http://starfleetrambo.tumblr.com/post/107605794303/prologue-1-2-garden-falls-content-warning) It's one of the most beautiful and emotional fan comics that I've ever read.
☐ Lol☐ Haha☑ Fuck you____As you can clearly see, "Fuck You" is more versatile and fits into posts it isn't even put in. So clearly it wins the contest it isn't even participating in.This is "Fuck You" giving a fuck you to "Haha" and "Lol"
Okay, if chlorine is the main problem that has a workaround.  It is actually a dissolved gas in the water.  So if you just fill up a  jug and set it on the counter un-capped, the chlorine will dissipate/evaporate and go away, give it a couple hours.  I just keep a jug or two in rotation to use for coffee making, sodastream, etc.   If you still have objections other than chlorine, there are lots of good ideas in this thread.  Personally for pure drinking water, I just use distilled because there is nothing in except water molecules.  And somebody upthread says you can buy a distiller unit if you don't want to buy bottled distilled.   I think I may look into that.
I kind of had an intimate moment with one of my closest friends after a bottle of wine a couple years ago and then he just never called me back. We had been friends for 5 years. It still seems so surreal that he just never tried to get in touch with me again.I often have dreams that he comes to pick me up from somewhere. Sometimes he apologizes and tells me he was wrong and just scared. Most of the time, he's just as smug as he always was.Last time he picked me up at an airport in Boston and I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with him. At the last second, I got into the back seat and said, "I'm coming with you." And he looked at me in the rear-view mirror and smirked, "I know."
Its a land. It goes in the 38-42 slot for my decks. And its only a one-time effect when you don't run bounce lands. Bounce lands are great with Bog and Depths :D
Thanks to all for the suggestions.  I think I'm going to split the difference and try instrument (for his rep) and study_buddy1 (for HOS rep).  It's been forever since I've done LSD and when I did it was so scarce who knows what my doses were back then.  I generally have a high tolerance for just about everything though.  Although 1/8 of Colorado's (/u/_Colorado) shrooms had me tripping good.Of course not until the Ag Team gets Dep/With back up and rolling smoothly.Thanks to all, please feel free to keep commenting any and all input is always appreciated.  The legality of some of our activities and habits aside I've felt those of us in the psychedelic/weed community have always been welcoming and helpful.~trip safely
McMiller's 300 yard range is my happy place. They put all the cranky FUDD rangemasters on the 50/100 yard range to harass the mall ninjas and leave the cool guys at 300.
It's also possible that Maseo still might die. CW has shown that they are willing to have the backstory for characters happen during the show (e.g. where Captain Cold gets his no-kill rule from).
I think what's frightening is that if the Great Ones of the Nightmare, which the Moon Presence is, are sympathetic in spirit... then what did Laurence and Gehrman want?  If it was order through fascism, the hunters all have that absolute power.  We can't even die.  Our force is so absolutely unrelenting.  That power comes at a cost, and it functions in a hierarchy.Gehrman is someone I think being controlled or rather, influenced, but it just makes me think that each choice you make has consequences to be considered.  Gehrman being left in the nightmare is one of those.  I think Yharnam may very well be doomed, but the ending seems metatextual to me.  Yharnam isn't real, for us.  That has its own implications to me.  The doom itself is false, but in terms of staying in character, I do think there's a lot to be answered for.  
If he is dead set on 5 chem then use a La Liga Manager. Heads up though, using futhead to build your dream team doesn't show you Ronaldo having 7 chem, but he should be 7 chem with the team that you showed me even without a La Liga Manager.
I'm getting that on every thing I click on as well. And yeah, it was sporadic to start and now on every thing. I think the site is just down for a bit.
It is still trickling out of me over 30 years later, I seem to process it in stages.  I have to be careful about how much time I spend here because I have to balance validation, support, and going into the black hole.
This tends to lead to some awkward moments when Americans and Australians hang out. I was at a house party in America and the hosts had to tell the Australian guy to stop using "the c-word." 
If anything you have a higher obligation to take care of yourself once you have children. It's a goddamn shame to see these sluggish, adipose fucks try to "play" with their children at the park.Really, you're going to just get winded like that after running around for 30 seconds? That's a disgrace, what kind of example is that setting? Don't get me started on ham mothers, they don't even bother with the 30 seconds. Screw that, when im playing with my cousins we're racing to see who can get up the tree first.
What..? The point is it's silly to call out someone's interpretation wrong, and label yours correct when the entire religion is based off an interpretation (well at least part of the point).
I've seen some pretty terrible posts in your sub, seems like your angry fans are very very vocal in putting Tampa down. Sure, there's some good ones, but the majority of the posts I saw seem to be implying that Tampa's fan base is a bunch of idiots.The posts he linked to were pretty bad, but he's not *trying* to make Detroit look bad, you guys made those posts yourself. I'm sorry if you don't agree with it but that's just the way it is. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of finger pointing like OP is doing, but it's a free forum for expressing ideas and opinions and I'm not going to sensor him, even if it does make us look like sore winners.
I don't think the top fan is doing much. Get yourself a pair of server grade blower fans that spin in excess of 5k RPM. Take off all the current fans, tape together the blowers with intakes on opposite sides, and have it point down on the heatsink. I did something similar to this, but with a water cooler.http://i.imgur.com/ydvReCu.jpg
I noticed this on tumblr with some artists. Their self portrait comic self is always thin, then suddenly they start preaching HAES and spewing my body and muh health, muh business, meanwhile comic character stays slim, then BOOM! They post an honest to god real pic of themselves and are at least 350 pounds and are just now claiming to be gender neutral or some shit despite wearing dresses and piling on makeup....but their comic self remains skinny despite their self love and fat empowerment... It's weird
Thanks for the guide - fellow Vlad main here climbing up the ladder. Had some questions:1 - Have you tried out Spell Vamp quints vs. MS? I'm currently running SV which seems to help in lane as well as late game, but I wanted to get your take on it. Also, why a mix of Flat and Scaling CDR blues? Scaling CDR seems to be far more efficient.2 - I have literally never beaten Swain in lane. Ever. I can't afford to trade, so I play safe, but then he pushes wave into tower and resets, and next thing you know I'm down 30 CS by level 9. By the time I get a jungle gank, he's strong enough to 2v1 us and the game is over. Any more tips for this lane from hell (which basically says to let him shove to tower, which I already do)?3. Vlad has lots of HARD counters. Safe to say that he's better as a 'counter' pick than a blind pick?
more like the stun cancelled the animation so he couldn't enchant then. anyway, after the stun wore off he waited 0.5 or so and timed it perfectly, sick play.
Hay que reprocharle a Monedero su torpeza. Comparto al 80% sus opiniones, pero debería haber previsto las consecuencias. sabiendo cómo están los medios.Acordaos del dibujo aquél, en el que Pablo debate en TV y habla de lo poco que tienen que comer los niños, enfrentados al crudo invierno, y los periódicos titulan, después de entrecortar sus declaraciones "Pablo se come los niños crudos".Ahora nos toca a la base convencer uno por uno a nuestros allegados de la verdad. De todos modos, que conste mis simpatías por Monedero y que sepa que contamos con él para el necesario cambio de España.

Your concern is legitimate. Tell him you are aware of her, don't have an issue with him seeing other women (since that's what you agreed to and you're still fine with that), but that you have an issue with risking your health. The current situation is not acceptable to you so he has 3 choices: dump her, dump you, or start using condoms with you (the fourth choice of starting to use condoms with her is not acceptable because you have no way of knowing whether he is actually doing so). Be prepared that he may dump you. However I think he will respect you candor and dump her or just start using condoms with you. Good luck.
Wait, are you being serious? I drove high all the time through high school and some what in college, but it's ridiculous to think it's not an impairment. I don't care if people (not teens or unexperienced drivers, they're dangerous enough) drive a bit high on weed so long as they know how to handle themselves and I don't consider it to be even close to comparable to alcohol.  it's still an impairment. The question is to what level, not if it is at all 
I take a wine glass and turn it upside down and place it on a table. I then take my right hand and slam it down on the glass breaking the base off and leaving the stem with a really sharp point on one end. I then take my hand and press it down on the stem until I reach the bowl. I have it every week like clockwork.
Confirms the benefits? It probably helps prevent infection, but it's unnecessary if you are circumcised by medical professionals. Medical circumcision doesn't involve drawing any blood, because medical circumcision is done through constriction. And if you read the wiki article you'll see that the medical community has voiced concerns that the oral contact could transfer HSV-1 to the infant (as it has done in a few cases). I don't have any problem with the practice - just not sure about the validity of your statement. 
I think we agree. To clarify, it's not the pills themselves, that make me gain weight, but they do mess with my metabolism and one of them even works so that I can't feel if I'm not hungry anymore. So in that sense, I need to watch what I eat and work harder to burn the calories. It doesn't absolve me from the responsability and shouldn't be used as an excuse. 
Switched a week ago to a 144 hz screen from 75 hz and the difference is really immense. The game feels soooo smooth but I wouldn't say it improves one that much.
Kabob is an American spelling, it's not a mistake in need of correction. Unless you do that for every other word we spell differently, in which case carry on.
Even with such a high tolerance? Been at 170mg daily for 3 days now and it seems to feel like how 30-40mg would if I tried it my first few times. It only makes sense to me that I'd be much more hardy to higher doses because of how weak 170mg is for me. Are you saying that the negatives outweigh the positives &amp; certain amounts of the drug just become dangerous at a certain point regardless of tolerance? If so then alright but this doesn't seem like the logical thing to happen given my knowledge of drugs.
Fair enough, but it is a compelling enough reason to convince you, over trying to convince you to buy it :)A lot of people really like the Odd World games, and from what I can tell they're decent platformers.
I had to explain what scope was to a fellow student in a GRADUATE web programming course. At the end of the semester. I don't know how she got that far. She was clueless. 
Between 10 and 11 I forgot about AP completely actually. By the time I made 11 I had enough AP for 13. Badges is what took a while. Now that I am looking at several Million AP for 15, I wish I cared about AP a bit more back then, haha.
Photons do not interact with each other. The strength of interaction with the electromagnetic field is a particle's charge, and photons have none. There is a low possibility of indirect reflection if the photons have enough energy (gamma-ray photons become electron/antielectron pairs, interact, pairs annihilate into new photons doing something different). The angle the photons leave at is random, but the probability distribution is calculable from quantum electrodynamics.
Was able to round using string string.format("%.1f", {wws})Would still like to make it one line with direction speed and the mph. For time to next event I have Hours: {c1bp} - 0.000001 &lt; 0 and '-' or ({c1bp} - {dtp}) &lt; 0 and '-' or math.ceil(({c1bp} - {dtp}) * 24-1)Minutes:  {c1bp} - 0.000001 &lt; 0 and 0 or ({c1bp} - {dtp}) &lt; 0 and 0 or math.ceil(({c1bp} - {dtp}) * 24 *60) - math.ceil(({c1bp} - {dtp}) * 24-1)*60Edit: Still haven't gotten 0 in front if its less then 10
To be fair, the eighties didn't really end culturally until about 1992. I'd say about 6 months after Nevermind by Nirvana came out and murdered that whole "big hair, neon colors" thing. 
Why is everyone assuming because he says he never decline an offer for a STARTING spot on Elements that he never received an offer at all? Elements is an org that loves having subs and it's fairly obvious that if they offered him a spot, it would be a spot as a sub. But nope Reddit circle jerk continues, OMG DAILY DOT IS WRONG OMG LORD VOLDEMORT IS A LYER AND HE SHOULD BE KICKED OUT OF ESPORTS hurr durr.
How the FUCK did I pick on him? He makes a fucking shit ton of requests, and i'm perfectly cool with that, so, I thought I could make a joke, but 7 year olds like you can't comprehend that. Fuck off. Conversation over. You "disgusting asshole."
A bit too kind to the 3d era Mortal Kombat and no exposition on how mechanics, engines and systems changed throughout the years but a nice basic summary of MK's history and storylines.
I'm really excited for the draft, but I'm slightly more excited that I finally found a legit barbershop in town. Everyone who works there has had a barber's license since the 60s and it's like $12 for a cut and a shave. And they're all awesome old dudes and there's a guy who sweeps up and shines shoes. Also when I was there, two of them took some time to give a small class of teenagers with Downs free haircuts, which was pretty cool. And they're really fast at it. And my hair looks great.And now I'm drinking a beer, playing Mario Golf and waiting for the Eagles to give up an RG3-like haul to get a QB while we safely draft good players and beat them anyway.edit: Eagles haven't yet traded things. Still might not. Doesn't matter, beer is good and so are the Cowboys.
Incomprehensible is taking it a bit far. Not to say it is a simple game (or that the rules aren't a mess), but I'd be hard pressed to say it is worse than, say, Magic. Which you do see young kids playing.
He's not pointing out the stats. The unit's ability heals for 5x it's recovery, which it has 0 of. In effect, it might as well not have a special ability.
Only in the broadest sense, and not for moral reasons, but practical reasons.I think most people would agree that murder is immoral, but it is illegal because we would have great difficulties existing as a society if it wasn't.  Lying to someone isn't illegal (in most cases), but it most certainly is immoral.
Found out my grandfather was gay 2 years after he died. His wife (my grandmother) was in total denial that he had been cheating on her with other men for all 50 years they were married. She finally admitted that it was AIDS he died of, not a random illness.

Whenever I see a peacock, I look for dropped feathers so I can get one. Ive never found any but I still do. No idea why. To be fair, it isnt like I run into peacocks every day or anything...
Full disclosure, I don't think I have one cause that is close to my heart. I care a lot about various causes. Perhaps that makes me a bit on the selfish. What is close to my heart is the suffering or problems my loved ones go thru because I know I can make a difference there. 
My question is how the fuck do you even unlock 10/10 for the enforcer rep 4 tier I tried dozens of times to get all four perks im still 0/10 whats the trick.
tbh I would never rule out something like this happening. Jagex in the past has done secret updates (not listed on patch notes) where they would move trees... not farming tree patches, just... trees... regular fucking trees, they would move them, for apparently no reason. Can't find the old thread, wherever it was, it was hilarious that someone had noticed though. 
Riding in a vehicle, almost always my mom's truck and she's driving. Sometimes there is a sibling with us also. We're dangerously close to a cliff or ledge or driving over a bridge over water. I keep saying "you're getting really close, be careful" and whoever is driving is telling me to be quiet and saying "Stop, I know what I'm doing" I get angrier as they get closer and closer, then finally they end up driving off the edge and we plunge into the water. I start freaking out as the car fills up thinking "wow I'm actually gonna die like this."  Lately though, instead of freaking out as it fills up, I'm just really mad, then when we finally drive off, I'm preparing the fastest way possible to open the door/break the glass and escape. Usually thinking "I told you, you idiot..." :|
I have a colt mark IV that I can shoot both 9mm and .38 super. I also have a Springfield in .45 ACP. I shoot the 9mm much more often. Getting the 1911 trigger and slim grip and easy shooting of 9mm in a steel frame gun perfect for me.As far as parts are concerned, the only difference between my two guns is the barrel, bushing, recoil spring, extractor and ejector. The only different design is the ramped barrel. I have had no problem finding parts. You don't need a full length guide rod. Edit: I forgot the slide will have a bit different breach face and barrel opening. But just a different size not design.
Thank you as well! Most likely there should be plenty of housing because Morgan Hall just opened freeing a lot of other dorms. The best options are 1940, 1300, White Hall or Morgan Hall. They are suite style so you don't need to share bathrooms with a ton of people. 
Ahh, I can't really explain to you the situation of where I live..dont worry..no fishes were harmed..and I rather not become a drug dealer..even though I did contemplate it...
I'm of the opinion that...If you don't want to support a good cause because the people suffering stopped you on a road for a while, then that's not really their problem I don't think...
This advice is crap. By all means if you have any evidence they are actually playing games with you then leave and don't go back.However,  I worked for a dealership for many years and it is a first come first serve business. I witnessed several occasions where we had several customers call in or show up on the same car. Just because it sells in an hour or two before you arrive does not guarantee it was a scam. This is exactly why customers are often warned that the car could be sold while they are at home deciding. It's not a trick. It's the truth.Yes there are sleazy salesman out there. But most are just trying to earn an honest living like everyone else.
ok, go open gta v and see if mods work with, or you could google it and read other articles that also say that mods are brokenlike[here](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-gta-5-pc-patch-released-reportedly-breaks-mods/1100-6427017/)[here](http://www.technobuffalo.com/2015/04/22/gtav-snow-mod-for-pc/)[here](http://segmentnext.com/2015/04/30/gta-v-new-patch-fixes-ambient-occlusion-but-breaks-modding-tool-compatibility/)or [here](http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/gaming/573754/GTA-5-Rockstar-ban-mods-ban-FOV-mods-GTA-5-cheats-PC-GTA-Online)
Your first and last link are the exact same US story so clearly you didn't read what you posted. The other two links were for a brief period of time; wages are lagged to inflation so of course one month won't match. Finally, the globe article references the very same metric that I posted that clearly shows wages beating inflation.Still don't believe me? Go to the bank of Canada's inflation calculator and enter the median wage today and the median wage from 1980 and see what you get. Or..... continue on being oblivious to the world around you.
i guess OP isn't aware of the many wars that the USA fought prior to 9-11 that killed more than 900 peopleOP also isn't aware of the many many other man-made situations that have killed more in non-war events. The Sultana disaster in 1865, in which a ferry boat exploded on the Mississippi, killed over 2400 Americans, for instance. Ditto for the General Slocum sinking which killed around 1800 iirc
You should probably read the Mod post about today's plan.  Spoilers in this thread will get you banned for the draft.  Unless you wylin'.  Then you just wylin.
Those are awesome pictures. Brings back great memories. Still waiting to hear if a donor has completed the necessary tests.I'm hoping for a call soon...darn insurance company...take a month per person for testing. 
I was in Mexico for a week and I drank water till I stopped sweating, then a bottle of Gatorade and is start sweating again, just keep alternating it's awesome
He won the UEFA Golden Jubilee poll. I don't know who you talk to about this, or where you hear about this, but he is certainly mentioned frequently as one of the best ever...
I do not personally believe Freddie Gray did this to himself at all.   That being said, nobody has the facts and it was just revealed that he suffered a head injury in the van, and the news station presumes he was standing at the time. http://www.wjla.com/articles/2015/04/breaking-news-no-evidence-found-that-freddie-gray-s-death-was-result-of-police-who-arrested-him-prob.htmlOnce again, These are not my personal opinions on the matter, just what was just released. Personally, i don't think he would be able to stand after seeing him being walked to the van by the officers while in pain and agony. 
It may take me a couple weeks, I'm currently taking several classes through work so extra time is not really there lol. But, first chance I have it'll be read! I'll send it out to me team as well if that's alright
Amiibo: VillagerIn Box or Out of BoxDoesn't matterReason:Beacuse I really like animal crossing series, and the amiibo is really good looking in my opinion :D
Captain Falconoob if that is easier for youdoesn't matterOther than lucario, who I already have, captain falcon is the only amiibo I actually want, and if I get it I will be free forever... (until we see a dlc character I like enough)
It's not as simple as costing v not costing. It's about profit. It's not unreasonable to assume that Riot makes more money if they keep people happy and implement a paid/reward hybrid system. 
I have predominately CDs, due to money mainly, the only Vinyl I have was bought for me so it saved me money haha.Halo 2R, Halo 8, Halo 11 (US release), Halo 13, Halo 14, Halo 16, Halo 17a, Halo 19, Halo 21, Halo 22, Halo 24, Halo 27V, Halo 28 (standard Australian). I really want cassettes, and The Fragile vinyl but I can't afford to spend money at the moment...Slightly related: Sigil #2 as well. (How To Destroy Angels EP)
I expect Anno to direct Godzilla, then, when asked about 3.0 + 1.0, he'll probably say "It would be very difficult to compete with people's expectations, especially since we've waited so long to make it", and cancels the rebuilds altogether. 
It's funny because the "I have never heard of this therefore it is not a thing" is an argument that people are saying is invalid (and it is absolutely an invalid argument) with regard to false rape accusations.Be consistent, friend.
Ahh-still I am not sure it matters. The main reason is that CELTA is very much an introductory course, so the trainers are assessing if you will be able to train up on the job without shooting your self in the foot too often. Thus it concentrates on the nuts and bolts of classroom management  and lesson planning in an EFL context.I know  trainers that have moved on to teach a wider range of subjects, but when they chat about their lessons they are always very clearly tefl trainers in their approach if not in their subject. This is one of the great things about being a tefl trainer- if you can tefl well you can teach anything well. 
Interesting question.  I'd tend to believe that the medication is legally owned by the mother, particularly if the mother paid for it.  If the 17 year old paid then maybe the outcome is different.I will argue that the answer shouldn't be different just because the mother isn't giving them to her as prescribed.  If the mother legally owns the medication then misuse wouldn't just legally default the ownership to the teen absent judicial intervention.  Of course, the mother could possibly be investigated for child neglect at that point, and a judge could take away parental rights (to include the right to make medical decisions for her daughter).  edit: formatting
I have all of those on my drop down, except hotspot, which I don't have enabled...Edit: I enabled the hotspot, then immediately disabled it and it didn't show up, but when I enabled it and pulled the drop down menu down, the hotspot icon was there and now it won't go away.Second edit: if you push and hold on the icons for the hotspot and invert colors, there is an option to hide them.

We could make "#antisjw" the mothership hashtag but topical hashtags are good because it immediately alerts people what the deal is.You see "#sjwcomics" it takes 5 seconds to figure out that SJWs are making a stink about something in comic books. Topical hashtags are going to be used more than a common tag, instead of using gate suffix hashtags like "Comicsgate" or more specific ones like "Sad Puppies" whic is great but takes time to explain this method combines the best of both worlds.
It's madness that this kind of law was even needed in the first place.  &gt; It seems like a matter of common sense that kids would have access to their life-saving medication, said Progressive Conservative MPP Jeff Yurek, who introduced the private member’s bill passed unanimously Thursday.No kidding.  So why is it limited to asthma medication and not other potentially life-saving medications?
In my specialty, our sea/shore rotation was 5yrs/2yrs -- which meant that I spent 5 years on sea duty for every two years on shore duty. Much of that time was spent at sea, and while deployed we stood watch 12hrs on/12hrs off. It was rough, but you got used to it. Not much time for college courses and when you were on shore duty, you wanted to live it up .. or I did, so didn't do much in that direction. While you're on a ship you don't have much room for personal possessions, but over time you can bring larger items if your work space permitted. Had a surfboard for the longest time just in case we hit port where surfing was a thing. But that's only 1/2 of the Navy. Some sailors never go to sea (Seabees), some less frequently than others, every rate has different rotations, so it's hard to say what you'd wind up in. 
I just bought one on eBay (for $25) and then came here and saw this, but I'm not mad at all. The refund was the right thing for Topps to do, removing the card from the chase was going a little bit farther than they probably had to, but I think it's fair. 
I lived above my shop on Gasoline Alley straight South of the speedway. I moved from there to back home in Denver, Colorado where nobody seems to know what racing is.

Statistically speaking at least 99% of people trying to turn standup into a career fail to do it. As long as you are genuinely trying to make people laugh, you're supposed to be there. 
There are laws in many states as to how much the shop can charge for storage, and if it is inside or outside storage. The shop could be looking to eventually put a lien on the vehicle and keep it in lieu of the bill. As has been said, put your insurance to work on it, and do not back down from them, this is what they are paid to do.
Not exactly sure...  but its close to an open window and Bris is cold and wet at the moment...  so I guess he was looking for some warmth.Funny thing is..  he got in there..  behind the salt...  without knocking anything over.  It wasn't till the salt packet fell that we knew he was even there.
I think that way of driving the wheels would be fine if you had a secondary chain to connect to the front sprocket and a very tight chain on the swing arm thing.
From my understanding, the ILWU is only on the West Coast. I know they've gone on strike in support of similar causes in the past, stopping work on [May Day in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Longshore_and_Warehouse_Union#2008_May_Day_work_stoppage) in opposition to war. "On May 1, more than 10,000 ILWU members from all 29 West Coast ports voluntarily stopped work, with some attending rallies held by the ILWU where the union called for working-class people to withhold their labor to protest the war."

Hello! I'm a bot who mirrors websites if they go down due to being posted on reddit.[Here is a screenshot of the website](http://i.imgur.com/tbl4jEX.png).*Please feel free to PM me your comments/suggestions/hatemail.*_____[^FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/Website_Mirror_Bot/wiki/faq)
I'm of the same opinion as you but you should know that this post was originally *not* stickied. It was only stickied after it seemed like it was never going to be on the front page. After 2 hours, it had 20 points and 5 comments. Seems like this just isn't that interesting to people right now.So, uh, this actually turned out to be a legitimate use of sticky!
Then there would be entirely different words used to describe each and every situation. This language couldn't be defined and learned, it would be pure glossolalia. If only our petty minds were capable of understanding such a language.
That's a very good point and I agree with you to a large extent. If you are American like me, we do play these convoluted games about religious freedom that blur into abuse of that power - namely oppressing others when it's your "right" to do so. I'm all for religious freedom as long as you aren't hurting anybody else, even if I think you're wrong and ridiculous. 
No, I'd let them know that the person should improve on something and learn from their mistakes rather than having them get fired outright.  To deliberately get someone fired for a fixable mistake is just cruel.
More like tens of thousands of dollars, but not many hundreds of thousands.Individual cash transactions in Japan up to around ten thousand dollars are common and normal.
Nah, I saw him ages ago in FA and asked if he did requests (since he doesn't do commissions), and he said yes. I sent him my deets about a week ago and sort of forgot.
Doesn't matter. Their military will be depleted, which will give you the 5-10 years you need to boost relationship with them. I highly doubt they will be rebellious.
I don't get where all the hate for OP is coming from.  I thought it was a good story and was not bragging at all.  Thanks for sharing.  Also I wouldn't go around taking nutrition advice from random people on the internet either...
I agree that they aren't on the same level. Slavery is obviously far more serious than what I am talking about, but is it not analogous?There may be some places that permit one to go naked under freedom of speech, but Arizona is definitely not one of them. The laws explicitly say that genitals and areolae must be covered. I haven't looked into the situation with any other states but I would be surprised if many of them were wildly different.
So, Moran was sliding into second head first and just took a ball thrown from the outfield to the face...Update: out of the game, walked off holding his chin/bottom lip
Congratulations! Your life is just starting! ahha. I am lead to believe that college is a completely different world (I wouldn't know, never went =P).Well... I am building a new house (My first), it starts getting built in a month or so. I am also engaged and getting married in June next year which is crazy. Apart from that not much haha. It is a rather financial stressful time though &gt;,&lt;
It's not condescending if you actually are misunderstanding something, which I genuinely believe you are.I'll ignore your condescension (irony?) and skip right to your argument:There isn't weather that contradicts climate change.There's weather that contradicts the misnomer "global warming" when it's taken at a literal face value, but that's totally moot, since it is, as I said, a misnomer.No climate change proponent believes that all weather all the time will be X, Y, or Z. Most believe that trends will continue shifting towards extremes, as is stated in the links I gave and as I originally stated in my first post.If you think I'm making two separate and contradictory arguments, you're going to have to lay them out as simply as possible so that I can tell you where your misunderstanding is arising from.
Knockback is arguably useless against even Creepers.To put it this way: spamclicking with an iron or diamond sword will kill a Creeper before it explodes. Unless you're knocking the Creeper into a wall, Knockback will prevent you from doing that unless you also have Sharpness.It's overall a really detrimental enchant outside of PvP, and even in PvP it's only useful for people who prefer archery or on a secondary weapon for when an opportunity to knock someone off a cliff/ledge/etc presents itself.
A valid question.It's just a broad "stick your finger in the wind" measure of equality. It doesn't say if a film is good or bad or if it's particular feminist. Given all things equal, a film should have a diversity of gender and on average films are as likely to have two women discussing something other than a man (surprisingly not as common as one should expect) as a film is likely to have two men discussing something other than a woman (which is pretty common place).The fact that films so frequently fail the Bechdel test, to me, is an indicator of inequality of gender. 
Only the Navy/USMC consider E4s to have NCO-equivalent responsibilities (i.e. as a Petty Officer).That being said, I would say the Army and the Marines certainly place similar levels of responsibility (probably more so in the USMC) on SPCs/Cpls. I really can't speak for the junior AF ranks, most of my interactions with them have been at the senior NCO and officer levels.
A couple evenings of work for the lift, (Would have been one night if the trailing arm nut hadn't stripped) then a couple afternoons cutting and bashing my wheel-wells for the tire fit. Probably should have gone smaller with the wheels, but I really like how they look.

Carbohydrates are a category of molecule that organisms need to survive, which consists of sugars, starches, and fibers found in food.Bread is so widespread because it's a cheap, voluminous, available means of delivering carbohydrates. Also because wheat, and its grassy relatives, are found widely around the world.Cultures that do not eat plentiful bread (Eastern Asia, Americas) surely have a substitute that's equally as prevalent in their cuisine, such as rice, corn, quinoa, or whatever.
Anxiety is intertwined with IBS more often than not.  And anxiety makes everything more difficult than it has to be.  I take Imodium (loperamide) before doing things that will cause anxiety, like flying or being away from a bathroom.  If you let it dissolve under your tongue, it works instantly and has sort of a calming effect.  I also avoid my trigger foods (dairy &amp; greasy fried stuff) when I'm traveling.      I'm primarily IBS-C but the opposite happens occasionally.  I'm flying tomorrow and have been dealing with anxiety-induced bubble guts for 2 days already :\ 
The former psychiatrist-in-chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital says a mental disorder that deserves understanding, treatment and not surgery Gender reassignment surgery does nothing to address the XY and XX chromosome that define make and femaleGender reassignment surgery doesn't result in sex organs capable of reproduction.

The interesting thing is that, before these two were television hosts, they pursued academic careers. One has a doctorate in mathematics, while the other's is in physics.

Stormfront has a huge and organized presence on reddit, and they upvote each other. It's not so much an obsession as a totally inadequate counterprotest. Also, go back to stormfront.
What whispersilk said :)    I saw a thread a few days ago with an argument about it, and while I was pretty sure she had a death touch I couldn't remember anywhere in the story where it explicitly said so, so I didn't get involved. Now that I found it I just wanted to share it.
The gold items are insanely good for allowing you to upkeep gold income in the event you have to constantly buy and place pink wards, as well as if you are behind and have not hit late-game yet when you are wielding 20k+ gold earned.
I always wished that Diana could apply her passive in an AoE if it was up and she used E. Think of the tactical plays. However, I think that would make her pushing potential way too strong.
this was posted by u/art36.  &gt;I've seen this line thrown around a bunch. The difference is that the police are an institution in place in society. If you can't trust 100% of the police force to act respectfully and have the best intentions for the citizens they serve in mind, than the institution has failed. Complete trust is necessary in that relationship. These public servants have a much higher standard to abide to than the average citizen. So, while I don't believe the majority of police officers are at fault for these heinous actions, it is certainly a number large enough to demand criticism. Finally, even though most police may not be "bad cops." the force is definitely a fraternity and they all protect their own, which makes it more difficult to weed out the bad apples.permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive 
By definition, accepting implies belief. It doesn't make sense to say you accept evolution as true while at the same time not actually believing evolution is true.
This is another one of those stories that makes me want to encourage my kids to get a job as a server at some point, even if for a few months. If the douche in this story ever had the situation flipped on him, he'd surely have raised some hell. Too many people don't understand the shit servers put up with. 
Lol i only have one reddit.  You can easily get to my FA from reddit but not the other way around.  My FA is mildly nsfw but is no where near as bad as my Prnz account on FA ;3My weasyl accnt has all my art on it though.  Nasty and clean.  But I believe I have it set to not show up in search engines when you look for the user name. 
I know i am in a small minority, however if Chroma's are given via Mastery of champion i want the options to refuse/reject them. It's not about money. I simply don't consider them skins and i don't want them on my account. *This sounds harsh i know, i just don't know how to word it differently. Please don't take offense to the wording.*
As someone who's been in this situation too many times, it's still really hard to move on. It's far easier to just stick around in an unhealthy situation because at least it's something. It's terrifying to make that leap, especially when you've had a bad history when it comes to romance.But I do agree. It's absurd. But I understand if people get stuck in these situations. I personally just don't want to hear people complain about it and do nothing. That's what makes the difference to me.
Your sound in Windows might be configured for a 4.1/5.1/7.1 speaker setup, so any sounds sent to the "back" channels aren't being played since your headphones will be treated as the front 2 channels.So check the Control Panel &gt; Sound to make sure it's set to either Headphones or 2 speakers.  Also check whatever mixer/control panel came with your soundcard software for the same thing.Also make sure your headphones are plugged into the amped headphone output on the card and not one of the 5.1 outputs since the ZX does have a separate output for 5.1 setups.
It was reported that were a lot of top clubs interested in him like Arsenal, Man Utd and a few more. So it makes sense he would have been sold for those price tags.

Many people are only on SSRI's temporarily. There's a lot of good advice on here (and a lot of bad), but I would recommend that your best first step is to see a doctor. He will almost certainly recommend that you try an SSRI. Your condition isn't fun, and is the root of all your problems. 
I can't stand the local radio, and I haven't been impressed by most of the new releases lately so I've been listening to a lot of audio books. I've listened to the entire available Song of Fire and Ice series, Guns, Germs, and Steel, and a bunch of other books. Audible is my life.
Sure some of these marriages weren't doing well but it's  not like TRP made anything better. Hell, I'm pretty sure some of these marriages could have been saved if there was an honest, productive effort,  based on sound professional expertise,to preserve the marriage. In two of the posts, the wives suggested counseling and what did the MRPers do? Whine and bitch on TRP.Any forum that promotes petty mind games to keep their partners in check is brewing a recipe for disaster. 
&gt; Trying to guarantee resource availability on a more universal scale, however, has the same problems as trying to force equality of outcome.Unequal resource distribution will always be present in anything but the most perfect communist society.In terms of gender equality though it is easier. There are roughly equal numbers of males and females born in all socioeconomic levels of society. The test is whether, statistically, males and females have the same resource availability. Those born to rich families will have more resources than those born to poor families. However, a boy and girl born to a rich family should both have the same resources, as should a boy and girl born to a poor family.
I looked up non sequitur in my dictionary, and this is the definition:&gt;  Doby told officers she had had smoked flakka, and suffered hallucinations from the drug in the past. It wasn't clear if she had an attorney.
Booker T would never make a joke about that. Anyone capable of understanding context knew exactly what he meant, and I'm sure the second it came out he was pretty mortified.
Welcome. Its never PURELY recreational.Okay sex *evolved.*If you consent to sex, the probability of pregnancy is something, compared to zero for not consenting sex(except rape).You agreed for sex, you agreed to that small probability of pregnancy. Now its your choice to do what ever you wish with the embryo.
Worked at a BBQ joint. A guy wanted a whole rack of ribs not sliced up. We had to slice it at least in half to fit in the to go box. Are we stupid or something? The guy asked for it whole. How unreasonable we were not to toss the whole thing in a plastic bag
I think the people in this little branch of the thread are being a bit unfair or even elitist. If you're specifically looking for a heavier game, and you've put enough thought into it to make a WSIG, I'd assume you at least have a decent idea that you'd enjoy either game and are asking about the better one. I don't see any reason you would need to "educate" yourself with the classics before being allowed to buy newer heavy games.
Yep. I agree. I had a shiba inu before I adopted my very friendly shelter dog, and he just didn't tolerate any dog being in his personal space. Before he died, he began to even snap at small children. I just accepted that dog parks were never going to be a part of our routine.
You can also refresh the diamond dealer to take more items. Buying at least one item, loading a new area (such as the bossmaster's room), and going back to the lobby will give the diamond dealer three new items. Repeat until you run out of diamonds. The items are rarely strong, but a lot of medium items is good too. Just remember to not buy a weapon. Food is okay for cycling items though.
The broadcast was pretty badly laggy in my experience, I had to turn off the stream just because it was getting irritatingly slideshow like.  Thanks for posting this clip! I didn't get to catch it
People who cannot sit still or relax for one second. Had some lady like this on a flight and I'm pretty sure she was days away from a nervous breakdown.
Statistically speaking, it only makes sense to rate something 1 or 5 stars if you want your vote to mean the most. It's not surprising that this is the result.
My wife and I have done a lot of geo-caching around Richmond. It takes you to a lot of neat places and you get of hunt for treasure at the same time! You just need you cell phone with a GPS and a couple of useful apps and you are ready to have an adventure.
Ehh, maybe. Maybe a small damage increase? Fire rate? Really seems like something to have if you don't have a Medic on your team so a boost for the frontlines instead of the retreat would likely be needed.

Great Job.  I like this idea for an on the go type antenna. Easy to disconnect and store, then reconnect when ready. Any interest in providing the files to make one?
Nope, they're listed as blue in his profile in various places, so they're definitely blue. Plus, in various Blacklist promo pictures, his eyes are somewhat highlighted to bring out the blue. It's probably an oversight. Seeing (HA! See what I did there?) as how they left "Name an occupation"  in the occupation(s) space, it wouldn't be too far fetched to think they might mess up the eye color.
I'm always willing to talk too. I've had plenty of friends with suicidal thoughts and depression, and I know it sucks more than anything else in the universe. I'm always here to help, because I don't want anyone to go through this alone.
Except this was sadly a farce told millions of time and yet still believed up there with "everyone but me sucks at driving!" And "if I say I don't like drama, then I truly don't like drama".Other notable and well believed falsehoods include "he's a Neptune, I'm a Venus, and that guy is a saggitarious, also blue eyes and being born on march means you're totally gay"  
Just because someone wants a long-term relationship doesn't mean they're in panic mode.  I would hazard a guess that the 35-40 crowd doesn't have the time or patience for the "casual dating" scene.  Many of us have BTDT in our 20s.  Casual dating for over a decade gets old fast, trust me.  
The reason they say that in the first place is to parrot what we say about them.  But since they don't really have a logical argument for turning it around, it comes off like a "NO U".
I sent out 2 last Saturday and still haven't gotten anything from Verizon either. Dumbass me didn't write down the tracking info either, so at this point I think it's a crap-shoot.On the bright side, I did just get my 13 boxes in to send off the rest. Unsure if I will right now tho. Going to give it a few days and see how all this works out for others.
Good question!So this is my fourth account. The first three I reached 4000+ karma in 1-2 months, and got a snoovatar from gold on two of them. I'm not particularly funny or insightful, so it's just be sheer brute force and constant commenting and posting that I reach those numbers, very modest for a season veteran, but obscene for a college student. After every time I reach 4000 Karma I take a long look in the mirror, full of disgust and self-hate, and say to myself "never again." And yet, here I am. Also on one of them I gave away *so much* personal info by comments and subs that I participated in, it would be very easy for anyone who knows me to piece it together and get to know me even more intimately.
I went into that dealership knowing what the invoice was, the state sales tax rate, and I figured out that $500 above that number was "a fair deal".  That was my goal, at any rate.  The first haggled price came out to exactly what I was going for, so I was happy.When I got the phone call, I was just really put off, so I wasn't bluffing at all when I tried to cancel it.  I still don't know how or why they would go $1500 below the agreed price (which, as I understood it, would have put them 1k below the invoice after the sales tax), but I couldn't pass up that deal.So yeah, it felt fantastic :)
100%. When people use this as an excuse for abstinence only sex Ed, I think "yeah, if that's the case very few people will get proper sex education. That's something I want people to know. That's very important for a functioning society." 
    def x():        # stuff        def y():            pass        # more stuffIs perfectly valid and heavily relied on for implementing decorators for example.The reason they won't work in your example is because function declarations are statements while lambdas are expressions and the language is more restrictive on where statements are allowed. Its the same reason `if x = 2:` is a error.

I've never used a ceramic heat bulb but I do have a heat lamp. It's just a regular 43watt bulb. I have a night lamp too and that is a 50watt bulb.  My thermostat regulates them by turning them off when the temp gets too high. I'd like to switch to a thermostat that regulates voltage instead of turning the lamps on and off but it's no big deal. I switch out the lamps before bed and after waking up. It seems like a pain but I really like it because I always mist while I'm at the tank anyways. I feel that if I had a ceramic bulb plus a daylight,  it would be harder to maintain humidity because too much air would flow through. I have a screen top but I keep it covered with a combination of two wet rags and aluminum foil.  I'm getting off topic. Wattage isn't too important if you'll have a thermostat regulating them when it gets too hot. 
I just tried visiting check.torproject.org using latest Google Chrome and got the same color, but the whole text was:&gt;However, it does not appear to be Tor Browser.So it just detect the user agent(and more?) for Tor Browser.
I've been ordering food for a bunch of student events lately, and I've been just following orders and ordering meat for everyone like they tell me to. I feel shitty ordering meat, and there's never ANY option for me at the places we order from without an extra specialized item on our stretched budget. So then I do all of the ordering and organizing and sit with some food from home at these events. I just don't want to be an asshole refusing to order pepperoni or asking for an entire pizza to my individual needs that no one else shares.
BUG Delver was pretty big in Legacy before the printing of Shardless Agent,  if I remember correctly.  But RUG will always be a mainstay of the Legacy meta.

I wouldn't say it proved this thing generated thrust, they just failed to falsify that it generates thrust. It could still be a mistake in experimental design or some factor they didn't account for. This is why they're still going to be doing more experiments. It's not just to figure out how this thing would work but to see if there are reasons why this could be generating thrust that they didn't account for in the other experiments.
It's a pity that you're so averse to encouraging diversity in STEM fields because some of the best and most dedicated engineers I know in school are women.  
Don't assume malice when ignorance will do, yes the policymakers are pretending that all it does is force the average Joe to pay for someone else's sex, but the people simply believe it.That or they believe it will encourage kids to have sex, regardless that they were out fucking young.
It's from a show called Portlandia. There are episodes on netflix. The show is about "hipster-ish" people who live in Portland. Each episode is comprised of a bunch of small skits. these skits are either new for each episode or are a continuation of similar skits from other episodes. Sometime there are main story lines that continue or are common through skit to skit, and even episode to episode. I think the show is very funny, but it is a type of satirical humor that can be quite weird at times.
