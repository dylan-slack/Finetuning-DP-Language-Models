Yeah. It sounds familiar to me, too.
Why does no one love Williams..
Small typo: It says "Dread Cosair: Kept...".
THOU HATH BEEN FORGIVEN YOUNGBLOOD
my favorite photo of her of all time
Does Williams have leprosy?
Well crap, I thought it was a foot.
Pffft, wayyyyy better than them getting Leo.
Don't sell that damn lighting coil


He needs work and he may need surgery.
&gt;best player in the draft 

K
WHY DIDNT YOU TRADE DOWN?????????
yeah, tec9 is shit now compared to the 5-7
Jesus christ do we take LEONARD WILLIAMS? OMG
"Irritated" obviously understated. Bastard OP. 
That isn't necessarily a bad thing though 
**THE REDSKINS FUCKING SUCK**
Ctrl + F "cunt"


81 matches.
You're bad for society in general. 
Dam, the bears are getting Leonard
Got you added and am online now!
WAOOWW!!! In all seriousness, great play
I don't want the Jets getting Leo.
I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK IF WE TAKE BEASLY

Very well played Washington
Valid point, we need a control. 
Could be their crew color 
Excellent pick cant go wrong with an Iowa man
We needed OT but this sucks. 
Well, okay then. Good job Washington.  
They call me 'tater salad.
Gotta have a strong OL to be successful
Oh, I know it. I'm an exresident
"I hardly ever have anything to do Varis"
So, less? I don't get your point...
leonard is got to be a bear
You bend that cap! You know you're white!
You got it. Gotta love um all though. 
How much would we have to give up to get to 6?
We like to circle jerk each other.
Sc13nce aka safeway has always done me right.
Good for online but terrible for single player.
I'll say "scooped out of" for moderninity.
Redskins needed an OL badly
Surprised it wasn't Leonard Williams 

^^^The ^^^one ^^^I ^^^actually ^^^posted ^^^xP
GURL! I'm dead this done killed me RIP.
His story stinks to high heaven.
Hopefully. I've had enough of the Waltrips.
Hate to say it but Leonard Williams?
It just keeps linking back here.  WTF?
Landed in Dallas Texas.  Go reds.  
Almost the definition of devil's advocate? Haha
pls keep doing what you're doing
ill buy it right now for 150k
As long as you dont get Williams.
&gt;The ~~Nuge~~ McDavid Awakens
RIP Seattle Predator Catchers
What a stupid play by Carlson
Jets gonna take blarcus blariota 
Back up to double the points!  76-38.
Holy shit if the jets get Leonard 
~~Maybe they can finally get along?~~
Chicago got the clamps on defense. 
This has been reposted long before /r/thebutton
Look at those monster hands.
Wow, honestly thought he'd fall to us.
I may have been a bit preemptive. 
It's still terrible, though. 
Not really. Bears would have taken him at 7.
Since it's BO3, just put 6 grips on there!
No mechanically inclined friends? or bravery?
Team needs &gt; BPA i guess
I don't see the correlation can you elaborate
In Eric DeCosta we appreciate
Oh shit, that's next level thinking. 
Oh I loved this stuff. I miss it so bad. 
He sure doesn't look 3. He seems very happy
PLEASE WILLIAMS PLEASE I WILL DO ANYTHING
I was not expecting that. 
ahaha, this makes so much more sense
Didn't Bush the younger introduce tax cuts?
Yup, it all starts up front.
Is it another DDoS attack?
Spring rolls for the duck sauce! 
I prefer him over Leonard 
The bears have to be shitting themselves.
I've always thought that too.
LOL Mariners home give away is fedoras. M'ariners
I WANT FREE TUITION I HAVE A SPENDING PROBLEM. 
To defeat ^^hi-yah! Ro-mannn
at this point how do we not pick williams? 
my best guess is the burning crusade
How far will williams drop? This is fun 
Oh wow. More dudes? I love this place. 
As long as Leonard falls to the Texans. Plz 
Too late! I do this for you!
I'm guessing it won't be IDPA legal.
Pig or Men or simply PigMen
See guys. taking Cooper wasnt dumb.
That was answered quickly 
we did it first. 2010 bitches
I go back and forth between the directions.
Maybe the guy cheating is also a bitch.
for starters, he stabs people.


Shipping is gonna kill ya..... 
Tackle...the least sexiest pick 
Yeah Derrick "2 days rest" Rose is unstoppabull.
I love this sub so much already
So the 5.5lb is a lie or what?
Red Hot Chili Peppers could be pretty cool
http://i.imgur.com/vfNqcBZ.jpg

Fuuck bears might take Williams!!! Pls Jets

Gonna be Shariff Floyd 5.0
Cousin wants in. Just hit it true and hard, Z.
This is a great pick honestly.
Reports are coming out about a shoulder injury
My shower timing is impeccable...
Wow that's such a relief. 
I quit the show before the tears began 
You can take Derrick out now, Thibs. Please?
YESSSSS HAHAHA U DONE GOOOFED WASHINGTON!!!
If you keep saying it it won't happen! 
How do we know that, could be a small one
Ah, thanks for letting me know.
You look better with short hair, big time
It's okay Sarah. You are safe now. 
I DON'T CARE BUT I HOPE HE SLIDES DOWN TO #15
Jets gonna do something crazy? 
Green eyes brown hair inspo? 
Agreed.  I can see McLellan in STL actually.
We're about to be up by 40 points lol

We need to do this immediately
How is it living in the future
This just freaked the heck out of me. 
Well, looks like you were right!
Way cool!  Thanks for sharing.

We gotta play like this every night.
HE WILL BE BLINDED BY ALL THE DONG
I think Nico liiiiikes you
Seems sort of like the definition of one
Lol why not Leonard Williams?
Guys.... What of Leonard slips to us?
Congratulations.

You've invented the ox.  
Fuck. I wanted the Giants to draft him
Ugh fuck Williams in Chicago
It's actually on PS3 and PSP too haha.
Why did that give me a boner.
So glad i think leonard is gonna be a stud
certified fresh and not out in theaters yet?
WE'RE ABOUT TO DRAFT LEONARD WILLIAMS FAM BOOK IT
"He's got huge hands, thick cock"
the Rams would like to have a word with you
Yeah, same boat - 34 here.  Too old for MFA. :(
Now I wanna know what McCatty said. 
COME ON WILLIAMS. WERE KILLING QBS IN NY
Obligatory, "Thanks, Babcock!"
Have you considered Bug Spray?
What am I looking at here?
Like in the United States. 
It works without the apostrophe
Is Williams gonna make it to the Bears?
how the fuck did williams fall this far
did not see him sliding to 6
&gt;Jerk baby.

Wasting milk is not cool!!

Please fuck this up Jets, please. 
Bought a soldering kit from /u/Readysethorrible
Leonard Williams @ 12 pls...
Nobody, thats his problem.

*no killer instinct*
I don't have a newsletter, sorry.
Very deflated. Nobody's really into the game. 
We had him Lagares played perfectly.
where were you when chip was kill
Beef jerky sounds uncomfortable.
Should we trade up for Williams? 
whats the story so far? just woke up.
I was hoping it'd be a chunk.
Derrick is digging their grave.
holy fuck that kid is a beast
Bill Callahan loves 0-lines
Poor williams must be getting stressed. 
Nope. Shame never really helps anything. 
Oh well.  At least he didn't go to the Browns.
That's a fucking head shot 
At least when we reach for a lineman, it's at 31.
*she plants a soft, loving kiss on his lips*
Ahhhh gotcha, is the shark appealing as well?
Barefax has a free buffet...
Not sure because I've never not used shock pads
Like I said, your front office is special.
You mean, trade to #2 and take Eichel!
Up vote gets to 25 we upload a squirt pic
could you guys imagine the jets with leonard? 
So I feel like you like Matt Adams
when will we get real nudes *w*
"jesus"

or so i would suspect
Guard or Center is less sexy
Not fat doesn't always equal healthy.
Now, he better not fuck up lovie's fucking day.

I read that in maddens voice
They better not also break up Kepner and Avery

Do not let Williams fall to the Bears jets!

What makes you think Op hasn't?
Jets pls don't take Williams

Yeah. It sounds familiar to me, too.
Why does no one love Williams..
Small typo: It says "Dread Cosair: Kept...".

He needs work and he may need surgery.
&gt;best player in the draft 

K
WHY DIDNT YOU TRADE DOWN?????????
yeah, tec9 is shit now compared to the 5-7
Jesus christ do we take LEONARD WILLIAMS? OMG
"Irritated" obviously understated. Bastard OP.

WAOOWW!!! In all seriousness, great play
I don't want the Jets getting Leo.
I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK IF WE TAKE BEASLY

Very well played Washington
Valid point, we need a control. 
Could be their crew color 
Excellent pick cant go wrong with an Iowa man
We needed OT but this sucks. 
Well, okay then. Good job Washington.  
They call me 'tater salad.
Gotta have a strong OL to be successful
Oh, I know it. I'm an exresident
"I hardly ever have anything to do Varis"
So, less? I don't get your point...
leonard is got to be a bear
You bend that cap! You know you're white!
You got it. Gotta love um all though. 
How much would we have to give up to get to 6?
We like to circle jerk each other.
Sc13nce aka safeway has always done me right.
Good for online but terrible for single player.
I'll say "scooped out of" for moderninity.
Redskins needed an OL badly
Surprised it wasn't Leonard Williams

This has been reposted long before /r/thebutton
Look at those monster hands.
Wow, honestly thought he'd fall to us.
I may have been a bit preemptive. 
It's still terrible, though. 
Not really. Bears would have taken him at 7.
Since it's BO3, just put 6 grips on there!
No mechanically inclined friends? or bravery?
Team needs &gt; BPA i guess
I don't see the correlation can you elaborate
In Eric DeCosta we appreciate
Oh shit, that's next level thinking. 
Oh I loved this stuff. I miss it so bad. 
He sure doesn't look 3. He seems very happy
PLEASE WILLIAMS PLEASE I WILL DO ANYTHING
I was not expecting that. 
ahaha, this makes so much more sense
Didn't Bush the younger introduce tax cuts?
Yup, it all starts up front.
Is it another DDoS attack?
Spring rolls for the duck sauce! 
I prefer him over Leonard 
The bears have to be shitting themselves.
I've always thought that too.
LOL Mariners home give away is fedoras. M'ariners

How far will williams drop? This is fun 
Oh wow. More dudes? I love this place. 
As long as Leonard falls to the Texans. Plz 
Too late! I do this for you!
I'm guessing it won't be IDPA legal.
Pig or Men or simply PigMen
See guys. taking Cooper wasnt dumb.
That was answered quickly

I was hoping it'd be a chunk.
Derrick is digging their grave.
holy fuck that kid is a beast
Bill Callahan loves 0-lines
Poor williams must be getting stressed. 
Nope. Shame never really helps anything. 
Oh well.  At least he didn't go to the Browns.
That's a fucking head shot 
At least when we reach for a lineman, it's at 31.
*she plants a soft, loving kiss on his lips*
Ahhhh gotcha, is the shark appealing as well?
Barefax has a free buffet...
Not sure because I've never not used shock pads

Look at those monster hands.
Wow, honestly thought he'd fall to us.
I may have been a bit preemptive. 
It's still terrible, though. 
Not really. Bears would have taken him at 7.
Since it's BO3, just put 6 grips on there!
No mechanically inclined friends? or bravery?
Team needs &gt; BPA i guess
I don't see the correlation can you elaborate
In Eric DeCosta we appreciate
Oh shit, that's next level thinking.

No idea -- I try not to listen to him. 
Kicking someone and sending him flying and no damage really makes no sense,   what if the damage is a percentage of the targets current health? , is that too strong? 
Yeah.  I mean, it was never actually made formal as far as "This is my wife, Beth, this is our girlfriend Teslok," and that would actually have made me uncomfortable.  For a while there, in the first year or so, it was more like I was their pet alien, because I was so ... socially ruined that I had to learn a lot of things from the ground up.  
I gotchu fam.I forgot a step. You're gonna want to group everything together before you do that. So get everything in the logo aligned how you like, group, then horizontal/vertical align with rectangles. 
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that's shitty. Hopefully it's' been a long time since it happened. With these situations, the other person doesn't think about it *anywhere near* as much as we do. The person who did the embarrassing shit always thinks it was much worse than it was. Hope that makes you feel a bit better.

You ram speed can also be a factor; but I'd def  look into your clock speed, and check all your drivers of course, make sure your .net framework updates are installed. Arma is not very well optimized, and I have a 780, fx8120, 16gb ramm and I'll still Fram drop on skyrim....I guess it's pretty heavily modder though. And I'll run only a solid 30fps on Arma three..
I know how you feel. After my first accident, the insurance company wanted to write off my bike. Having owned it for 2 years until then, fixing it and only riding 1 month until the crash, I've grown quite attached to the bike (it's also my first one), so when they told me they wanted to write it off, both me and my dad went berzerk in them. Worked, got new parts, new paintjob and it got into a better condition than it ever was
I took all AP courses my senior year in high school (I liked the fact they didn't give homework and you just took a test each quarter). My AP psychology teacher was a psycho bitch who really didn't like me and told me I'd never pass her tests let alone the AP exam at the end of the year.I was one of only two people in her entire class that passed the AP psych test that year.
make serqet's ult's reach a little longer but keep the indicator the same so there's less chance of it interacting weirdly (same with ao's)and make serqet's hitbox actually off the ground when her model is off the groundtired of getting targeted when i'm supposed to be untargetable
oh man i just finished watching x files a couple of weeks ago. around march i started hearing rumors that they were taking it down in april but fortunately that was just an april fools prank. I think they did take it down for a day though
Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's any reason to play the original RE 1 now that Remake is widely accessible. It has just made this weird situation where everything get's downgraded from a technical standpoint for the next 3 games.

Completely understood. It's essentially plug and play unless you're looking to add the second horn like your set up. I appreciate the comment. Thanks so much for the info. This will have to be my next upgrade 
I fear you might be right. Danish exceptionalism is definitely thriving all over the country. Although regular Danes easily change opinions concerning the EU, they are also massively uninformed and quick to focus on negative sides while ignoring that 50%-66% of our laws (which work great) can be traced directly back to the EU. It does feel a bit utopian to imagine the population and our politicians suddenly becoming massively pro-Europe and maybe even federalist. I'll keep a packed suitcase under my bed in case it gets relevant.
Sorry, maybe I should have been more clear, the point of my question was to narrow down my search to quality movie specific t-shirts similar to the website I linked. Amazon is basically looking in the Walmart of the internet. 
Ok, let me help ya'll out a bit. Get out a map of the USA, and a pencil. Put your pencil right where the Mississippi River crosses the Tennessee/Kentucky border. Draw a line straight east to the Atlantic Ocean. There is no good BBQ north of that line. There is also no good BBQ west of that river. There is also no good BBQ in the parts of Louisiana east of that river, get the shrimp instead if you are there. 
Aren't those just as loud as Blues? I was under the impression that it's the same stem with a different spring, like the relationship between Red and Black.

&gt; I don't think that reasonable + rational + logical = objectivityWell objectivity to subjectivity is a scale isn't it, the better the methodology, the more snippets of understanding of reality we will get, the better the theory the better closer it is to reality. So reasonable + rational + logical = *higher levels of* objectivity.&gt; but if we're going by the true definition of objective, we can't have objective knowledge of anything without have full knowledgeI disagree. We don't need full knowledge for it to be reasonably 'objective', and how objective and objectivity are defined is a matter of interpretation.
Fripp's already pretty against digital music so he already did this begrudgingly, so I doubt we're getting that when he'd be getting even less money out of it. Weird that that tribute to King Crimson album is on there though.
I think I understand what he meant, and the title of this post is swinging the opinions a bit. He's just saying that if someone is out there looking to commit assault, you can assume they'd rather target someone who's alone. 
I hope not.  It's already hard enough to swallow that a complete moron is way richer/more successful than I'll be.  Him achieving that while actually being mentally retarded would be too much to deal with.  
It is actually quit interesting. Religious people like Islam and Russians, scared of the gays but men kissing other men is perfectly normal for them. And on top of that these people that are so scared of gays all bade together nude. Why on earth would you want to bade with other males nude if you are not gay? 
Here's the thing, unless her marriage somehow impacts him financially or materially, it's none of his business and you have no obligation to tell him or to have to tiptoe around his potential feelings regarding your mother's remarriage. I know that's not going to make a difference to your father, but it should inform your approach. Next time you talk to him, mention it, but don't harp on it and don't answer all the questions that are sure to come. A whole lot of 'I don't know' and changing the subject.         I have a mother and sister who are somewhat estranged and a stepmother. When I speak to my mother, she doesn't ask about me or my life, she wants to know what my sister is doing and she wants to know what my stepmother is doing. It's none of her business. I can't tell her that, because it would be the end of the goddamned world, but it's not. So I tell her I don't know and change the subject. 
Move forward in your stance, tee it up higher, and think swing up. Also tilting your spine angle to the right may help, but can't know that without a video. If you have a coach, why aren't you asking them? Strangers on the internet that have never seen you swing and aren't coaches/golf professionals can't possibly give you better advice.
Holy shit OP, that title.No one fights for humanity.  They fight because they have to, or because they're paid, or because they have a military alliance, or for an ideology, or for their home.  No one fights a war because it's the right thing to do.  Ever.

I ported my Wind number to VoIP.ms and got a Bell flex data tablet SIM for my phone. If I use 1GB of data I pay $20, up to 5GB and I pay $40. My VoIP.ms ends up costing $2-$3 per month. Most months I pay half what my WIND plan used to cost, and the rest I pay the exact same.I get WAY faster data (because I can use LTE now) and the voice quality is much, much better. And if I'm on WiFi I basically have a perfect cell signal. I can make calls and send SMS from TCONNECT-enabled subway platforms. I am so happy with this change.
Cosplay is supposed to be a fun hobby. Dress what you want to dress as. If people notice your character and enjoy it, then rock on. If not, then just be happy in wearing a costume that you want to wear. Sometimes the best moments are when you dress as something "outdated" or niche, and find that ONE person that recognizes you. It has the same effect, if not better, than a swarm of people around you because you were (insert popular character of that year).
I'm a volunteer in hospice. My coordinators are very accommodating and usually want to make sure it's a good fit. Be honest. If you need more responsive patients, say that. Dealing with folks with dementia is not for everybody. If it's too far, tell them to get a hold of you when there is an opportunity closer to where you are.
So far only 1 plant (of 8) looks like this.  Maybe 60% of the leaves are spotted now.  I water 1x a week in the morning (now moving up to 2x/wk)  but we've gotten a lot of rain lately and started getting cooler evenings.   Has 4-8 tomatoes growing but flower production has slowed down lately.  I side dressed with coffee grounds 2 wks ago and plan on trying epsom salts this weekend.  Are spots nutritional?  Or bacterial/fungal?  Please advise!  
I'd suggest keep what you have,  save the money for ammo, shoot the shit out of it, then come back a few months later and ask yourself if you still want to go this route. Get some experience behind the trigger to figure out what works and what doesn't for you.There's nothing wrong with going this way, really. If you like it then that's all that matters. I just feel like it's a solution looking for a problem, or a solution inferior to other options.
Assuming both Gurley &amp; Gordon are gone it seems like we're headed for a CB, what do you guys think about these guys?  Think they're actually difference making prospects or just another guy that winds up as depth?  I feel like I just cant get excited over any of them.
And the Galaxy X. I understand that there was a treaty it just doesn't fit that if i have a cloaking device I can only put it on some ships. I at first thought the avenger class was going to mark a new era of fed ships that would be able to equip the device but I was sadly disappointed.
Don't forget, argumentatively it's not up to you to do anything. The burden of proof is on them. They are claiming a god exists. So let them argue. Let them demonstrate a deity. (Good luck to them, this has yet to happen in human history.) Atheism is not the claim that a god doesn't exist. Atheism is the rejection of a claim. All atheism says, is that "I'm not convinced". God doesn't exist and I'm not convinced are very different statements. You need to know this point inside and out. Period. Atheism is not a claim. Is is the rejection of one. And just because you're rejecting a claim, doesn't mean you're affirming the opposite claim. A rejection is a rejection, not a counter-claim. 
I think the point is to learn the terms used in Japanese so one can discuss CS is Japanese. So, while the actual code won't be much different, if you already know the code, then this is a good way to learn the terms.
Senior year of hs, I was dating the salutatorian, and everyone hated the valedictorian so much, that because their GPA only differed in the ten thousandths place, our AP Lit teacher let my gf discretely take an optional final without letting the valedictorian know because my school had the "If you take the AP test, you don't have to take a final in that class" policy. So my gf took it after school the day before the last day of classes, it bumped her from an A- to an A, and made her the valedictorian. My ex was the most popular girl around for that summer because everyone fucking loved her for taking the valedictorian down a peg......Now I'm dating the almost-valedictorian four years later.
She wrestles for Shimmer, she's really young too.. Like she was born 3 days before me, damn I'm old.ANYWAYS yeah her name's like Sarah Dobson or something, I doubt she'll get signed

The only thing that I would consider even remotely misogynistic would be the way that Dan equated his struggles as being an adopted son as being similar to Shirin's abusive childhood. But I think that that isn't veiled misogyny; it's just uninformed and tainted with his distaste for her. Rodney has made some sexist comments, as have other players, but I wouldn't call him misogynistic either. 
I'm an asshole because I don't care enough about tips to fight on the Internet? You're a strange one. I personally am quite glad of my priorities after seeing how angry tippers get on the Internet.

Facts and Opinions dude.
I think this is at least close to something factual.My understanding has been that if you go below a certain daily caloric intake, your metabolism can shift into "famine mode" where you digest food more efficiently (or store more fat, etc.), and you effectively slow your weight loss.Can someone verify if this is just a myth?**EDIT:** Why down-vote me when I'm asking a serious question?

Grading organic exams can be so much fun. I've never seen this sort of anger though...usually just stuff like "magic" or "science!" as reagents. I did once see a student who didn't know part of a mechanism so he wrote, "The next step happens with wood nymphs and chemistry gremlins (chem grems)." That answer got a smiley face.
The U.S. Government should change some regulations to allow big game hunting in all states. Nothing quite as fun as popping a few warthogs after all.

You can also just use parachord or bootlace to easily make something through which you can slide your belt. I carry mine horizontally on the front of my body- Don't have to carry a knife in your pockets, won't feel a thing, and can easily sheath it. The Izula is by far my favorite EDC knife.I would also like to note I like the parachord way better than the clip the kit comes with- It reduces a lot of bulk.
My guess is HSBC is long fossil fuels ... they are happy for the retail investors to be selling right now because most experts agree we are in for a long term (5-10 yr) bull market for all fossil fuels ... they and their preferred customers want to buy cheap ....
Yeah, I think Tony's hair is way too messy for Coulson, especially with now nice he seems to keep it. Part of me wanting that set (besides getting all the LEGO Movie ones) was that hairpiece to finish off my Coulson. Here's Coulson from the game just for reference just in case you need it. I'd imagine since Clark Gregg got to voice him he had some say in the approval of his design(since its basically a minifigure of himself), but I'm just going out on a limb there too. http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131011175301/marveldatabase/images/a/a9/Phillip_Coulson_(Earth-13122).png

There is nothing saying you can't. Beyond passing the physical test, you also need a doc signing off on your medial paperwork. Part of the medical paperwork will include "does the candidate have any medical conditions that will preclude them performing the following physical activities..." There may be a few extra hoops to jump through (perhaps literally), but where there's a will there's a way.One of my coworkers is an amputee (leg below the knee) and you would never know.
Wow, if only I could have thought of that on my own, thanks so much for sharing your supreme intellect with me. Nice bluff with your written out plans, well played.
Thankfully I don't need to compile anything, it's just HTML/CSS3/jQuery. It's just some features a client wanted which are shit and they'll probably change it and cause it to break. 
I'm always interested in what the breakdown of different pollutants is in heavily polluted cities like New Delhi. I've read that (in the case of new Delhi) a large proportion of the pollutants are from cars but haven't seen any numbers to that effect. It'll be interesting to see how the problem of pollution will develop in polluted cities, like what technologies will come to the forefront to tackle these issues and what social/economic changes that'll bring for the places like India and China. 
&gt; It's still a lot cheaper than if you were to buy the individual ingredients themselves and cook it all yourself. Not really. If you were to buy a weeks worth of rice and veg and meat it would be a lot less than $2.50 a meal.

Unanimous decision for Floyd Mayweather.Pacquiao will try to make the fight exciting in the first few rounds and he'll win the first four rounds. After that, Floyd adjusts and lands perfect counters and avoids the machine gun of punches by Pacquiao. Pacquiao will land a hard left in Round 10 and Mayweather will be buckled, but he'll come back strong, but the judges give Pacquiao the win for Round 10. Floyd will then pick Pacquiao apart for the rest of the fight while he throws a lot of punches throughout the rest of the fight, tiring him out by the end.After the fight, Floyd will then act all humble and say, "It's been a long road. And I proved to the world that I can beat one of the biggest Hall of Famers and boxer. Manny Pacquiao is a great fighter, but Floyd Mayweather's a better fighter. I want to thank all the fans, the Money Team, Team Pacquiao, and everybody else who made this happen."Something like that.

It's also the only summoner spell that can miss (and will regularly do so). Mark has a low cooldown, but I'll happily bet that you don't end up using the Dash half of the spell that much more often than other summoners (expect perhaps Flash). Between the shots you miss and the shots that would end up getting you killed, there aren't that many good opportunities to follow up on casting a Mark. Maybe you could argue that the cooldown should be 25s or 30s instead of 20s but I really doubt that a few seconds makes the difference between balanced and "incredibly oppressive." 
I'm sorry you're being downvoted (if it makes you feel any better, it wasn't me), perhaps the way you phrased your initial comment made it seem like an attack on Messi, and the way you defended yourself in your first reply to me pretty much reaffirmed that notion (at least, it did in my perspective).As for this:&gt; The fact that I'm being downvoted says it all, because I didn't even say anything bad about Messi, or said "Ronaldo is better." This was about everyone comparing what Ronaldo does instantly to Messi, which is true.*You* brought Messi up. You do realize that, right? This thread had nothing to do with Messi until you felt the need to bring him in and say he "acts like the nicest guy on the field" unlike Cristiano who gives it his all or something. So yeah, that's why you're being downvoted.

One of the ways that people who are deaf and blind communicate is through a modified form of sign language. [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller), for example, would have an interpreter sign into her palm with their fingers. She became both deaf and blind at the age of 19 months and one of her teachers was finally able to teach her to communicate by doing this. For instance, her teacher would sign "water" into one of Keller's hands while running water over the other and Keller eventually put the two ideas together. I would assume some variation on the method is still used.

The thing with draining it is you have to compress it and protect it.  If you don't, it'll just fill back up again.  So if you're just going to drain it and then get back on the mats the same/next day, skip draining it.  If you're really concerned about it, drain it, compress it with some rare earth magnets or something, and take a week off training.  I used to be concerned about it but I quit caring.  I work in a bank and people don't see anything negative about it.  If nothing else, they get a kick out of the small, quiet computer guy who's in "fight club".

Use parts from different armor sets if you don't like any whole set.[GW2style.com](http://gw2style.com/search.php?searchname=&amp;searchdesc=&amp;searchowner=&amp;world=-1&amp;race=1&amp;gender=1&amp;color=-1&amp;dye=-1&amp;armor=3&amp;armorslot0=-1&amp;armorslot2=-1&amp;armorslot4=-1&amp;armorslot1=-1&amp;armorslot3=-1&amp;armorslot5=-1&amp;dosearch=1&amp;sortcol=3&amp;sortdir=0&amp;ipp=20&amp;index=1&amp;displaytype=1) is good for inspiration too (basically like this place but easier to search and more popular nowadays).About dyes, start with your favorite color. If you want one color to stand out you use an opposite color (or slightly opposite) on other parts of the armor. Or you can ask for help again if you can't come up with something that satisfies you :)
I do work on the show. I was hoping my photo of the working scene was a bit of a visual proof of that. The reason no one has done any AMAs is we're just so insanely busy until season 1 is over. I'm sure someone would be happy to answer questions to all of you awesome fans.
not deadpool. not for the next few months at least. he's the last hero to get his 52 review so he's very very underpowered right now. Cable and Thing are next to get their reviews so you're looking at later this year for deadpool's review.
I have lower back/pelvic pain on almost a daily basis.  Not sure whether it's caused by IBS or endometriosis, but it gets worse in the 2 weeks before my period.  It feels like it's coming from my bowels.  I get sharp gas pains when I'm anxious too, but that's a different kind of pain.  The lower back pain is dull and achy.  Hope you figure out what's causing yours!  
Well, children *are* inconvenient. :-) This particular kid may have been well-behaved, but the rule is in place for a reason. Kids *with* their parents act a fool in public, but at least then you can ask the parent to get a hold of their child or leave. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think 11 is old enough to be off shopping by yourself, generally speaking.
Hey! So of course those two are tentatively sold...but I'm actually interested in TLBC - I am on the small side of 28D so I wouldn't doubt that 30B's would fit. Also for the Heidi Klum ones, is the band fairly tight for a 32?
I haven't gotten the skills yet for the project I want to do.  I'll make it one day, but it will not be this day.  I'll just say my original idea made me start down this hobby 2 years ago.
Its not that you should be compensated for your work, its that you should have the option to put your work up for a price.Iif people don't want to pay you for it they don't have to buy it, but they aren't entitled to it for free. If you chose to created something, which doesn't break any laws, you should be able to try and sell it.

oh yeah? I thought you said you were an expert!? now your just the guy that "researches a lot??"...if your gonna point out that your LGS is just soooo amateur, but not do anything about, then your wasting your time even mentioning them.
I feel like all of these reporters never once really thought it would go any other way than Winston - Mariota. Hell, ESPN didn't even try to play for drama once the draft started. Gotta get those clicks beforehand doe. 
Next will be an imagined offense from her family and friends, such that he will insist she not see them on her own.  Actually, that's probably already happened.
They get mad at you if you tell them that you don't understand and it doesn't look incriminating though. "I gave you the information, if you don't want to see what's in plain sight then *you're willfully ignorant*!"There's nothing willful about not being able to discern the point of an info dump regarding people I don't know.
As a girl who got the family sweat gene, I hate deodorants that lie. Says it works more the more you move. The fact that I have to take a second shower at night because I smell like sweat, determined that to be a lie.

I am not sure how they will survive. I was super amped that they were coming back but they fell short. Some of their beers are great, some ok and some are horrible. Their food is basically normal bar and grill fair but a little bit more.They also did a terrible job early on managing the place. Beers were way to much (originally $4.75), there were too many inexperienced waiters, unprofessional managers, and don't get me started on the whole killing their $2 pint night without telling anyone and letting a whole bar full of patrons find out when their bill arrived...
the odd things about it are the numbing of your nose and the gray appearance.i've only time i've seen h that had a tinge of gray was when i lived in DC, and dope there is (well at least was) garbage.but hey, fire is fire!
Thanks so much!:)No worries! I slip into stuff like that. Sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me. It's always good to talk about stuff and I'm definitely here to listen:) It's hard to take risks like that, especially when it's your best friend on the line. Me and my boyfriend were best friends, it took him the whole school year to work up the courage to tell me and it didn't go so well the first time, but we were still best friends. You could always tell her "I like you, but if you don't feel the same way I understand. I just thought I should tell you." Maybe she'll feel the same and maybe she won't. I was always the kind of person who said "thanks for telling me that. I'm sorry I don't feel the same." and we would continue on being friends acting like nothing happened. Evertbody's different though. I wish you the best of luck!
I blush deeply and cover my flat chest with one hand instinctively, before quickly resuming picking up books. "I suppose so...So ummm...." I pause for a bit. *Calling me a stripper in response to my shirt....must mean she thinks I'm a girl, right?* I look to get and ask, bright red. "So do you think I'm a girl?"
Exactly. I always used to squeeze that hair tie the closest I could to my head. I always ended up with headaches and finally realized that too tight = headaches. 
&gt;At this point, it just seems like it'll end real badly if I try to keep it going. I'm inclined to agree.  You really have to be upfront with someone if you're going to transition while still dating them, and if they can't deal with it, then that's the end of it, really.
dunno, not an expert on other schools open container rules. maybe some just turn a blind eye on game day, but ours is actually a board ordinance that is officially suspended on gamedays (during the designated tailgate times)mainly just wanted to clarify dry vs wet though. because regardless of open container laws, dry campus would mean there's no alcohol allowed which is most definitely *not* the case at msu, regardless of the day
I think there's lots of people here who can identify with that. The socialists of the 80s and 90s who were fighting for a better life for the working class are being completely alienated by the left of today. 
I went to the chiropractor for lower back pain and it was incredible! I stopped going a few weeks ago but will pick it back up once I enter the third trimester in 2 weeks. You won't regret it!!!

No that was way different and not related.  The article you posted was a corporate stunt to take advantage of an employee.  The Lamborghini key would be revenge against somebody that would wrong you.  Plus no where near a verbal contract.
BUT THERE'S NBA PLAYO---OH WAIT THEY'RE AT HALFTIME......BUT THERE'S BASEBALL AND THE BIG TEN LACROSSE TOURNAMENT!(All that being said, the you don't need to watch the draft to keep track of it, so that could very well be the case. I don't mean to assume anything.)
Sorry guys I was trying to do this on the remote play app, but its too hard to make the jump s, Can I just grab the Cp then leave on 2 more characters?
Something something INDICATORS AND SAFE FUCKING DISTANCE.Driving through Sunnybank on the way home from a shift last night, in the wet, with my AC and demister broken, was driving on hardcore mode.
OO OO I WANT I WANT :DI was actually debating upon actually making "/FEC talks writing" a thing when this showed up. Mostly because I'd love to ~~brag~~ show you guys some of the world-building shenanagins I get up to sometimes. Mostly so I'd have an excuse to write it all down :p
No one will read this I'll make a reddit bet right now:Someone takes home a cucumber or other dick shaped vegetable or fruit, and sticks it in their pussy or ass. Mark my words! If that happens someone better guild me. If that doesn't happen I'll shove a cucumber up my ass.  
It's not easy to change friend. The confusion is the fear of the change itself. If you feel you just exist, hollow and you change will you still be you? Or is that the same as dying? Well that's for you to decide. Making that choice to be better in itself is validating your life. You can't be hollow when you have a purpose. In the end, regardless of words given. What do you want? Do you still care about those people? If you do, change. They deserve better, and more importantly, you do too. 
Eagles were more in the running than we were for Mariota. I really think the Chargers were just doing due diligence if he were to fall out of the top ten.
Well. It's been bundled before before and was cheaper. It was bundled in IG with Sword of Asumi. Shouldn't be a hard game to find a deal with. Maybe /r/IndieGameSwap can cover you on that.
Slap's BBQ. The rest aren't nearly as good. Sorry to be a hater for the staples, but the quality isn't there anymore. My parents were there three weeks ago at Jack Stacks and Arthur Bryant's and their food was cold everywhere but slapsEdit: spelling
Wow muchas gracias por esas recomendaciones! Dices que debería especializarme y me está llamando mucho la atención especializarme en matemática financiera, un profesor me recomendó bastantes libros de modelación financiera y me está gustando mucho eso de matemáticas. También, ¿dónde recomiendas empezar para socializar y networking? Tengo contacto frecuente con la mayoría de mis profesores, pero para socializar con personas de la carrera como le puedo hacer. Hablo con muchos en mi universidad, pero la verdad no conozco a mucho profesionista, solo persona de mi edad. Sé que existe el IMEF, pero mi universidad aún no se afilia o existe una organización donde podría hacer network con financieros? 
How about is cosplay? Example [this](http://imgur.com/a/hVgnE). That cosplay's custom relate to SIF's new card (UR Eli). But i think cosplay is fit /r/LoveLive than /r/SchoolIdolFestival.Btw: is anyone know who that coser is?
I think that is the most optimal way to play around espionage but that  implies you are sorta lucky with your spies. There are games where I will have maybe 8, 10 techs maybe 15 techs stolen back to back and my blind, inept and incapable spy won't catch anyone.For that reason I think denying the AI embassy entirely is a solid compromise.
I'd say the tea party is half a reaction to racism, and half a reaction to people wanting a reap choice, even if the choices to them is terrible. Think of McCain and Romney, imagine you were actually wanting a conservative. Now take the group that actually wants a conservative, throw in the racist and add fox news coverage. Now you got a political force. Opposed to the liberals, who actually want a true liberal, no one pays them any mind.
Bullshit. Every American lives in the top 4% compared to the rest of the world. You don't see other people acting like this. There are more whites in poverty then blacks in the US, yet somehow they aren't murdering everyone. You are part of the problem. You make excuses that the facts absolutely disagree with and put it in bold caps and think it makes you right. I call you ignorant and a fool.
It sounds cruel  but maybe just bite him back. You've tried everything else. Every kid I've ever heard of biting on this level didn't stop until they were bitten back either by another kid or a parent. :(
I don't think he's really that way.. Check out his [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ajju2/i_am_jordan_schlansky_associate_producer_of_conan/)
Whole world hoping you fail for 4 years, and you go to the Finals 4 times, play for team USA, and STILL maintain impeccable stats? Did dis dude jus said dis?
Regardless of whether reddit gives a damn, I will walk away knowing that I have the power to over come the need to press the button. Its more like a kid at the party who doesn't eat the cake because he knows its unhealthy so he resists temptation.
I know you're being hyperbolic, but you can build a PC that will play virtually all modern titles at 1080p 40-60fps for $500-600. Head over to r/buildapc if you would like advice on how to do so. Its easy.
I hope we trade him later on in the draft if there are some better picks still available when such a trade would be possible. It's still all up in the air I think, I'm distraught with the pick because I really wanted us to trade right away, but I know way less about the draft game than everyone on here, so that may explain why. I'm not giving up on [Whack Zach](http://i.imgur.com/6bFvkJN.jpg) just yet.
We need to stop sexualizing nudity first. Though it does bring up a good point, does Japan even have the same cultural aspects in regards to nudity as we do? Genuinely curious.
If you post anything of value on the free section of craigslist, you'll hear this shit all day..Everybodys' a single mom whose husband ran off and left her to die with 5 kids in a hotel room, nothing but a bible to keep them warm and an old tv that doesn't even get hbo. They really really want that free playstation 2, it'll change their lives in so many ways.What type of item was it, anyway? I'd humor him and ask for pictures, see what he sends.  
I want these guys soooo bad! I mained Ike and only Ike in brawl and I haven't used him since. I think having his amiibo would be a great way to honor him and how he fought for his freind, me.
The slow driver who imagines they're "safe" is way more likely to cause an accident, but no, that hero probably won't get pulled over for being so dangerous. 
you generally can't retake a course that's D or above. I think i know someone who got a "D" in one course and managed to retake it, but generally it's an exception. Contact your faculty advisors. 
I meant dance as a general term and added ballet; a lot of people turn into cunts when they have kids in theater too. Also, I really don't believe one can segment themselves into "oh I'm nice everywhere else" and want to force a kid to exercise until they vomit; it simply means they're hiding the cuntiness until they reach a context in which they can impose it on a kid...which is rather worse honestly.
Nah, to be honest the hit and hope thing is more of a later thing in his career of when things are going shit see if you can pull off a worldy like the old days.Guy was just a genius, his heart hasn't been in it as much since he was converted to a defensive mid
Well its not half so picky about pH, and is fine with actives like niacinamide or green tea extract (L-AA is not). It can be a little tacky at higher percentages I believe, but that can be solved with more 'slippy' partner actives.
Are you because you don't seem to want to address the fact that theres very little chance of the mirror being used for spying, if she had found a camera I'd agree but the only reason the mirror is being treated as an issue is because it made her feel uncomfortable, seriously who gives a shit its just a mirror on a bathroom closet door. She made an issue out of nothing and people are jumping to her defense because she drew a line between the mirror and sexual assault and god knows how much social justice warriors are constantly on the lookout for anything that could possibly be related to "rape culture"
Well when I play as Anubis, I never notice i lose hp during my ultimate. NINJA EDIT: Yes even during their shield. I've seen the purple circle and ult'd like they were nothing.
Yeah, I don't even know why keeping eye contact is a thing. Like, why do you want me to look at your eyes? I suppose that's just a characteristic of our current culture or something. Sometimes, people will even think that you are hiding something from everyone. Yeah whenever people see me as different I am glad, because that's actually what I am and so I feel like they understand me a little more.
They said they weren't doing the tats. Seems like DC threw it out there to see what people thought and when reaction was super-negative they backed out.
You *really* don't have to hoard those quality armours and weapons. No, seriously. You're feeling smart now, but just kill more stuff instead of trading for scraps and whetstones. You'll play the "how to get to 40%" game often enough with flasks and gems later...
I make an awesome playlist and pay for the bar for everyone. After everyone is drunk, really drunk, I punch him in the dick and every other dick there;)
Luckily my body is not sensitive at all to body rage acrylics and stainless steel jewelry, I've never had a problem with them! I know there are way better options but I've never felt the need to go elsewhere.
I love playing basketball, and although I've been playing for years now, I'm not very good BUT I can see and know how plays are unfolding - I recognize elevator doors before they are being set, i can tell when players are going to pull up to create a 2 for 1, how defenses are specifically attacking  a certain PnR compared to another. That being said, I am sure that the talent/skill gap between myself and a world superstar like LeBron James or Stephen Curry is smaller than the talent/skill gap between myself and a celebrated LoL pro like Faker. And there's no chance in hell I could even reach 1% of LBJ's level so... Yeah, the LoL pros are just really fucking good.
Watching the extended interview. Man, this woman is blaming everyone but herself. She's blaming 9/11, blaming the White House, blaming Clinton, blaming the intelligence agencies, then blaming her editor... I found myself yelling at the TV.Stewart once said that his show is basically the people who yell at the television, the guy in the back of the bar yelling "Bullshit! You said X last week, now you're saying you only said Y?" It's kind of refreshing to have someone on TV be the one to show clips of the same politician lying from a year prior, but I'm sorta surprised it's only Stewart doing this. (though to be fair Rachel Maddow has been doing it too, but not as frequently nor as popular as TDS)

Defense is a problem. LA is a good defender, out of our starting 5 Lillard is the only weak link defensively, not sure Lopez could cover both Love and Lillard's defensive duties and still be doing all the dirty work he does now.Offensively he'd work just as good if not better than LA.

I think you are an exptovert/exhibitionist.    You like to be the center.  Fortunately you are very attractive.  Too much ink for me, but its a valid choiceMaybe the overall effect is overdone/stimulation overload.  7-8/10
I think it is one of those things you need to use before you can make a judgement. I like the idea of a bigger trackpad (some companies, Lenovo especially, seem to enjoy putting tiny trackpads on their laptops), but I wonder how this idea would work with a Japanese keyboard which has a smaller spacebar due to (useless) extra keys either side of it.
Server: NAType of Bug: In-Game BugDescription: Elise can no longer self-cast rappel Steps to reproduce: Go into any game mode. Try to cast rappel (not onto a target) via self-cast.Expected result: Elise rappelsObserved result: Elise does nothingReproduction rate: 100%System specs: HP laptop. Elise can still do a target-less rappel if she clicks E with your mouse cursor within the range indicator. If she clicks outside of that circle, she will walk to the edge of the range and then cast it. It is extremely clunky to use this way and also GREATLY increases the chance of accidentally rappeling onto a minion or enemy when using the ability during cluttered teamfight situations. To avoid this I've always self-casted my rappel if I didn't want to immediately drop on a target. Now the self-cast does nothing. IMO this is a pretty big bug that makes playing her extremely clunky. 
Idunno, I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and think she's not as comically retarded as her peons to try and substitute a vault door as an image of the entry site into an allegedly secret, fortified underground nuclear weapons production bunker.Because then .. we couldn't actually deride her .. we'd just have to pity her.

From what I've read, Letrozole tends to have less side effects than Clomid, and doesn't dry up CM and thin the uterine lining like Clomid can. I've taken two doses of Letrozole and have a bad headache this afternoon (google says that's the most common side effect) although I'm not sure it's the Letrozole yet. My Dr put me on it because although I O on my own, it's very early and maybe the egg doesn't mature, and also it doesn't give my lining enough time to build up. 
Same here! I already said it on r/nintendo, but that's what I'm hoping for, because I prefer duos with one boy and one girl and I'd like to see a gaming duo where the girl isn't the sidekick. I also think Yooka looks more feminine with her more rounded features and Laylee looks more masculine with his prominent eyebrows.
the difference being that the mets have turned those picks into talent. it's amazing how the jags have had so many top picks and are so bereft of top talent
Yo I'm all for fanboying, I have several anime stickers on my DJ laptop. That being said mine are all pretty tasteful. I'm just saying some anime upskirt saying "LOOK AT THIS!!!!!!!!" is pretty embarrassing from any standpoint. I mean go ahead and put whatever stickers you want haha, I was just saying he should try to find some less cringy anime stickers.edit: and i don't think it's fanboying if you just have an generic anime upskirt sticker... 
Yeah, I taped them off and spray painted them black haha. Took me 3 hours in total to do. I did the same with the front and rear bumper and around the windows. Semi Gloss black.
Not counting ones that use stolen moves or reflects:* The Dead Woods stage brutality. iirc you have to use 2 interactables when you're one away from winning, then be a specific distance away from the enemy when you finish them off with the log interactable on the far right.* Reptile's acid spit brutality, except you hold up (or a different direction, I've also heard towards the enemy).* Sonya's X-Ray brutality. You have to be holding up for the last hit.* [Cassie's American Way Brutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/33mp6a/cassie_cage_hidden_brutality/). Idk if anyone else found out how to do this consistently because I couldn't. But it is indeed real.* Kotal's suicide brutality. Basically you off yourself when the enemy is one round away from winning with the damage buff that hurts you when you perform it. The enemy gets a Brutality for your troubles.

The chances are something like 1 in a million and this happened tens of thousands of times in the Gallipoli war. At least it's what my history teacher had taught us..
Unless this was a movie you shouldn't assume you know what he was thinking.  When I think dirty thoughts I don't bite my lip, and when I bite my lip I am not thinking dirty thoughts. That only works in movies. As far as looking at her ass. People need to grow the fuck up. Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable to realize that adults are sexual beings doesn't make it wrong. Your parents had sex, your dad's pen was in your moms mouth; get over it.
Didn't Oliver say something along the lines of "I don't think that bolt of lightning struck you Barry. I think it chose you" in the pilot? If so, it gives some credibility to this theory
Honestly, the books just seemed to keep adding but players and random characters to the overall story without much forethought into trying up their individual stories. I have absolutely no idea where the books are going to be honest. 
Wow. I had no idea there were issues with licensing on this site, since they were so popular. I hate to see them go, but I think they're taking the high road here (whether voluntarily or under duress.)
I actually TWD more as its gone on. I loved the first season, found the 2nd boring, liked the first half of the 3rd, found the 2nd half a little slow, loved all of the 4th season and loved all of the 5th.
I got in at 10.50.  I think the lawsuit is just a temporary setback, but I'm a noob.  Worst case they'll settle, which will likely be covered by insurance, and then it's business as usual.  Earnings soon, and more info on their product trial which I'm hoping will get them pointed in the right direction again.  The trial stage failed to prove that their product is non-inferior to the leading competitor based on specific criteria, although "a subset of patients showed evidence of non-inferiority".  They'll try to leverage this partial success to change the criteria and start a new trial, so success isn't out of the question.Again, I'm a noob.  You can safely ignore me.
The films are offensive to critics because they're offensive to the art form. They're cheap, pandering pieces of Christian propaganda that the studios know will make money in certain regardless of how bad the films actually are.Basically, they epitomise everything that is currently wrong with Hollywood.
The only place he's depicted with nipple rings is the box art.  The cinematic doesn't even have them (which I would consider the most canonical design, especially when going for realism).
While I did think of Social Democrats immediately after posting that, but I decided to leave it alone. I'm sure you already know this, but people typically draw a distinction between private and personal property, with private property typically being referred to as things like land ownership in the absence of actual, personal use, owning means of production, and other similar things. I guess you just see that as metaphorical, though, which I don't.
I still do that, but just a little.  My recommendation?  Get a manicure and some nice gel polish.  If you're a dude, still do it, but get clear polish if you're self-conscious.  For some reason I do it less when my nails look nice.
If the teacher or principal is doing the bullying, and I found out as a parent, I'd raise 50 kinds of hell because it is a violation of the fucking trust placed in the school. Same for police. If the police are bullying a person, there isn't an outside mechanism to deal with them. *That's* the point.

I could, but I uninstalled the beta, cause that is what I was using earlier, If that is causing the problem, I'm just gonna give up on the app, even though its cool. Anyway, I've never used iCleaner, so idk what I'm doing with it and dont want to break something. Any tutorials you can show me?
Can someone explain the peeker's advantage to me?  I've been throwing the term around (mainly in fits of rage :P) but I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly, or even know what it it.
Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. The correct format is:      **Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    An example of a correct title:         808 State - ex:el [Breakbeat] (1991)         You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).---**If you are not posting music, please [message the mods](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMusic) to get approved!***[I am a bot](/r/AutoModerator/comments/q11pu/what_is_automoderator/), and this action was performed automatically.

YOU BASTARD! YOU LEFT ME AND YOUR WIFE, CORRUPTED GIF, WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO "BUY CIGARETTES" 10 YEARS AGO! HOW DARE YOU SHOW UP TO MY PLACE IF WORK OUT OF THE BLUE LIKE THIS!?
If your character have filled the bag, it's happens and maybe it's a wrong items in the bag or the items.txt changed. Another cause is much data. Otherwise is bandwidth or something else.
My personal approach to scheduling has been:* 4 courses  * Part-time job with (semi-)fixed hours  * Tutoring  * Clubs/volunteering/etcI enjoy the extra money, as it ensures I can stay debt-free while also having a fair amount of disposable income to blow on things which I want to do (such as eating out with friends frequently). Just find something that works for you.As for financial problems, you should be able to sustain yourself off of just co-op sooner or later, but if you want extra spending money or just something different to do a part-time job is nice. That being said, if you're going to go for a part-time job, you should probably be at least a bit choosey (taking anything less than ~$20/h is probably not worth the stress unless you have lots of free time or really like the job). Anyhow, it's ultimately up to whatever you find works for you.
I actually do this a lot because I had no other way to hold my little brothers tiny cello when I taught him. Now it is a convenient way to play when I can't use the pin. 
Knowing Benjy though, there's a bit more to it than just a random name. Detlev Bronk, according to the Wiki, was big sh#t in New York City in his day. Is Benjy suggesting that his family is some big powerful clan with roots in NYC? Then again, it's not impossible that Benjy himself created that Wikipedia entry, just prior to mentioning the name for the firs time... in an Kaufman-esque move. If so, it was a lot of effort that went nowhere since no one followed up on the suggestion to look the name up. 
There are 82 million gun owners in America.  That is a force to be reckoned with and the Federal government is just as afraid of it as Admiral Yamamoto was.
Are those maggots? Why is everything being eaten by maggots!!?!?!?!? (yes, i know why, but...wasn't really for this number of maggot infested pictures. )
Was wondering when one of these rants were going to pop up again.I think for anything to actually change, there's going to have to be a country sized riot. Problem with that is people generally suck in large numbers. But it may work. Then again it could backfire terribly and end with a lot of people dying. Hmmm, I guess what I'm trying to say is, is that maybe we need a civil war. Middle/lower/working class, black, white, every color, and creed under the rainbow working as one to take down this horrendous sham of a government and instilling a new and better one that *is* for the people. Buy that'll never happen. 
I think you have them backwards: 0.8x speed for cross-class weapons and 1x for class. Or you meant to multiply the time instead of speed.I think this change would be ok, but don't have a strong opinion either way.
Multiple studies have concluded there's no evidence to support longer sentences having any impact on reducing repeat offenses. After 3 years the ban has served its purpose, and it no longer provides a deterrence of value, as any further effects are merely punitive and no longer associated with the original act, so the real question is, why not? By that time, the cheaters have already created new accounts (and probably been banned on them, too), and the multiplayer community has moved on to other newer games, and if they do cheat again, they will be banned again, so really the only people still being affected by the ban are the innocent ones who got flagged with false positives.
I am always hyping brawlers, so why not. Their unarmed strike levels pretty decent. You can use unarmed strike while holding whatever you want so you don't have to waste time swapping weapons. You can use martial flexibility to take ranged or melee combat feats depending on the situation. In a shootout? Take deflect arrow and catch arrow. Snatch their arrow out of the air and shoot it back at them for cool points. There is so much crazy shit you can do with martial flexibility. The only draw back is you need to burn a feat on longbow unless you take a fighter dip.
I just checked the website and it does say that it opens on May 7th. I guess it's been a while. xD There is no specific time so perhaps check at midnight and periodically check. Unfortunately, you can't do anything before hand. You simply have to wait online or go to the department of housing at the time registration opens. It's a first come first serve thing.  I am not sure, but I THINK you can't get meal plans if you live off campus except for the 5 meals a week or the meal block plan. 
You know, maybe since there is now 3 objects completely out of whack. Keen will somehow figure out how to stop them from going ape shit and maybe fix rotors and pistons for once perhaps? One can wish.
I have a feeling shonda is just going to jump another year and then it will be the end of dempsey's contract and she'll be like- "See, We didn't break any contract!"
Its origins as a word are pretty racist, and I kinda feel that it traditionally has been. It's true that people used it to refer to gangsters, but it was generally Anglo-Saxon people referring to Slavs, Jews, and Italians, who weren't really considered white at the time.I guess you can argue that it's more of a classist thing, since people mostly use it to refer to uneducated people who don't have social graces, but I think it's racist too.
Stubborn persistence and growth by month into 2016 might begin to change minds in the media. If we get bigger and louder and never stop getting bigger and louder then there is no reason for them to ignore or dismiss us.
Something to note about the yetis is that they seem to roll more easily. Maybe the weight being more centered instead of towards the top/ flight plate.Totally anecdotal but my buddy's yeti seems to stand up and roll away after basket hits far more than my r-pro. Could just be that he putts with more hyzer. Am I just imagining things or does anyone else have experiences with the yetis rolling around?
Fixed! We've gotten a few comments and compliments about having a game that has a bit 'more melanin' as you say from gamers who are glad that there's a game where the default racial skin tone is a darker one. 
What if she wanted to have the kid?  I'm not saying the kid was planned, especially not that early, but why should the kid have to live away from his mother because she wants to "find herself"?  She can do all of that at any time. Having a kid isn't the end of your life like many people are so inclined to believe. Just because she had a kid that early doesn't stop her from being who she wants to be.  The reason I said good for her is because she stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for her actions. She didn't just abort it or give it off to whatever family would take it. 
Elsevier is a huge conglomerate of many many journals. lancet were led to believe that the wakefield study was true, as were many others and this wasn't proven false til many years later. in hindsight it was a bad mistake but you can't judge them for publishing it in the first place. 
thanks man! Not so good at doing the name mentioning. Unfortunently, I had to use a monster that couldnt be destroyed by battle to get my point across, and he was the first one i could think of. **BUT BEWARE MORTAL. FOR THIS CREATURE IS ONLY THE FIRST TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF THE CURSED ONES**
Why do you say that. I consider Kobe really tough minded. Hard to consider Lebron tough minded when he choked hard in the 2010 finals. He's a smart guy for sure but not tough.
Hamling v Roberts in the VFL:  Round 1 - Hamling 13 disposals 6 marks 1 tackle, Roberts 14 disposals 3 marks 1 tackle.  Round 2 - Hamling 13 disp 6 marks 1 tackle, Roberts 13 disposals 6 marks 2 tackles.  Doesn't give us a whole lotta insight aside from Hamling's remarkable consistency across the two games! I'm curious to see how Roberts goes as I really have no idea at all what he's all about 
Fortunately "Gaming" accounts technically don't have retention departments because we realize that the entitled customers we get are usually spoiled little kids who want it their way all the time.

Difference is that Greg Martin doesn't throw out ten-dollar words or reference existential philosophy every other sentence. Best thing about Sky losing the Premiership rights is no Barnes. 
&gt; aging hipster full of angst and jealously because his career as an independent filmmaker failed miserably.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  You think I make movies? Dude, lol.  I've never even been CLOSE to show biz.  AND you think I'm shitting on indy film makers like I don't watch them?  Hmmm.  K.  I'm not gonna bother with ya.  Think whatever you like.
Because of how the damage and scaling works between the two. There have been countless posts in this sub on the actual math behind it. And I know he spams, which is why I said probably. I'm not a Ryze player, though, so I'm not going to bother doing the math for him specifically.
They haven't been calling it any kind of finale, though.  They haven't called it a season finale, they haven't called it a series finale...I just checked IMDB.  It shows two more episodes in this season: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/episodes?ref_=tt_eps_sn_mr
Was this sub supposed to be an insult to fatpeoplehate? I'm a proud shitlord, this was a fun joke that started due to a spelling error. I was *there* when it started. OG
I'm moving to James Street (which is pretty close to the downtown core) very soon and will be living in the smallest room I've ever stayed in. However, what I am losing in room space I am making up in location, as I'm within walking distance to my two jobs, my favourite pub, and a short bus ride to Carleton. The point is, you gotta give up some things to get others, as someone else pointed out. I'd say it's a pretty good location, and Hartman's Independent is right nearby too. Maybe try to find a few friends to live with, or a vacant room in a shared house. :)
A boy in my class in year 4 was incredibly intelligent but never did anything that the teachers told him to do and for that reason was treated as special needs. I have no idea if he has special needs but I know at that time it had never been diagnosed. My year four teacher (who, incidentally, was named Mr Gay) was furious that Lewie wasn't doing what he wanted him to do. So he made the whole class sing "There's hole in your head, dear Lewie, dear Lewie, there's a hole in your head dear Lewie" while he pointed at poor fucking Lewie. 
Yea I commented in that one. According to some guy (who I dont even think was American) The Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zep and Black Sabbath all mimic American blues singers.What is funny is the article even says singing is more or less accent neutral, it just stupidly assumes that American accent is the neutral accent. 
Apparently a lot of democrats and liberals hated O'Malley. I'm curious about Jim Webb, he seems like he could be the dark horse of the race, if I'm using the term correctly. Like Hillary already has brand recognition. Sanders is incredibly appealing to a lot of people and pretty well known. O'Malley has been making some media appearances. Jim Webb just seems to be sitting back a bit and watching things. 
No problem I would ask the same question. I don't think the current memory will Imost the performance of the machine but you can always upgrade it if you need. If you handnt supplies me with memory I would have done 16gb DDR4 same brand 
No worries...I'm on the west side, so makes it simpler for me to have some idea as to when to be available. I could probably help Saturday, just give me the details.
But PhotoJim99 I'm only concerned about parking for poor people not about the long term fallout from my entire neighborhood turning into a concrete jungle! Why can't you of the poor people!/s
Not unless you can safely completely reformat your phone's storage or whatever partiton shows up as storage to your computer - because that's what you'll have to do to turn it into a bootable install drive. Even then, it's risky. I'd just get a cheap 4-8GB drive somewhere instead.
I stalled out once on my cut and just kept at it and then randomly I dropped like another 10 lbs overnight. Try to keep your diet tight. It will be the hardest thing you do.
I got my account back recently after a charge back. you will have to jump though many hoops, it took me almost 3 months to get back. I had to sent them a letter with a great deal of info about my account and identity. Good luck, and just remember to be patient.
Absolutely! Well...wish me luck, gotta go meet my friend to "tell him something important." So freakin nervous, I'm running the spectrum of feelings from being terrified ("OMG I should wait!")to euphoric("I'm finally doing it!") every few minutes. ughhhhhh, I need to relax after this week!!

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH NO!She needs to get dragged into the street by her hair and whipped until she bleeds to death in front of a jeering crowd.  This deserves severe cruelty to be instantly and mercilessly meted out.
&gt; On a side note, anyone that uses the words "be like" in a sentence should have their testicles scraped over broken glass.Aw c'mon, that's no way to be like.
I always thought that it was talking about the whiteness of a cracker too, until it was explained to me this was by a rather racist Australian, who then added "but it isn't really that bad of an insult, is it? We're still the ones cracking the whip, huh? They're on the ground and we're in a position of authority and they're trying to insult us with that?" Ah. 
Just a couple of rosewill red led case fans. They move a good amount of air, but I'm going to replace them with something else and put them on the front of my case
White people are almost always murdered by other white people. Obviously we need to do something about these vanilla skinned thugs before all the good ones are strangled in their beds.Why can't the white community stand up to these savages?
Many thanks to /u/skepticaljesus for the good deal on these.  Picked them up off the buy/sell/trade post after a bit of hemming and hawing. I'm usually a 10.5D/E and these were 10Ds, but the last runs quite large so they fit just fine, and actually have a bit of room.After getting them in today I went to town with the brush, AE burgundy shell cream and edge dressing.  Think they came out pretty awesome.

Galactic Wrecking Co.I've only demoed this at a few events and to a few other people, as I'm still tweaking some of the elements . . . but here's some images: http://imgur.com/a/0IAJX#5You're on the bridge of a starship when the other astronauts start having a dance party. It's like being INSIDE a cartoon episode. A lot of people who have tried it start dancing with the characters. Once the Disco lights and bass groove kicks in, it gets pretty trippy. Just going to optimize everything and release it soon! Probably after the Oculus Game Jam. :)
That is sooooo not true! They might not be recording the whole thing (totally unethical), but you bet your ass they'd be cracking up and there would be inside jokes for years. Gotta find the funny where you can when you work in the medical profession.
Same guy that commented above but I lost the other throwaway. I came across more harsh than I intended. The words extremely, hateful, and destructive probably took it too far. Keep in mind this school is small. There are plenty of hooligans but also plenty normal students. It is one of the only places I still hear the word gay used as an insult besides online.This writing is completely unstructured. I'm just ranting about what people might want to know. I haven't been in four years so I only have what information my friends tell me and what I used to know.
ohh. what's that? i'm in the UK so i'm not familiar with that. do you know if it's a generic chemical or summat?...maybe i should google is and not be such a lazy drunk cunt. ;-) heh
Tell them that a DnD economy is inherently silly (true) and it isn't worth the time and effort to try and make it into something fully rational (arguably true), nor is it worth wasting gaming time arguing about econoimics in a economically silly fantasy world, (also arguably true) so take your 8gp and let's move on to more fun.

I really hope there is a big boycott soon for Newcastle, hopefully a media shit storm could do some good and get Ashley out. It's a shame he seemed great early on and now is destroying the club. I feel for Carver...he's a poor manager but the problem is with the people hired him.
i always liked the Attica, i just don't have the mods to make it as good as it needs to be for the missions i play. I also use Zephyr as my main frame, but my friends say she is gradually become less viable with the jump attack and whatnot
I took a look and didn't see any discussion about the 2012 CTS. Do you think it might have been the SRX you were referring to? both the CTS and SRX had similar NAV systems, however the SRX's was a newer generation that supported BT audio. The CTS's navigation hardware was never revised during the production span.The funny thing about the SRX Bluetooth implementation is that it used 2 separate radios: One for audio (through the NAV) and one for calls (through OnStar) and you couldn't have a phone paired to both at the same time.In reality there's 2 options if you wanted Bluetooth audio in the car: You could either purchase a bluetooh audio receiver and plug it into the headphone jack in the console, OR purchase an aftermarket controller that replaces the GM nav system.
MTurk is having temporary server problems for everyone this evening. Just have to wait for the MTurk employees to fix it. At the moment, it appears to be mostly cleared up.
My parents moved from Singapore to here shortly after I was born, and I grew up in Vancouver. They wanted me to grow up in a Western country and to escape what they saw as an authoritarian, controlling government.
You should watch the NXT Columbus match between Ryback and Big Show where this originated... he played off the crowd so well because of this chant, and it was actually Ryback that was pissed off by them.  Big Show had a field day mocking the crowd, talking about his ironclad contract and that he had 10 more years on it.  It was quite amusing.  He called for the mic mid-match to yell at the crowd.Here's just one of the spots, the only video I could find on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGQU1_os3RwThe problem is it's played out now, of course.  Gotta drive it into the ground.
I'll be honest. Without Conley I think we'll take maybe 1 or 2 games, but it will be next to impossible to win the series.  The hope around Memphis is that Conley is able to put on a mask and come back for Game 3 in the Forum. It's just a hopeful speculation, but how awesome would that be?  If Grizz went down 2 and then Conley comes back all masked-up and Grizz someone defend home court. Holy Cow! We'd have one for the ages.
I'll make anime out of Pluto Nash with a bad, Japanese, Eddie Murphy impersonator. All his lines will be in poor English, and I'll make it a point to have any narrative cohesion fall apart by the 2nd Act of the first episode with unnecessary padding. Good times will be had by all (and by that I mean people trashing it on the internet).
I think I am going to start with Ocarina of Time. Big gaming confession here... I love the Zelda series (even have a Zelda 3DS)... but I have NEVER beaten a Zelda game. I think it's about time, eh?
Go somewhere else if you want to bitch....its like bitching about target when walmart is down the road....go to walmart and move on or keep shopping at target and stop bitching...
It's not free though. If you're buying chromas with IP, you're not spending IP on champions. So if you want champions, you need to spend RP. It's an additional IP sink next to Runes.

I read a little bit every day starting in seminary. Sometimes it was quite a bit, but other times it was only a verse or two. My family also did family scripture study where we read a chapter a night. Funny thing about the family study - we started out all using different scriptures until one night when we came across differences between them since we had a couple different editions between us. After that my dad had us start using some old BOMs that he had and we never spoke of the differences again. 
You guys got the better Quarterback, and it really feels like this is my fault.I always jynx myself. I said I wanted any player but Winston... and life just has to keep teaching me, if I really want something I just can't have it.
I know this is not a faction claim or anything but could the monastery of Cage be placed at on the map? it is at the cave at H14 and great job on the map
I absolutely adore Miranda Lawson.Learning more about her and breaking through her initial, and intimidating, outer shell and discovering the real, and sentimentally caring Miranda underneath was pretty special.On the flip side, I am not a fan of James Vega either.I just never got into his character as much as the others. Maybe because he was introduced so late, and hastily at that.

My big (read: only) reason for sticking with SwiftKey is emoji prediction. I know Google Keyboard has it... But they might as well not, with how useless it is. It can only predict like 5 emoji... 
Maybe. Then again awakening had like the largest sales of a fire emblem game right? a lot of people who bought it were very fond of infinite grinding on the world map and such, getting loads of money. making insane weapons and re classing a million times for perfect characters.I don't think a large number of people would want the Nohr one. If it means sacrificing all of that. I personally want it because the on the rails games have re-playability. I can go through each time and try different characters on my party. Hopefully this game isn't a waifu simulator / pick whatever class you want for any character game like the last one.
Do you by any chance have a Kyogre with a Modest nature and perfect IVs in Speed Sp Atk and either HP or Sp Def? If you do I'll be happy to part with my spare Palkia
I really like this and I've been listening to it over and over. A little constructive criticism from a random person on the internet though; I feel like the vocals are really loud in the beginning. Because of this I feel like at the drop you have nowhere to go dynamically. 
You know I hope they do bring back a system that allows us to more easily support mod authors.  Because many mod authors do deserve recognition and money for their hundreds of hours of hard work.  90% of the reason I didn't like the system they had was because 75% of the money wasn't going to the modder.  I couldn't see myself ever wanting to pay for anything knowing that a quarter of every dollar would actually go to the person I wanted it to.
They did, which is a shame as imo Joslyn deserved it. That was more a knee jerk reaction from the viewers regarding Dela's loss and people wanting her to have a consolation prize of sorts.
Who would you put? I'd say top is the only difficult one to call.top - Odo/Huni/Cabo leaning more towards Cabo/Odo.Jungle - SvenMid - FebivanADC - ForgivenSup - Yellowstar
She was out fixing Greg's van, and they didn't take the time to alert her to the monster because they didn't want to lose it. Did you miss the first minute or?
Yes, they removed our ability to spawn those objects. They added this to them in the last update:*"printable" : false,* (Can't print it at the 3D printer)  *"hasObjectItem" : false,* (Can't spawn it with /spawnitem and won't drop when mined)  They did that with several other items as well, like graffiti, which is why some people got Perfectly Generic Items when the update hit.
http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3492ig/equipment_analyzer_v05_beta_now_with_actual_magic/Do you mean this? I haven't used it, but the creator says it analyzes your inventory and tells you which items you can safely get rid of.
Yep, exactly.Worst case scenario, all you've done is shown there's hope for the world. In a somewhat twisted way I'll admit, but still, silver lining, glass half full, et cetera. That's the important part!Best case scenario, someone didn't die.That is also the important part.
Forgiven isn't upgrade for any top 3 team in NA/EU LCS. Sorry, while good players, his champ pool is weak. Lack of be able to play Corki, Kog, sivir was a problem for SK. This make so comp are limited because of his weaken. Not be able to play corki make harder for team to make comp with AD mid, need that extra magic damage from corki. Not play strongest team fight ADC of sivir really hurt most of comp that are played.KoG is very nice champ with tank heavy meta.When he learn to pick up and play a few more champ than maybe top ADC.
Yeah, but let's assume this person is living in Denver. Even so... who cares? There are over 2 million people living in the area, I don't think one person (even a very crazy person) matters.
i wouldn't mind a fixed shotgun trap like you see in the movies. Uninvited guest opens the door to your shelter and as it opens up they're just blasted by a shotgun trap fixture on the other side.
My interest has suddenly been piqued by RPG video games.  Does anyone have a recommendation?  Difficulty level: I don't own a console, and my PC is 4+ years old, has an i7 processor, 8 GB memory, but only a 512 MB ATI graphics card.I've heard good things about Dragon Age: Inquisition and its predecessors. The first game's ultimate edition is on Steam sale for $7.50 right now, actually.  However, I'm not beholden to this series of games.
Irrelevant.  Network, late-night, talk shows,  can't be political or controversial.  All they care about is ratings.  The show will have no teeth, no balls, and it will suck. 
I'm okay with this as long as she was all for it.I knew a guy who spent 2 hours finishing a WoW raid after getting the call that his wife was in labor. I don't think she would have been all for that.
Well the v2 coils are backwards compatible with the V1, so I'd assume they have to be the same. They look the same to me, other than the v2 coils have larger juice and airflow openings.
&gt; Alexis Karteron, a senior attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union who represents a woman who, like Disisto, was falsely arrested for videotaping police activity, says better training is needed.&gt; There is very little in the police training manual about how to respond when a bystander records an encounter, Karteron said. She pointed out that when many officers were trained, cellphone video cameras were not nearly as commonplace as they are now.I don't know what the NYPD manual says to do when someone starts video taping, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't say to arrest them, break the camera, and to make up charges against the photographer. No amount of training in the world would have prevented that officer from doing what he did. 
There is more truth to that than people like to admit.  When I moved to Texas one of the locals explained to me that people who display the Confederate flag are saying that the War between the States isn't really over.
This trailer is just full of liberal greeny bullshit and bias. Technology (and technological-advances) are not "automatically" evil and negative or destructive. Technology is just a tool,.. it can be used for good OR bad. * There are lots of examples of technology making the world a better place (spreads knowledge, instant communication, improved global-medicine, better data-gathering for storms/earthquakes,etc) * There are also lots of examples of technology being used to do shitty stuff (wars, hacking, inequality,etc) Technology is not necessarily a bad thing. Growth is not necessarily a bad thing. This trailer makes it sound like we should all go back to living like the Amish.

I have no malware lol what. Also 60 people in server including friends of mine that have played with me on the server before the patch so it seems its not the servers fault. Reinstalled game deleted all my data folders and checked file integrity nothing worked.
Yeah, really nice place.  Those three carom tables looked really nice, but I feel like that game would be a lifetime investment to become decent...like snooker.  Looks fun, but I know it's just not realistic to take that game on.
[Have I introduced you to our lord and savior Grid planning?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan)That's basically what I'm kinda trying to emulate ish.But seriously, straight lines are the most efficient roads Though my roads do follow the land mostly when it comes to elevation.
Homeopathy dilutes the material to such a degree that it is not possible for you to really even consider it there. It also does not always use what makes you sick. 
My wife is Russian dipshit. You're the ignorant one. You asked a question about Russian culture and I gave you the answer because I am knowledgeble in the subject. You should learn the definition of ignorance, and not ~~ask questions~~ read answers to questions if you can't handle the truth. 
Rooster Teeth is my favorite YouTube channel.And the only podcasts I listen to are all of their podcasts.I haven't gotten around to listening to the /r/anime podcast yet.
I used that case for a while, everything should fit. If you are willing to forego the optical drive, I would get an H80i GT liquid cooler so you can overclock more. in order to fit it, you'll need to remove the side HDD mount and you'll have to put the HDD in the optical drive bay. You should be able to fit an SSD on the bottom of the case too, and another beneath the optical drive bay if you only use one fan for the liquid cooler.Also, I know that [these dust filters](http://www.demcifilter.com/c211/ELITE-130-MINI-ITX.aspx) were made for the case, and should prevent most dust buildup.
Yeah. Money can buy a lot of things, including but not limited to campaign ads and rallies. However, money *cannot* buy votes. I embrace the challenge, and I'm sure Bernie does as well. I think there's a real chance to make a difference here. 
Yes the guy who cybers online and blackmails people out of money is someone worthy of everyone's sympathy. I mean sure it's possible, and likely, that this is one messed up person if this story is even true. That doesn't make them a good person though. 
&gt;I don't understand how you can compare that to something as detailed and as deep as Camp Omega and the various missions, vital story cinematics and rich lore laid out around the various missions.Like you said, it's subjective. GZ made me feel like it was a glorified tech demo, P.T. entertained me and gave me just enough content to make me feel... satisfied?It might also be that P.T. is a great party thing. I love getting new people to play it and watch their reactions. Don't get me wrong, I liked GZ, I just. I don't know. It felt like a demo with some achievements stuffed into it, I'm sorry, that's just how I feel, and I guess feeling aren't always rational. 
If no one was protesting you would not even know about this issue. There are people who are still not convinced that black, brown, and poor people are treated differently by the police and are routinely beaten, killed, and victimized by police in a police by numbers system and the war on drugs. Slowly phone cameras and the protesting that ensues following police murder on camera are convincing middle class and rich white people that there is a problem. There are some who will never be convinced because they either benefit financially from the current setup or they are just evil and like people being brutalized, murdered, and caged like animals for the color of their skin, their economic status, or even for victimless "crimes". But, little by little more people cannot stick their heads in the sand and claim its "only a few bad apples" and "most police are good people who want to protect you" and "its a dangerous job so a little killing and beatings is justified".

###There were a lot of migrant workers in Texas by WWI, but not as many permanent residents. Those who chose to stay after the Mexican-American War weren't necessarily happy about it in many cases, and they faced severe discrimination and even terrorism over the years. It's a really complex and fascinating subject. I took a class specifically on immigration along the border and even that barely scratched the surface.
Tupac. I would appear on the streets of Los Angeles, enjoy a long day of partying, food, and festivities, then as my 24 hours came close to expiring, I would wrap myself in a blanket, twirl around, and appear as my white, pasty, bearded self. For the rest of my life, I would be known as the Tupacocoon.
Seriously, the Rifs?[This shit just writes itself](http://readingisfundamental.org/).Cleon's ghost is very disappointed in you.(But all that aside, yeah pretty much.)
It has been changed. While you still have to choose from the three schools (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium), your parents have now full authority to send you to any school they want. The teachers only give recommendations based on your grades, but your parents can ignore them. Which is one of the reasons nearly all of the students now go to a Gymnasium, making it very very difficult for the teachers.
If you look at a finished weld on dirty aluminum, you'll often see graininess or black specks on the surface. That's what was cleaned off. It doesn't actually clean the metal, it just breaks up the oxide layer which has a much higher melting temp than the aluminum which then migrates to the surface of the molten aluminum and makes it look a little less nice.
I don't even care if they try skydiving, go for it I say.It's horseback riding that pisses me off. Animals don't deserve abuse so you can feel better about yourself.
Pretty much constantly in elementary school, especially in 4th grade since the teacher wasn't very good. Led to me being labeled as having behavioral issues and having to have a special behavior report card signed at the end of every day. My parents were so mad at that teacher. Eventually I learned to just keep things to myself mostly.
It really says a lot that blacks think text over the internet expressing opinions they don't like justify them physically attacking others.It says they're a profoundly weak and sensitive people.

What I want to know is why his friends left him.  The article says he "fell behind" the group.  Did they not notice he wasn't keeping up?  Did they look for him or try to help him along?  Did he walk away from them when they weren't looking?  I don't get how they could leave him behind.  They don't sound like very good friends.
As is said, install the OS onto the SSD then set the SSD as the startup disk. He can use Migration Assistant, in the Utilities folder, to move his files and settings across. This can move some apps but they may need to have serial numbers etc reapplied. When he is sure that the files have been moved, he can delete the files on the old disk and reuse it as wanted.  There are also utilities like CarbonCopyCloner, shareware/commercial that can just cole to the SSD.
I think it would be pretty cool to have the #1 SBC, MAC, MWC, CUSA, and AAC playing head to head in two bowls each season, round robin, ~~with one left out every year~~, with the top mid major getting into that access bowl. So lets saying its SBC and MAC champs play in mid major madness bowl west the first year, CUSA and AAC champs in major madness bowl east that year with top MWC getting into the access bowl. The next year it would switch. Possibly there would be teams that wouldnt be game, but I think it would be fun

Not if you spray them with refreshing coca-cola classic, it would be a fun way to disperse crowds in a super environmentally friendly and easy to clean way, plus getting a coke sponsorship will help rebuild the now destroyed neighborhoods that are freshly doused in the classic taste of thirsht quenching coca cola

This is the best reply so far.  I didn't get hard the firs time I had sex and I was just like OMG its happening and thinking to much about it gets you out of the moment. If you just enjoy her instead and make her have a good time your dick will get on board, even if it doesn't showing her you are willing to please her regardless of your pleasure is generally a huge turn on for women.
I'm so gonna get this foundation.Plus, I think it's pretty rad she's having a book on the history of beauty! I haven't seen much from her to be honest but I was expecting a complete different video based on the thumbnail entirely (and already was in inner-sigh-mode) but was so pleasantly surprised how she spoke about the whole topic. Big like.
Both are good, but so far in one season with Gaya I've seen more promise going forward and defensively than Bernat. If anything Alba is better Bernat.

I'm cool with that, now that Mariota is gone we still have some flexibility to move around and get a really good player for a smaller price. I'm not entirely comfortable with rolling the dice on Bradford's health myself, but I'd prefer that than what we were gonna give up for MM. If Bradford implodes and we get Sanchize all year next year at least we'll still have a (high) first rounder to try and get another QB. Or, Bradford stays healthy and we keep our good players. I'm good with it.EDIT: wrong word.

Exactly!   I had terrible nosebleeds all the time until, on vacation, my nose would just not stop bleeding and I ended up in urgent care.  The doc told me to use vaseline on the inside of my nose.  I've done it every day since and the nosebleeds are GONE.

hmmm i also have the black/red h440imo the case looks best when it's really minimal looking, like: http://i.imgur.com/EYDwXP1.jpgcolor coordinated ram, fans, psu cables, etc. are all somewhat subtle changes that really make the case shine, and i'd try to stay with a minimal amount of red leds inside the case, i personally think even the nzxt logo and io panel lighting being white looks kinda weird - not awful, just not matching as much as it could

I love Lollipop, but even on 5.1 I'd be damn close to going back to Kitkat if it wasn't such a pain to do. Even if it means rooting and eventually flashing something with more functionality, which I don't at all want to get into, might honestly be worth it.

Plain and simple - $1 pledges convert into higher pledges. People back your project, get the updates, like what they see, and up it later. And if they don't like what they see, they cancel, and you've only lost $1.

I am there and doing that and your response makes me think you do not understand US taxes. If he does not make a dime in Cali, he does not have to pay income tax in Cali.E.g. If he has a house/car in Cali, makes $1,000,000 in Texas, and makes $0 in Cali. He will pay property tax in Cali, US Federal income tax, and state income tax in Texas.

&gt; I was told to step down so it wouldn't hurt my own reputation to stay there and the organization's reputation potentially.Eh, they lied to you. Stepping down was the worst decision for you make, and hurt your reputation the most.Because* You signaled that you were incompetent when you stepped down.* It was just an honest mistake.It only required an apology, and making sure to be more aware of what you're reading.* It wasn't actually your fault. It was the screener's fault.* Stepping down made it seem like you might have done it on purpose/ are grossly incompetent/ this happened before* You had the ability to make it an honest mistake on everyones' part, but instead you decided to take full blame and just step down. 
I would still talk to housing. I left Tech in the middle of the year. The process was more like a negotiation in my opinion. The housing faculty have the final say and can bypass the rules. As you are receiving a CO-OP, I feel that they would work with you and probably waive the fee. If you were dropping out to go work at Joe Smoes Car Shop, probably not.

I just hope the whole Alliance debacle incduced some humility into him. He is just such a great player and I'd be really happy if he'd be be back on the team. Steelback is fine, but arguably he is just not as good of a player.
Unless you have some specific need c++ and java aren't that different. Most likely your choice should be dictated by available libraries. Biggest difference as languages in my mind would be choosing between RAII in c++ or garbage collection in java. Second consideration would be template metaprogramming in c++ vs generics and reflection in java, though you might not end up doing anything complicated in either. As I said they're not that different, but we can't give suggestions without requirements.FYI this subreddit is more focused on academic views of languages not helping people choose between them. Maybe /r/learnprogramming is the place to ask.

Fantastic for that.  Transcoding 1080P movies which are 3GB+ easily with no hiccups.  It is also running the torrent server and indexing server along with that, I highly recommend it.
There are some stuff that teams work better. Like when the legion of doom attacks, superman and Wonder Woman can only do so much.

Actually, it had a lot less to do with any supposed advancement on the part of Europeans and a lot more to do with the host of new diseases they introduced to the native population.The fact is that urban settlements and agriculture were commonplace in North and South America centuries before Europeans arrived, and there's zero reason to believe that the introduction of European culture would be viewed as noteworthy by a species of immortals that have already mastered interstellar travel.

Think about its actual application. Men don't have control over reproduction at all, no say in it, even if they use contraception, or are deceived out of it. A partner can abort a mans child without his consent or carry it to term against his will.

Well. I didn't play many jrpgs, but Persona series is definitely best for me especially in comparison Persona 4 with Final Fantasy XIII. Persona has excellent balance of good dialogues, interactive things and fighting. There are good characters. Game is really long but you don't feel tired. But I have bad feelings about Persona 5 and even don't know why. Maybe it's all about style, main character or three second role characters which look too typical. Typical guy, typical blonde girl and strange cat.
Weirwoods in the south are only in gardens. You don't want rogue saplings of any tree to clutter the garden, let alone ones that get that freaking big. And there's no point in transplanting them since common folk would destroy them.
Campus rape epidemic? I bet this has something to do with the way childs are educated, or rather not educated about sexuality and alcohol and those who are worried the most about campus rape are part of the problem by focusing on preaching abstinence rather than proper controlled and educated contact.

Not very. They last for a while on me if I'm not eating/drinking/etc but they'll normally need a touch up after a cup of tea. I find them quite variable though - some of them disappear as soon as you look at them (Romantique can be picky, Triceratops, Demon's Desire) and some will survive a couple of drinks and light snacking intact (the ones with better formulas generally, like Sexy Nerd and Winter Romance.)
I'm still trying to figure this out as well. If you find out, let me know! I only have 2 friends left, hah. Ruined all romantic relationships so I'm staying away for now. 
I completely agree with this.  I watched a cyclist use a turning lane to travel straight across an intersection, and it resulted in a car lightly clipping her.  Cyclist fell off, car immediately pulls over to check if she's okay.  Other pedestrians have already helped her off the road, etc.Meanwhile, her friends are verbally harassing this guy who didn't do anything wrong, and clearly felt *awful*.  Nobody drives and says, "Damn, I'd *love* to hurt a cyclist today."  Screaming at a motorist about how much you "FUCKING HATE THE CARS IN THIS TOWN" isn't helping your friend, nor is it changing the fact that your friend caused the accident in the first place.

It's Release to Manufacturing, however, RTM is the first build that consumers will receive. In the case of Windows, RTM releases go to the OEMs (Dell, HP, etc.) months before a customer can purchase it. This gives the OEMs time to install it and bloat it up en mass in preparation for the release to the public (general availability). With that said, there could be patches available through Windows Update by the time it becomes available to the public.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_to_manufacturing_.28RTM.29

Good. Any team that wants to move from 20 to 2 should have to give up a shit ton of picks/players. There's a reason the worst teams draft first. They need the help more than you and have all the leverage.edit: salty eagles fans downvoting. 
There's a special rule in Reg 25.2505 that says that previously used DSUEs are included in the total available exclusion amount, but it seemed odd to me that an individual could go around collecting additional estate tax exclusions ad infinitum. The only example that's ever given in relation to that specific piece of literature assumes that the cumulative DSUEs aren't in excess of the $10.68 million maximum that would be available without the special rule, and I couldn't seem to find anything else about it online...

I don't mind the casting, but I hope they don't screw up the story. Like many books, this one seems like it would be a perfect 10 part Netflix or HBO series.
We had a personal finance class in grade 10, and options for "home" skills through grades 10-12. Those included law, fashion (which was really just a sewing class), cooking and nutrition, parenting, living spaces and shelter, etc. I didn't know it at the time, but my highschool actually offered a wide variety of useful classes outside of standard education.. Also auto, welding, computer tech, drafting, portfolio, etc. I hadn't considered it in a long time but I guess we were really lucky.
I can attest to this. I lift in a gym where dropping is prohibited. Controlling the weight back DOWN to your shoulders not only builds strength but builds confidence. Learn to be comfortable bringing it down slowly.
You said that 'it [platypuses] never really evolved after the reptile/mammal divergence.', which is why I pointed out that echidnas evolved from platypuses. Many other extinct mammals did, too, and once upon a time (many millions of years after the reptile/mammal divergence) monotremes were a thriving clade of mammals like marsupials and placentals.

Amarillo is kinda expensive to use for bittering. I'd consider using Magnum or Warrior. You'll probably only need 0.5 - 0.6 oz and it should be cheaper. Then take that ounce of Amarillo and add it to your dry-hop.
&gt; "Oh, it's easy is it? Hell, here's my $5000 camera and lens, and oh why not here's another $5000 in studio lighting and props. Well, go on, take a picture, it's easy right?"right, the idea is, "if you think it's so easy, here's a $5000 camera. show me how easy it is."

Ok, who told you they didn't? Two can play that bullshit game. Why would there be all of these rumors for no reason? There is zero point in putting it out there just for shits and giggles.
Yeah I totally agreeHopefully Giannis will learn from this. But Dunleavy has been a bitch the entire series, not saying it redeems what Giannis did at all, he just has to learn to pay back by dominating on the court instead of playing into the bulls small dirty plays thats going on.You can really see the difference in experience between these two teams, the bulls know just how to make the Bucks frustrated so the young Bucks show it while the refs are watching (13 techs in the series)
the day I get punished by a hungry crab is the day I BibleThump- I wouldn't uninstall, I'd just die from laughing too hard.  And yeah it has an awkwardly good fit for some reason as you mentioned a few... it is just so fun to play, if you have the cards I'd suggest giving it a shot for 5-10 games, it is an absolute blast and may inspire you to play it more- it has had that effect on a lot of people
Thank you very much for the well thought out response! Unfortunately with the way my program is structured, I have to wait until my final quarter to take my senior capstone course, so it's kind of an all or nothing deal. It's a bummer you don't get anything extra from employers for completing two degrees, but a double degree vs double major is only like a 5 course difference in my program.

You can do the DLC at any level really, it is just more painful. Give it a go and if you break your controller farm up a bit first.Edit: Oh you want to place the vessel for Kaathe? If you just wanted the dark ending you don't need to place the Lordvessel for Kaathe or even meet him. 
The nightly news. Local news isn't bad, but the national coverage by NBC and the other major networks is hard for me to sit through. There are agendas to be pushed, I get that, but I can't help but wonder why anyone would take them seriously. 
Being a recent Portland transplant, I can relate.My favorite football team is the Saints, so fortunately I'm already predisposed to the fleur de lis.
&gt;Draw a freehand circle, then click to see how close you got to a perfect circle. Help with server costs.It wasn't built to compare results, it was built to see how close *you* got to a perfect circle. You *could* reliably compare results if you categorized circles in small, medium, or large variety. You could refine that accuracy but adding a fourth, fifth, sixth... nth type to the category. It does none of that for you, but doesn't appear to have been built for that in the first place, and all of that would immensely add to the complexity of the design.It could pretty easily normalize results, but that would ignore the fact that larger circles are harder to draw freehand using a mouse. 
First time I played, I got out of the valve, First thing I saw a woman waking alone in the wasteland, went to talk to her, she run to me and got me flamed to death with a flamethrower.WELCOME TO FALLOUT.That's when I felt in love.
Every ship in the game is designed to be universal to an extent. The Hornet can carry cargo. The Origin 890 can be a pirate. That's the entire point of the Aurora - to be adequate at every job but exceptional at none. &gt;it sounds like whatever variants the Hulls can be converted to, they are going to be good at the roleThis is the illogical leap you're making. Greater modularity does not mean greater effectiveness. The only other role that we know the Hull series will be good at is as a [Q-ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship), which is a narrow counter-ambush role and makes perfect sense for a freighter. Every other role that you're theorycrafting is at best speculation and at worst panicky rumor-mongering. 
A lot of athletes actually fuck that up. David James was an elite level goalkeeper for like 15 years and he's declared bankruptcy. Countless NFL players run dry post career.30 for 30 did an interesting show on the topic called "broke" I really recommend watching if youre interested in the financial minds of people who make six figures before they know what a mortgage is.
Every time I get Abel from a chest, I just sigh and pick him up anyway. There are worse drops (like Fate as The Lost), but I rarely get any decent use out of him besides large stationary bosses that we can double team with all the ultra mega massive DPS Abel adds.
That's a pretty bad situation.  I definitely don't have answers but clearly the city needed to be better prepared if it wanted to take an influx of arrestees.

Rabiah's flavor is too tied to the real world and the source material (with cards like Aladdin's Lamp, Shahrazad and Bazaar of Baghdad). Nowadays Magic likes to keep its flavor separated from its real world inspirations.
From 4:56-6:30. I absolutely love that lo-fi sounding chill elevator music type of sound. Anyone know the name of this genre? Or any artists that make that kind of music? Thanks.

I was a subtitute teacher for a few years. One day, I went to the high school I graduated from to substitute for a gym teacher. The class was taught by multiple teachers, and the other substitute, "Mr. C," frequently substituted when I was a student there.We got to talking and he says, "This district is going downhill. It's all of these blacks."I pause for a minute. This man is Sicilian. I'm white, so I'm guessing he thought that meant I'm automatically of the same opinion.A black student walks up and asks some things; this kid must have heard some of the conversation. Mr. C answers him. The kid has just turned away and he says to me, "He's OK for being one of them."I was floored.
mm Hg is a unit of pressure. (It is, literally, the pressure due to a 1 mm high column of mercury.)The modern name for the mm Hg is torr. That is, 1 mm Hg = 1 torr.How about atmospheres? There are 760 mm Hg per atm. --You seem on right track. As always, the eqn is in moles.  --Generally best to post a new Q in a new thread. That gets it to the top, where more people may notice it.

I bring the combines for life powders and spread the healing love when it's needed. It's saved so many missions and hunters are normally very thankful for it. I've been hunting the T. Zamtrios and he is quite the hungry fatty. Instead of throwing poop at him, I take the time for DPS and life powder the hunter who's been named dinner. Extra DPS and no one dies, Yay! But once I am in the belly? No dung bombs, no life powders, just stomach acid till death. It's disheartening being the only one helping to keep the group alive. 
Massachusetts here too, but cape cod area. I was trying to think of trends all day too, but all i can seem to come up with is really bad makeup (in my area anyways!) heavy black eyeliner.

Primaries aren't actually general elections though. They are just the party's way of choosing a candidate they want to run on their ticket. Also, there are only three countries in Europe with enforced compulsory voting (Cyprus Liechentstein, and Luxembourg) . . . and only Switzerland gives postal notifications for all voting elections.
I don't know what he meant because that part was not included in the audio clip.  I know neither what Ingraham said nor what Rand said in response.  We only know a paraphrase.
It's still a good place to build, can beat the scrap out of the vehicles even when they don't bear loot in the container.  Recurve bow's laying around, berries and water.  Also it's out of the "city lag" zone.  Big fan of the spot.

Those people would be wrong, he definitely is one of the greatest ever.In my country (Portugal) there is a consensus, he was the best of that era, we all liked Figo (one of is rivals in that time) butt Zidane was a lot better.Di Stefano was the king in the 50's, Pele in the 60's, Cruijff in the 70's, Maradona in the 80's, Zidane in the late 90's early 00's and Messi since then.Ronaldo Fenomeno was closed, and arguably better than Zizou in top form butt he had to many injuries and only as something like 3, 4 years in his prime (when he was in his early 20's). Zizou had a decade in contention to the best player in the world.One of the most skillful players ever (his first touch was unreal) who won every important thing like CL, WC, La Liga and Seria A (the best league in the world by far in that time). For me he is the best I ever seen apart from Messi and this comes from a Portuguese a country Zizou used to kill in the big tournaments.
Chill. u/exccord is right. Even white supremacists have some right ideas. These ideas are just a piece of everything that supremacists thing and as a whole they end up completely misguided, hateful, and awful, and just totally unacceptable. Even in the speech portrayed in the video, Derrick has some points which in general make sense but simply do not apply to the situation at all. He is ultimately wrong. 
Yep, or they don't think it will happen to them, or that if it wasn't safe they wouldn't have a house there in the first place.

It'd be way too strong if it'd activate no matter what if the unit is killed during it's duration. 2 infestors and you're guaranteed to be directly converting up to 24 supply directly into your army MIDFIGHT, STRAIGHT into the battlefield.I'm not sure how to tweak it to not make it too insane or too broken. Probably energy cost. I feel like if a infestor could only do it on one unit in a fight, it wouldn't be too strong, maybe?EDIT: If you want it to introduce some actual micro it'd have to be way shorter than 10 seconds as well, 10 seconds is like, the duration of a 200 vs 200 fight, if not longer.
I know that's the point of them, but I totally get what you mean, and the lack of an obvious "all actors involved were above the age of 18" disclaimer makes my skin crawl a bit
Follow this advice.  Spot on.  Exactly as I did it, but I took 5 days in the T-9 and was ready to buy a fully outfitted trade Conda.  Since Conda I bought and outfitted a combat Clipper and put 50 Million credits in the bank trading about 1 hour a day.  The rest of the time I have fun with the Clipper.  I will add more ships after next release.  It was a long road, but really once I got to the Python, the rest only took a few weeks.

I had no idea that was a law myself. Perhaps he did, and perhaps he didn't.  As far as I knew, the cyclist was in the wrong because she had attempted to pass the taxi on the left. One of the passengers even asks her why she was passing a stopped vehicle like that.That being said, as I mentioned somewhere else in this thread, I would've stayed there and waited for the police but I definitely would not give her my information.
I've always had an irrational fear of little people.  I'm really not sure why, although I blame "The Wizard of Oz" for it.  I have intentionally tried to challenge this fear as an adult and have worked through it somewhat.
I doubt that they are sleazier than any other billionaire. But I gather they have become very active in in the culture wars and have made lots of enemies. Its in the mind of people that the koch  are evil billionaires pulling the strings of us politics. So people are looking for it more now. Sometimes finding it sometimes making connections where there are none. 
No. Marvel movies aren't dumb movies with explosions and mumbo jumbo. There's something more to it. If that's all we wanted, we could watch Transformers. It's a melding of several separate things.GDQ's are meant to be in that same vein. So, if you're complaining that they're doing things wrong on the speedrunning end, those complaints are valid. How many of those WOULD lead to them losing money if they fixed it?It seems to be that the overzealous rules policies and the occasionally unprofessional behavior of the staff, coupled with poor organization and communication make up the brunt of the complaints, and I'm sorry, if you think that is going to lose you money, you're off in the head.I would say that these people don't think that, but that they don't care. If you're okay with that, fine. Keep watching and support them. If you're not, say something. Doing that is the only way to change things.
See, I disagree. The fedora doesn't *enhance* any of those outfits except the bottom middle one. Each one of the others would be better without the fedora. It's just not a good hat because you have to fit within an extremely narrow description range for it to fit.
Wouldn't keeping it well oiled avoid much of the risk? I've always found that if you keep the wood in a fairly saturated state from the onset, you end up with a pretty consistent life. I'm in a bit more dry climate. It may be a little more difficult in a humid region, but OP should be able to control moisture content. Keeping it somewhat high. This might all be moot if op got lucky with his species of wood.
Dunleavy started some shit and got roughed up. Giannis got tossed for retaliation. No one got hurt. Bulls advance. The end. Take your moralizing somewhere else.

FBI is always creating "stings" and often using entrapment.  This happened to be a drug sting.  Instead of sending more people to jail and going on a witch hunt, can we please simply decriminalize drugs?  We can do away with the DEA, and large portions of the FBI an DHS.

Can you be a socialist libertarian? It seems like his views on what the states should take care of are more along my lines of thinking but it sure seems like the rich have to pay a lot of taxes. Why aren't people upset about taxes that huge corporations making billions of dollars are finding ways to avoid paying?
I've used this technique a couple of times over the past month. It works, but reheating them doesn't get them as hot as I want them to without over cooking the yolks. Next time I'll pull them early the first time through so I can reheat them more without over cooking. 
Well one of the studies I linked suggests that it is not a piss poor anti-androgen.http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM197404182901602"Mean (± S.E.M.) plasma testosterone — 416 ± 34 ng per 100 ml — was significantly lower in this group than that in the control-group mean — 742 ± 29 ng per 100 ml — for age-matched men who had never used marihuana"That is a significant reduction, and it was seen in humans. Also it is thought to interfere with androgen uptake as well.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6249575I don't see it really being a weak anti-androgen. Perhaps weaker than others, but it still has a significant effect. And as I said before I was never suggesting it could be the cause. Rather could it be one of the influencing factors. 
I don't know, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be a big deal. If you're in Baltimore, have you checked out Exile Fitness? It's a really hardcore powerlifting gym and it's awesome.
in scid vs pc you can do a premove by using ctrl+click on piece to move and click square to move to. Not ideal but it works. Pychess also has fics support but i havent used it much for online play.
No. Never, even if I believe it. I always model respect and consistently expect them to do what they are supposed to do. I feel like a broken record, but if I tell them they'll never amount to anything, they'll just switch off, give in and never trust or believe in me, which makes managing the classroom that much more difficult. It's a vicious cycle that I can't perpetuate in good conscience.
I love how they teased Bard using summoners Rift, the 3 little icos that would glow on the map. That would be awesome if they did something similar. However I think with this update on the baron pit they just wanted to give it more structure and a "dangerous" vibe. AKA 2SPOOKY5ME
His non-witnessing testimony is becoming more irrelevant anyway. The cops cant count to 4 unless there's independant video of them stopping more than 3 times, the arresting officer had his guns taken away because he's unstable, and 5 cops have already been shown to be filing false reports. smokescreen like this isnt going to help them as much as they hope
Can you link a source where it's mentioned that the bottom core trait line is being replaced by the elite? Sorry I just haven't been able to find anything on that
We were at DL this weekend and picked up a few of these amazing postcard prints from Wonderground in downtown Disney.

I'll post the final presentation when we have it all up. 
try going for more defencive or aoe spells, also if its somthing like dark fog or the swishy swoooshy spell ry predict where the phantoms gonna go e.g if you've notice hes a reactive player, try argo him with soul arrow, if hes a super agro dude who wants your ass on a silver platter then you know he is not gonna waste time in hacking you up therefore lay a aoe spell right i front of you, cs thats where he/she is gonna roll to) thats my theory thought, overall if you feel unsatisfied with your build then change it, cos theres no point play if you're not having fun you now :)

You would really need to take a calculus course for it to make sense easily, but essentially what he's doing is reordering the equation without actually changing the value so that it matches a predefined identity which one would have memorized, and is very easy to solve (the part where he says "∫sec^(2)(x) dx = tan(x) + c" is the predefined identity, with tan(x) + c being the solution).Essentially what this means is that he's taking the integral of sec(x)/cos(x) (finding the area underneath the curve of sec(x)/cos(x)). He then proves that the area under sec(x)/cos(x) is equal to that of sec^(2)(x) and solves using an identity to say that the indefinite area under the curve is equal to tan(x) + c (where c is any real number).
Ugh, I don't even know what goes on in the minds of such individuals.But hey, live and let live, she can do what ever she wants, I don't care. Just please for the love of everything holy do not call this "art".
it's hard 4 me 2 go nuts over a video no matter how many people r around me going crazy. there's just so much energy b'ing in the same room with the band and feeding off of their energy 2.  maybe death grips r COMPLETELY different in this respect and if that's how this tour is going 2 b, we'll all find out whether they can convey the same energy as a tru blu live show.  i'm going 2 6 shows and i'm just fuckin hoping they r physically playing.

It's very refreshing to say the least. However, it's still mindboggling to be called a racist by a white liberal for pointing this out in person. It's very depressing to see whole generations of whites being taught so much self loathing and uncompromising acceptance of people who hate them.
They are one and the same. Speed = distance/time. You you have super speed it means that you use very little time. If you can dilate time, then you move at regular speed but the rest of the universe slows down. Neither you nor the rest of the universe would be able to tell the difference.
If you're certain the relationship isn't salvageable, perhaps approach the "daunting" part of the breakup -- the actual logistics of it -- by pretending that you've already done it. It's a good exercise. Right now, this minute, tell yourself that it's over: What would your next steps be? Where would you live? What would you pack? What bills need to be separated? Work it step-by-step so it doesn't seem so overwhelming. Then, you'll be able to sit her down and explain you're ending it without an added panic attack. And I think taking that week to sort things out seems like a solid plan. Good luck.

My thoughts are that the media is obfuscating what is really going on and how badly the police are losing, and that I wish there was more counter-cultural uprising going on in other American cities simultaneously.  If we all stand up at once, they can't stop us from taking our country back.
The troops she's stuck leading in Meereen is the event spawned stack of about 10000. I've had Dany slowly ship a considerable amount of troops from Slaver's Bay across to Westeros before to help my battles when I've married her before. Poor Dany has never been married for love. Always for her armies or Dragons...Sorry to hijack the post - but does anyone know what happens if Sansa is installed as LP of the North? Will the children be Stark as the title trumps the marriage, or will the children be Lancel's little Lannisters?
I got a smaller, but still nice ring when I proposed to my wife. She was/is very happy with it, but says she wouldn't mind having a bigger one sometime in the future. Some of her friends have bigger rings with more stones, but I like the one I was able to afford at the time. I tell her I'll replace her plain wedding band with one with more stones, but I always want the engagement ring to remind us of where we came from.

What's sad about this, is that A LOT of parents will say the same thing. But, of course THEIR kid is suited for college! Only the dumb kids aren't, which of course, couldn't be their's.So basically, you have a bunch of people that all agree that college isn't for everyone. But at the same time, those same people aren't willing to admit that perhaps their kids are the ones not suited for college
Same here :/ so I guess it isn't a problem with just me. I checked the website and it has a notification about a system error. I'm guessing that's what's going on. When I try using the website I keep getting glitch notifications as well. Come on Microsoft. 
That's so much work.... http://www.amazon.com/5912543-Camaro-Equinox-4-Button-Remote/dp/B0089KMSR6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430439890&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=camaro+key Buy off Amazon prime.

I agree with GRRM. But, only because I can separate the worlds of GoT and BB. What is acceptable in one, is less so in the other. I believe he was speaking about the character relative to the world he lives in. Walter in GoT wouldn't last. Joffrey couldn't exist in the world of BB. Also, the evil in GoT is much more just out there and on your plate. 
Sure. I feel like you'll still be unconvinced but I'll give it the good old college try anyway. Give me some time to organize my thoughts and evidence and expect a PM from me soon.
I still have a few glitched-paintjob adders from the early days of the original console version. There was some neat stuff you could do, lie pearlescent with matte finish.
Well, they're all different races and D&amp;D can often have racist peoples. Especially against races they believe are ALL evil (half-orcs, tieflings, drow, etc). Racial issues have existed in the Fantasy genre since its conception.
For amazing Chinese food check out [9+9](http://9plus9.ca/). We tried it out on a whim after seeing it recommended in a different thread on this subreddit and have been back several times.  
Because it was bred by a man who had a couple illegal wolves and some other dogs, including an American/white shepherd. This was a neighbor of one of my mom's friends. The guy had warrants out in several states and was in hiding, so our future dog was starving and killed another neighbor's chicken. He said he was going to shoot her when he got off work, and when my mom found out, we drove out there and rescued her.Some of the guy's other dogs were adopted or put into shelters. Several of the vicious ones, including the two wolves were put down. I'd upload pictures, but I don't have any and would need to dig them out at my mom's house.
So in that study, the kids who saw their moms sporadically were more likely to develop depression than kids who never saw their moms again? That's interesting.Edit: Grammar
Pretty much, which would lead me to believe that the ones who are complaining are the same people struggling to adapt to the new meta, or feel like they have less of an advantage compared to Classic mode. That said I'm still curious to see how much OC'ing affects a bots performance. I was shocked too see my medic shredding through a plasma tank in an earlier game.
The challenges these days are pretty varied so it would be almost impossible for someone to go on a complete immunity run. Rodney or Sierra should be able to beat Mike at some challenge. 
1. Get tickets in section 22 and show up at 5:00 when gates open to catch BP, and ask guys coming in and out of the clubhouse. Alternately;1.b. Get tickets anywhere and wander down towards section 22 at the beginning of the game and/or and at the bottom/top of the 9th. Tip the usher at the top of the stairs $20. Wander down and see who's around signing after the game.  2. Left-center as near the field as possible!edit - Section 22 'cause it's right next to the clubhouse stairs that lead out to the field.
Same steering wheel in the base GT as well. And you have my favorite center gauge up. I just wish it would magically tick over into the boost section sometimes.

From an interview with him on a panel I saw, he told a story about how originally he wrote Walter actually purposefully injecting her with more while she was asleep to cause the OD. But he was convinced out of it by others as being way too dark.
Friend's mom teaches at my school, he sometimes tells me the interesting things other teachers say. The worst so far came from a medical teacher and was directed towards one of the students in my class: "I bet fagboy is going to show up in his nice little dress shoes." Not my favorite teacher.

The only point I made is that it's POSSIBLE for it to flop, there is no wrong to that statement unless you want to claim it's IMPOSSIBLE for it to flop. 
Fowler wouldn't really compliment Mack well unless they moved him to a 4-3 DE, he's more of a 3-4 OLB/DE. Leonard would fit in way more in oakland, but since he's good and fuck the raiders, I hope they pick a receiver.

To be fair, a lot of teacher education programs have only about one semester of actual developmental psychology courses.  A lot of teachers don't even work with kids until at least their second year (unless they're in a good program, which doesn't necessarily mean the school's even good).This may sound like an oxymoron, but teachers oftentimes come out of their undergrad with too much education and often too little experience.

Other than having mini-rule book to pass around, no.That said, the minis and map tiles were worth the cost for me. Actually, the minis alone were worth it, and I didn't know how much I'd love the map tiles.However, if you have tons of terrain and minis from Hordes, you don't really need it.
My ideal scenario for the Undertaker's retirement, since this is the only thread that's ever seemed appropriate for it. Wins rumble, wins title at Wrestlemania. Taker receives such a beating that the light from the urn flickers out and dies. Druids come out, lights go out, and then they come back on, and all that's left in the ring is the urn and the title. Commence a tournament next night on Raw, because tournaments rule.

Ok, I can't believe how many people have up voted and commented on this picture. This is not the best picture of Rio, the best picture is the one you take.

I know everyone thinks this is hilarious and that she's a great parent, but I think it just shows bad parenting.Hitting and cursing at your child, are those the hallmarks of a good parent?
It's not a good pick. I wish him the best, but he's not the answer there. Glaringly obvious to me, but maybe I'm wrong. FWIW, I don't know if Mariota would have been the answer either, but Tampa did have to pick one of the two of them. It's a gamble either way. Shitty year to have the #1 pick when you need a QB..
SV and MM are getting slight buffs in PTR. I too run SV but also play MM, and have found that a decent SV/MM hunter can outperform BM. In all honesty the fact BM does so well with 4pc currently motivates me to push harder as SV/MM. I really enjoy the specs I play and relish the challenge. Don't worry about who is the stronger/weaker spec to play, just enjoy what you do and you'll do well

Or they only play POP from the 70s/80s and no rock. Belinda Carlisle is a great singer, but her songs are NOT rock. Journey does rock. The Moody Blues did rock. "Music made in the 60s-80s" is not the definition of classic rock. The phrase you're looking for is "classic music." But apparently we can't use that because people can't tell the difference between classic and classical or some shit. 
I would recommend looking on Airbnb and seeing what similar sized houses around your area are renting out for.  Say you end up listing the room for $220, if you aren't getting any requests after a month or so, lower the price.  If you're getting flooded with requests, you know you've undervalued yourself and bump up the price.  Also, keep in mind peak traveling seasons for NYC and change your prices accordingly.

Having flown over Mexico city during some studying abroad, I can say that picture does not even start to show the full scale of the city. In all directions literally as far as you can see, even hundreds of feet up in an airplane, all you could see was landscape covered in buildings. The true scale of it is so mind blowing still that it is something I definitely want to witness again, even if only from a plane.
I'm not getting rid of it. And I have two avics. I actually wasn't afraid to handle the thing at all until people here freaked out because I posted a picture of it on my hand!YOU GUYS DID THIS TO MEEEEEEE*runs away screaming*...And thank you for the tips.

Rhetorical question.  And I'm not sure why the down votes, Winston was not worth the first overall pick.  You fuckers get dumber and saltier by the day.
There's a great app called Tenuto on the app store. It costs a few dollars but it has some great exercises in it that will help you such as note recongnition, ear training, and interval training. A great companion app is their app which I believe is just called Music Theory. This can all be found at musictheory.net but if you want to support them or use it more conveniently, you can buy the apps.
Could not agree more. Your body is most likely doing a fair amount of compensation elsewhere in your hips and core and this book will work on your whole body rather than treating what may be a symptom. 
I dunno, I liked it. But then again I watched it only a few months ago for the first time, followed the rewatch threads for it, and asked a friend of mine questions and discussed the show with him. I also love to over analyse the anime I watch, especially those that seem fairly intelligent. I get why people don't like the non-EoE ending, but I thought it was pretty interesting and insightful.Of course, EoE blew the whole thing out of the water, but NGE wasn't bad at all.
This banlist looks like someone misinterpreted the "casual" part of EDH to mean "Decks should be janky as hell and not have good cards"I can say for certain that I would never bother playing at a LGS with rules like these. Not only does the expanded banlist rule out a lot of fun strategies, none of my 5 decks would be legal to play there without swapping out several cards, and some of them wouldn't be legal ever.
Strikers could work with Death From Above, mainly because everyone knows that a reckless Titan running at you in a straight line has about the same possible outcome as standing on the path of a moving train, so they'd likely run/blink away. DFA is more unpredictable for the enemy, possibly not having a visual on the Titan until he's literally in their faces with his fist. 
Depends on how ok you are with interacting with other players. If you do it all yourself, it will likely take you a few months or more. However if you choose to involve other players you can reasonably get them all in like 5 hours. It depends mainly on logistics like are people trading what you want to buy and does the reddit armory have what you want in stock. And if you decide to buy them off the steam market it's probably something like 30 minutes since theres a lot of clicking involved. But as I said earlier, the stock weapons you start with are head and shoulders above most of the alternative weapons.
As one opinion, this sounds like a recipe for buyer's remorse to me. If you already feel big reservations about the purchase before making it, I don't think they will go away once you buy it, unless the money is nothing to you and you're okay turning around and ordering something else right after because something broke or just looks bad. If you feel locked in to one option, in my opinion that's a good reason just to defer the purchase. There are so many quality keyboards in non-gaming brands that just don't have the RGB feature.
Yeah quick look at profiles for both groups (even if unofficial) has EXID with the 4 members (without Hyerin) being at around 168-170cms. (Hyerin at 165cm)  Where as Crayon Pop has Ellin and Geummi at around 165cm.  So yeah CP is short :p

You do realize that he had not only an entire army of silver Knights, but also nito, izileth and her daughters, and seath. And he knew their weakness, right? You seem to be under the impression he soloed them. 
And Conner's evolution from a normal whiny teenager to a fucking coldhearted badass was amazing. Like, you don't really care too much for him until that event where he Shows Up as a badass, and then he gets better and better. I fucking loved that series 
well I feel better but fuck that shit. that was one UGLY MOTHER FUCKING experience.my sense of cold and taste are completely different then I remember. Bananas have this nasty taste, ice feels like it did when I was like 11 years old, gatoraid has this nasty hint of piss...I did burn my lungs good with Cl2 gas 4-5 years before, perhaps the opiate withdrawal resurrected some dead cells or something, idk. pepperoni tastes funny too, and toasted bread has a odd smell.all i got was clonadine. I did not taper (though like 36 hours in I took 1mg in an attempt to get to sleep, it did not work, so I got rid of it, i decided tapering was just gonna extend the illness.fucking drug bullshitAnd yea, it was pure, at first I needed only like &lt;300ug. Tolerance grew astrofuckingnomically.my parents got involved and I got some serious anti drug sanctions going on, like zero tolerance, probably for the best though, I have had enough fun for a long time.

okay, serious answer: I'm not sure, if there is enough plot for a whole movie, but maybe it would be possible in the final fantasy style. [here is something, not sure about the original story](http://steamcommunity.com//app/301520/discussions/0/622954747292709238/)

I think you can list the related sites in the sidebar (go to subreddit settings, and there write in the sidebar box).I meant if there are some nylon legwear subs I didn't add there.The people I know who are into this are my friends who I figured out were into it and asked them. But they aren't very knowledgeable about hosiery though...

I'd just let him correct her. I have a 6 year old, almost 50 lb Standard Poodle, and a Mini Schnauzer/Boston Terrier mix puppy. When I brought the puppy home he was 8 weeks old and weighed 7 lbs. He is now 16 weeks and weighs 13ish lbs. I have let my poodle correct my puppy to his heart's content the whole time. Your puppy will eventually be a full grown dog, and preventing your older dog from laying the ground work for doggy respect will lead to fights down the road. The last thing you want is an older puppy or full grown dog with no respect and no manners, because this will lead to real fights and discontent down the road, which will be much harder for you to sort through and deal with than allowing your older dog to correct your pup now. As long as he is not drawing blood or being overly aggressive, I'd let the corrective growls, body posture, and snaps happen. 
hahahahaha you know, rapers going to keep raping 1000000 years after you're dead.

Fucken SJW trying to rewire humanity one fucken outrage at a time while making serious issues worst for people.
As someone who lived in TN during his reign, he'll be missed.  I thought he showed pro potential for sure.  Always was rooting for him.Hopefully Mariota doesn't get the same welcoming Mettenberger did.  
Pretty much nailed it. I like Pearl a lot but now that we're down to the last few girls and someone has to go every week, I'd put her (or Trixie)out next. I just think the other girls deserve it more based on performance to date. It doesn't mean I don't like them.

What does that have to do with what I said? Claiming that everyone is "easily capable of doing that" is patently false and unprovable. Stop with the sensationalist hyperbole.
then she should've just split it and bailed instead of trying to keep it all.. no, it's not a million, but half a mil should give you one helluva new start..
For real though. This is somewhat unrelated but now I am kind of on the other side of the situation because I am going into medicine and we study psychological diseases and whatnot. I have really come to appreciate how much they are BS'ing it half the time. I'll be shadowing and some girl comes in saying she's depressed. Doc will be like "hmmm have you ever tried *insert medicine here* before?" then she starts taking medicine for her depression... The dose is small and everything but for real it's basically all guesswork and the doctors just hope that it works.

Glad to hear your opinion, Indigo. Your comment on poor coping skills is rather on point. That'd be a good place to do some reflection, me-thinks. And you're definitely right about my yearning for psychiatric labels. I'd blame my curiosity on that; I can't stand to not know exactly what's going on. I know I know, I'm probably out of luck on that one with the inherent difficulty of psychology. As to what I've been diagnosed, I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, SAD, GAD, OCD, ADD, and hallucinations triggered by deep seizures. That's off the top of my head, but that's the general overview of my mental health diagnosis. One thing I do know, this whole talk is reassuring and will definitely spark discussion with my next psychiatric meeting.

Oh very nice! I'm happy to read a review like this. I actually have a B&amp;M authorized retailer about 10 mins away. So I'm super stoked to give them a try! Just rebuilt an RDA to go for the samples and come home with a winner! I usually do "special" or favorite juices on Fridays, so 1 day a week may make it the exact treat I'm hoping for. Thanks again!
Oh I know they are, I've been listening to Big Bang and their solo stuff for quite a few years now so Im not surprised at the experimental stuff at all, just this specific song isn't my style ^^ I don't mean any offense, taste is subjective!
That video makes me crack up every time I see it. Also, I agree. I've grown up in Canoga and it was bad a while back but has gotten a lot better (especially with the police station on Canoga/Roscoe). Canoga is not very different from Northridge, imo. There's rough spots throughout the Valley.
I haven't. But I'm a UI / UX designer who has worked in and around healthcare for over 10 years. PM me and tell me more specifics and I may be able to help give you some ideas. 
The fake journals were reprinting previously published studies and weren't included in Medline or other search databases. They'd have had basically no impact on medical research, I imagine they were promotional material given to doctors. There's no reason to take this as a sign that the research on vaccines is dodgy unless you're completely paranoid.It's still shitty but it's important to keep this in context - Elsevier produces a huge number of journals, some among the most reputable in their field, and by far the biggest knock against them is their subscription fee is too high.
Shipping a device that's known to catch fire and possibly explode thru the mail seems like an incredibly bad idea. Vendors should just credit everyone that bought it and get they money back from eleaf. What's the ramifications to an individual shipping the device back and it catching fire?

My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI.  It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into it (doctors, insurance, diet pushers).  In the same way, the Bechdel test is a simple way of looking at movies that in the aggregate but is too simple to draw any solid conclusions.  Such as:&gt;demonstrates inequality against women.From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.  Maybe an MRA would hold a stronger objection to the premise of the test, but I don't have any issue with it as originally formulated.  I think it can point out a way that we can change the film industry, but not really say much about the level of inequality unless you define inequality as failing the Bechdel test.
&gt; They sat there and claimed my door was open and when that didn't work they said they thought it was like an apartment complex where anyone could just go through the front door and then knock on apartment doors.One of them didn't go by the name "Nobby Nobbs" did he?
How great would it be if there was some unknown player who had a very similar name to a prospective first rounder that got accidentally selected because the team mispronounced the other guy's name?
I played a bit of Mortal Kombat X. I've been in training mode as Bojutsu Kung Jin, trying to perfect some combos. Played some Persona 4 Golden this week, got up to Kanji's dungeon.
It's one week of train up, one week of rigorous testing. Generally by the time you do the ruck you're pretty beat up from the week of studying and testing, so that adds a little bit of difficulty to the ruck. It's 12 miles in 3 hours which isn't difficult for anyone who is regularly rucking, but many of the officers in the medical field are doctors or nurses, so they likely haven't rucked much before. In fact, they're arguably closer to civillian than military. Again, the chances of this officer ever having to do a 12 mile ruck in real life are virtually zero, but she was able to do it (even if it was ugly in the home stretch) so she earned the EFMB. Congrats to her. 
When I was in 5th grade my teacher basically said I was stupid and "the apple doesn't fall far from the tree" insinuating my dental hygienist, RN, and very mouthy mother was also stupid. So because she flipped right the fuck out and because my grandparents both taught in the district for 50years (so they knew everyone). I got checked out.I had a college level understanding and ability in every subject except writing which was admittedly a 3rd grade level. My IQ was pegged at 165 and that year I scored top 1% on 3 different standardized tests. The discussion changed from whether I needed a tutor, to whether I should get moved to high school at age 10. Didn't end up happening though.So by the end of that year after I got my scores I walked into her class (because I'd changed teachers) and told her to go fuck herself. 
23, Male, Spain. I started watching it when the first Dungeon and Dragons aired because I heard about the show on some internet forum. Since then, I became obsessed with this TV show more than with any other AV thing. And that's pretty important to me because here in Spain I'm trying to get a degree on audiovisuals and work in something related with visuals, and audio, and stuff.
"when botlane was hard carrying" you might mean "when yellowstar was hard carrying". Rekkles did nothing and was way less better than he was supposed to.
I wasn't gloating, More just pissing off all the blind Mariota lovers. Defense wins super bowls, Its not worth throwing away our whole front 7 for one overrated QB.

Thank you. I also flaired your post with NSFW... If you post something similar in the future, you should be able to flair it yourself. Hopefully that will help prevent it from getting so many reports. Have a nice day!
Don't waste time dieting! Just waste time by stuffing your face, walking slow (until you invest in a scooty-puff), injecting insulin, taking 3x as long to bathe.....

An ellipsis is just three dots. Also try and not sound so pathetic. I don't care about tips. You clearly do and like to argue about tips on the Internet. That's cool I'm happy for you. I have better things to do though, I'm sorry. 
**Amiibo:** Pit   **Packaging:** Any   **In Box or Out of Box:** Any   **Reason:** Clearly because I need him to assist Dark Pit in gang-banging Palutena ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) , and also because I'm 34/35 right now.
I'm 99% sure it *is* a joke. At this point we're making fun of how he dresses, not looking at a set photo. And boy, does he give us a lot to make fun of or what?
Start running now.  Seriously. They'll probably give you a recruit handbook the first day.  Have that read entirely before you show up the second day.  Don't do anything unless you're told to.  You don't want the instructors to know your name any time soon.

Refurbishing and regenerating the base map would be quite the challenge for them. Then again, the two map expansions together is probably around two-thirds to about the same size of the base map.
700+1 was released last Thursday and this week is golden week so assuming the pattern is followed, which it probably will be, we'll receive 700+2 next Thursday which is 7 May.  Every Thursday after next Thursday will also have a chapter. I don't know what at what time 700+1 was released though.  I'm guessing really early in the morning, like 1 a.m. - 7 a.m.
I',m assuming that you've never heard of Simon Wiesenthal or the Simon Wiesenthal Center, responsible for tracking down more Nazi war criminals than any other entity you care to name.
Keep in mind that while she is a girl, she is also a human being.  Talk to her like she's a human being.  Girls really like it when you stop freaking out (OMG, a *girl*) and acknowledge that they're just normal human beings.  The boobs are incidental.
I was a class mom last year, the sub had come in for the day as the regular teacher broke her foot in the snow. I was volunteering in the classroom. The kids were not in the room yet and this woman said "I heard that this class was filled with a bunch of assholes." The kids were in first grade and really great, fun, kids. I said that nice to know how highly you think of my son and his classmates. I walked out of the room, went to the front office and shared what the substitute said. The kids never even met her. They escorted her off of school grounds before the kids arrived. One of the school administrators taught the kids for the day. 
Of course, if snipes are rarer, then farmers with crazy storage loot are gonna stay unshielded for longer, possibly resulting in better loot overall. Maybe especially with respect to DE.

Regardless of whether the viewers give a fuck about the charity or not, when they watch a GDQ they want interesting content.  The key word being interesting.
After my dozenth time dying due to this exact thing (usually switching to a fucking shotgun when I was trying to zoom in with an assault rifle) I just unbound the weapon switch from the mouse wheel.  I just use [q or tab, forgot which] now.
I disagree. We already know that ships needed for SQ42 are being developed first, and given that many of these are secret we won't hear about them. After that comes pledge ships prioritized by the number of pledges, size/complexity, or to test new mechanics in development.We are regularly told when ships enter and approach completion of  different stages of release (Concept, Hanger, Flight). I agree that a short section of ATV which gives this update is a good idea, so you don't have to search through RTV notes.I don't think reports on every ship being worked on at any time is a good idea, priorities change, teams working on ships can be prioritized for weeks to work on another ship which gets flagged as being required sooner, or for core gameplay systems/releases. It would just cause crying is the forums about why X ship I pledged for is 'delayed'.
i've never seen such irrelevant opinions of fiqh, even when comparing to opinions of people who aren't even muslim... What started out as a curiosity in what my ideologic enemies state, turned into a 'what the heck am i reading' and ended up with me disgusted, wondering how any of my Muslim brethren can believe any of this trash. That was bad religion even by salafi standard... nice picture of the tigris though
If it's under 600 dollars total for the year I don't think it's illicit (don't have to report it to the irs). But my actual advice is to find a local coin star and do it in person and pay for groceries with it (they are mostly in those stores anyway) then just send a buck to night attack via paypal each week. It's simple and relatively friction free.
Or because a close friend of his stole a car that happened to have a dead girl in the trunk.There is never only one answer for any situation in this case.But just to feed into your frenzy for a minute. Something came up for Hae, we don't know what, or where, but she was in a hurry after school. She left, not to get her cousin, 2:20-2:30. So, that alone shows that you can't prove Jay wasn't near Hae. Jay did know Hae, they went to the same school, hung out with the same people, played on the lacrosse team together. To say that they didn't know each other when there is a very large probability that they did, is just silly.
Lynn Ahhh yes, her girls just awful. It's so hard to parent too. Im torn to think kids are your reflection all the time but the bucks gotta stop some where. Gretchen giving parenting advice bc she took a college class, laughable.  
Well it isn't foolproof, I have same problem.  Especially times when I'm really scatterbrained, it doesn't work at all.  But it is kinda neat when it does work lol
Akuma is now rescuing the triforce from Ganondorf. I think Akuma could defeat Ganon if he actually cared enough. Just drop from the sky on to the castle into Ganondorfs main chambers and rip his soul from his asshole. Might not be that easy at all but I still feel like akuma would win 7/10 times
This is exactly how XMod will adapt.Clans will add a few fairly low level accounts for revealing traps and CC that way higher level attackers can sandbox knowing where the traps are. XMod will add a feature allowing them to manually input the traps and CC discovered by a clanmate.
The money will come from summer jobs, my savings, and my parents.It won't be 3k if there are three people in the apartment, and I have friends who are students and pay 3k/month. The dorm isn't desirable and I have lived in it for two years. People are loud and there is not enough personal space.  
My teacher repeatedly called an asian kid in my class a communist just because he was asian, called a boy a rodent because he was walking around funny and made rude racist and sexist jokes about kids she wanted to pick on. "Jeff, you're never going to get anywhere in life." "Bob, how do your parents deal with you? " 
well that's 20 minutes I'm not getting back. Honestly this is just about negligent discharges. if you always follow the 4 rules almost all of these would be avoided. the last one of not leaving guns out for kids should be obvious.

To be completely honest, I think that may have been a lot of the reason Ray left. They play so much stuff and are expected to be hilarious in everything they do, and I can see how that can burn someone out. That's like waking someone up in the middle of the night, shoving a mic in their face and telling them to make a video that'll have a million views.I'm with you about the GTA IV LP's. I've watched all the cops and crooks episodes at least 4 times each. 
I've been thinking about starting a web comic.  What does this mean to remove the hosting?  Would they just remove the image or is it something more?  Sorry for my ignorance.
My school counsellor (not a psychologist or psychiatrist, just a teacher with the title 'counsellor') told me in grade 6 that I have anger issues and ADHD, and suggested to my parents that I should be put on medication.This was after a single incident where I lashed out violently at a classmate who had been brutally physically bullying me for over a year. He was never punished. I had no history or violence before this and academically I was doing great. My parents called the counsellor an idiot.
Glad it was useful guys.That's a whole bunch of stuff to keep track of Charles!My instinct is always to keep things simple by sing as few tools as possible.  Oftentimes I feel like the more tools I have the more I forget them, and I just keep them around as a security blanket of sorts.  But that's just my personality.  Working with a team, I need to be more flexible and try to figure out what works best for everyone.Working on paper or just working unconnected to the internet has definitely boosted my productivity.  I have a Surface that I work on once a week.  It's exhausting, but I usually get one and a half day's work done just because there are no internet distractions like Reddit. :P
Ah, the cherry picking.&gt;"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

This update has shown me that Hussie is not only hilarious, he has a style of writing that is utterly beautiful in some weirdly fucked up way that is such a goddamn treat to read.
Definitely junk food gotta go grocery shopping and use coupons. apply for help from the state, get food stamps. Its always the junk food that costs the most. The average wages life sucks ass and has plenty of paperwork to stay comfortable.
1. I understand that you are a full RN and spent 6 years in the various departments but what allowed you to start travel nursing? 2. Did you apply or get headhunted? 3. Have you been away the whole year or do you get to go back home occasionally? 4. Do you ever fly with patients home or is it just driving? 5. Is it done solo or do you have a partner to assist you with the patient or client? 6. Would you possibly explain some of the duties you attend to with your patients?7. How did you find out about it in the first place? Thanks for allowing me to ask these questions. I am a Unit Clerk and I have been able to speak to one travel nurse for a brief amount of time. Your job sounds very amazing and rewarding. Edit: After reading your other comments. I realize you have already answered some of these questions but I will leave my comment as is. 
he probably didn't want a bunch of idiotic fanboys spamming his ask.fm, asking if the rumors were true.  I would probably do the same exact thing in his position
This would be handy if I wanted to try these masks and didn't have any AB hauls planned. Spend the $$ up front for a single package, see if I like it, then buy in bulk from somewhere with a better price.I could also see the instant gratification aspect being useful to some people; until about a week ago, I'd have been one of them. But I had a moderately-sized sheet mask haul come in, and there's more on the way, so I don't think I am in any danger of running out and needing them Right Now.
Lives are more important than property.  Businesses are generally insured and can rebuild, but you can't bring back a life.  Even if police only tried to target looters engaged in egregious activities, avoiding escalation and death/injury to innocent bystanders and peaceful protesters would be difficult in an urban setting.
I have a white exclamation mark inside a red box next to "MSE &amp; WebM VP9" in that link.  No idea what that does/what it's for.  Videos seem to play fine, though.Just wish I could alt-tab to firefox with HTML5.  :/  I miss having a full screen video in the background and alt-tabbing to check reddit/e-mail/read a chapter of a light novel or whatever.
So they do the broadcast for each day of the draft right? And doesn't the draft take four days because they have so many rounds? Seems a bit extravagant doesn't it?
Antetokounmpo apologist here: Doesn't it come with the territory? You gotta expect that somebody might retaliate like this. Especially if he's 20 years old and you're up by 30. Not saying that it was smart or a cool thing to do, but you can't instigate and not expect people to get pissed.
Yes, it was made in the spirit of the Irene Adler Ringtone from BBCs Sherlock. So, just for text messages and the like. I guess I could have added a few seconds at the end, to make it loop more nicely.
If we don't see all 3 eldrazi titans on Zendikar, perhaps the one(s) that aren't on the plane, could go there, due to the mana, and they could finish the eldrazi off once and for all their.
So, to have a chance to witness those endearing messages you say, you can wait and see for a few more time in this subject (shhh xD) I've already done my part :P
I'll have to get back to you after I read those but I think I'm considering the justice system to be part of the same system as the police, which maybe needs to be examined further.
You know,  there's something to this. I made this exact observation years ago.  My 1st week of my 1st semester (out of three, but that's another story) at BYU, I was actually amazed at how beautiful the BYU girls were and that their skin was absolutely flawless.My 3rd week of my 1st semester (yup, that new car smell was wearing off) at BYU, I finally realized that the BYU girls were putting their make-up on with a fucking trowel.I should have quit school and dove head-first into the Mary Kay pyramid scheme, with a little Avon on the side...

I am fairly inexperienced with turning as well. I invested in a wolverine system and I am pretty happy with how sharp my tools are. I am less happy with how terrible I am. It is still fun and I will keep at it.
When our SS screws up, our fans cheer him his next time up (there were boos, but there were more cheers).When the Mets SS crews up, they boo him out of the building.
I am aware of and agree with all the phenomena you mention.  I'm arguing that, for any hallucinogen or anesthetic that isn't a prodrug, if you use slow infusions (or other methods) to achieve equivalent concentrations blood concentrations in nonhumans and humans, then you'll get almost equivalent brain concentrations, almost equivalent binding, and almost equivalent effects.  Do you disagree that this is the case for ketamine, LSD, DOM, etc?   
To use the same anime, I think better examples of my perspective are [Fate/Zero](/s "Tokiomi \(fuck that guy\) and Kariya \(so sad...\).")  Both received about the same level of development.  Even though it was obvious (even without reading / watching *F/SN* first) that both had to die, the latter was presented to the audience in a more sympathetic light, therefore his death had more meaning.
Based on what is in their store, as well as reading the live letters, the all-in-one package is different from the others.  If you look at the store, even the digital download of the all-in-one package doesn't list Early Access as one of the preorder perks, whereas the other ones do.  And like I said, I distinctly remember it being mentioned in a live letter.  The official forums translation only kind of implies it, it isn't stated outright, but I remember the big kerfuffle when it was said.

A twelve part HBO series would've been interesting, but HBO doesn't like to go into expensive, effects-laden shows like that unless they could get multiple seasons out of it.  With Forever Peace being a non-sequel, I'm not sure if that's possible.
Looking back now it kinda looks like a spoiler but Heenan always thought Hogan was a cunt and no one really believed him about anything he said about Hogan
I have loved ALL of Grant Kirkhope's music. Goldeneye, Donkey Kong 64, and Banjo all had memorable soundtracks. I'm so glad he is a part of Yooka-Laylee. 
Dude this is hilarious. I know it sucks now, but you have a story to tell for years. Scan all these stupid bureaucratic documents and police work they make you comply with, screen shot the emails, and post them on TIFU for the world to laugh with you when you change schools.Seriously, for rollerblades. My sides.
Wizards tried doing the nostalgia trip twice already, first with Time Spiral, then with Coldsnap.  Neither one sold very well, so I think they'd be very hesitant to try tapping that well again.  Also, like I said before, Dominaria is a huge place.  If you want to tell any kind of focused story, you'll need to pick just one location and deal with what's going on there, and that's going to leave some old fans dissatisfied because why didn't they go to *my* favorite sub-continent?Wait, I think I've got it: Dominaria is to Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar, Innistrad, and Mirrodin, as Urza is to Elspeth, Jace, Nissa, Sorin, and Koth.  The former are gigantic, with extensive histories that, as a new player, feel almost impenetrable.  The later are smaller, but more relatable and have stories that are much easier to digest for six months before we move on to something else.

Not too much protein. Lots and lots of water. Then more water. And carbs.  You need carbs to charge your muscles, protein is best in the first hour after you finish. Dry clothes!Expect the course to be in worse shape the second day after 10,000 mudders tear it up the first day. 
Tamers kind of goes into the consequences of the awareness of shape-shifting creatures from another dimension. There's no way that there wouldn't be governments trying to get their hands on digimon for experiments or used as living weapons of mass destruction.Really, your best-case scenario would be to get someone like Gatomon as a partner, who would probably pass for a regular cat (albeit with unnatural markings, though you could just say it's hair dye). On the plus side, her evolution is an extremely human-looking creature, so you could pass her off as your hot cosplayer friend.
ya nothing like learning some physical chemistry, i ofcourse further researched and i see how that holds true. though if the mod had some sort of capacitor/inductor system at the base it would allow for the metal in the coil not to matter since it would put out a constant it would delay the recalibration of the mod... but that would ofcourse make things clunky.
Yes! I have wanted Mariota for a long time. This team, like all other teams in the NFL, can only be successful if we have a good quarterback. I don't know if Mariota is a franchise guy, but he might be. I am excited about this new era.

Hoarding is a real mental disease.  Getting the city involved to force them to clean up would be a start but they are in need of counseling as well.  Calling in the city would definitely be helping them for their own health and safety whether they like it or not. 
So even if its by accident that the company hinted towards this, it's still rape culture? Does not thinking how something connect to rape 24/7 make you a rape sympathizer? I'm not picking up what your putting down here. Also, I'm not at all saying that the ad doesn't show rape culture IF its on purpose, but I highly doubt it is and all twitter's outrage proved to me is that people are not accepting of these kinds of ads and no company in their right minds would put this out because they would be ostracizing a significant amount of consumers (and that means less cash money).I could also be way off the mark with what you are trying to say as your comment is fairly hard to understand. I would really like it if you could tell me what you mean like I'm 5 or, if I understood what you meant, would care to elaborate.

if you abort a mission you will still get xp without bonus xp. I kinda like the prisma gorgon look and firing sound, but there's nothing amazing about his stats. It's viable, but if you don't want to keep weapons just because they are cool / rare, I would advise selling it.
&gt; LIKE LITERALLY DONT SAY THINGS YOU DONT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR.&gt; EVEN IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE (I DONT THINK IT IS). IF IT WAS TRUE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE JOE ROGAN JOKING BECAUSE HE IS A FUCKING COMEDIAN. GET IT?!??!?! HE MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH, SO IT WAS A JOKE SO YOU CANT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.LOL It was a joke was it like when he told that woman to fly to Peru to take ayahuasca despite never taking or going to Peru himself.
There are studies that say I have to accept people no matter how fucked up they are? No, I don't think such a study exists.You can go off and fantasize about little ponies and becoming a sexual tomato all you want, I just won't approve of it.The fact that you think 'family values' are bullshit probably confirms you're a teenager with divorced parents.. and your ignorance of world affairs, and attitude towards people reflects your subsequent lack of respect due to said lack of values.
I do some of my own repairs but sometimes the time it takes and life gets in the way, the $80 is so freaking worth it to have to back better than new :)
Alot of pessimism already. I'm excited. last year the titans made a pick in the first round i didn't like but they proved me wrong. im hoping they can repeat again.
The reason I mention the Zelda song is because the Irish-esque style fits really well on dulcimer. I can play it in a basic form, and even that sounds really cool.
I always have to mention that this happened at Utah State University while I was attending. I didn't see the accident but have a few friends who did. Motorcycle hit a car, guy went under the car, car lit on fire. Weird series of events.[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHS3GL7Ynz8)
Hey, whose current  platform calls for legalization and decriminalization? Who has their idiot health minister babbling about the children when asked about the proven medicinal properties?So yeah, 100 years ago, today, let's talk about today.
I took it as he isn't gay "now" but that he always was. So John asking if he's gay now is wrong because he didn't turn gay. He pretty much says this flat out in the convo. He was insecure about it and trying to bury it.
Well they can't go back and call it after it happened. The Giannis play was blatant and everyone saw it. There wasn't even a foul called for MCW so they obviously didn't see it and didn't have a chance to review.
Origins sucked BALLS...                 What is worst is games you can not pause at any time.               You are in the middle of a huge story dump or cutscene and you want to pause... Every button you press skips forward or cancels outof conversations...          EVERY GAME NEEDS A PAUSE FUNCTION!
When it comes to officers we are a mile wide and an inch deep in knowledge. They navy will teach you everything you need to learn, but having a STEM background sure as hell helps. As far as height goes my classmate as 6'10'' subnuke another was 5'1'' so if you want it go get it.If you want looking to be an officer your first job is to lead sailors, your second job is whatever your designation is. Think about that before going for officer.If you like International relations, check out a [Foreign Affairs Officer!](http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/restricted/Pages/foreignareaofficer.aspx) though it would be later on down the road.You will miss your family but the people you work with make a new family and even when they leave to go on a DEP. When you see them X years later it was like nothing was missed :)
I went to go get fitted for a pack last year and was actually in a similar situation at REI. The salesperson kept giving me giant packs (at least to me) to try on, and my dad sort of had the bigger is better mindset as well. I ended up leaving the store with nothing and coming back a few days later with more knowledge of what I actually wanted. I ended up with a Deuter ACT-lite 40+10 which has been working pretty well for me so far. It's insane how tricky gear shopping can be sometimes, especially with parents who aren't as interested in it.
EUIV has a pretty steep learning curve. I got into Paradox games through Crusader Kings II, and I think that's probably an easier introduction to Paradox.
Mr. Unicorn had to pick me up from work and drop me off in the morning. Did the same last week. I nearly didn't go last week, good thing since I won an Ovechkin signed stick.

I use Gold Bond's friction defense (on my nipples, inner leg, feet and heels, and on any other parts that seem like they may get rubbed).  Use liberally, more if raining!
I never hated the guy. He's ok. His matches on the last few PPVs have been entertaining, and that's really all I ask for. He doesn't have to put on a wrestling clinic; just be entertaining and put on a good performance which he's done. He's improving on the mic, definitely getting more comfortable. But there is one thing that really bugs me about him: cocking the fist is corny as hell. I don't mind him raising his fist then punching the ground. I fell like that's enough to signal to the crowd what's coming. The fist cock is just stupid. The fact that I have to talk about a fist cocking at all kind of pisses me off.
they dont have a fosher to beat anymore after last torney, gaem is boring now cuz they win every scrim, similar story with fosher cuz no one would scrim them cuz tembest hid strats for big torney and nemesis dedded and lg dedded too
Honestly it's up to the clerk and/management. I give the basic discounts out at my store, senior citizens, military,  and student, as well as having a special with wine on a certain day of the week. I'll give random discounts out depending on my mood, like if a hot lady walks in and I'm chatting it up with her, or if I'm in a bad mood and someone makes me smile. Hell, I gave a discount to some people just because they were born in the same year I was, lol. High dollar bottles I'll haggle with you somewhat,  but I'm still going to get money on it,  other products the price is as is, no ifs,  ands, or buts, or I'll just kick you out or raise the price if you keep pushing the issue. Remember, these people are small business owners,  and every dollar and penny counts to us/them, so if you want that $ 18 750ml bottle of vodka but only have 10, either down grade or don't bother buying it,  because if you can't afford what you want, then budget better, or plain and simply you don't need it.
Yeah, it isn't a choice, and sometimes it'd be nice if it was - I have a few male friends that it would be so *easy* to be in a relationship if we were attracted to one another - but we aren't. It's as simple as that. Doesn't make instances of unrequited love hurt any less, but that's just how it is.

Nice approach.I'd also consider training time multipliers for logged in players, like the vitality system used for Lineage 2 where players starts with 3x XP modifier (or something like that) and that amount decreases along his session, reaching a point where he must log off or be inactive in a neutral area for several hours before reaching max boost again.It wouldn't prevent people from learning offline at 1x, but would benefit those who actually 'play' the game.

Just for the record, he can still be traded, like Kip said, its just unlikely.It makes more sense to take him and then trade him after discussing instead of rushing it in in the allotted 10 minutes.

It does for me. The second time I dropped gave me the most memorable dreams. I dreamed very vividly, and there were lots of things swirling in my dreams.

You just gave me this theory. 5 years from now every time Winston and Wilson play they will say "he used to play baseball guys!" Instead of the basketball bs we hear 7 times during every chargers game. 
The same thing happened to the one on my 125 over the winter. It should be fine if you tied it around the bike in strong winds, but that's just extra hassle every time you want to ride.I'll probably be buying the Stormex next time.
Well, I did a session once when I was 15 and once when I was 18 with two different therapists, but once I was there I was too anxious to admit to anything and never went back.I had a consultation at a different place the other day, and a counselor talked to me. They asked if I had a plan, and it doesn't seem like you can have suicidal ideations without there being some method.My selfharm isn't necessarily life threatening (bruises mostly), and it's not with the intention of suicide when I do that. I'm just afraid to talk about it with someone who doesn't selfharm because they may not understand that.
That's actually kind of cool. I wish more providers would do this.They get to protect themselves from people dicking around with phones, and no one necessarily needs to find out a workaround for that model.
You make a good point, however the hunt doesn't end because some hunter is killed by Gehrman. The hunt ends because the source of the scourge is wiped out. That is what we end up accomplishing by killing Mergo's Wet Nurse and stopping the Mensis ritual from beckoning the red moon. Obviously none of this has been accomplished before because the Mensis ritual and Merog's Wet nurse are still around by the time we show up. This leads me to believe that the first hunt has never ended. Djura and Eileen must have failed to accomplish this goal, or for some reason been released from the dream prematurely.Of course this is all speculation and not absolute fact
What's the source for that metric? Because it's neither borne out by the exchanges in this thread, nor is this thread a relevant sample relative to the Big Bang threads you're disturbed by (gee yes, happy people - very disturbing), much less the 34k subscribers to the subreddit.Your response marks you as trying to prove a point, which makes phrasing it in the form of a question disingenuous. You're not in pursuit of understanding, your beef is to comment.So you're that person now. You walked into a assembly of happy people and are trying to convince them they're stupid for being happy. That's you. What's more disturbing *really*, spazzing out about a well-shot music video or the fact that you went for that energy expense?
those are [made in the USA, Levi's 501xx's!](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=50798016) I'm actually enjoying them but the denim is much more slick (vs slubby) than the wonderfully textured Samurais.

I've never been involved in any for of rape and girls have called the cops twice to report me. In both instances they were proven to be completely  full of shit and nothing happened to them. You saying it doesn't matter is exactly what's wrong 
Because it seems feminists are not pleased in general until women are the majority in an area.  For example college enrollment.  Most feminists don't think there being 60% enrollment of women in college is an issue at all, many actually think its a good thing and should remain such and some won't mind it go higher.

I don't know how many times I have to fucking say it: inequality isn't inherently bad! Can you wrap your head around that? In equality is much higher in the US than it is in Australia... but, on average, who does better? Their median wage or ours? Their cost of living or ours? Guess who wins. 1 guess. "Oh, but they have a higher minimum wage and lower inequality." Yeah, and the average person is doing much better here than there. If you want to aspire to be Ecuador, I'm not confident I can have an intelligent conversation with you. Yay for them.... we are much better off than them precisely because we haven't been implementing their policies.
I'd love to see what he managed to put in his Roth 401k accounts... In theory if you had some sort of hypothetical shell account that had post tax money in it, and then you had the same sort of multiplicative effect 200-300x earnings as his regular 401k, you'd be in the tax free billionaires club at retirement, all probably perfectly "legal", though not ethical. It would make off shore accounting look like chump change.

This would seriously be the greatest plot twist they could come up with. The entire time we think Waltz is the leader and Batista is a henchman, Waltz carries a white cat starting about half way through the movie, once he's an established villain. Eventually, Bond kills Waltz and we think "what the fuck?! That's it?" then the cat trots over to Batista, standing with a dozen henchmen.
Meh, everyone survived before when the total rate was nearly 20% (prior to 1997) and when it was 15% after HST was introduced, up until the GST reduction in 2008.Sales taxes are good taxes - and the negative impacts can be offset by giving lower-income people (such as the seniors everyone seems worried about) grants to off-set their tax burden.Since the province brought in nearly $1 billion from its portion of the HST last year, the increase from 8% to 10% should net it another $225-$230 million or so (after roughly accounting for a possible decrease in spending). Not a bad chunk of change.

More frequent injections will give you more stable blood levels, lower spikes and should keep E2 from spiking as much as with weekly injections. AI dosages are individual dependent. Bloods are the best way to dial them in. If you are planning to take a preventive dosage you can search to find most common protocols. 
I think he's worth about 4 mil. This kid got 28 goals on his sophomore slump, you can't argue with that. Nyquist may not be the next Zetterberg, but he's a great player. Trading him would be stupid, unless we get another young stud.

Minny. They're another team that I feel has some great fans who's heart and soul is in the game - seeing the cup won by them would be amazing.Also, they really deserve it. They've been building for a long while, and they're finally at the point where they have a really good chance. They've worked hard to get where they are.
I'm so fucking relieved. It would have been neat to see Mariota but with the trade rumors circulating there was no way we make a trade that favors us in the long run unless Mariota is the 2nd coming of Jesus.

Keep in mind nearly all open micers are at the bottom of the barrel in terms of income/opportunity and bottom of the barrel in terms of looks. Many open micers feel the only way to escape their/our/my lives at the bottom of the heap is through standup. But, we're not all going to make it. In fact, almost none of us are. Thus, douchery.An old bitter comic explained it to me like this:  no one you know is gonna make it, and even if they do make it, they're not gonna want to help you, and even if they do want to help you, they're probably not going to be able to before you quit comedy or become/stay so terrible you're beyond all help.He's probably not wrong, sadly.

Just adding this in - there's also the South Island Distance Education School (SIDES) for online courses. I took some online in grade 12 (including physics) to be able to balance school with volunteering initiatives that were going on, and had no problem getting those high school credits for uni. Not sure about that 19 or under policy, but they have a pretty clear website if you want to check.

I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not honestly sure how you're connecting this to my point. What does the question of whether or not the industry is giving women what they want have to do with how the Bechdel test illustrates a clear imbalance in media that cannot be attributed to the Bechdel test's emphasis on dialog? 
It still shocks me that it's not seen as weird to say this. To be talking about a living creature's intelligence and how sweet and cute it is and then talking about eating it. It's just so strange. Like if somebody was talking about an infant and you said that it would either be looked at as satire or you'd just look fucking nuts.. And most likely it's the latter. 
I feel deeply uncomfortable expressing any kind of spiritual certainty. It's difficult to explain my feelings, but they are very strong, and they are reinforced by the disgust I feel with myself for having ever believed any of Mormonism's claims.

And like that's fine. I don't exactly agree with the "Let's suffocate the rioters" stance but I certainly think anyone who thought this thing with the pizza shop owner was a good idea were out of their mind.My objection was only to giving "most" of the rioters a unified reason for rioting. I admit that this might not be the best time to make such objections as that's minor compared to the terrible situation in baltimore. Perhaps I should have thought it out more before responding
Most of my engagements in pistols rounds go something like, person jumps around a corner then starts spamming A D A D A D and crouches occasionally, making it impossible for me to hit. Generally happens when they have a glock, but it is no more difficult with a USP or P2000. Running accuracy is a joke. I understand to a certain extent the glocks being more accurate while moving than the CT pistols, but in their current state, pistols (default and others) are incredibly luck based and unbalanced.TLDR: Make standing still and tapping with pistols more rewarding. Decrease movement accuracy of all pistols. Only pistol that can 1-hit head armor should be deagle.

I completely agree. I can't stand to see people and their self-entitled rants, which to me, sound like they go a little something like this:"You mean they updated the game and now i have to pay attention and play it, like I used to? THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!!! I won't stand for it. Someone get me my bottle and safety blanket while I throw my temper tantrum!"I mean, seriously, you vote a game 1 star because 1 thing changed? How is this such a big deal in your life, that you set out to ruin a company? You have to play a game that you originally liked before you had this thing? Big deal. Get over yourselves and live with it. Don't like the change? Ok, no big deal. Give some feedback and let them know. But to try to ruin a company who has been bending over backwards to better their FREE game? Shame on you.Downvote me if you want, but everything I said is true.
Nothing you cant already do with good management of TP scrolls/BoT + your TP skill. Boots&gt;Midas&gt;mael&gt;Blink&gt;Mjol&gt;BoT if you wanna splitpush like hell. This way, you can rat and not let your teamfight capabilities suffer mid-game.He has a 20 second TP so I really dont think 5 second reduction is gonna matter, even more so because we're talking 6k worth of an item here. It's gonna be nice to have at some point, sure, but only if you get cheaper and more effective items first.
I look at it this way:If you're shooting at a wanted criminal and a civilian jumps in the way and gets hit, that's accidental.If you're aiming at a civilian and forget that your holding a gun in stead of a camera, that's *not* accidental.It's also worth noting that you can't assume someone is wanted under any circumstances. Even if the system authority are shooting at them, you cannot assume they are wanted. They may simply have a hostile reputation with the local faction so that they get attacked even though they aren't wanted.Wait until you can confirm their wanted status before firing.This change will force people to have a little more weapon discipline, but that's fine since people absolutely should have that weapon discipline anyway.
Github is a project management platform built around git. First, try to start using git. It's a version control system. You make some changes, describe those changes, share those changes. Until you get comfortable with that you're not going to get much out of github. If you've got code other people will want to use, its not a bad place to put it.Most employers are not going to look through your github with a monocle. They might take a glance, but very few will deny you a chance based on that alone.My githib activity is huge, but unfortunely 99% of it is private repos for companies I've worked at, and that data isn't shared even on github with anyone else.
You mean the Trimmed Comp req? I blame Castle Wars for that one... seeing how Chris L asked for suggestions on the HLF and Castle Wars suggested the arbitrary 5k req since he was the only person in-game who had that done already.
Economics is what you need. Either that or Finance/Accounting. Everyone who starts a business lives or dies because of how they handle their money.  Having said that, even if you don't end up starting anything or even if you fail, you have a legit degree to fall back on.

Erm, that woman is crazy and is "addicted to being outraged", but let's not join two disparate groups.I don't have any allergies, but damn straight I want to know *exactly* what's in my food. It's *my* body and I reserve the right to know what I'm putting in it. I also don't trust food companies in the slightest.

Their example was a bad one of the Oxford comma ruining a sentence, as it wasn't any worse writing than any other way of ordering the statement. 2 of the 3 examples in OP's pic are also bad examples of not using the comma. The functional rule when making a list like that would be to use any plurals at the end of the sentence."Among those interviewed were Kris Kristofferson, Robert Duvall and Merle Haggard's two ex-wives.""This book is dedicated to God, Ayn Rand and my parents."Personally i think the 'lazy' way to write is to use the Oxford comma primarily, because you don't have to worry about what order your list is in and can just write as the ideas come along. Not using it and still having functional grammar requires more thought or editing.That said, I use the Oxford more often than not. In data sets, you really should always separate out individual items via comma.

People get irrationally aggressive when you bring it up too.

I would have been wandering Home Depot for a long time if I hadn't asked my mom. HD also has Rainbird products, but they were significantly more expensive than the DIG brand. The starter kits are definitely convenient, but I would buy piece by piece if I were to outfit my entire garden with the system, of course. So much more customization options!

Honestly, vegan food has no calories. I'm cutting and I sometimes struggle to reach my 2000 calories a day.Smoothies are my only source of dark leafy greens, though. I can't stand eating them so drinking them is the only option.You don't have to enjoy smoothies to gulp them down. Most of the time I just do spinach + berries + some flax seeds, but thats all low calorie stuff.Oats, peanut butter/nuts, bananas and lots of plant milk might work and can easily get you 800+ calories. Maybe even add some protein powder.
Don't bother trying to argue or reason with anyone here. They're all too busy having a circle jerk and masturbating each other with tears that they don't really give a shit what anyone says, they just want to be SJWs.
i  made a few 300 dollar deposits before finally running hot in the pre black friday days at the 3/6 table then the 10/20. Ran 300 up to 5400 and cashed out never to play online again... i was playing with my entire roll the whole time... and had AK vs AK in a 5400 dollar pot where my flush came.... LOL Then i started playing live a lot... lost 6 buyins at 2 5 nlhe before becoming a break even live player.... then discovered MTTs ... finally hit a few final tables and got my MTT strategy down... now i play cash recreationally but try to fit in as many live MTTs as I can when the majors come to town.
And what did u make your account for? too post up how to add me. CLASSY but anyone older the age of 2 years old would already know the information you posted on this HOW TO ADD SOMEONE ON DOTA. At least i talk with my mind while all u do is post nonsense and useless information on reddit congrats get a life. CLASSY and by the way i made a account to defend myself on this post which i have more then the right too UR ON HERE WHY TO TALK ABOUT ME COOL DUDE. FUCKING LOSER LMFAO REKT.
Invite them to join a steam group, my favorite are:[Get Off Mcdonalds Wifi](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GetOffMcdonaldsWifi)[Mad Because You Lost](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MBYL)[Did your gank just get spanked?](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dygjgs)
Mustard is probably ground.That said, without the ratios or process, good luck. Who knows what they're doing to their ingredients to bring out the flavor profiles they achieve. Cooking is as much science as art - give 20 experienced sauce makers this list of ingredients and you'll get 20 totally different sauces. 
Why in the world would you jump to that conclusion? Fidgeting is not being mentally unstable.  Those are different though not mutually exclusive, and you yourself said you aren't a professional.  I don't think we need to assume his friend is mentally unstable in any way that would require help from professionals based on the info that was provided.  
Yeah sure thing. Here is a [guide I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/31vuuw/the_ultimate_way_to_fix_jailbreak_issues_ft/) about using iCleaner Pro to disable tweaks. Follow the guide carefully and read it since it has some important information. I hope the guide is helpful. It has screenshots also :)
Both aren't really super offensive picks in the lane phase. Leona is incredibly passive until she can get a lead off a misposition, gank, roam while Thresh is basically Janna with pick potential + stronger punish in lane. Thresh is a far better trading champ and has a lot more room to play aggro in lane though, and in general is the end all of the support role rn.If you like aggro supports you probably want to pick up something like Sona Lulu Nami who basically aim to fight the entire lane phase and win off superior trading + without hard committing to a fight.
People who won't have it any other way. They don't take into consideration other views of things and downvote you to invisible when you have different views. Yet they have nothing to support their claims at all. 
Glennon won't start. You don't sit the number 1 pick. And you don't take the pro ready QB over the project QB unless you plan on starting them right away. 
The scientific method is rolling in its grave.Also, the word "prove" is in the first sentence, which is a pretty good indication right off the bat that the author of this article doesn't have a fucking clue.And then...sixty percent?  That's their best evidence?  Maybe it's just because Mormons have a reputation for being dorky and people associate that with pasty skin.  I wonder how many of the photos they looked at were of black people.
It's not strange in the context of professional sports. If the NFL allowed a team to, say, draft and trade players in between winning the AFC conference and the super bowl, and a perceived slot upgrade opened up, they would. 
well, it might sound very queer. but it's kinda just sad if what it comes down to was that opie thought he had found a best friend when he met ant and it just kind of dissolved over the years until he's just someone you know.but this happens all the time. a friendship starts strong and dissolves. i don't know how he couldn't get his head around that and not let it get to him.it's easy enough to work through that when you have two people on the same page and don't let anything get personal. but when one person is very clingy and needs validation all the time, it's a fucking disaster that is waiting to blow up.
Asian parents tend to see their kids as a retirement plan which I think is pretty messed up. The whole collectivist culture/filial piety doesn't help either.Not to mention, the cycle of abuse and violence in each generation.
Florida's public records laws are almost freakily transparent.  Florida's public records laws also require extraordinarily easy access to public records, the process is very frictionless for a reporter.  Even am email from a school teacher can be requested, and it will be provided upon request.  No reasoning, just request it.  A government employee's email is always sent with a disclaimer that reads like this: **[Florida has a very broad Public Records Law. Virtually all written communications to or from School District Personnel are public records available to the public and media upon request. E-mail sent or received on the School District system will be considered public and will only be withheld from disclosure if deemed confidential pursuant to State Law.]**Another reason we see so many stories about Florida, is Florida is now the 3rd most populous state in the nation.  More people, more shitty behavior. 
I would totally crossplay, but my problem isn't lack of bravery, it's lack of a convention to attend. One day I might make a long trip with the purpose of attending a convention.
This is the top six. You get eliminated because you messed up. You have no filler queens to lay back on. Hell, Latrice was *reamed* for having a visible bra strap.
&gt; ala PokemonFrom what we've been hearing from the developers it seems more like a Oracle of Ages/Seasons type of deal. Two games that come out at the same time with different stories and emphasize different aspects of Zelda gameplay (Ages focuses on Puzzles; Seasons on Combat/ Hoshido on Awakening conveniences; Nohr on more varied map objectives, limited/no grinding, etc.). 
What's your relationship with your grandmother like?50 years ago multi-generational living was the norm, and still is in much of the world outside the US.  I think its one of the reasons having kids didn't seem like such a burden to our parents and grandparents.  Embrace it maybe?
At this point I'm just wondering where her talents lie. She can't act, dance, sing, isn't particularly funny, her runway walks are always the same and the last lipsync (in which she did exactly the same movements as in her first one) was a bit too boring for my taste. Her look is flawless and her fashion sense is current and cool as hell but does that grant her stay? I just can't help but wonder if we are not majorly missing out not having another queen there in Pearls place that would show us a little more. Idk don't hate me it's just how I feel about her at this point but who knows maybe she turns it out the next few challenges.
Ok.  So what if Tenn wants Bradford, but they are not sure that the player(s) they are targeting will be there when the Eagles pick.  So they select Mariota, who they are ok with, but wait to see if the Eagles will blow them away with an offer later - if one of the players they want is available when the Eagles are slated to pick.Off the mark?
I can't tell if you're saying you actually drive better when your high, or if you're providing a relevant example ^^^^I ^^^^drive ^^^^pretty ^^^^well ^^^^high
In general, there is "ger" and "ger toshav". "ger toshav" I think means a gentile who lives by the noahide laws and resides in israel. Though this particular commandment might apply to both; someone else can clarify.
CNN is shitty too, but the mistakes they make are less obvious than Fox news. Like one I remember in particular, they were reporting a story leading up to the Beijing Olympics and it was about Chinese police beating protesters, yet the picture clearly showed that the officer was:1) Not Chinese as he was very dark skinned.2) Not wearing a Chinese police uniform (it had some other language on the badge)Turns out the police was Nepalese, but most Americans won't catch that if they just look at the news. Whereas Bill O'Reilly exclaiming that we don't know how the tide works is clearly bullshit to anyone with half a brain.So yes, CNN also misinforms, but it's usually less obvious than Fox. And I don't really think it has a liberal bias, if you want to see liberal bias look at MSNBC, and even they're not as bad as Fox. Mostly American TV news is shit, the only news source I really trust in the U.S in NPR.
You obviously have strong affection for ESO, but if you feel so wronged by the game/Zenimax, just. move. on. The amount of time you've spent in the game is clearly substantial and worth the money you've forked out.Or if you don't think that's the case, chalk it up as a lesson not to trust Zenimax in future. So much out there in the world to sink your teeth into, another game might meet your expectations.
Exactly.  Yet anyone who tries to present scientific evidence against the global warming alarmist agenda is labeled a "denier" in a clear attempt to delegitimatize them by invoking holocaust imagery.
Not sure, but it's definitely possible to measure! I don't have [the tools](http://smashboards.com/threads/physics-input-etc-display-in-develop-mode.391956/) to do so unfortunately, hopefully someone else could lend a hand.
Good points! I forgot to mention the horizontal force as one of the potential problems, but it did go through my mind. Luckily, living in coastal BC, I have a huge selection of very strong trees to hang from! But I can see where this could present some issues.I really don't mind adjusting the hammock each time I set up... It only takes a minute or so and I have been able to be quite comfortable at a few different hang angles in my GT hammock. This concept of a structural ridgeline is more for simplicity than for hang angle. I've seen a few setups that have a tarp ridgeline, hammock suspension with ridgeline, and a bugnet ridgeline and I thought this could be a way to make setup simpler!
FYI, stucco by itself is not waterproof.  The only thing that keeps it waterproof is the exterior paint, and the sheathing and waterproof paper under the stucco.
I use them to define the risk of my sold options in the form of spreads.If volatility is low, buying ITM credit spreads are a viable option.  Tastytrade says to put the price in the middle and collect 1/2 the width of the strikes.  Probability of success is about 50% 
Honestly believe that Tennessee drafted the guy who will prove to be the best QB in the draft. Yes, I'm biased (Ducks fan) but there are no question marks over the important intangibles Mariota brings. Perhaps most importantly I believe that the Titans are a good, almost perfect, organisation for him to mature from a collegiate stud into a Pro Bowl caliber QB. Other than that I agree with most of what Gruden said about him - a quick study, smart kid, etc.Congrats Titans.
Stick to German beer people.  They have beer purity laws which stop company's putting in ingredients that don't belong in beer like GMO Corn Syrup, GMO Corn, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Fish Bladder, Propylene Glycol, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) Natural Flavors, GMO Sugars, Caramel Coloring, Insect-Based Dyes, CarrageenanBPA &amp; lots more!  Carlton &amp; united are not under this law.  So if your drinking beer everyday you may want to choose a beer from Germany that suits your taste.  That way you can be sure your only getting proper ingredients like water, barley, hops and yeast
Buy 3, there are still thousands of people playing on weekdays and up to 10,000 on weekends. Gears 2 still has a bunch too, depending where you live. I live in NE USA and I can always find Ranked Execution or Guardian matches.
Okay so now I have another problem. The BETA drivers fixed every issue that I had. So thats good. But no I have a problem that when I run a single monitor game i.e DOTA 2 or whatever it mirrors the game across all the monitors. Is there anyway to fix this?

It should be  Philippines, bad auto-correction. =/ anyway...In the last century, USA was pretty bloody with it's colonies, and yet it still holds one of the world's last colonies, occupations, US backed military and fascist rules, mass massacres, super-NATO organizations, CIA operations, policies over Latin American countries, US backed fundamentalists, etc.Also, crimes against the Native American population had committed in the modern times as well.I mean, you are the ones that armed and backed tons of bloody fascist death squats, contras, and orchestrated a coup d'etat and backed the military rule, just for banana profits for God's sake - banana profits. Is this your definition of "pretty good"? Really?
Motorcycle helmet manufacturers are usually really good about designing helmets so they don't block your peripheral vision. At least with the few helmets I've owned.
I haven't either, so I'm not sure if you can add the new customer promo on top of the other one. Give it a shot!Also, didn't mention this before: the PSU has a 7 year warranty, which makes for some great peace of mind :)
How many rape victims do you know? It creates agony for the rest of their lives. I'm not necessarily agreeing with a death penalty for rapists, but I think punishment should be on par with murder.
That is true. On the other hand, if the Clintons hire someone to oversee their homes while on the campaign trail, and the overseer hires illegal immigrants, it would bite them in the ass.If you appoint people to do things, and they fuck up, you're ultimately responsible because you appointed them. How many people does the POTUS appoint to run things? It's a valid criticism. Otherwise, there is no incentive to appoint the best people.
I love being fit, and i love that my husband is fit! It's a sexy mindset, to want to push your body, and to know you are in control of your own appearance and you can sculpt your body into whatever you like! He drives me so crazy, I hope I can do the same to him for the next 40+ years!

Just wondering, because I like the book a lot.(1) What's outdated about his approach to sexuality? Do you think other authors do better?(2) Ought military scifi focus more on battle? It seems like so little of war is actually about fighting. There are long bouts of boredom, tedium, and coming to terms with what you are doing.

I probably missed a few episodes of "Voyager" back when UPN started bouncing its schedule around, but I never bothered to definitively find out whether I did or not --that's how much I liked and cared about that show.

Don't bother, the person you're replying to is a troll with several banned accounts. They openly admit that their trolling and don't want to be taken seriously.
Not that people are consciously faking it but that it's the in thing now to be a little nerdy. As far as his accent goes, you do know that producers and directors commonly give directions to their actors on how to act and speak during scenes right? I have known and hosted Japanese exchange students before and their English doesn't sound anything like his, which sounds more like the shredder from the teenage mutant ninja turtles.
One of the main themes in Toradora is coming of age and being more mature than your parents. For taiga to grow up she had to leave and move past her upbringing. She loved Ryuji and wouldn't have been able to tell him face to face, and feared that he would stop her. She had to face her family issues alone. This whole segment is incredibly important to her character. It's hey moving past the problems the series had spent building up around her
When I transferred from scotiabankk I withdrew my money $400 at a time and physically walked it over to the TD ABM to deposit it so that I wouldn't have to pay $50 for a cheue book. I would go with TD e-series, forget what CCP reccommends. The TD mer is .5%, while at tangerine it' more like 1%Personally I'm using virtual brokers because it's even cheaper than TD and it allows me to better diversify, but I've heard some people have trouble with them
Pretty much that I assumeSince the poem is about a busted, buried statue of a cruel ruler in the desert, with an inscription that basically says 'check out everything awesome I'm done', but the only thing around him is desert, it corresponds pretty nicely
As I can see with the 12k and 10k attackers, this deck is somewhat aggressive. Therefore, it is nice to tech in Archangel, Doombrace for the grade 4 line-up. It also helps filling up the drop zone without any disadvantage, since you will be soul charging 3 cards at the end.
The statement that the war was fought over state rights is an old way of thinking about the war.  It wasn't.  If it was fought over state's rights then why did the South push so hard to violate Northern state's rights with the fugitive slave act?  The state's rights argument is an old, sympathetic, southern apologist style label that is given for southerners fighting the war.  They might have even believed that themselves, but really they were trying to protect their "Peculiar institution."I would highly recommend you look at Edward Ayers's the Valley of the Shadow that has a wealth of primary sources, from both the North and South.  It's a focus on two communities that are very similar and really not that far from each other in the Shenendoah valley.  Here's the link: http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/
It probably mess up the mouse's tracking. And in terms of immersion the mouse is only use by one hand, and only 'replicates' a portion of a gamepad. Also rumble makes you less accurate on a gamepad.
You are one person who can only reach a very very very very small portion of the human population. You can't say "most don't learn." Secondly, I could say "I've tried to physically help anorexics. Most don't learn. That is not an exaggeration or slander. Honestly, these people don't care that...Anorexics inflict the pain on themselves." Do you see how flawed that is?
If I was those two teams I would be VERY concerned looking at that.  One has worked out well...the other has not.  Which is it going to be?  Tampa's or the Titans?

I just drag and drop samples, and if the samples are similar, I'll group them in to summing tracks so I can do group effects. Just a workflow thing I guess, nothing incredibly beneficial about it.
1. Yeah, prejudice does play quite a role in what gets published. I've had my supervisor tell me that it's easier if it's sent in the professor's name rather than in the student's name.2. Quality over quantity. More papers doesn't mean better research. Different researchers have different standards on what constitutes novel, publishable work.
On larger stages King Diamond can almost outdo Alice Cooper. Word of advice, even if you don't normally wear ear protection, wear it for him, his falsetto literally hurts. 
Not even a little bit, they'll just stop printing those cans and move on. Maybe they take a hit and destroy the ones they haven't shipped out (they can just re-can it, no one would know).If they were real geniuses they'd have already stopped production long before their one and only set went out.
Someone already started it. It hasn't had any activity yet. I just submitted a post. I don't think it will catch on, but the Bernie Sanders circlejerk does need to be broken. And I actually like the guy. I think he's great on several key issues, but reddit is going crazier over him than we ever did over Ron Paul.
It doesn't feel like it but Onepunch Man has been going on for a while. But yeah Dorohedoro is so fucking awesome :D It ain't over yet, but apparently it's only got one more chapter :/ 
I had to look up the rise and fall times of standard leds for a high speed flash system we were building in the laboratory. In my field there are very few things one has the luxury of regarding as "instantaneous". Turns out LEDs are one of those things. Rise was around 4ns and fall very similar IIRC. That's about 1/100th of a clock cycle on the processor I was running it on. 
For me it was the fact that Steam was, relatively speaking, a considerable resource hog and my PC was a pile of shit. It was the straw that would break the camel's back for a lot of games that I could barely run to begin with. 
Nah I'm not upset. Just because I disagree doesn't mean I'm upset. What I hope I can do is talk with people with different beliefs than me, not only to help them see my view as something that isn't ridiculous, but to see their view as well. I wouldn't mind doing that with you actually. A chance to learn someone else's PoV, provided they're civil. 
As long as it isn't the Tumblr variety left I'm pretty agreeable to it. Inb4 someone says there isn't anyone who shares their views in government offices/positions of power, lol.Edited for clarity
Dude.  These are super cool!  I've known the technique but never thought to do it for headphones before.  Awesome idea, which I am now gonna try to emulate.
When you are doing dirty work, you just want to toss it while driving by. Its easier to hide one piece of metal in the car than it would be to take it apart and then put the pieces into a bag.
I'm pretty sure it's an aftermarket landau bar that doesn't use a bulb, but it would be nice to see a pic of a functional lamp to know for sure.Chrysler used this kind of crap in the '90s.
It could be repaired, but I'd like to see it half the price if you have to repair it.  If you don't weld or have a friend that's a welder, it's going to cost a bunch to have it repaired.
You can't heal wounds if you fail the check, but you can still heal strain with advantage and critical hits with triumph.For example:Jax, wound threshold 12, is unconscious having taken 13 wounds.  He also received a critical hit (broken arm) and has five strain damage from using abilities in the combat before he went down.The groups droid medic, 1G-0R, tries to fix him up, fails the check but rolls 2 advantage and a triumph.1G-0R, splints Jax's arm and shoots him up with a stimulant.  Jax briefly wakes up but passes out again from the pain.  He removes 2 points of strain and the critical hit.1G-0R curses in binary and injects him with a stim healing several wounds and Jax wakes up having reduced his wounds below his wound threshold.Narratively his arm is sill broken, but usable and he suffers no ill effects.Note:  Personally I don't like the auto-heal critical hit effect for ongoing effects like that.  Any non-incidental crits should take time to heal.
But that's what's so promising about this to me.  Just shoving more electricity through it seems to have produced thrust in the *hundreds of millinewtons* range, rather than the 50 micronewtons from 50 Watts. I guess I should have been more clear on *why* that was a really big deal.  750 millinewtons is huge!
DL, its pocket change compared to sirenic. If youre planning on losing a few times, use the cheaper stuff to save youre money till youre comfortable with the kills. 
Well, that's not very democratic to set criteria for candidates based on their background and education. ;)Going back to Ross Perot, his background was in Sales and Computing.  Go watch some of the videos of the 1992 debates and such, he had some pretty far out ideas but actually made a bit of sense. A lot of his campaign was based off of the fact that he wasn't a politician.  In one of the opening statements I believe he made the remark "Well they have a point, I don't have any experience in running up a four trillion dollar debt."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-W4GWjN2kg(edit: For the record, Ross Perot is one of my personal heroes, so I could talk for hours about him lol)

Get a tall one!! Best bet for collapsable fence that would work best is probably something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/PetEdge-Steel-Exercise-18-Inch-X-Small/dp/B004WP8MPE/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430439966&amp;sr=1-4)They can be taken as a line with the ends angled up against the walls of the patio. But if the dog is always going to be supervised out there, might not need a super tall one. Just prevent them from easily jumping it. I also live on the first floor with a patio to grass. So I bought 2 50ft leashes so my dogs could romp on the grass. I tie the leashes to the chairs we sit on, the bush next to the patio and sometimes my 20lb kettlebell. That is also an option if it is feasible for your location. It's also great because I can take them out there and throw the ball, play with them, without any fears of them running off since we don't have fences.

Titanfall has sold a shit ton there bud. The sales that are going on are too good to pass up. Not to mention the game kicks ass and has received some really good word of mouth as of late.

Our current model has problems before the expansion point itself. This has some evidence for explanation.It needs more research yes, but we have something to go off of instead of just saying all the laws of physics break down at this point.When we have the Computers to solve these Quantum problems more evidence will surface, honestly it's possible that all these models are wrong. We just don't have the means of accurately saying what happened before the explosion.
I thought he was one of them. Aren't he and his brothers all members of the Houthi militia?Edit: And don't worry about him. He is kicking it up in Beirut. 
Thanks, although I'm not too keen on waiting to start recording till I'm in-game, usually if I do record something I want it to be the entire experience, Load screen and all.  I will try bumping up the bit-rate, pretty sure I have some misconceptions about what it actually does so it may actually help.  Also, what's the point of me having a 2TB Hard drive if I don't even hit 25% on it?  Time for it to get off it's arse and start remembering things.
I don't know about Canada, but in the US you can file a return without disclosing where you got the money. That's how they got Al Capone -- he didn't file his taxes.
You can do hot to cold. I take hot to relax my muscles from heavy work. at the end though i go super cold for about 5 minsalso got to make sure  you got a great shower head :)
You should have hit up Wegmans last year.... $7.00 for Kyocera paring knives (not folders but goddam).  I have no experience but I hear that the O2 spyderco salt folders work well.

Well, I expected the black finish and I got gray. Also The magazine was a little beat up. I have been meaning to take it out but never did. I like the heavy feel in my hands though. I think it would manage recoil reasonably well. I'll try to take a picture when I get home tonight if I have time.
I'm not that good. Really not that good, that's why I wrote the comment. Chikage and BoM just seem to be the easiest weapons to learn use effectively. If people get parried easily, they play predictably. (Edit) no matter what weapon.
I've posted this chunk of text below on reddit. Feel free to use it as you wish. Definitely point him to this sub and RCgroups etc." Resources to absorb are below. They will answer some of the questions you asked, and some of the questions you will ask yourself eventually* My newbie FAQ intro video. You might be beyond some of it though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYkUIhujlc* Find RCModelReviews on youtube, and watch all four parts of his recent "Build a Mini Quad" series. This is a 250 sized "racer" setup.* Find FliteTest on youtube and watch the electrohub build video. This is a 450 sized setup similar to the phantom.* Find FliteTest's beginner plane series. It isn't multicopter specific, but still has a lot of good info.Your first point of decision is what do you want the quad to do? If you are more interested in photography, a larger 450+ sized quad is what you want to be researching. If you want fast racing FPV, you probably want to research a 250 sized quad."
Well, just as an examination of the text, the initial term "the heavens and the earth" is extremely broad and can be taken to mean "all physical matter and things described below". It appears to be a Catch all for all of creation. Then the later verses go into more detail about our little corner of the  and the things relevant to us. So, even though it doesn't explicitly say "God created water", it is a de facto reality covered by Genesis 1:1.     But we should avoid overanalyzing a 6000 year text that tells a legendary creation story. It is a theological text, not a historical or scientific one. Thus the theological message is that very first verse: "In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."     Edit: and I totally didn't even look at who was submitting this. Why do you ask, namer?

Like the other person said, get there plenty early. We want to a sold out concert at the HOB on valentine's day this year and it took us forever to find a parking space in the parking garage. So just make sure you have plenty of time to circle around for parking. The plus side is Mandalay Bay is usually not too bad to get to traffic wise since it's the first casino, I find it pretty easy to get in and out of even on busy nights. Unlike having to deal with traffic getting to a casino further down the strip. 
Back when I was a little kid me and my entire neighbourhood used to play baseball. Some day this one kid accidently hit me in the face with a baseball bat. Blood EVERYWHERE. I nearly lost my eye but it's all good, it required some stitches and left a nice scar in my face.
Premier League does not compare to the NFL, it is more comparing it to the SEC in NCAA, where as the whole UEFA compares to the whole of the NCAA. It is a comparison made to please the american viewers of the program by purposely not looking at the full picture.

You guys get real fixated on the taxes. We actually get stuff for our taxes - its like social insurance : Decent public transport, holidays, maternity leave, social welfare, education, health, national radio, TV, films. Shows like Doctor Who, The Thick of It etc are made with public money. Also we don't get super stressed out about our taxes either because we pay it automatically at source - no yearly filling. We also don't have to pay taxes to our country if we aren't resident unlike US citizens. 
Well since its the first run its normal they don't accept me as their leader and that it takes at least the whole so that I can directly aid them with lead.From the GM point of view becoming the leader requires RP (wich Im totaly OK with), But in a way those command action wich include RP are part of becoming the team leader. 
It could most certainly be rebound anxiety, many people get the same thing after a night of heavy drinking.So while I'd agree it's a dosage issue, an adulterant is most likely not the case.  Even if it's not alprazolam it's almost certainly another benzodiazepine.Any GABA agonist in high doses has the potential to give rebound anxiety, and when you wake up in the morning with a feeling of panic you can't understand - it may just make you do irrational things like punch a hole in your door.  I'm not sure what your personal experience is like but there's plenty of documentation on exactly this feeling OP has described.  
The way we speak is correlative to the way we thinkI'm not really talking about mixed language, more of when the more polite "saya" being replace with the more crass "aku". "mane leh" is quite rude compared to "mana boleh seperti itu"
It forces out all the money you'd normally spend on detection vs. a Shadowblade/standard invis hero at 2/3 the cost, plus a relatively spammable defensive/escape/utility cooldown.It needs a mana cost and/or cooldown tweak as a limiter.

I had my bicycle stolen in uni once and I was pretty upset as it was the last thing my grandfather gave me before he died. A few weeks later I saw it at the train station near uni. It still had one of the locks I used on it. They just abandoned it unlocked as it had a flat tyre. So I just took it home and fixed it up again.That's the only time I ever got a stolen bicycle back.

I know mine would especially in this case as I'd guess it is a metal catalyzed reaction where typically the ligands don't matter as much for the general reaction mechanism. I don't know this reaction though, so these ligands may have some effect on the stereochemistry of the reaction or on the mechanism directly. So it's probably very case dependent on whether or not a prof will tell you what  the reagent is. Although in OP's case, it looks like the student immediately gave up as soon as they saw it.
If you define socialism only in the traditional Marxist sense, then he isn't a socialist. But conservatives are going to call him that anyway, so he might as well run with it. 
I've ran D&amp;D groups for years now, and honestly address it like you would any other player who isn't a good fit for the group. Leave the transgender stuff out of it, and just explain that she wasn't a good fit and its nothing personal.I've had to do this plenty of times and some people understand and some flip out. There isn't much you can do to mitigate that except by being brief or non-accusatory.
In the actual Lovecraftian mythos, Cthulhu is pretty far down the totem pole. He's an ex-slave who learned a little of his master's magic, got a big head, and tried to lead a revolution against the Elder Gods. This got him and the other Great Old Ones banished to other dimensions or sealed away in the earth. He's still way more powerful than a normal human, but more because of his psychic abilities and magical knowledge than his physical power. He was still asleep when the boat hit him, so most of his powers and defenses were offline.He got popular online because he actually has a describable physical form, where most of the Lovecraft creatures don't, he also had three stories about him, where the others got one each. A lot of the more crazy shit people say about him would be more accurately attributed to the Elder Gods.

Not really. They lack tone in their muscles, have small breasts, almost linear hips and often slightly overweight bodies. While I do appreciate them as beautiful works of art that does not make them beautiful people. The key here is to remember their origins as meaning to appeal to the aristocracy and in those days the physical distinctions between the rich and the poor were highly apparent. These painting aren't meant to indicate what the artists or people of those times would find attractive, more what the aristocracy of those times looked like.
I have an overweight friend and my 4 year old son constantly stands under him and lifts his stomach up and says, "You have a big bellie" I can't get him to stop, even when I prep him before hand

A teacher at my school really disliked this kid in our class, he was a dick head. But that day he'd just had a haircut, she asked to stop talking and then when he didn't she said, "Being stupid isn't a lifestyle choice, it may be a haircut choice but it's not a lifestyle choice." Also nearly every teacher that day made a joke about his haircut. It was pretty bad. 
Obligatory plunger comment.Besides that, make sure to stock up on good cleaning supplies now, instead of buying them later. Get a swiffer sweeper, lemon pledge etc. etc. it'll save you a trip when you realize your apartment looks like crap.
And he's useless with that many ships on the board.  The only way I've found to get his ability to trigger with that many ships is to either have him or the swarm constantly sacrificing position.  Of course, there are plenty of better pilots out there than me, and N'Dru is a fantastic value when he works, so YMMV.
I'm not talking about the former, that's... just a cutscene.The latter is what I meant, it's the tech demo. They made a third one for PS2 with VIII as well.
Another option that is a bit cheaper is the [alhonga dual pivot](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ALHONGA-Caliper-Brake-Long-Reach-Brakes-Front-And-Rear-Set-Adjustable-414g-/330968303110?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item4d0f3f8606) but it's not as nice as the tektro r559. I've used these a couple of times and they work well. The pads aren't amazing but they work well enough if you're not bombing down alpine descents.
I just wish the situation wasn't so binary. It's not that I don't like chromas, it's that I don't like the price and the method of acquisition. But not buying the chromas will not tell you any of that, it will just tell you that I don't want the chromas.

I think this thread is about locker rooms with the assumption that people (particularly students) will be changing in the common locker room area not in stalls.
As nice is that is, I'm more of a realist and from what I saw last year was exactly what all the NFL scouts predicted. I have very little confidence in him.
Edmonton takes this in a heartbeat, Montreal never offers it. Price and patches have great contracts. They're all young. And those 3 guys will get you in to the playoffs given whatever middling talent you surround them with. Edmonton would contend next year. Montreal might take years to recover.
Being captain is about knowing your team and getting the most out of the guys around you.  Not everyone needs a shouter or a guy that gets in their face.  A good captain knows when to rile and when to keep the guys calm and he has the respect of the team to be able to do both.  The abilities and techniques can be learned through experience.  Gaining the respect of the other guys on the pitch is much harder.
Listen to your coach. No one here can tell what it needs.I'd say you could drain it (syringe) if you feel a squishy pocket or "pillow" of fluid. See a dr for professional advice. CE happens, if you want to avoid it wear ear protection.Good luck  
Sometimes its really fun to be the only sober one. You get to watch people cripple their motor functions, while you stand over them, unihibited. You rise to nearly godlike ability, with super reflexes, decisionmaking prowess, and unparalled speech. In comparison anyway.
Don't think it's cool to wish injury on someone. If anything it'll make the division more exciting and competitive. Which is bad for us, but good for football, y'know?
They'll probably be kept around til the end of the Wii U.  At that point Nintendo will decide if it's cost effective to carry them on and integrate them into a new system.
He choked in a Finals against a super smartly coached team where he was carrying the load for the entire season. He won 2 rings and has been the best player in the league for 7 years. He's extremely smart and understands that the "physical" side of the game is stupid and proves nothing, which I believe is the point Kenny was making.

As he should, but not because of Mariota; Mariota could completely suck out of the gate; I honestly expect him to be less than average. But because we traded away Foles, a proven winner.
I suggest making accounts on rabb.it It'll let online rooms of people watch the same thing and talk about it in chat while it plays. Great way to interact with everyone. 
Well, I have no real basis for comparison as these were the first morels I've ever picked or eaten, but I thought they were fantastic. In fact, one of my favorites. There *was* a bit of grit on the one that came from a very ashy section of the burn, but it washed off pretty well with a quick swish in a bowl of water. I have heard that 'natural' morels are tastier than the burn morels, but couldn't say from experience.
It's hard to believe this is true by just this picture when there's already another tank of lava at the same level that the controller is. Why do you think the controller is actually using the tank under it?
I believe someone had a similar question in Washington. And I believe the answer was that they can't force you to waive your breaks and there is an anti-retaliation provision in Washington law that makes it illegal to fire an employee for reporting a forced waiver. See [this site](http://www.lni.wa.gov/WorkplaceRights/Wages/HoursBreaks/Breaks/) and contact L&amp;I if, after reviewing the information on that site, you conclude you want to report a possible violation.
Gender dysphoria does exist. These people are born with sex characteristics that do not match who they are. Genital reconstruction (gender reassignment is a misnomer) is a treatment. Facial surgery and breast augmentation/reduction are treatments. Hormones are treatments. These people are not to be shamed or disgraced for who they are. They are to be embraced and respected for who they are.

I'm not sure he necessarily *directly* killed himself over her.  I think he ended up withering away when Voyager got home because he had nothing to distract him from Seven's death.
"This book is dedicated to Ayn Rand, my parents and God."The omission of the comma is popular because of AP Style, which is like the standard for journalists. It's a style choice mostly. Either way, it's the responsibility of the writer to remove ambiguity when writing and, as others demonstrated, it's possible for lazy writers to make the oxford comma ambiguous.
While that is true, I find that most System Hacks used are by people that just mainly want the assist points to lead them into their larger streak. So they usually just have assist points and that is it, or assist points with extra time so they gain more points. With it being rare that they use the disable exo suit module, I find it more useful to use a different perk in place of hardwired, most of the time. 
A complete rehaul of melee is literally throwing away a PvP system that so many players love to use. Some of the stuff in here is cool (ex. magic bar), but redesigning the most basic PvP mechanic would be like removing a cooldown timer on LOL
Holy shit DC killed it this week minus that turd of a book Convergence. Justice League and Batman were fucking incredible. I have to go with Multiversity though.

I am in my kitchen, running in place to get my last few steps in for my daily goal and I literally have tears in my eyes.  Shit! This is it! I am so damn tired of feeling like food controls me.  I am down almost 20lbs in 45 days and I am thankful for that but still, there are days when I don't say no the extra bite of ice cream or the extra beer or or or, and even though I am always under maintenance calories each day I still feel powerless against the food sometimes.  I am 45 days better today but damn I look forward to owning my shit instead of letting it own me.

Not sure yet. Unfortunately, I probably won't be able to have the listening party until tomorrow after work. I'm definitely listening to the whole album without interruption to take it all in as a whole.The video release for Insomnia was excellent. I have high hopes and expectations, for sure. 
Ward's turn is the best character move I have seen in this show.  I absolutely hated Ward.  Since the turn he has become one of my favorite characters.    I stand corrected on that actor.
The Buffalo's got better sights, whereas I think the Elephant Gun is a flattop, so it's harder to aim. Plus, the Elephant Gun is a rare drop from an exceptionally annoying miniboss.
I can see matchmaking ruining raids for a lot of people.  If you go on LFG, you definitely want to do a raid.  If it's as easy as selecting it directly, you will get a large influx of short attention span players who will ruin it for the rest of us.  I agree with you that options are good, but this option would lead to a large number of complaints that the raids are too hard.  This already happened when VoG came out.  I sure as hell don't want Bungie catering to the casual gamer at the expense of hard end-game content.  I haven't even had to resort to LFG or any other third party websites.  I made all my friends in-game.  Play a bunch of ROC strikes with someone?  Friend Invite.  Need a PvP buddy?  Crucible Friend Invites.  Someone waves to me at the tower?  Friend Invite.  It's really not that hard.  I'm shocked at the lack of effort leading to all these complaints.
Call a local law firm that doesn't do divorces, maybe an officer in the local bar association who isn't a divorce lawyer. Ask the receptionist if she has a minute because you need a good recommendation. Describe in 60 seconds that you fear what your soon-to-be-ex will do, you know he'll lie, and you need a tough, well-respected atty who won't overcharge you. Maybe she can check with her arty and call you back with a name.  Lawyers know lawyers. Some are great, some haven't that respect yet. Find out before someone is learning on your case. Also, if you interview the best ones in the town, he can't hire them.

Everyone needs to reproduce. That is the purpose of life. That's why you eat. Why you have a job. Why you go to school. Why you live.Those who don't or can't don't fulfill the expectations of their ancestors, the direct lineage that had ran continuous for eons suddenly comes to an end and the geenpool becomes devoid of potentially unique alleles and the combinations there of. Not ensuring genetic continuity is like being a traitor to human species.
Not a touchy subject, but most people were saying no and getting crap about it. I figured it would be best to give a full explanation. Use of the word fuck or any other swear word is everyday life use.

Depends on the issue. Labor organizing is strong here. The majority of service industry workers here are Filipino and Chinese immigrants. Our hotel union here is very active and organized, and not just around labor issues but around issues like the environment, immigration, affordable housing, etc. But other issues like increased AA representation? Yeah, it's just not that much of an issue here. I was part of the Asian American Journalists Association on the mainland and thought I'd get involved with the Hawaii chapter when I moved here. I thought the chapter here would be huge because there are so many AA reporters here. Turns out it's a small and relatively inactive chapter. AAJA's key issues are newsroom diversity and fair representation of AAPI's in the media. My guess is that here in Hawaii, where AAs are well represented in the newsroom and fairly represented in the media, AAJA's key issues don't resonate as much. 
Holy crap lol! Thanks for reading, and for the info. I can't promise I'll beat everything, but I sure as hell won't go back to my old ways of unfinished games. :D

I don't really know if it counts as erotica, but the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning is SO. FREAKING. GOOD. And the sex scenes are SO. FREAKING. HOT. I'm not really into erotica as a general rule, and I wasn't expecting to like the series since typically urban fantasy isn't really my thing either, but they're just so addictive and by the time the sexy bits really got going I was full-on invested. And I just realized now you wrote this comment like 3 weeks ago, but hey, it's already typed up, so there you have it!

Good point. It's not like the politician was making a statement/civil disobedience for a point. On the other hand, it was a different jurisdiction that I am not familliar with the laws. At the time in Canada, prostitution was not illegal, just things associated with it were. Also, there is no reason to be morally outraged for breaking a law that is stupid; elsewise, politicians would be disqualified by parties for jaywalking or speeding, or whatever. 
Maybe the Titans can get the Eagles or Browns to panic-spew for Mariota later. I wasn't really keen on him, but with Winston gone, it was either him or Leonard Williams.
I actually found Christine's whole adulterous edit and subsequent boos to be a horrifyingly misogynistic joke on the producer's part.

Most of the time even when I hit the wrong keys it knows what word I'm typing, but more importantly it's really easy to change or add words to user dictionary.
Congrats on 22 days!  Keep up your great work.  My wife has made comments about how nice it is to come home and me have coherent conversations rather than slurring or babbling about something.  I'm so thankful to be able to offer a clear mind to her each day.  
I didn't get the impression that cultures were being compared (edit: in yarn's original comment). It sounded like theories of ethics were being compared.
&gt; Of course, it may be difficult to actually commit a crime on the moon if you're there by yourself.Draw dickbutt on the now bleached-out American Flag from the first moon landing.
You know it might be tax evasion is punished worse than their lowest degree murder, like murder that is accidental or the accused showed extreme remorse. Tax evasion is always premeditated and intentional. 
Nice.  First time ordering so went with a sampler to lockdown a favorite and picked up a 30ml of the crunch berry on a recommendation.  Looks like you love is that tiramisu? Almost ordered some ill have to grab a 10 ml next time to try
How much time/training do you put into strength and stability? I cut days from rolling to spend on yoga, weight training, and conditioning, and have found myself somewhat less banged up and broken.
Yeah, we sure do love a good shitshow.ETA: Someone actually asked if we are bringing in Islamic State fighters. I just can't. How did this LTC maintain himself? Someone better be up late tonight writing that man a COA for that.
They're also entirely different champions. They're balanced around different strengths and weaknesses. Just because TF got a nerf over something *kind of* similar doesn't mean Annie should have the exact same thing done to her. You might as well be asking why Garen ult doesn't do true damage, because Darius's does and they both spin. For starters, TF card has a pretty low cooldown and most importantly can be activated on the spot. It doesn't require a certain amount of other casts to happen, isn't charged.If you actually think her stun should deteriorate after a few seconds then you must have never played Annie. This would ruin the champion. Annie bot might even stop playing her if they did that.
yes that is also if it is improperly stored, aka leaving it out at room temperature, exposing it to air for long, THEN putting it back in the cooker. which i do not do
"If you want to get better get better."Please, please please! Tell me how! That's what I am asking, I want to know how I can have fun but get better. Fighting nastys is the only thing I can do (to my knowledge) that I can train to get better. I want to play this game and get better but I can't find that I can based on what is provided for me. Also, I'm sorry that I came off that I was telling the guy to fuck off, I was trying to simply say. "Thanks for the suggestion but do you have other, (in my opinion) more interesting examples of a fun to play character." I mean their is what 51 characters? Mario can't be the only easy one to try out.
Thanks for the time tip, I forget how many I had right but it was 80%, I knew all 140 characters and what they looked like but lacked the names.If you want to improve it I would try to get more name options in there too as you have already done so with most. For example I was confused why 'Susan' didn't work when I thought it should've since I didn't have 'Strong' at the end. I couldn't remember 'Bartram' for some reason but I did remember 'Bar Bar' which Finn also uses.All in all I can easily see this have close to 1,000 questions with so much in the show already (not to mention questions outside the show such as which VAs voice which character).Great work and keep it up.
I kind of wish they would go full-scale in their attempts. America could just say they're vacationing citizens that aren't based in America, so we can't do anything ^^while ^^giving ^^them ^^ships ^^and ^^shit
TAS GOT MENTIONED!!10/10 this list is not shit. Although I haven't seen the other 9 yet so who knows.EDIT: 0/10 no misty chronexia, this list is shit.
As long as I know, there's no such thing as a genre only for anime. They usually take ordinary jrock songs to openings/endings, you could look up for some jrock ballad songs, like this for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGb_aizCIEg
As regards to when you move out, that will depend a lot from how long it takes you to get the benefits you want. Your social worker will likely dictate that I am afraid, If you get a choice, the sooner the better!I understand and agree with your points, I am simply asking you to think as if you are in your sisters shoes. I also feel you have made up your mind as to your sisters fate if you tell, when your fears could be completely unfounded, you are not a professional, and are not qualified to make a decision in the case of abuse. Your social worker and others involved deal with these situations countless times and will have experience that none of us here would have. Just bear that in mind mate. If you are happy with the way you go I think that's fine. I just want to try and help you see that just because there's abuse doesn't mean your sister would be instantly removed from your parents. Especially if she says she is still happy.
I figure you can't outlaw oppinions, even if the majority of a country could be persuaded that this or that oppinion should be treated differently.That's how we got our Reichskanzler in the first place. East germany could tell you about another sort of extremism that hated nazis. Didn't work all that well either and when you supress things, they will blow up in your face.Let the Nazis be Nazis and wait until they break a law. Then force them to read some books in the prison library.
Sweet! I had been looking at his site, but shipping to Canada was expensive as always. While I don't need one right now, I look forward to seeing your work in the future (maybe on my desk!)
&gt; ch and dinner during the week, and go crazy on the weekends. Work out at least 4 days a week. You'll be good to goFive Guys isn't bad. I get my shit without the bun and it comes like a nice bacon cheezeburger salad.
I know you've already received a ton of comments but I just wanted to give you my .02 worth. First of all you look fantastic and congratulations on your transformation and beating depression with something you now have a passion for! One life skill I have acquired recently is not giving a shit what people say/think when they are not in a position to judge you or even put you down. I'm sure if you looked at every profile of these people they would all be sad human beings jealous of your hard work. At the same time, I know it still eats away at you. Keep doing you, and even though you are a stranger I am proud of you!
Hey man I love it.  I had a similar idea but never had the motivation to actually make it.  Pedal and store some potential energy in a big flywheel and build a tractor around it.  You can till and maybe even make a snow plow and cutting attachments.  But I always thought you'd never be able to get the power to actually make anything useful.  Great job!
Apology for poor EnglishWhere we're yuo when Chip Kelly dreams dies I was at home winning off the field when Scot ring   "Chip is Kill"   "No"  And youou? 
Incorrect usage of the upvote/downvote buttons. If you've read a post, you're supposed to upvote it. If you haven't read a post, you're supposed to downvote it. If you like the post, you're supposed to gild it.
I couldn't even watch that all the way through. How can they call themselves media when they are so damn biased? The only bright spot is the relative low number of views.
One thing I've noticed is that the difference between taking .5mg and taking .75mg is huge. One relaxes me, one knocks me out. My doctor gives me a prescription for 1mg because I travel a lot, when in reality I take .25 to .5mg.It's true that Xanax has a high chance for abuse. Withdrawal is also fucking terrible, and I assume your doctor is trying to protect you. he has probably prescribed you the SSRI in an attempt to reduce anxiety in the long run. Try coupling this with therapy as well so you're not so dependent on Xanax. Also avoid caffeine, etc. 
&gt; So this is all Reddit is going to be now, Obama stuff?&gt; He has literally no chance. None. Why are we wasting time pretending he can win anything on a national level?Annnd the cycle continues.
i'm sorry but i'm really losing faith in this F.O atm. They could have gotten an insane amount of players(that we need) and picks from eagles. Mettenberger have potential and i think he will be a stud QB in 2 years.
Is that really something worth complaining about? If you don't like it there is zero reason for you to keep watching. He puts it after the content so there is nothing forcing you to watch it.
1: Thanks for having this giveaway, it is very cool of you2: I should win this because fire emblem path of radiance is the first fire emblem game i have ever played and Ike is my favorite smash character. Unlike other fire emblem characters who are all from royalty, i relate a lot more to a commoner like Ike. Wii fit trainer would just be nice as i have never seen a wii fit trainer amiibo in person.
LOL you live in a fucking sanitized, sheltered, lily white bubble if you think only 1% of ANY population is racist. In fact I think whites are the only race where a minority of us are racist. Non whites don't get criticized the same way for being racist. White people are the only ones who catch flak for saying they'd never consider an interracial relationship.
Right. This is straw man bullshit. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
My freshman year my geography teacher asked me if I was born in the U.S. Because I got 48 out of 50 in the states test and everyone else did very poorly. I'm Hispanic decent born in the U.S. and she was white. I guess if I was born in Mexico or anywhere south of the border it would've been embarrassing for the other kids? I don't know why she even asked.
I don't have an adapter yet, either. And I've only had my telescope (Orion 4" Mak) for a little over a month. I didn't realize how tricky it would be to hold my phone's camera lens in the right spot.Edit: phone's* camera
....... 20 years is really not a huge difference? I'm only 32 and feel like I have absolutely nothing in common with the generation of people on HBOs girls.
I just bought an 1989 dodge which I'm pretty happy with. The engine was rebuilt 9 years ago, the transmission is good. The downside for sure is the suspension that will need some TLC but I'm okay with that for now. I only paid $2,000 with 35,000 miles. The body is excellent. It passed calif. smog. I'm loving my van. I shopped for newer vans and found that the style I wanted were out of my price range (I only wanted to pay cash) and were not as attractive to me. I want to love what I'm living in and the older styles appeal to me. It's carpeted, the windows are tinted and it has slide windows that help with air circulation. I wouldn't pass up the older vans. Lots of people buy these for road travel and hardly use them but hang on to them so usually only one or two owners. 
&gt; Co-op was something they wanted to do for SoD but they decided to save it for Class 4.Actually they were planning on doing it, but it would have required them basically rebuilding the game, so they cancelled it. 
Not gonna lie but the kpop fandom can be quite dramatic, us noonas included!  For us it's just for comedy, but I find the younger Kpop fans to be a bit more serious about their overreactions and they get very easily angered by people who don't agree with them or make jokes about their favorite group or bias.  Kids, don't take things too overboard, just enjoy the music and freak out when you actually see the band in person ;)
Probably.  Just like there's probably a good reason they were on "the list" in the first place, but this was from their strength &amp; conditioning coach - not their official coaching staff.  Tommy Moffitt is good at what he does, but I'm sure the HC had a real long talk with him after he flew his shit list in front of NFL scouts.In the two years since he pulled that shit, he's never talked about it and never tried it again.  I think that says all you need to know about how official "the list" was.
I don't think he implied what you're paraphrasing. He said something to the effect that he didn't expect he would win, but that he would hope that he could still fight, or "play chess". Something like that. To even "fight" against Carlsen, one would have to be among the very best players in the world.
Lol what? This isn't a survival trip. This isn't even big enough to be considered a land nav course. This is like a "two kids playing in the woods and coming home because it got dark" course.
I like how everyone decided that chanting "please retire" at a heel Big Show is the most offensive thing in the world. Especially, when the prevailing opinion on this subreddit is that people are sick of him, and Kane, being in main events and that Show is past his prime.
Look him straight in the eye and say "This is the truth. You can choose not to believe me but I refuse to discuss this any further. I am not a liar and I don't like being called one." Say it every time. Word for word.If this has just started in the past year, I would be concerned that he is lying or cheating and is projecting on you.

It'll make you stupid, but making people gay is a stretch. It'll make you suicidal, make you hate everyone around you, hate yourself... but it won't make you gay.
It might be just a game but it's been a significant part of my life for over 2 yearsI also wanted to make it clear that I would still be involved in Mercs and thank Height, as well as mention that I would merc.

&gt;However if you compare it to Superman or Batman who've been running for 75 years, 10 years is nothing.Not the same really, they constantly change artists and writers.
It's different because "hack-a-Shaq" in basketball gives the advantage to the team committing the rule infraction.  That's why I don't like "hack-a-Shaq" but I have no problem whatsoever with shifts in baseball.  That being said, guys in the NBA need to work on their free throws just like guys in MLB need to work on hitting to the opposite field.  It's embarrassing for players in both leagues.
I was talking more about nationality/country instead of race, but whatever.I still find it a weird leap of logic how smash picked up an odd slang definition.

This is awesome! Is that patch in the top left a distortion that happened from sorting? or is that another layer you brought in? Either way I love the results and was curious about how you got that warped/vortext effect.Also, I was checking out some of your other stuff and wanted to thank you for helping me find quicksort!

The Android Pebble app doesn't hear about incoming events from BBOS, so it doesn't send notifications to the watch.In the past, people have used the side-loaded Android app just to browse the Pebble App Store and upgrade the Pebble firmware, while leaving the actual message notifications to 3rd-party apps like [Talk2Watch](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/39743920/) or [pBBl](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/36059891/).  But you'd have to remember to stop one before launching the other because they conflict.Now [Talk2Watch Pro](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/47592888/) can do everything, so there's really no point in side-loading the Android app.
Was what Cuban said not correct? They are a predictable team. They run, run and shoot the three. Also they wouldn't be that good without James Harden. Is he supposed to say "oh, that team over there is stacked and great. I hate playing our rivals because they're so good"? Don't be so sensitive to what an owner says. You don't see Mavs fans get up in arms about every little thing that Morey says. I'm not justifying the firing. I just understand the reasoning behind it. And if you don't, then it's pretty clear you've never been involved with a professional business of any kind.
For people who can't see the video (on phone etc), he is using:* Firebolt Grenade (to hit around corners, play hide and seek, or hunt a wounded enemy)* Balanced Glide* Radiant Skin (because PvP damage reduction is awesome)* Flame Shield (more damage reduction)* Viking Funeral (doubles DoT of Ignite abilities)* Touch of Flame (to cause Ignite with grenades, and so see where your opponents are with the DoT caused by grenading around corners)* Apotheosis Veil (for a one-use "regain all health" buff).
LoL's meta rotates *a lot*. When I was a LoL player I loved playing Aatrox, then he got picked in the world championship and got nerfed into the ground. He was really weak and if I picked him I just put my self into a big disadvantage. LoL nerfs and buffs are really big, they easily destroy a hero in one patch.LoL's meta rotates so often that you can't get all the meta picks with free points, if you want to play all the OP champs you have to pay or play extremely much.
On the rational side, the Feds don't bring a case unless they're very confident of the outcome. They wouldn't appear to be consistent or reliable if they were losing cases left and right. 
I'm not saying don't date at all, I'm saying having friendships should trump dating in terms of priorities.Dating is a temporary form of socialization in, I'd say, at least 50% of cases, filled with many rejections. The vast majority of relations end after 1 date. Maybe OP wants something more than that, and I can't imagine it's easy when you're eager and desperate to communicate, especially if you are male. I've seen guys get depressed over no replies, no messages, no dates because it happens. I don't want OP to see this as a magical solution to their lack of knowing people.
Since everyone is giving you the "water is a chemical" shit, I'll add something constructive to your comment.It actually has a lot to do with how they are labeled between "Non fat," "Fat Free," and "Light."How they are labeled determines what is changed in them in terms of sugars, artificial sweeteners, substitutes.
A note and a title are NOT directly connected.You can have one name on a note both names or a title, which means he still legally has part ownership of the car.Don't remove his name from a note, as he will still have his name on a title, and hence claim ownership of the car.  If the title says your name AND his name, there is no way to remove his name from the title without his consent. 
Seriously though. I don't know how did it but your characters reached out to me very deeply and whilst I'm not happy about it, the experience was incredible
Well if you're smart you keep a diverse portfolio so that if any one industry takes a dive you are protected. Also, I can personally vouch for the merits of the stock system. I'm in highschool like /u/DenseCookie and over the course of two years of mixed investments I've grown $5,000 in college savings into around $20,000 not to mention some sizable bitcoin stashes I have lying around. To be clear the stock market is VERY DANGEROUS and only suited for a VERY SELECT INDIVIDUALS but if you are smart and know what to do you can make a lot of money. You'll also lose a bunch of money if you're stupid. I may have quadrupled my money in the past two years, but I should be currently sitting on 30k instead of 20... I really fucked some things up about halfway through... But I've learned since then and I'm prepared for more :D
Wow.I came here for support. Instead, your response is "your fiance flat out lied for months about something, but you're over-reacting." How is that helpful or supportive? Also, good job at placing all of someone's self-worth on their body image. I have plenty of worth that has nothing to do with my physical appearance, but I don't really have confidence problems in those areas.

Even before it the councils, it was not considered to be applicable to Christians.  Now it's almost universally accepted as just the laws for the people of Moses, PRE-Christ.  The only time Jesus ever referred to it, he quoted Deuteronomy 6:5:   Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.There are two important parts to religion:  the content and the practice.  In both cases, you'll see Christianity has evolved and Islam has not.  
Yeah but this is painful. It's not about losing, it's about how we're losing. To be so utterly embarrassed and shamed on national television is excruciating. I had to turn the game off and switch to the draft, can't bear to watch this team self destruct and crumble in real-time. I need a shot.. or twenty..
I would be stunned if Kansas ends up in the SEC. We're not a good fit culturally at all. First of all, we're a basketball school. Secondly, a huge part of the history of Lawrence and Kansas is that we were aggressively anti-slavery and pro-Union. Our mascot is derived from a term for anti-slavery guerrillas and we're [damn proud of our free state history.](http://archives.kansan.com/media/1969/12/120225_BKCvsMissouriFans_cneal28.jpg) How well do you think we'd mesh in a conference that until recently had student sections chanting "the South will rise again" and a school with Colonel Reb as an official mascot? I can't speak for the entire fanbase, but I'd literally rather be in any other P5 conference than the SEC.

Tell your parents. First step in a righting a wrong is admitting you fucked up, and if they are paying your tuition you owe them that much. Next is talk to an advisor and see what your options are. Can you re-enroll in the classes failed so you can redo them to get second year standing? It will also be important to clarify if you are on academic probation or not. If you are, you're gunna have to enroll elsewhere. And in general take ownership of your education. You put yourself in this situation, all you can do now is change your behavior going forward. Study, go to class, procrastinate less and go to your goddam exams! 
He's a gobshite, deliberately over the top, brings people on just to talk over them, and then acts like a dickhead. It's misery porn for people who like to give politicians a bashing; it's no wonder so many of them refuse to go on his show.

[I my self am an american](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQwKVspiMA). There's... a UN provision if I recall that says nobody can own any area in space, however. That said, if that provision (or treaty, whatever) is overturned, I guess we know who went there first (well, based on the lander. The flag is actually bleached to a blank white by the sun).**EDIT:** Edit to assert my love for the stars and stripes and the people it represents (but not the /current/ government body running it)
[Here's the relevant thread and comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/2u1k5y/lw_plasma_stellerator_or_more_aim/co4exqr). There's two caveats to that post and my spreadsheets, though:1.

My Beta 15 spreadsheet hasn't been updated to reflect the nu-Battle Rifles that lose 10 aim after any non-turn-ending action.Anyways - I haven't put math to anything here, but my expectation is that Rapid Fire will still yield more expected damage from less reliable shots, and that the Nu-Battle Rifle will be... complex.

Now I really want to know what features that Ephone has. Does it have a built in wand, only possible to make so short by manufacturing it in a fractal curve that cancels out it's own distortions? Is there an app that summons small purchases by displaying a diagram on the screen? Does it sync with a retrieval charm on your bag of holding to display a searchable inventory and pop whatever you click on into your hand? Is it enchanted to shield itself if dropped? Is there a mode where it levitates in front of you face, hands free?
Ah, her. You're right. I think I'll get gloomy about it now instead of waiting. It's stuff like this that will keep me playing the GBA titles instead of shelling out for the new ones.
so, how are you getting enough heat with just map gas... i have the same setup and i cant seem to make more than 1/2oz liquid, and even then it wants to solidify before i can think of pouring... do you have a few firebricks to make a makeshift furnace?
As a small business owner, this is totally true.  Yelp sucks. If a customer opens up a new yelp account and reviews your business with 5 stars it gets buried.   However if that same customer instead gives you a bad review, it sticks. Also yelp aggressively calls you trying to get you to sign up for they paid version, which is way overpriced compared to other Pay per click options. 
American CEOs are overcompensated in general, but for what it's worth Yahoo's stock price has tripled since she started there 3 years ago.Fun fact:  She fired her COO, who pulled in a total of $109 in his 15 months there.  She could probably make more money there than she already does.

I felt more suspense at Breaking Bad, but I like the setting of Game of Thrones more. I think it's unfair to compare these two unless they were of the same genre. They're both enjoyable.
No one is hurting per se, but people generally don't want to feel like they are deliberately handicapping themselves by choosing a different class. Beyond that, if the Cypher is too epic, then the difficulty-settings scale differntly for different char builds.
From what I hear Executives want Williams and the Coaches want Cooper.  I'm so nervous!!!! I hope the Executives get their man!  Williams all the way!!!
Not OP, but yeah it's fun alone. but you gotta have somewhere to chat with people, like the tripsit IRC. First time I did MDMA it was alone. I also like doing cocaine alone. 
If an attorney can help you plead to a charge that doesn't combine the words "battery" and "officer", it will do you a world of good. Yes, lawyers are expensive, but you should borrow money if you have to. Just imagine what "Misdemeanor Battery on a Peace Officer" will look like on an employer's background check next time you apply for a job: *"This guy attacked a cop?!"* This has serious life-altering potential. Even if your lawyer is ultimately unsuccessful, at least you'll know you did everything you could. You don't want to be kicking yourself in the unemployment line a year from now thinking, "Why didn't I get a lawyer?!" 
Agreed on the learn networking, design and management first. Disagree on the over hyping of scripting. Scripting is so underutilized at the moment. We should be using it to do firewall reviews, review configs against templates, generate documentation on the fly (so we don't have documentation we always have to update), generate new configs, find a switchport only given an IP address in a network of 100's of switches... There's so many uses. 
This long-winded pontification of what GDQ "is", doesn't at all invalidate the views of those of us who don't like the way the events are run, which is what I assume it's supposed to do.And if GDQ isn't for speedrun fans, who the fuck is it for you then, bunghole?
The reason he ended up paying child support is because the state went after him and he didn't show up to the court date, so the state got a default judgment. There wasn't a chance for the judge to decide that this is fucked up. Even then, the judge still probably wouldn't have ruled in favor of the mother since "it is about the child's right" and no one cares about a father getting raped.
It sounds like the police were using the possible exigent circumstances of evidence being destroyed to enter the house. In the pdf you linked, it says the officers followed a suspected drug dealer to the house, and claimed to smell marijuana. This sounds as though they are claiming that following a suspected drug dealer to a house, and claiming to smell marijuana is probable cause for a search, and then used the sounds coming from the house to manufacture exigent circumstances. It doesn't in my opinion, but that doesn't count for shit. I believe that if police officers pulled this shit, and didn't find any drugs, they would have opened themselves up to a civil suit.Even with the information you provided (thanks for the reading material) it doesn't change the fact that demanding the police obtain a warrant before they are allowed inside my house is a perfectly acceptable response to them banging on the door.
I'll stick with my preferred order.  It helps that 1: OWB gives a lot of useful perks, and it makes sense to be able to use them rather than throw away content without their availability, and 2: OWB is content with a _manifestly_ lower level requirement than Dead Money, especially on hardcore.
Razer isn't selling a headset. The devkit headset they're selling is for people to toy around with their OSVR thing. So far, they say they have no plans to make/sell a consumer version.According to them, they want standardized VR headset software so they can make peripherals for it (like that controller they made a year or two ago that failed miserably).
I have the same jacket but unlined, and I would have to concur with the above. You really can't go untucked with this jacket because it hits right at the beltline. Everything else in the outfit has to fit just right as well, nothing can be too big or too loose as this is a very slim trucker-type jacket.
I can wait at least for 1 month. Then I'll say fuck it. The sad part is she only cares about the money and she is set (and I mean fucking destined) to inherit the business. If she keeps this up she will lose more than me...
More specifically, Go is a game of complete information.  Given a board state we could compute a solution given enough time and resources.  Bridge is a game of incomplete information and much of the challenge is not only is solving a given "board state", but even deducing what the board state is.  In addition, the partnership aspect of bridge makes it a very different dynamic.  Solo efforts are quite different from team based cooperation, especially when the rules of the game itself enforce limited communications.  (Bidding, signalling)Where the luck factor comes in could be somewhat similar to poker:  we can compute that we are 90% to succeed in an action, we still fail 1 time in 10.  Nothing like that in Go.
Yea, what's up with asexuals and aromantics acting oppressed? I've never seen anyone oppress you just because you lack a sex drive similar to theirs.Well, outside of high and middleschool that is.

Whether they did it intentionally was not the point I was try to make.  What I am saying is that if your non GMO corn has cross pollinated with GMO corn it is no longer non GMO because it now contains DNA from GMO corn.

This is the opposite of how it normally is for me, I'll be pulling into my driveway then have to sit in the car for a few extra minutes til the song is over.
I believe I was told that someone was holding it there and had $ down and was going to purchase later that day but decided against it around the time I showed up just to ask out of curiosity. Like I said..sheer luck!
I have been a trader for 2 years now. And I used to be able to trade bulk in decent quantities then they just started disappearing. When I started using puca power I saw these trades become available again... but only for a second or two before being auto traded. I used to grab maybe 10 to 15 cards from one user but I was barely able to grab one lately.
yeah, that's what the kids keep saying, i don't know that for sure but whatever the case most people get employed with a decent salary no matter what they do, engineers may get a head start (according to popular belief) but who gives a fuck, that only counts as an advantage when you're starting out, what about the next 40 something years you're working being stuck in a dull job most people can't and don't care to relate to

Harsh. I kinda stopped going to movies the day they came out after a really bad experience a few years back where people would not shut up during the film. I got so annoyed I vowed to stop. Unfortunately my ex still loved watching movies the day they come out. Oh well.
Well you seem to be using it as an insult and said he may re-apply when he stops, so you seem to have a problem with anal fisting. I guess technically it might not be homophobic, but the way you said it makes me think it was.Hope middle school is going well :)
I don't know if I really want to.Bethesda made a bad choice, and they should pay the price for it. Just because they corrected their error in judgement doesn't mean that their action should be forgotten. Forgiven, fine, but not forgotten.
Jaromir Jagr was drafted in  1990. He signed another one year contract to return next season.Not  sure if you count strike-shortened seasons in there.
We have regular UT testing done on pipes at work as part of our corrosion monitoring program. Its nice because It can be done on the fly without interpting unit operation.
My neighbor named his cat Dr. Fish, and someone else thought to call their dog Grandma.     &gt;Mom! Grandma peed in the house again!  &gt;Well put her outside!
Mod chips were very popular, easy to get, and easy to install if you knew how to. I knew people with spindles full of pirated PSX games. They had so many they would literally transport them in garbage bags. I ended up playing tons of japanese games in my childhood because of how easy it was to pirate games for the PSX and DC.I really regret how much I pirated when I was younger, but I don't regret how much it taught me about software and hardware and the internet, and I certainly don't regret actually playing the games.Funnily, even now Nintendo is still using proprietary discs in their consoles. Look at the Wii U - it uses a very slightly modified Blu-Ray. A lot of people wouldn't notice if they didn't look for it, but the discs look different.
Anywhere that a nice-looking car isn't very common, people are likely to overestimate its worth. You barely see any muscle cars over here, so when people do see them they think the owner must be rich even though it's just a base level car. Although to be fair, if you want to buy one without importing it yourself you do have to be pretty rich...$55k for a 2010 Camaro, seriously...
Wut? No. The Empire State Building collision imparted 63 MJ into the structure. The Trade Center South collision imparted 7.7 GJ into the structure, or 59 times as much energy.edit: oh, I put 500, not 50. Whoops.

This was the biggest disappointment with his list of supported issues for me too. "No new spending" won't help. What needs to happen is "smarter spending". I'm not military, but I am military spouse and even as a low level spouse I hear about far too much wastage. Reduced military spending won't fix the problem; it will only exacerbate an existing problem and denude an already limited force. Being anti-war doesn't mean you have to be anti-servicemembers too.
Yes, it was a joke - and that's fine. But, it was still a accurate reflection of reality at the time. I don't care about the note - it doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already - but it's not untrue. And how can Cameron possibly not use it as a prop? It reinforces, albeit somewhat unnecessarily, his argument for choosing the Conservatives over Labour.
Haha yeah, you were being downvoted when I replied to you. God forbid you quote someone, respond to it, and that's all.Glad you agreed with my rambling though, I felt like it got a bit off topic toward the end but I tried to tie it together. You write for Di Marzio right? You should try to put together a piece on this
ye and we all saw how good puzsu was against Uzi right?peke was best mid in EUlcs in S3 but yeah let's give credit to their botlane and not peke+soaz outperforming everybody else in S3 LCS
I did CF for a year, towards the end of my 200/mth year minimum subscription, I just wanted to do strength training.I was only allowed to do strength training as apart of a class, which was 3 days a week, tuesday, thursday, and sat.They had 0 open gym times, unless of course you were on PED and competed or a chick, then it was ok...I joined a rock climbing gym, also expensive, but there are incredible perks in terms of eye candy and no one touches my oly platform or squat rackrock climbing gym is 75$/mth, still 'expensive', but far better than the 200$+ you pay for a CF gym. The only benefit of attending a CF gym are the girls, or some trainers who could actually know what their talking about.If you dont need someone to help you, find a better gym, too expensive

It's about money. The same reason they played Hamburg in the UAE in January. It's also an opportunity for Pellegrini to get a closer look at some younger players, but it's 99% money.Those senior players who are there will be there in body more than mind, so to speak.

I think it's part of the Johnny Manziel thing from last year, where he was expected to go early...and didn't. They kept showing him sitting there, looking more and more nervous/uncomfortable with each pick that wasn't him. Some guys didn't want to risk that being them this year.
I'm here, but if it's late, then I don't want to keep you up! I don't think I'll be able to trade tomorrow as I'm moving some of my things back home, but maybe sometime during the weekend?
As I said, I guess I agree with you.  In a society with full equality under the law and a lack of social double standards, I can't think of any reason why statistically men and women would have different resource availability.  But I would consider resource equality to be a byproduct of the other two things, not a goal in of itself.
That's kind of where I'm at. I might just have to play around and see if I can find something that works. I saw on Ravelry that there was one person who made several pairs of socks in the same natural yarn, but the projects were finished in 2012 and I'm not sure how weird it would be to message the person and ask if they remember how well the socks they made three years ago held up.
I feel like they're talking about the release schedule in this case. Anet's already tried out a couple different update schedules. If they stick to the season/expansion setup, we could end up seeing new specializations earlier than before.
Oh yeah, we got the Montana for the property away from home. Nice, but you have to take it down in the winter, or the cold here kills some of the fabric. 
He's only apologizing because you caught him. If you hadn't caught him, he'd still be fucking this other lady (are you sure he stopped?). Unfortunately, I agree with other posters that this might not have been a one time thing. He's got perfect cover with odd hours at work and seeing movies alone.If you attempt to work things out with him, a condition needs to be that he gets tested for STDs periodically. Also, you both need to download a GPS app so that you can have piece of mind and be able to see that he is where he is supposed to be. Of he is truly remorseful, he won't argue this.
Yes that's just a myth because when you shave and it regrows, it's shorter and doesnt bend or anything so the shorter hairs feel harder and thicker. Guess thats what leads people to still believe in that myth
Moffit, our strength  and conditioning  coach did this. He said in an interview  it was more of a joking punishment  and he'd  back any of these  guys to NFL scouts.
Don't worry. They're just jealous. My parents bought me a laptop to use for school when I was your age. I called it my computer instead of the computer my parents bought me. I didn't try to pass it off as something I had worked for (even though they had me "earn" it through grades) and neither did you. 
Meh.  My friends know about it and if anyone asks why all my art features these anthros, I'll explain it to them.  It's not something I wave around or talk about much.  I don't really make a big deal of it and people generally don'd mind and think it's actually kind of cool.
to be a little fair, it's also about how much you play the game, average people don't play nearly as much as these popular streamers, and just by playing so much, they are actually better hearthstone players than most

Bread did nothing. I hope it's just that. It just makes eating and drinking painful. It feels like it could be inflammed. How can just a pill do this?!?!
Someone who let himself achieve that grade of sickness (come on, if I have maggots anywhere I would remove/kill/burn or whatever the hell takes to finish them) deserves to die.
Wow...Thank you for going so in depth with that. I'll admit though, I was just curious about the dynamics of "when a girl starts a tickle fight with you, TAKE THE HINT". I mean, more often than not its been with someone whom I've been intimate with, or about to be. But on the flip side, 1\3 of the time it was just genuine fun 'n games (so I think, at least). I guess for sure though, what you said is accurate and there is no " one size fits all" with human emotion!
speaking as a Christian myself, we do not hate gays. It is said many times in the Bible that God loves all his children, but hates sin, and homosexuality is a sin. Therefore, God does not hate homosexuality, he merely hates the sin of homosexuality.
Most of the endgame gear is droppable for raid tanking sans epic and a few vp drops which are only small upgrades.  Red is just about rolling with your gang and they're always looking for more :P  edit:  Also, holo kinda just walks through kunark content atm with only a little comp from azrael, so just app and walk through free loot / raidz :P

Ingenuity I + II will become mandatory once you start crafting 1★  and it'll also make your rotation for lvl 50 stuff efficient.Piece by Piece and Waste Not II will become mandatory for 3-4★ (once you get to this point you need a very specific full 10 abilities from other classes at all time)

I think the team will consist of original Wells and his wife and Barry s father and mother after the Flash goes back in time and saves them.  Cisco and Caitlin (Killer frost) will be the villain s.
Trying to predict whether this is a good or not is like reading tea leaves at this point. If the two paths are really as long as Awakening (or close to it) like they're saying, people complaining about this don't really have a leg to stand on imo. That's a gigantic amount of content and they're absolutely justified in breaking it up. On the other hand, if it's obvious that they just split one game into two to make some more money, it's a pretty skeevy thing to do. Like I said though, nobody is going to know until the game comes out. So yeah, in that sense, I am also confused about why some people are already condemning the way it's being released. I don't see why you wouldn't at least give Nintendo and IS a chance, especially since Nintendo hasn't been egregious DLC so far. 
Can confirm - went to smoke dabs with /u/epidemic and was instead fed to Seymour. Currently posting from purgatory; overall it's not too great, not too bad. 
Damn. Why are people on reddit always such assholes?? Can you not have a discussion or disagreement without immediately being an asshole?? Damn. Is this how you are in real life?? 
So, haven't you told her about your feelings yet? If not, then do so immediately. Tell her, that you don't feel great about this at all, in fact it makes you feel very uncomfortable and ask her to consider your feelings about this matter. If she ignores your feelings and doesn't give a shit about it, you have your answer.
Sorry, don't know what you're talking about. Her win on the Conjoined Twins episode, which just happened one episode ago, was in no way controversial. It clearly was between her team and Katya's. As for the Max-Pearl win earlier in the season: it was no less questionable than Kennedy's win in episode 3 or Katya's win in episode 6 (as a completely forgettable Merle Ginsburg). In fact, a # of the wins have felt a bit arbitrary but I don't see how Pearl's were any less deserved than the ones I've mentioned.
Nah Diddy, some of these people just straight up threw away our mailout, then magically remembered it existed at one point and called out of the blue to ask about it a year later.  Blows my mind.

Holy cow, I didn't realize new people would actually join during Omega Ruby. What drew you into twitchplaypokemon and had you known about it for awhile before you joined? 
You can. Google gives you an hour or two refund window after you purchase it to get a refund. The refund button appears in the app's page if you are within the refund window. A tap on the refund button is all it takes for Google to remove the app from your device and refund the purchase
I get angry comments about not having watched Dirty Dancing and the notebook. From what I can tell, one is just a dance film and the other looks depressing. Don't fancy that to be honest!
That's a shame. I can't say I feel the same way, and all I have to offer to the contrary is speculation on how everything will come together in the end.

Homeopathy is using *none* of *something that produces the same symptoms as your illness*.Seriously, the dilution ratios are so high that there are mathematically zero molecules of whatever the "active ingredient" is in a homeopathic treatment. The purported effect comes from the "memory" of water.And it's not inoculating you against an illness by showing your immune system and actual pathogen - it's treating a runny nose with something else (or rather, the "memory" of something else) that makes your nose run.
When I was in high school my school system picked up the motto "Every student matters everyday." Not a typo. This was on the signs, on printouts, on the sites... We were a ghetto school system, sure, but even the freaking school board doesn't know basic grammar?

That is because while I love college and higher learning in general (current student, learn for the sake of learning), that environment is BP as fuck.Just take your women's lib and theology courses and enjoy yourself making little atheists and misogynists.
I went to visit family over there. They had soda with every meal. My siblings and I love plain water with like 90% of our meals. They thought we were weird.
I also have Anterior Pelvic Tilt and the exact same kind of pain if I don't pay extra attention to my posture. Especially if I swing hard.I do a lot of sports who requires to do a torso rotation and I use to developp pain in all of them if I practice it to often. Like the previous poster mention and I can't stress enough that good posture, flexibility and core streght help a lot. However, once on the golf course, even if common knowledge state to be relax at address, actively engage your glutes and your abdominal muscle (as if you were trying to press down on your leg with your abs).It goes against common golf knowledge, but for people with anterior pelvic tilt, like me, it can mean a whole season pain free and you're even going to hit farther and straigter.

A man filled with the gladness of livingPut his keys on the table,Put flowers in a copper bowl there.He put his eggs and milk on the table.He put there the light that came in through the window,Sounds of a bicycle, sound of a spinning wheel.The softness of bread and weather he put there.On the table the man putThings that happened in his mind.What he wanted to do in life,He put that there.Those he loved, those he didn't love,The man put them on the table too.Three times three make nine:The man put nine on the table.He was next to the window next to the sky;He reached out and placed on the table endlessness.So many days he had wanted to drink a beer!He put on the table the pouring of that beer.He placed there his sleep and his wakefulness;His hunger and his fullness he placed there.Now that's what I call a table!**It didn't complain at all about the load.**It wobbled once or twice, then **stood firm.**The man kept piling things on.
&gt;Thanks for the advice .. I used the link to request unbans for some under two hundred Reddit accounts, that are either banned directly or have been shadow banned, which contain my posting history at Reddit since 2007.
This is at a university where a student of mine was failing a required class: "He's the kind of guy that would go nuts and come here and shoot everyone. Do whatever you can to make sure he graduates this year."
Excellent response! Thank you for taking the time to write that out. If you don't mind, what political system would you say has followed the ideals of communism most successfully, or as you said, who followed their own definition of the communist dream closest?
Are you implying he strategically ended up with a broken neck?The same guy who ran from the cops - a stupid idea as it is, planned this from the start with Machiavellian precision for the sake of a potential police brutality claim?I want what you're smoking.

Pro tip... don't eat at Tucker's. It's no good. I normally avoid posting negative stuff, but I feel compelled to save people from the poor decision of going to Tucker's. It's a tourist trap.
Things have really changed in the last couple series going into today.  I still believe in this team in the long haul, but during the 11-game streak, it seemed like we always had an opportunity to take over and then we'd hold it out.  More recently, we get leads and figure out ways to fuck it up.
Thank you for your feedback. Seriously. It shows that you actually care about our sub and we sincerely appreciate it.We're sorry for the ifs and bumps in the road. We really want to make this place as nice as possible for you guys and we promise we're trying our best. Hopefully we can get there. Thanks for sticking with us!
It seems nobody understands that actually lifting the weights is the easy part. Doing the science and statistics is way harder. And these celebrities have someone else to do that for them.
Use the standard build but swap Hydra for Meteor shower. Take Prodigy/Astral/EE/Unstable. Easily did a 51 solo with it, but with a 1 Hander you have similar damage output with more gearing options.
Each small island is supposed to have a luxury mansion on it. They put the islands on auction to buy. Sounds cool, but if I remember correctly, it will only end with the islands being washed away due to longshore drift. They spent billions on something that will only look flashy and cool for some time, before it is washed downwind. 
A Turkish architectural firm did the maths and came up with 1.7 billion on the bottom end. Glass manufacturers said the minimum cost of glass would have been 700 million.  As someone who doesn't mind erdogan. I would never trust his official figures. 
That's certainly one way to get around the issue of the one drop that hungry dragon spawns. Though I suspect you don't have enough dragons to reliably trigger BWT and corrupter. There's also no heals in the deck. Lastly, if I'm running BWT, i'm running both. I just feel like its inconsistent to only play one. 
Maybe it's to do with [the billions we give them in aid](http://dfat.gov.au/geo/indonesia/development-assistance/pages/development-assistance-in-indonesia.aspx)
Alright i think for a logo ill get a pic of me and my dog (hes always sitting my my bed next to me during streams) and then see if i can get someone to draw it cartoon-like. And i will talk to my donors and see who is ok giving up mod powers and widdle my number down to a few. Thanks for the feedback
Sweet thanks so much! Have my upvotes (cause I'm poor and cant give you gold)!Edit: Thank the lord (or any other god including reddit) that you are here! This is gold - literally!
I didn't even know there was going to be a Stagg Jr any time soon!The Stagg Jr batch #4 proof is only .05 more than batch 3, I wonder how it's going to taste compared to the third batch (which was pretty fantastic imo!) Also picked up a bottle of Maker's Mark CS for a pretty good price, so that's nice. 
I'll be asleep at that time here in Australia; any chance someone could ask on my behalf whether the band plans to do any sideshows around Australia following their Splendour In The Grass appearance? 
The funny thing is that I was just about to post this same question.  With the resurgence of podcasting, I was looking for some local shows myself.I've just started my own at [www.randomconnections.com](http://www.randomconnections.com).  As the name might suggest, it's not just on history, but on a variety of topics.  So far there have only been two episodes.  The first was on SciFi, and the second on the historic headstone carvers of South Carolina.  Upcoming episodes will be about flea markets, ghost towns, shape note singing, all with a South Carolina flavor.You can [subscribe on iTunes here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/random-connections/id968365267?mt=2) 
There are many people who are looking to sublet their apartments over the summer. They usually post in our facebook "free and for sale" page. Unfortunately, you need an rpi email to access that page. But that's where people post. For example, someone posted just yesterday about subletting their apartment (313/mo/person). Another person posted a couple days ago (305/mo , no utilities). I'm hesitant to post their listings here without their permission. But if you'd like, I can give them your contact info.
For anybody into punk at any point in their lives, The Other F Word is great. It's about what happens when the fathers of punk age and become fathers of children, and how it can be difficult to lay down authority after you fought it so much.
Well, for as fantastical as the story is, it still needs to have some ground rules.  That would be the science part of the fiction...  The base assumption that we are all making is that what we know of physics is pretty right, and would be the same anywhere.Throw out your expectations, not your assumptions.  If you throw out the assumptions you have to wrestle with all the philosophical issues, like why does any of it exist, to the point that you get so bogged down you miss all the fun stuff, like firefly references. 
Wow, I *am* getting old. A proposition bet, more commonly known as a bar bet, is a bet that proposes something. A guy might say something like, "I'll bet you a drink that my cock hangs below my knees." If you accept, he then pulls up his pant leg and shows you something like [this](http://www.zhippo.com/SkinDeepInkTattooHOSTED/images/gallery/medium/ROOSTER.jpg).In the film Cool Hand Luke, a famous prop bet involved the eating of a shitload of hard boiled eggs. Usually though, there is a "trick" to the bet.
MTurk is having temporary server problems for everyone this evening. Just have to wait for the MTurk employees to fix it. At the moment, it appears to be mostly cleared up.

Just to let you know, unfortunately this draft comes right before finals. So no redditing. But I'm streaming the draft (in the background). Solidarity with my Jetsbros, and here's to a good draft!
I think when I read On Acting I remember that there were older people in in class too. But that is also great to hear. I am probably stressing / worrying about the "personal statement" in the application too much, but I do that.
The face was drawn by builderman himself in ms paint and then he died. Taking away the default face is like spitting on the grave of the person who is the sole reason for the existance of the game you're playing.
Considering the circumstances no, I don't think it's over the top. He was scaring me badly, so I left. And I already said he constantly looks at my main (alongside the rest of my social media)
Since there is no evidence, none at all, that Adnan strangled her and threw her in a ditch, just your (and others) "gut feelings," I'm always puzzled by people who make the argument that he did it, end of story.  On some level, it feels like (yes, I'm going to say it) racism. It's not intentional, just good old fashioned institutional racism on a subconscious level.  It happens -- Adnan is brown and Muslim and there is a lot of Islamophobia going around these days.
Not what he said, really. He is, I believe, speaking about people who feel entitled to tech jobs without putting in the work studying. I also work with a bunch of awesome women engineers. They're degreed.
I couldn't answer the phone until I heard her talking on the answering machine...but ONLY if she used the code, "I need a King's Kid to pick up the phone." My mentally handicapped brother got grounded once for picking up when he heard her voice but before she finished the code. 
My friends mum was crazy. She couldnt go to movies or watch any M rated movies until she was 18. Couldnt go to concerts, couldnt stay out past 9pm, couldnt wear anything that was ''too provocative'' (knee length is considered bad), wasnt allowed to catch public transport alone until 18, no dating. She was very sheltered, but has turned out to be the most wonderful person I know so her parents did something right. That and she is the life of any party now and clubs more than I sleep.. 
How would you build the 6.84 OD?He has so many options to choose from now.Octarine for the huge +stats and -40s cd?Aghs + Refresher?Blink dagger over force staff for initiation and self-escape?Oldschool scythe of vyse?
Not my colleague, but one of my friends had a teacher remark about a black student who isn't the brightest, but very hardworking. Apparently she said something along the lines of, "if we were at a plantation, he would be my right hand man." 
Who else has been in one of those situations where everything is forced and feels incredibly awkward and people keep making terrible jokes to ease some tension?That's what watching the official NFL stream is like right now.There's no tension to ease, but their "banter" is just really awkward right now.
Your link indicates that's something that  some PA member proposed. Netanyahu would never propose such a thing. I suspect the settlers would return, but they aren't stupid and would riot if such a deal were proposed . I don't think any of the negotiations ever floated such an idea. The international community would expect that Israel evacuate and remove any settlers in what would be deemed Palestinian territory.
My problem with the ending of Soul Eater is that friendship *did* have a place... and they just ignored it. They spent so long getting Maka, Black☆Star and Kid to work together as a team, and they spent the entire penultimate episode rescuing Soul because his and Maka's teamwork was so important... and then in the last episode they just threw that all away and had Maka beat the villain by herself. It didn't help that the penultimate episode built up hype for the final battle *really* well, but then the last episode was just kinda a let-down.
The way they were all shaking hands made it look like no one was coming back. Maybe it was just me, but it seriously looked like they thought the whole draft was over.
Pretty sure you've got it backwards. Non-necessary DLC is the kinda people generally *don't* have an issue with, because you can just ignore it. It's the stuff that adds important story elements and such that people get pissed off about.
The test is used quite commonly just as /u/majeric is doing right now as in indicator of negative inequality between the sexes which it does not do. I don't think MRAs have a problem with the test when used correctly they have a problem when it is used as a gage of discrimination. like a wet sponge being used as proof of a cyclone  (edit) my bad, changed it to mean "between the sexes" not sexuality 
&gt; what I mean is not too bigsmhAnyways, focus on spending that $300 for gym access and grow some balls to work out in public. Trust me, no one cares about anyone but themselves when they go to a gym
"This repository is an SDK contains the API and samples." [WTF](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/004/592/my-brain-is-full-of-fuck.jpg) Could you please repeat that?
Jesus, Hussie wasn't kidding when he said that these fake teens would sit around bullshitting to the bitter end.  There are going to be 7 more of these!
This whole thing sounds pretty odd, I'm going to wait until more details come out. Elsevier's not perfect but they're still one of the premier journal publishers out there, so it would seem strange to me for an editor to be strongly opposed to having them handle production and even stranger that he'd be sacked just for doing so.Edit: I can't access the medical site articles about this but they all say the issue was a 'staffing row'. I'll see if my wife can get them later.The press release claims that Elsevier is only going to handle production, they won't have any editorial control over the journal. I wonder if this is about some people at AMPco losing their jobs in production?
I've never played the games of any of my mains, ever.  Brawl: Toon Link and Lucas  Sm4sh: Marth, Pit, Dr Mario, Zelda and Ike (and soon Lucas as well)

My last day at work. Ended up pulling a double and dipshit boss let the guy who just got there leave early because we didn't need so many people on. Actually screamed FUUUUUUCK right outside the managers office after he failed to give any fucks. He was kinda scared of me after that
Yeah, that would be nice, ha. Every time I've heard a "oh my gosh I had that and" I've looked into it and it was ruled out. While I'm happy I don't have endometriosis, I would have at least had an answer.The thing about BC is at least something basic I can try.
Ya, I think that's how it works in lol, I know that's how it works in heroes, but in dota you can set individual hotkeys for quick cast and normal cast on all skill and item slots.
As long as the trust was their for Shirin to not use it, then it should have been done that way.  Also reminds me of what Spencer/Jeremiah should have done in S28. Had Jeremiah wear the idol during TC and then give it to Spencer to play. I don't think anyone has ever done anything like that, but it does involve a lot of trust.  Truth be told, if I was in that situation, I probably would screw the person over and just use the idol.
We might have got the better out of the two qbs. Sure Winston is a better pocket passer and has the size but Marita seems like the smarter man. I feel he will be able to adapt and so will we with guys like McCluster,Douglas  and Sankey. Our O line sucks so get the guy that can scramble. I'm do fuckinn excited 
Absolutely. The confidence such a man actually has, attracts younger women, often sick of the stupid gamesmanship of their male cohorts. And please, remember, we are talking about preponderance of occurrence, not any kind of absolute "every time" bullshit. There is literally nothing that works "every" time.
Dude. Neil Degrasse Tyson is a much better role model than Tupac, a guy who moved to California when he was 16, was involved in the death of a 10 year old boy in Marin City, repped Thug Life and hung out with gang members, before being killed at the age of 25.Seriously, how about you tell me what the fuck was so good about him that you'd rather have your kids look up to him than Neil Degrasse Tyson? Seriously? You'd pick a gangster rapper over the head of NASA as a role model?That is EXACTLY what is wrong with ghetto culture.Maybe YOU can tell me why Tupac makes a better role model for your kids than the head of NASA?
Say something, make a stink about it, fuck that guy. I work in a school (IT not a teacher, but still.) that should not be acceptable, I would say something to the principal and if that doesn't work send a message to the school board. If you can get names from classmates for a petition go for it, else I would honestly start smear campaign with quotes from his stupid fucking self and post them around the building. Also on a slow news day local stations might like a story about a teacher making an uncomfortable and "unsafe"  environment for students. 
I mean,..yes,.. it is an electronic-device,.. so technically speaking it does have a finite lifespan. The LCD-backlighting could "pop" tomorrow and you'd be done. or it might work for 5 years if properly taken care of. There's no way for me to know. My experience has been that they are pretty reliable. I have 3 or 4 of almost every iPad made,..and they are all still going strong. 
fuckin' casual. Do you even lift? You probably don't even like dat gushy gushy wet wet. You like weiner. WOW HOW CAN  YOU FUCK YOUR LIFE UP SO BAD. HAND IN YOUR NATTY CARD BITCH
It's described in the original Star Wars novelisation:&gt; It consisted primarily of a short, thick handgrip with a couple of small switches set into the grip.Above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger in diameter than his spread palm. Anumber of unfamiliar, jewellike components were built into both handle and disk, including whatlooked like the smallest power cell Luke had ever seen. The reverse side of the disk was polished toa mirror brightness.
I didn't hear this, but I was actually just talking to a coworker who told me this story. When my coworker was in high school, one of her teachers was infamous for calling students "Helen" whenever they did something foolish. As in Helen Keller. He would actually say, "What are you; deaf, dumb and blind? Helen!" A student apparently bought him a license plate that said Helen on it, and he hung it in his classroom proudly. What a jerk.
Sure, I just wish /r/space would have called out the Obama administration on doing this too, they have been gutting exploration to fund earth science. Dawn, New Horizons, Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity, Messenger - all Bush era programs that Obama got to take credit for. What has the Obama administration launched? /r/space/, you guys got fucked by Obama, and have been awfully quiet about it.
SO AWESOME. Seriously, the team and every member of the organization and event staff is amazing, hard-working, and incredibly talented. And we work at the best park in baseball for the BEST FANS in baseball! What else can you ask for?
I did it for my BSN program. Should work. Edit: I see what you mean. That's strange that it says only graduate nursing now. I did it in 2012 for undergraduate
Ours was. "There was a girl named 6, she had 9 boobs, she had 2 2 2 many. She went to 51 Street to meet Dr. X. Doctor X 8 her boobs, and now she's boobless.
Just a little spiritual teaching I heard: "things don't happen to you, they happen because of you." So, surely this person doing you unjust harm, is something to do with the way you are, essentially feedback on the way you are being? Obviously, this cannot be 100% true but still. Worth considering, before you hex the shit out of them.
What works best for me is a simple "Hello. I just want to remind you guys that this floor is a quiet area, and we need you to keep the volume down a bit so as not to disturb other patrons/students." If they don't quiet down after a few minutes I let them know that a quiet policy is not enforced on the other floors and they may be more comfortable there. If they're still loud after that I simply call security. 
I'm gonna be completely honest with you, and some may hate me for saying this, yet if you can get an R9 270x or 270, whether new, used, or on the hardwareswap subreddit, you're better off getting that instead. The GPU is the max that CPU can handle without bottlenecking. It's up to you though.
Ugh, I used to work the Haunted Mansion. Our standard spiel is "two or three bodies per buggy please". So of course they'll try to stuff three of their hambodies in there, causing the ride to stop and everyone having to shuffle around.
&gt;I hope that you like it when characters in stories talk to one another, because there's an awful lot of that to come. Please stand by patiently and enthusiastically as my fake teens sit around bullshitting to the bitter end. Then a bunch of cool stuff will happen, and that will be that! 
You can't just fucking turn up to a gym class and say you're trans-gender and they'll let you into the locker room. Nor will turning up in a skirt work either, it's a long term evaluated process. Think living as a women, permanently and psych evaluations and possible hormone treatments. Basically by the time you'd be allowed in the locker room you'd have tits yourself.

[DC Deck Builder: Heroes Unite](https://www.cryptozoic.com/games/dc-comics-deck-building-game-heroes-unite) is awesome. Has a great theme and replayability with the crisis pack and the alternative modes. Can't wait for the JSA crossover pack and Teen Titans version.
Clean and sober for 5 years off of heroin, coke, pills, yada yada yada. Started gear after almost two years of being stalled and frustrated in the gym.  Still figuring it all out, but I can relate to the feeling.  I look at it like this... I am actually trying to achieve a goal with my aas use.  Before I used with no goals and no purpose.  Is that rationalization?  Maybe, but my life is good and I feel great.  I can also pretty much guarantee that I'll never be sitting and sobbing with a syringe full of test because I can't find any more veins to shoot in.
Realistically we were never going to win the league, but in hindsight I think we will all look back at the months where Monreal and Debuchy were playing cover Centre Back and thinking what if. Really though, if we secure second and win the FA Cup, I'll be delighted. It's positive progress, and I think big things aren't very far away now.
&gt; and don't you have the ability to be just as good a player yourself?Bwawaaaaahhhhh!!!! My bronze ass. I'd probably do better against the NFL than I would against the LCS.
Putting up with his paranoia is all you've done wrong. He wants you to sacrifice your career to ensure you're not cheating? That is psychotic and controlling enough of a reason to GTFO.
I'd be up for it, but only experience I have with CE is beating Crota himself at the end. Would like to learn the rest though. 31 warlock with mic, maxed Gally and IB. Psn/ rhoddog12
Here's what the message is boiled down as simple as I can see itHuman nature is social. When resources are scare we tend to clan up and trade on what we can scavenge. This happens in all communities. When even that is threatened people get violent. You see it from Appalacia to Compton.
I had much the same experience on a winding, isolated road along a river in a rural area, only it was a deputy sheriff in what I assume was an unmarked SUV.  He wasn't very happy I flashed my brights at him, and he made sure to light me up with everything he had when he pulled me over.
I would say the Rangers are my second team, but I'm fairly confident that my Sabres are going to take the cup, so I don't even have to think about settling for number two.
Or maybe just take it upon yourself to be a more thorough reader when this subject comes up. It seems important to you to have "actually seen it happen" I'm sure /u/ellibound truly appreciates being given "another shot" at proving her statement is 100% correct to you, but since you seem so invested in finding proof that's been accurately screencapped, make it your homework! Luckily those comments tend be frequent when discussing topics like this, so it shouldn't take you that long .
They don't.  That's the whole point of science - to continuously question.It is not "theories as much as God is a theory" - it's continuously testing the best theories you can make.And some things are actual facts, not theories.
I actually went to 5 different places to get quotes and look at artists work and they all loved the tattoo so that part about the artists laughing in your face is completely false.  And personally, I'd be flattered if someone loved a design I did enough to use it.  Lastly,  I'm genuinely curious about the last comment. Why will they blob together?
Having been someone that was very disrespectful and aggressive like this kid, and who naturally proceeded to get my ass beat - it didn't make me more respectful, it just made me feel humiliated and angry. I very nearly brought a knife to school later on to murder the guy who beat me. I'm a completely different person now not because I got 'some respect beaten into me' but because, with a lot of help and understanding, I gradually started to understand I was making other people's lives hell. I realised it was possible to get respect without being an asshole all the time.

As a pedestrian I am curious why it is okay for cyclists to endanger pedestrians on the sidewalk? The majority of cyclists do not, but I have had my share of cyclists come up from behind, most without warning. 
How dare they ever have a good or positive thought! They should live in constant shame and emotional torment. That always makes *me* want to get out of bed and exercise!
And neither do you. If we take your logic THAN NORMAL would include their own practices being just as dangerous if not more so than the helmetless ones. I'm telling you this isn't dangerous. You're insinuating they should continue their dangerous tackling habits and not try and fix something dangerous. This is a move in the right direction, you're just stuck on DIFFERENT EQUALS BAD. You are not correct.

Tie fabric is usually classified as such. Most of the nomenclature has to do with the weave of the fabric. For example a silk twill vs silk faille. Also ties can be made in other fabrics as long as you cut it on the bias (45° to grain line )
Why do I deserve to win? Well I think I deserve to win just as much as the next commenter. Why I should win in particular is that I'll happily share the wealth with my big brother. He's constantly spoiling me, giving me the life he didn't have. So by giving him Ike, I would feel like I've done a good deed. That's one of his favorite Characters, along with Falcon and jiggs.

Do it!  Short girls make awesome lifters because we don't have to move the weights as far :)If I were you, as a new lifter, I'd just do Starting Strength at first and eat at maintenance (or at least not think about diet too much) at first.  You will notice changes in your body within the first ~2 months...don't focus too much on how much you weigh or how you look at first, just focus on getting stronger, and the rest tends to fall into place.  After you've been at it for a while...that's when you might want to mess around with diet.  Cutting too much will leave you passing out on the platform!
Old profile: my summary was a list of things I liked rather than things about me. It also prominently mentioned feminist blogs. I still read the blogs; I just don't talk about them. Old and current profile: selfiesssss and idgaf they work. 
Am I the only FE player that likes EXP grinding? Sacred Stones is the game to beat as far as I'm concerned. Having units stand next to each other at the end of a battle for 30 turns to gain support conversations? I think yes. Also the stupid boat level.

Woah, my previous comment was a joke about the lack of affection felt by most Europeans towards Europe as a concept (plus I must admit a jab at the bizarre convention of having military displays and heavy handed national symbology before sporting events) , not a jingoistic attempt at one-upmanship. The use of anti-semitic, racist, and otherwise discriminatory language in public, particularly prevalent as you mentioned at events such as football games, is indeed deeply troubling, but not quite as prevalent as your comment would suggest. 
Did they all come in around the same time? If so can you please share it? It sort of seems like they are working all day and then mass dumping the information to us at the end of the day. Thoughts?
&gt; However both jokes are awful to make to the people who were there, I'd imagine.But not for the Romans, what makes me respect American soldiers more than Roman soldiers?????
That video is intentionally misleading. Notice the quills all do the same amount of damage; this means he had 10 stacks of quills on the svens before the video started.
I started crying at half time, i was in complete disbelief how horribly they played. I would rather watch a close game like the 2005 or 2006 GF than that game! 
YES. A firmware update to make this possible would make me so happy. The folder would be filled with all killscreens of rajang, just so I can cry/motivate myself for another run and rejoice in that bitch's death.

Yea but 15 years of being horribly disfigured to the point where people thought he was a ghoul would make him a hundred times more psychologically in need if you ask me.
If you can do it get a friend to take you (should be less than an hour procedure if you are doing in office) or get a cab there and back. While I wasn't in horrible pain it would have been a bitch to drive home. Don't jiggle the boys any more than you have to for the first week.
Yeah, plus a really unflattering picture. In the other picture she doesn't even look that bad - definitely not haggard. Like you said, she's gained weight and isn't wearing makeup. 
My high school American Lit teacher used this poem as an example of writing in which many people try to find a deeper meaning that isn't there. In her words: "Don't thos plums sound delicious? Wouldn't you eat them? I would!" Same woman described a pop-up book edition of the Kama Sutra as "Penises! Penises everywhere!"You're a beautiful human being, Mrs. Shoemaker.
Thanks for your leads. Here is a picture as requested. I have a guy who wants to trade me a colt delta elite 10mm for it and that seems more than fair. http://imgur.com/A8ltVgy. Not sure on size of dot, but intensity is adjustable depending in how far the knob is turned.
Yup. I'm at over 1000 hours if I include alpha and beta and I have to say, Gjallarhorn is well worth it. It was my own fault I didn't buy it from Xur when I had the chance 
So u are bugged i guess, the last boss is a error trigger, i killed Thaumaturge once and bugged, cant use anything except quest. Now i started again but not battle anything just quest to get resources, ima w8 for update to save my game lol, tired of resets.
Veins are one of those genetics type things. Some people have amazing veins despite either extreme of weight. There are some fat people I love to stick and some skinny people I dread seeing. The biggest thing, though.. I work in a very rural part of the south. My patients are very low on the socio economic ladder and they've no regard for their health. Period. I feel like I never stick any normal people because they're either really, really fat or strung out on meth and weigh ninety pounds. The fat people always smell worse. I have a hard time getting the tourniquet tight enough. I've seen yeast in the antecubital space. Many are rude. They just gross me the fuck out. Generally they are harder stick, yeah.
I have listened to Migos Cross the Country just about every day since I first heard it about a month or two ago. Best trap song I think I have ever heard.
But she's not like "Oh hey don't talk to him he's mine" she's just trying to get his attention in a more subtle way. I wouldn't think it's that bad unless he told her to stop and she didn't.
Caps waiting for puck to come to them, passes not connecting - you know, Caps 1st period hockey. But started to look a little better prior to the PP. Oh, and killed another penalty.
&gt; Matt never said it was coming today.I never said he did. My point was that he regularly posts store banners and the like without any indication of how he came across the files. As  Belvedere just showed, Matt got the file from the Dota 2 website. Matt is quiet about sources so as to make people think that he's got inside knowledge of Valve. 
&gt;Because then .. we couldn't actually deride her .. we'd just have to pity her.Oh you sweet summer child. MEK and their cult leader are way past the point of ridicule and well into the land of pity.
I just run around the tower taking selfies with random people and send it to them in messages. What you're doing is much more creative, but I wouldn't get confused people messaging me back for it.
I'm American, yeah. Most of the reason I debate here in the first place is because of how influential religion is in my daily life, usually through politics.
Five is pretty much the lower bound of Dixit - it depends on whether she has a fully developed Theory of Mind yet. If she has not, then Dixit will be an exercise in frustration as she doesn't understand that your mind works differently than hers.
The dude is funny on Twitter. That's his thing. There are a lot of people, myself included, who use Twitter as a platform for humor (he's more of a mix between humor and day-to-day stuff, but still). Just don't follow him if you don't want to see it.
I think it is a great idea, but if you are going to be presenting this it is going to be very distracting to the audience because of the proportion changes in almost every frame. It would only take you 2 or 3 hours to redo this in chemsketch and the proportions would be correct. You also might want to consider working on a grid to avoid movement of the structure off center on each frame which is also pretty distracting. This might sound picky. but people are going to notice the imperfections first and then wont be paying attention to the main idea.    
Depends on if the planet suits it or not -- most of Tatooine and Hoth is open and barren, because that's how the planets are, compared to more mountainous, forested, or urban planets that aren't as barren. One of the things I disliked about SWG, some planets were a bit too open, and you could just drive up and over stuff which didn't make sense whatsoever, giant canyons, big mountains, etc
Thats what I thought, but I went to report a user for scamming and didnt see anything pertaining to sharing of an account and it just got me wondering.
Again, if you take the time to quote the things you're replying to, I'll reply in detail.  If its too much work for you to quote the relevant things I said you're replying to, why should I put in the work to go look up whatever you're talking about?  That's why we have quotes here.  If you were interested in having a discussion, you'd facilitate that.  But if you're unwilling to use quotes and just want to throw a bunch of sentence at me without context, I'm unwilling to take the time to reply to you in detail.
I'm with you there. I don't identify as a feminist either, for all of the reasons /u/Lluxx listed, but mostly the first point listed. I'm not interested in directly supporting the feminist movement, and so I don't feel that I can really call myself a feminist. 
I was just shocked it wasn't downvoted into oblivion.One of the posts on /r/videos has some of the most vile thinking I ever saw. And with so many upvotes, it disheartened me.
Dante Fowler Jr number 3. Wasn't there another DE that was ranked higher than him and everyone thought was better?Edit: Leonard Williams is who I was thinking of.
&gt; I believe you're using the nomenclature improperly.You do not get to make up what words means. I seen routine usage of term "paper rocket" for rockets that have existing physical hardware, but not flied. "Paper rocket" does not mean literally rocket that exists only on paper. It means rocket that is completely unproven, without any successful launch.
No problemFor me it was just a matter of calling a few weeks after I did my medical for an update..they said everything checked out so I would assume they would know before you get a letter in the mail.Don't want to answer your second question for fear of giving you the wrong info..but as an infantry applicant myself I know thats where my med file went along with many others so assume yours is going there too.Good luck!
&gt; That's pretty neat.Sorry, now I think your [this guy](http://static.fjcdn.com/comments/That+s+pretty+neat+_985210cab35ac0b5ab8eaa80de025170.jpg) lol.
Ugh, I hated that Battle. It looks like an old PS2 game, *and* it has Yoda... fighting... with a lightsaber...I actually liked a lot of the earlier parts of the movie better. Chasing the changeling assassin? Fun, felt like what I always hoped the prequels should have been, if only for a few minutes. Obi-Wan's fight with Jango on Camino? Excellent. Everything else was garbage.
You're still not getting it. With a bicycle you're still not disconnecting the wheels from the power source manually. This is what I prefer about a manual transmission, not simply the fact that I can select a gear. It's the clutch not the stickIt's not an argument. I love driving stick and won't go back to auto until I'm too old or crippled to drive it anymore.
Has anyone noticed how legally shaky this argument is? This requires taking a *very* broad reading of "substantial burden", and proving that abortion is an actual part of her religious practice (rather than her religion just having no objections to abortion). Using the same logic, I could sue a state for not allowing the sale of liquor after 9pm, since I don't have any religious objections to drinking.
Non-black: Culture has accomplished something more advanced than wiggling around a twig in a termite mound at suppertime. Non-black comes to the U.S. and does something related to their culture or is just grateful for a steady job, relatively safe atmosphere and a decent home. Assimilation follows in a couple of generations.Black: Nigs gonna nig.
I met up with a guy I had only met once at a bar through mutual friends.  We were supposed to go out to dinner then meet friends, but he said he forgot his wallet at his place and would I like to come up to see his apartment- to which I agreed.  We get up to his apartment and he starts asking if I'm into Astral Projection, and saying its the most liberating thing. Asking "Do you want to try it? you could try it now, I could lead you..." I kept saying "It really isn't my thing, I'm not really into that spiritual stuff."  He had given me a drink and kept saying drink up then we'll go, but feeling a little freaked out, I said I needed to eat before I drank anything. Later found out he was hard into hallucinogens.  Dunno if he just made me a drink or was so fuct that he thought he'd liberate me with an outer body experience whether I wanted one or not. He never once tried anything sexual either, so I think he really just wanted someone to trip with him.     
&gt;Seriously, can you imagine a dark, complex Optimus Prime?Batman's parents died, and he got really dark and moody.Optimus Prime's entire world died - imagine how dark and moody he could get.
I used to just ignore and scoff at the ponies when visiting r34 sites. Eventually I thought, with so much pony porn, there must be something to the show.  So I watched it.
I don't mean to be rude - but 15 years later you want the guy to get excited? Lol, I'd probably be like "yeah and........?"It would be hard to get excited about it after already spending most of your life in prison. Also, we need to be careful, just because people react in different ways than us, doesn't mean they are acting wrongly :) Just fyi - I actually think he is most likely guilty.

Gigi is in the second and third pictures with the red/orange pen, Third picture on the right central. Reads Gigi Buffon, the B looks like a P in the photo, looks like he didn't connect the B, which looks odd in comparison to me. 
Yeah, I have been offered a free one month premium acct and was wondering the best way to use it for reaching out to advertising a/d for building freelance relationships.
I know, that's not what I was trying to say. I mean I could have sworn he had a jab at Opie, but I'm probably confusing it. I know he won't spend his time like that.
I'm really glad they did the responsible thing and hotfixed this. Though I'm sure they're crazy busy getting ready for release, and some of them might still be comatosed from the Heroes of the Dorm after party. This helps out the people actively playing a lot.PS. Fuck the people that intentionally abused this shit to get easier wins &lt;3
Just to make a few more from the top of my head, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Mario Kart 7, *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, Fantasy Life, and there's a new NN3DS exclusive called Xenoblade. I don't think all of them have demos, but consider them if they don't by looking up some gameplay on YouTube or reading some reviews.*And I forgot, there are also free games and they're not half-bad for short burst playing: Pokemon Shuffle and Pokemon Rumble World.Happy gaming!
How can they put fourth an effort when nothing can be done? There is literally nothing that can be done by police officers. How are you supposed to put out an APB for a stolen bike? Most bikes look pretty much the same, and require very specific descriptions to differentiate. Then, even if an officer found the bike with someone, how are you supposed to prove it's yours?It's not like this problem only happens to bikes, pretty much any kind of property theft works out this way. Police certainly don't organize huge busts trying to find things like a PS3 or diamond ring. Pretty much the only property police are able to retrieve with some success is cars, because they are something you can't hide as easily and they have unique identifiers easily visible (the license plate, and if it's removed there are lots more discrete serials hidden throughout the components).
You don't have to change anything except the order of the list and eliminate one of the commas. "Among those interviewed were Kris Kristofferson, Robert Duvall and Merle Haggard's two ex-wives.""This book is dedicated to God, Ayn Rand and my parents.""Highlights of Peter Ustinov's global tour include encounters with an 800-year-old demigod, a dildo collector and Nelson Mandela."I think the first two are much more clear. Maybe the third one is still a little ambiguous, but I think it reads more naturally and is easy enough to decipher through context.

Sanders is running in the Democratic *primary* - he isn't running in the Presidential election as an independent and unless there's a huge amount of support for him outside of the Democrat party, I don't think he will run in 2016 as an independent.
I wont disagree to the logic behind your comment at all because frankly you're very correct. I believe the tool list has just never been considered (at least not in my local) as a requirement for change in contract so it's been left after all these years. There are certain tools that people won't give grief over for having but the tool list is mostly to get a good grasp of items. The real key is that you are to only require hand tools and I'm sure all if not MOST locals would not require any power tools to be personally supplied.
So how would you protect all the property in the city of Baltimore.What if you only protected your own house in a riot. Are you racist against those people in the other homes?I think I've just always seen racism as an active thing, not a passive inherent thing. I might be wrong on that thinking. I mean I am a white person in Los Angeles. That does not give you the typical experience of America. I've been the majority race in maybe 50% of life experience depending on how you view it. For instance Caucasian was the majority in my university, but within my school and major and most classes I was a minority. And I now drive through watts and south central at least once a week in the course of my job.
I have to disagree.  Mr Magoo consistently gets out of every situation,  but i doubt you would say that isnt plot armor.  How does he do it?  Plot armor.  How does batman dodge bullets? Plot armor.

So. Much. Cologne!I'm convinced the first Abercrombie was originally european night club that raved so hard Europeans exploded and their form-fitted clothing few off their bodies and folded neatly into piles. Once the police arrived on-scene they entered a darkly-lit building full of folded clothing too tight for the average person, and with far too many industrialized rips. Only the siren of euro-club techno throbbing in their ears and choking fumes of over-sprayed cologne left the deafening and pungent signs of the stereotypical Europeans which had once occupied this space.

Goddamit you all, no matter how we listen to this BLUR HAS A NEW FUCKING ALBUM! Do you remember when *Under The Westway* was released and we all thought a new album was around the corner and then had to wait 3 more years, not even sure after a year if a new album was on the way?Fucking yes.

It's a Tanabata Jirachi, an event Pokemon. It's worth that much, as absurd as it may sound.Competitive shiny Pokemon are much easier to come by with the use of /r/SVExchange :) 
I dont know if anyone uses this method or not. But i use 1.65@800DPI and i use my wrist for aiming and use the letters C and V for left and right sharp turns. Been using it for almost 10 years now. The low sens helps me get accurate aim in duels and the letters help me with quick turns like 180 shots. Once you get the coordination down you can be pretty consistent with combining the letters for turning and your mouse movement. 
Well, when the patient it's 100% ready to be discharged from the hospital we will call up social services and they will do what they can. Those guys are heroes. I just kill some maggots and take dead skin off. Guys at social services will try their best to internt this patients in a municipal shelter or something equivalent. There are very few available. The patient most likely will not want to remain in the shelter (mental health problem + drug addiction) and will drift off.
it definitely would take a little while and should be careful. it seems that the more amethyst unpoofed the more unstable her body became. the gems risk giving themselves physical adnbormalities that could hinder them.

Looking at the picture of the big cat thing and the dogs eating the raw meat - "WTF, they're just giving them raw meat?!  That could make them really sick, wtf?!"Then seconds later:  "Verily, I am a dumbass."
For one you basically need to:1. Read in the number *as a string*2. Loop over the string, accumulating the number according to the rules of positional notation.To use 9876 as an example.* You can convert the character '9' to the digit 9 by subtracting the character '0' from the character '9'.* You want to end up with a number like 9\*1000 + 8\*100 + 7\*10 + 6\*1This can be done by starting with the number 9 and shifting digits to the left via multiplication by 10:          9    (x10) 90    (+8)  98    (x10) 980    (+7)  987    (x10) 9870    (+6)  9876You might want to implement in another language first to make sure you get the logic right. This process is similar to the C `atoi` function.

The level of complacency with health, careers, and almost everything else in society today disgusts me. The only person who can change your situation is you. If you're ok with where you are, great; but don't bitch about people looking better and making more money when they actually put some work into their lives. I couldn't agree more, OP
http://www.hurstbeans.com/recipes/285/Hursts-HamBeens-Vegetarian-15-Bean-SoupHave you ever made 15 bean soup?  It calls for onions and I add a good amount of diced carrots and ham hocks for flavor.

Good luck!Edit:  Recipe on the back of the bag
I think it's best for Italian football if other teams start becoming stronger. Otherwise, if Juve has no competition in the league, they won't be pushed to improve and will begin to struggle in European competition.
They edited their errors.It was a joke. The joke is now gone and now it looks like a malicious attack against a nations intelligence instead of just pointing and laughing at the errors of one person.
Too bad the rest of the bosses are not as responsive. Kinda lazy on Blizz' part considering it doesnt take that much work to come up with several lines for each boss.
You don't understand. The science modules did not have to go with, even if you didn't bring a scientist.  Any kerbal can approach a science module and remove the data rendering the science part inoperable.  This is very important for long duration missions because it saves a lot of mass.  
I have the argon oil one for my 2B/2C hair and I love it. If you put it in when your hair is a bit drippy, it spreads better. You will feel like you're using too much, but it's not. Then let the gel cast set while you diffuse or air dry. Once fully dry just scrunch out the crunch and it will hold all day. 
Ain't that the truth?!?!  My Ngrandparents were wealthy and tried to control everyone with money. Friends and family. Of course friends came and went very quickly. They died with no friends and very little family who cared. Zero worshipers.

For sure man, if you ever come to Berlin, we gotta smoke up.But yeah, exactly, that's the main axiom of absurdism as I see it, freedom on consciousness, freedom to act. Oh man, I love that feeling of... you know when you have some ideas in your head but don't know how to express them eloquently? Then one day you are reading some book and find that the author is just describing what you had in mind in the most beautiful way possible. I totally recommend you to read Camus' books. Or for that matter, you could probably also enjoy Sartre's Nausea. Fucking loved that book.

I don't think those could be switched. Lol. I learned cursive in grade.. 3? I had my personal finance class in grade 10. Imagine trying to teach 8 year olds about personal taxes. Lol. I mean, we probably learned about sales tax as an example of multiplication, but not income taxes.

I don't think they should nerf weapons unless the class as a whole is overplayed(Demo). Rather, buff the other weapons until the class has many options and playstyles.
In my opinion probably not.This is one of those fighting games that people play religiously. You'll want to play the story mode to see which character you like, however the downpour is is that the story mode gets old QUICK. People will quickly point out "You don't buy fighting games for the story mode option", however if you're new to the game and/or want to find out what characters you like the most appropriate option is to play the story mode. Which is complete shit let's be honest.

It's probably only PvE players because there was never any reason to have PvP content there until now. This is the first end game PVP content we've seen, and now there's a reason to form groups to smash the opposing team. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens, but I don't think finding a group will be a problem. 
I was about to... I got an offer around this past Christmas. They have recruiting for students around October or November I think. You can check it out on their websites. I remember seeing a pretty detailed schedule of the recruiting timeline. However, the big4 in HK are desperate for help and you can basically apply at anytime during the year if you have some experience. That is what I did. I applied sometime in late November and heard back from them beg Dec. there isn't really a "best time" to apply unless you're a student (in which you would apply during recruitment season). 
Same here, I've had a lot of luck with FL and okcupid (met my wife on okc, in fact). It's tough finding poly accepting folks in some areas, I'm lucky to be in an area that is much more open to that, which is super surprising since we're also the home of Focus on the Family. 
I'd go insane if I did 20...I got out a year ago after my four, and I got into dental school, which the VA is paying for.  As I said, I don't regret a thing.  I probably wouldn't have got into dental school without the military experience.  My degree was Biology B.A. with the med/dent pre-reqs completed.
You are correct! The thought of shooting a scene but having to be a mile away to do it is hilarious. Obviously it's not built for this purpose but it's a funny thought.
The question is now if this is more due to fnatic being an overall healthier team than elements. I just think it is hard to doubt that Rekkles is a better ADC then Steelback if you just look at the fnatic games from last split and last summer.
His independence is exactly what will be appealing to most undecided voters. And I think you're missing a big distinction - Sanders is running for the Democratic nod. It's not like he's just running to run - it's win or bust. He's in the race already, so just being there gives him a chance, especially against Hillary. I'm a fan of Hillary, I'll admit, but I love Bernie. He has my vote and a heck of a lot of others' votes too.
I have an ML3RC  It plays extremely well, neck profile, fret access , the works.  Pickups sound alright full but dreadful split.  Electronics feel kinda crappy (scratchy push/pull etc.)  Cosmetics aren't great, you can see a lot of tooling marks on the neck and fingerboard, and the finish isn't perfect.  IMO it's a decent guitar, but not worth the money.
In many cases, yes.But some dogs have [extreme loyalty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachikō) that lasts [until they die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyfriars_Bobby).
Hi! My friend and were going to start developing games as a hobby. Seeing as you are THE guy who made Deus Ex, do you have any tips for game development? Thanks! :)
That is true. However House isn't a proven pitcher being in his sophomore year. I just think if a pitcher has been struggling through all of his first four starts something needs to be done.
There are answers to all your questions.  However, it requires you to invest time in study.  If I simply gave you all the answers you wouldn't accept them.  If you really care you could look them up and have answers in just a few hours. 
Vancounver and Edmonton are probably up there too, I'd guess. But Winnipeg, unfortunately, has just developed a negative connotation that sticks with people.I mean, how many times have you told someone, "I'm from Winnipeg", and someone just looks at you and goes, "of course you are".
In the less traditional area, I thought about using some traditional mongolian music for the Unicorn clan instead of japanese stuff after I discovered Tengger Cavalry recently.It's probably too metal to use as background music, but imagine a Unicorn cavalry charge to [Tengger Cavalry's War Horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUja-wrQVgs).I'll need to look into less metal mongolian music. :)
IANAL however assuming that Rabia and Adnans brother were at one time the sole possessors  of CG files, no judge in their right mind would rule in favor of IAC. I'll let a real lawyer weigh in on the precedence of this but if there isn't a second unadulterated version of CG's records how could any judge not assume that the defendants advocates could tamper with the source material. How could anyone prove what may or may not have been in those files? 
The part where white people don't drive 30 minutes into the inner city specifically to murder black people, and vice versa. Also the part where you're likely a two-week-old Chimpire alt account.
I'd be really happy with that myself, that way 3/4 of the starting secondary is solidified. If we don't trade away our younger defensive talent that unit could finally be a beast again. Really wish JJ were still around to get a crack with these guys.
We get it. You're the Last Angry Man, standing up for democracy against an almost unstoppable tide of progress and equality. All those gay-hating, think-of-the-children No voters must be so glad you've got their backs. 
Extremely sexiness. My husband has a legit man crush on Lundqvist. Although the grey in his beard this year is a little bit of a downer for me. He needs some of that brush through beard color they keep advertising on these channels. 
That's been the popular opinion so far, that dynasties have no place in office and that we don't need another Bush *or* Clinton in office. Even Barbara Bush said, before Jeb expressed interest, that "if we can't find more than two or three families to run for higher office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great people eligible to run."
Not a teacher myself, but my middle school gym teacher once told us to divide up into teams by saying, "Beaners over here, whites over there." She was fired pretty soon after. 
Seems like a good thread to bring this up; if I am Atma/Alex grinding as PLD and I equip one Animus weapon and one Zenith weapon (Zenith Holy Shield + Animus Curtana, or vice versa) would I have a chance to get am Atma and a piece of Alexandrite? Should be easy to do since you can repurchase the i80 relic from the Calamity Scavengers in each city.

Hind sight is 20/20. You have no idea whether they are armed or not. These idiots have no idea how much they are turning people away from having empathy or sympathy for there situation. I'm not from the US, but reading about these incidents just makes me think "That's why the police beat your ass every chance they get".Seeing the brutality that the police are responsible for is just as fucked up, they are even bigger cowards then these teens.
&gt; I've been in the staff room when it's been announced that a kid has been kicked out of school and everyone has stood up clapped and whooped!Woah. What did the kid do?
Mostly Pokemon. I used to play Melee, Brawl, Double Dash, and Mario Party 5 a lot, but not so much nowadays. Been meaning to get into League of Legends, but no time. :(
So, as I understand it, you asked a question about financing but are getting opinions on your relationship and what OTHER people would or did do when buying their rings...Honey, you buy what you two want her to have. After the ceremony, after the cake has been eaten, after the guests have depart and the dress and flowers have been discarded that ring will still be on her finger (for MANY years). If it makes you two happy then it is a good use of your money. Hopefully, someone in this thread will give you some good advice about financing. 
#According to IMDB this is NOT the finale of the season there are two more episodes to go this season.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/episodes?ref_=tt_eps_sn_mrThis is a public service announcement.... carry on with being extremely confused about this episode and wondering WTF Shonda is thinking.
it was from the standpoint of people being atheist after having been christian but that is not all atheists, which the title would have implied. it was not about any of the logical arguments or writings and whatnot.yeah, reddit is very judgemental especially atheists lol. plot twist: i'm a minister and i get judged, attacked, and harassed by the people who claim to not be judgmental
As a recent UCLA alum, I can guarantee that our stadium isn't ever half as full as the ones pictured. I'd also like to brag that I played on those courts earlier today :)
Yeah it has money wise, but it has never been where you can get more magic log killing a boss than chopping magic logs. (not including all the other drops.) So you're clearly missing the point.
Well, I look forward to playing some Smash with you in any case. Don't sweat about the name, it could mean anything as far as your teacher is concerned. 
Pick a character who you already like and who isn't terrible to play as. Maybe you're loyal to a particular series, or maybe one of the characters just looks cool. Screw around in training mode for a while until you find something. Then search the character's name on /r/crazyhand and read read read. Think about and practice the strategies you see mentioned there.But don't always play to win, either. Maybe you're just happy because you kicked a bad habit or landed a really good down smash or something. When you're sick of playing, walk away for a while.
Yeah! Though I would be looking forward to the Fallout 3/ New Vegas series that may hopefully happen. If anything, that would be a kind of bridge-gap. 
I know you've answered the previous question a few times, but never really elaborate.  What's involved in being a "head ice tech"?  Is that something you need specialized training for, or is it something that any Zamboni driver could technically do, but Bob's been here for 40 years so he just keeps doing it until he dies?
Nothing really, but it seems like once you buy on the first thing any one dose is mod them even if it is just new exhaust or removing some of the things like the throttle override and parking brake assembly, that just wind up causing headaches at some point. But for the most part I meant it is hard to find a completely bone stock one and stock parts are a nightmare to sell, heck go to a forum and try to give your stock exhaust away for free it will be more effort than it is worth.
They don't have to. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
When i set them as primary and secondary I get the error message "The WAN IPv6 address is not valid" and it won't let me apply the setting changes.Is there something I can put into the IPv6 address to be able to push the changes through?
It's nothing to do with him or what Kelly wants. Most of us *wanted* Mariota, but knew it was really, really unrealistic and were so tired of the hype and constant talk like it was going to happen.
an aggressive limit order. Profits are profits and waiting for a special number like 50% is great way to turn lots of winners into losers. The market only gives you so many chances to take a profit. You're lways on to the next trade. the bigger the sample size the better the results. The premium is set at entry. your profits will smooth out like a bell curve in the end.
I went to two of the shows when they toured together. Incredible. I have a couple of the videos saved somewhere but I really enjoyed this one thank you!
I think it's not about content (which there's already a ton of) but if you say open up twitch look how many people view hearth vs Hex, how many more streamers too. Blizzard has the edge with their huge following and coming out sooner, we as a community have to spread the word
The Silverstone isn't a very high quality PSU. I'd take the Leadex Gold [here](http://www.prisguide.no/produkt/super-flower-leadex-80plus-gold-1000w-220634). It's a very good PSU. You could do with 850W however (unless you are going to be overclocking/overvolting the GPU's). 
We've got programming exits every step of the way :) we're calling them "Oracle Stops" similar to how on the Oracle you can exit your color set programming after each one.
I spent about $1700 all told, but I'm in IT and it is my workhorse travel laptop. That included a pair of docks and all manner of what not with it. I live and die by this machine, so it is worth it for me. 
&gt; Yeah, that is your opinion but it is wrong.I don't think that's how opinions work. &gt; Death penalties do nothing to deter violenceThat's not the main point of the death penalty.&gt; Innocents will be executed and have been executedRaise the standards of proof then for the death penalty. A the very least, the death penalty is good in theory. In practice, there are many murder trials where it is pretty clear who the guilty party is.&gt;Until people realize that we are supposed to have justice system and not a revenge system, the US will continue to be a laughing stock of the first-world in many things including the practice of executions.How is executing someone after due process and years of appeals considered "revenge" but locking them up for life is not? Losing your own life after you take another is a pretty clear case of justice. An eye for an eye. 
I am honestly blown away by how miserable so many people think law school is. Sure it is stressful (particularly 1L year), but I didn't find it to be any different than undergrad. 
In your list of requirements you forgot skill and pride, nice work.. and the 'We Recycle' sign really makes sense in the way you reused what may have otherwise been waste.Now wtf is the garbage bag thing? Never mind, pretty sure I don't want to know..Up vote for coming to your senses on the roof issue, am sure the tenants will approve as well. Generations of them.
And if it finishes level it's a draw not a tie, they're boots not cleats, its a shirt/kit not a jersey/uniform, and there's no S at the end of 'offside'
I played that game after playing extensively the earlier Lucas Arts "Battle of Britain" flight combat sim. It's a strange feeling looking back at the sparse pixels. BoB was 16 color; SWOTL had 256!
My book group is split down the middle on this one, so I'm hoping you can answer it. Are the parallels between Arlen and Jesus intentional? (We see him as a youth, then a large gap until he's older. He's the "Deliverer" a religious figure.) Is he meant to be the second coming of Christ? Were your trying for religious undertones, or just borrowing? 
The only law I know of is about the legitimate reason.  If you use your knife and arrowhead for your work, and can prove it, you're good.  And if it's a non-threatening knife, most of the cops will probably let you go.  Here in france the only law about knives is : sharp things are not allowed.  I still carry my crkt K.I.S.S. everyday, and twice I got pulled over because of it, once by a cop, once by a mall security guard. Both times they let me go and all the cop told me was "don't flail it around".
Yeah I noticed in 2013 when he had a bad season at the plate he looked tense batting. Then last year he was killing it until late August/September and he looked much more relaxed. Now he looks tense again and it just seems like he's trying too hard to hit one out.
Never would've thought I'd see Blue Streak getting discussed on reddit.  Loved this movie as a kid and I'll always love how he accidentally wowed the entire police force at every turn.  Of course it's dumb but this'll always be one of my favorites from when I was little. 
Alright, I ran the ping test on my wife's laptop, and the ping was way better. It was almost always 34-35, but the highest it went was 120, once. The ping spikes on my laptop were up to 500 ms.[Here are the inSSIDer results](http://imgur.com/pmcjMsj). I had changed channels to channel 3 on another person's suggestion.I take it that this means there is a problem with my laptop adapter?
Yeah I tried editing my comment but I'm on mobile. I just figured people would assume I meant that he Fucked a chick anal and then she sucked him off. But this is the internet where if someone can try to make you look stupid then they will.
It's true - all the cool kids are doing it. And when has peer pressure hurt anyone, really?Now if you'll excuse me, Jimmy Henderson is jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, so it looks like I'll have to go too. Thanks, mom.
They have a system where people can donate on the Nexus. But people don't donate; like Robin said in the discussion, the donations modders receive are very minimal.
Shiro's Chimera. Halp me. I love the colour so much but cannot get it to work. I've tried patting, swiping, primer, bare skin, and I can't get it to apply evenly - some patches are deep, dark grey and some patches are light taupe/silver, whatever I try. I love it so much but I cannot justify keeping it unless I find a way to make the damn thing work.
I like "this is wrestling" when it isn't over-used (as in, chanted during more than one match per show) because it's a nice little nod to what fans want between those ropes.
That's a damn fine amp.  Same spec as the 360.4 .. I've run 3 different versions of that Zapco powerclass over 15 years (AG, REF, DC) .. Bridges 180x2 watts of A/B goodness.
Ok agreed but have you seen EoE?edit: I guess if you consider the TV ending the "ending", then yeah it is pretty bad. I personally consider EoE the ending but i can since the literal show's ending was those last 2 episodes I can see where you've coming from.
Something something vomit something go home with ugly stranger something something buy crack something urinate on the carpet something something wake up in the psych ward. This was not only one occasion.
Combine pushy sales people with a mysterious filtering algorithm and there will be people who are absolutely, swear-to-god certain that Yelp is fucking them over.  Most of the time I see "proof" of this posted on reddit, it is some family restaurant with a bunch of filtered 5 star reviews from users who have reviewed nothing but that restaurant.
Well it's not fraud if you aren't lying so just don't lie and you'll be fine.  Also, I'm pretty sure that most of the colleges have a VA office that I found very helpful for transitioning from the military to college.
I'm a relatively new knitted and I love this pattern, but seed stitch is impossibly slow-- flipping the yarn back and forth.  Do you know of a tutorial on how to do it faster?  Or do you just get better with time?
The new multitasking screen I don't like, I do like the subtle design tweaks though (Im a web designer, so it brings it up to whats currently "standards" for design), I suppose sense 7 will make a big difference though. What interface do you use... I use to be into launchers but I got sick of them. 
Sit her down, tell her you have to talk to her. Make her feel as comfortable as you can and then just tell her that you want to end the relationship. You still love her and care for her but you can definitely see you two are different people and that you two probably aren't meant for one another (word this differently i'm just trying to get the general guideline of what you should say). That out there there is someone who is way better for both of you and since life is so short she deserves someone who matches her better than you do. Tell her she deserves someone who can make her happier than you will something along those lines because of your feelings that have left you or something. Tell her she is someone you will remember forever and that you will always cherish the memories you had with her.Word it however you want but there's a fairly good template to let her know it wasn't her fault and just remember to avoid cliches and to leave her a better girl for the next guy.
Kubica's crash in Montreal and Senna's crash were somewhat similar, and the fact that Kubica came out with essentially only a twisted ankle is amazing and shows how quickly the safety technology developed in the years following that weekend.
You're both wrong, but mostly you are.  Communication is an interaction between two people, and both sides have the responsibility to ensure understanding between them.  That means that you have the responsibility to use appropriate language and tone, and he is responsible for interpreting the words with the knowledge he has of you.  However, it has to start with you, because what you say and do is the only way he has to understand you.Of course, it largely depends on exactly what is being said - a detail which is notable by its absence, by the way - and how it is said.  If the only things you ever say to him are criticisms of every little detail of what he does, then yeah - he's pretty justified in feeling attacked.  If you're just mentioning that the green dishwasher powder works better than the white, then not so much.You are responsible for getting your message across to him, and doing so in a way he can understand without an undergraduate degree in DDgun99ology.
Interesting. Do you need to apply Rend during CoE rotation to receive the bonus for the full 15 seconds, aka Snapshot? Or will an already applied rend start ticking higher for 4 seconds during the CoE activation?
&gt;Forcing me to watch these over zealous intros is the same as having credits at the beginning of a movie that you can't fast forward through.Yup, and neither is going away. You're buying someone else's creative choices, not "the best gaming experience possible"; and those choices are almost invariably going to include splash screens in games and trailers in movies.The Idle Thumbs podcast had a pretty good discussion from a dev's standpoint [about Alien: Isolation's splashes.](https://youtu.be/fgoFIiz4Rhw?t=2290) Link is to a youtube timestamp of the discussion.
&gt; Googles data and services CAN be copyrighted, and patented.Google services are actually available to licensees regardless you use Google Play APIs or not. They have separate APIs available for those purposes, and have been widely used on Windows phone since inception. Microsoft could then make API wrappers that mimic Google Play APIs to access Google Apps API legally.
Why would you even get a Windows phone? It seems there is absolutely no actual advantage over android, so unless a person is required for work (somehow?), there's just no reason to get one. Especially considering how small the market is, and how little software is available. 
Vimpelcom was trying a power play with the Canadian gov't. They basically said if you won't let us own the company outright, we won't invest, thinking Industry Canada would fold. They didn't, and here we are. 
&gt;You will be the kid at the party that didn't have a slice of cake because you wanted someone to ask you why you aren't eating cake.What?Is this a thing?
I want to agree with you but whenever my girlfriend says she's "so in love with me" I just have to reply with "So, love has blinded you?!"Personally, I think that scene should have come after the opera scene, had the opera scene been a shakespearian style ye olde epic (though I guess talking during would have made Palpatine a bit of a jerk, huh), and had Anakin and Padme make fun of the dialogue in that style. But I digress, grrr prequels, much hate, throw rocks and big pointy sticks, hammer large pieces of crooked wood on all the windows!
It's really not different. The difference is that some of the more crass mysteries of magic have slowly been revealed by science. Throwing fireballs is really easy with the right "witches brew." 
I would like to circle back to the witness who told police he saw a suspicious person near the burial site during the correct time frame, and was ultimately dismissed as being irrelevant. That's beyond belief IMO.
&gt; As another has said, this might be more of a case of poorly worded/unnecessary criticism than sexism.I am going to disagree with you here. Under no circumstance is suggesting that the authors bring on a male co-author to tone down possible ideological assumptions not sexist. That just isn't ok.Maybe the reviewer didn't mean to be *deliberately* sexist, but their attitude is certainly such that it suggests that s/he thinks men are less ideological than women.&gt; the manuscript in question was not a scientific paper, but more of an opinion pieceI hadn't seen that -- can you point me to a reference to that effect? My impression was that the authors were conducting survey work to understand the frequency with which men and women scientists have co-authors on research papers and how that impacts on their careers.
I don't understand how you don't see thisHe didn't say he looks for people who *describe* themselves as overachievers, he said he looks for people who **demonstrate overachieving** at something.
hey, someone HAS offered 50, but since they haven't linked me to their spreadsheet yet, if I prefer your collection better, I'd be very happy to make a deal with you :) 45 shinies, correct?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union#ReligiosityNorthern/Western Europe is between a third and 18% religious. Though it's not a majority, i'd certainly not say it's a real minority.Similarly, the percentage professing some level of spirituality, when combined with religiosity, still outnumbers atheism for the most part, so I'd argue feeling in northern and western Europe is not laughing at the religious. Anecdotally, as a resident of the UK, it's quite rare to be ridiculed for my own faith.Also, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium are hubs of the scholarly study of Christianity (a community of which I am a part). For good scholarly research to take place, an outlook of ridicule is generally discouraged, otherwise you end up with unscholarly twaddle like *The God Delusion*.
I don't know what it is, but something about this image caused my eyes to report that this was a very elaborate clarinet, and he the world's most badass clarinet-playing motherfucker.
i forgot to mention this has been happening all week long since playing with my buddies. shotgun death after shotgun death. it's getting to the point where i rather be killed by hackers just to break the pattern. and its funny cuz some of the players are using esp and no-clip as well as the shotty. becuz you are that terrible at this game you need hacks and the most op gun in the game. ffsi would be fine dying to it ever so often but 4 times in less than 10 minutes is just fuckn absurd. i might as well be playing mw2 or some shit. guns, especially high tier weapons should be RARE. PERIOD. high tier ammo should be RARE. PERIOD. not fucking craftable like it is now. smh
Done, for misc. team. Looking forward to the post:&gt;After that, a new post will be made with official teams and objectives.Do you know when we can look for this? Can applicants be notified directly?
How do these people become top mods of so many subreddits? How do people become mods of popular subreddits in general? It's crazy to think one guy is in charge of so many subreddits, and he barely has to do anything. 
We've only ever bought larger amounts. Our first trip we just pooled money with several friends. Last time we bought for the whole week. Got about an ounce of mid grade for around $100-120. I honestly don't know how easy it would be to find smaller amounts???

My thoughts are that any conversation about the specific situation and n Baltimore is going to devolve into useless reactionism.  If you haven't been talked ng about issues like poverty, race, police behavior, the drug war, inequality prior to this, you probably won't be talking about it afterwards either. 
Goddamn I really like Pedro. I remember going apeshit over the Zimmer incident at the time but the guy really is a great personality and a hell of a pitcher. Those were golden days to be a Yankees or a Red Sox fan. 
Three phase is smoother and more efficient to wire. It is almost always preferable when available. However, I find your explanation a little misleading because you have to look at the power delivered over time- the fluctuations in single phase voltage are accounted for in the meter. Can we use smaller motors, conductors? Yes. Is there some windfall because three phase is always delivering power? Not really.
I had a hard time justifying the price for a Milwaukee. When I was at Home Depot, I found out they have a General Contractor tape. Essentially it is a fatmax but I like the simplicity of the ruler on the Milwaukee better. 
&gt; this is partially why i believe geoff wants shorter LPs. but also, i dont think this is a bad thing. i personally dont watch all of RT content (at least not what you included) simply because i do not enjoy all of it. as im sure others feel the same. this then puts the question of "is this popular enough to keep putting out?" which is something we cant really answer.This is why I love Funhaus. Their videos are just long enough that I feel fulfilled in watching them, and every bit of it is hilarious due to their editing style.
But there isn't really a unified set of beliefs or practices.The closest think is the strainer thing, but conspiracy theorists have the tinfoil hat thing going for them, and that doesn't make them a religion. 
I was wondering what you were referring to.  Those are safety glasses used for dangerous environments (construction, lawn care, etc.).  I think they came with that strap. 
I really hope that pick 18 takes the entire time to pick their pick and that number 16 is something super boring so that we actually get talked about and get to see highlights of our guy. I feel like we always get fucked. Excepting a certain Hawaiian.
Before you do anything on social media it would be good to first figure out your target audience. Then create a brand that caters to your target audience. Treat this kind of venture like the business that it is. Setup things like you would for a business. Figure out your purpose, your target audience, what you want to achieve, then create a brand that includes everything needed to accomplish those things.  
Slightly above your budget, but what do you think of [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-14-2560x1440-WQHD-IPS-Intel-i7-4600U-8GB-256GB-SSD-PC-/161684418219?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item25a5246eab)?
I'm talking on Roman Catholic sense here, and no where in the dogma does it say that.In fact, here's how it goes.Do you believe in the One True God, Creator of Heaven and Earth?Do you do good works?Do you ask for forgiveness when you sin?Jews believe in the one true God, as do Muslims. But with Francis, we are kind of moving away from the "Do you believe in God" prerequisite.

I give the same advice to this question every time-Make a formal written letter. State exactly what you want. Show your understanding of the procedure. Explain why other options are not right for you. Indicate that you understand this procedure is permanent and not to be considered reversible. Print it out and sign it by hand. Keep a copy for yourself and insist they keep the original for their records.
Maybe you're missing the point... I know, for a fact, that there is another album with multiple pics of a different girl in that outfit. This isn't a guess, I've seen the album multiple times. Also, I'm pretty sure the  "yellow shade of paint" is just the white balance being off and no where did I see the wall stop in any other pic. Even if it were many homes also have those. I'll update when I find it.
so you dont wanna get slapped around???i would be more than happy to when the draft is over. bout 2 hrs. message me if you want it. u'll realize real quick how shit u are lol
She might move into the UFC's top 5 briefly with good booking and a little luck, but I don't see her becoming top 5 on any reputable ranking source.  I just think she has almost no chance against Gadelha, Esparza, Tecia, or Rose.  Penne is the only top 5 I think she can beat.
The Phantom from *Phantom of the Opera*  All the girls in my class used to feel bad for him. I was just like "He tried to kidnap her and kill the other man" Like the archer meme "Do you *want* to get raped? Because that's how you get raped"
Cool! Definitely try it at least. /r/Games has been talking about the disappearance of 3D-Platformers for awhile, it'd be nice to see it come back a little.
I don't think evidence supports the claim that dairy universally causes inflammation, but I suspect it could in some people."Dairy product consumption does not exert adverse effects on biomarkers of inflammation in overweight or obese adults. Several methodologic factors and limitations among exist- ing studies do not allow differentiation between a beneficial or neutral impact of dairy products on inflammation"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/4/706.full.pdfDairy fat does contain some estrogen, so it could it influence testosterone and estrogen levels in the body that way but I don't know. I haven't seen much conclusive evidence on the subject.
Unfortunately, they'd have to be friendly Buddhist business owners who don't mind being vandalized, receiving death threats, and being branded as the people who hate freedom.  They would also have to be willing to hurt and embarrass potentially lovely people by turning them away and saying they are unworthy of doing business with, and I've never yet met a Buddhist who would go out of their way to hurt a fellow human, even a little bit, simply over a difference in beliefs or to prove a point.  I would dearly love for the assholes who support these kinds of laws to get a dose of their own medicine, but that would just turn the rest of us into assholes.  
My point is that _it shouldn't mattter_ if someone wants to drink coffee or smoke meth. Either way, it doesn't concern you, unless you believe it does, in which case you've got your head up your own ass.
[[Gray merchant of Asphodel]] + black stuff is usually pretty good. :PBut seriously, if you aren't already running the good old [[urborg, tomb of yawgmoth]] alongside [[cabal coffers]], you are missing out.
And yet more evidence surfaces that the term "organic" is utterly useless.  "Why can't we use more non-organic synthetic protein the obligate omnivore chickens we force to eat vegetarian against their will and still call it organic?"It's torture.  It's inhumane.  It's a *lie*.  Great job "ethical" people.
The biggest mistake is to vote for a single policy.(He's TRYING to get the support of the marijuana community. And this is politics, he could just have been doing that the whole time to try to get the votes.) Make sure that you agree with a candidate on a variety of issues before voting for them. And remain open minded. Actually research the issues you care about, including the opposition. Know what you believe, and vote that way. Voting is the biggest governmental privilege given to us as citizens. Use it wisely. 
Every action is subject to only your own thoughts and wishes. You can choose to view the world however you like based on the knowledge you have. Each mind has the ability to gain the same information as you but only you can choose the ultimate opinion of it all. The tree for example can be objectified as being beautiful or strong, but an existentialist thinker will see the tree for a tree; It has roots, a trunk, branches and leaves, each with the ability to be transformed into whatever he/she chooses, within the physical capabilities of said component. But truthfully, there are no answers that lie within the tree, unless you choose to ask questions that will provoke an answer. Same goes for most things in this world... unless you don't agree.(assuming that my understanding is what I believe it to be and assuming that this comment helps clarify EqualityMeansEvery1's assumption of their understanding of what they believe it to be haha)
My puppy has been doing great at that. Pees and even poops on her pad when left alone in the playpen, but also does it outside. I would just make sure to praise the puppy anytime they get it right.
Hello - Sheriff's Office? Yes, I'd like to report some missing items I want to claim . . . "A number of bales of marijuana were found in the area but they've not been linked to the shooting scene."
Where would they recruit for this division anyway? 7th &amp; 8th grade wrestlers? Only the hardest of the hardcores even want to watch the flyweights. Leave this shit alone. 
They're good in those contexts. It's the people who wear them on, like, a college campus or something that just look goofy. The worst are the tacticool mall ninjas in their 5.11s who are trying to pull off some sort of contractor/security look. All that does is scream "shoot me first!" to any kind of criminal.
For families and particularly kids, no one really gives a shit. They're proud of their dad.Tacky? Yes. But would I actually say something? Fuck no, they're going to see their dad. 
You'd really be willing to trade 2 1st rounders, cox, Kendricks, Bradford and more for a quarterback who still can'tMake NFL level throws? I'm not trying to start shit, it's a serious question. That's trading our future for an unsure quarterback. I think Mariota could be a great quarterback, but Bradford can too and we don't need to trade anyone else for him. 
it's no use arguing with a moron like yourself. I'm going to quickly profile you, you are a white male, with a gun in your house. you enjoy drinking a beer each night and abuse your wife. did I mention you are strongly Republican and oppose gay rights?oryou are a teenager whose parents were republicans and I don't blame you for being brainwashed by moronseither way, KYS
Not a Canadian so maybe someone can help me put Winnepeg in USA terms of violence. On a scale of1) Martha's Vineyard50) Omaha100) ChiraqWhere does Winnepeg fall?
Keep at it! It took 3 hours but my first time in t13 the other night, my group managed to push to the storm of meracydia add consistently. Phase 4 doesn't change a whole lot so if you master the first two phases it becomes all about handling the adds right and persevering through akh morn. Trying is the first step towards your clear ^^
Meh, I don't really have any objections to people who subscribe to the [Theistic evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution). Honestly as a doctrine it's probably done the most good in getting people to look at evolution and accept it as being true.
They are pricy but those Karuna ones are heavenly. I haven't tried a ton of other masks yet, but even getting the cheap ones on Amazon, I may splurge in a pinch when I run out and am waiting for a shipment.
I just finished Gurren Lagann this morning. Most likely starting Rolling Girls or Tamako Market tomorrow, and marathoning Girls und Panzer on Saturday.As for current season stuff, I'm watching Nisekoi:, Danmachi, Plastic Memories, and my personal favorite, Hibike! Euphonium
Wii Fit, and Lucario. The only reason people don't like gold mario is because they don't understand what it means to own a golden statue of the most popular videogame character of all time :/
Not necessarily. A lot of stuff in Star Wars is no longer canon including the KOTOR games. The validity of SWTOR in the new canon is, by extension, unknown. Most likely, it's not canon.Only the 6 films, The Clone Wars cartoon, Rebels, the NEW Marvel comics, and the most recent SW books starting with A New Dawn are canon.
I think you understand my comment, and the comment before me.  The guy basically said that third party sites created by the community are better than just a board of names.  But LFG sites are just boards of names.   So I had know idea what the fuck he was talking about.   In fact it was absurd. 
I see. I was guessing of running few quintet walls can go well with Cider for instant 6+ soul charge but it is rather quite difficult to pull off and yeah, with the current clans with GB and strides, Quintet walls are more likely being opt out in many decks. They even gave Quintet walls an R rarity for the upcoming GBT-02 set.I won't mind having few quintet walls tho, budget-wise that is.
yeah, trading is about as fun as a brick to the skull. But when you can make 6 mil an hour, double what you can anywhere else doing anything else, it's hard to resist using it to fund your toys...
Why would anyone say no to this? We get 2 new characters! We get Banjo, who we've wanted for a while, and Master Chief, another iconic gaming character that could have a pretty cool playstyle. You may not like him, but you don't have to play as him. A top pick character and a somewhat weird pick character is better than none at all.
There is 0% chance you could EVER pick sports bets at 58%.Elite, full-time sharps who bet sports for a living and have the ability to move lines hope to bet at around 55%.
That's very impressive actually. So are you able to ship anything you buy online straight to Amazon, or do you have to still ship to your house for labeling?

Why would you stream to your computer if it was really just mirroring the XBox system? Not being a naysayer, I'm really questioning what this is good for? I understood how cool it was if you could do something on the XBox and something different on the stream, but this just seems like a way for people to stream to a laptop while the take a poop, but that's what Reddit is for.
I thought the shooting gameplay in Watch Dogs was really fun, and the ctOS in general was a really cool idea, but there better be some improvements up in this bitch.
Torp looks really cool when it fires - glowy blue and white ball of energy - looks a bit like the projectile for Emp Probe or Scramble Sensors - unstable, stormy.
yeah, don't wind yourself up too much - all the anecdotal feedback in the world will still tell you next to nothing about what *your* experience will be.  The closest you can get to an actual useful prediction is asking your biological mother what her experience having you was.  Even then, it's something of a shot in the dark.  You'll be okay.  Most of us get through this stuff and we do it by taking things moment-by-moment.  If you try to shove a whole steak down your throat at once, you're going to choke.  If you take bites and manage it piece by piece, that fucker doesn't stand a chance.  Feel me?And just to add to the pile of useless anecdotal feedback, prior to 4 cm was like period cramps in waves for me.  Not like super fun but also totally manageable, and a hot shower took the discomfort away completely.
Even if a relationship ends in good terms, you want to feel safe and have someone to vent, and take some time to get over the ex. If I date them, they will have one less person to hang out without feeling awkward and such. 
&gt; Skill Gems&gt; No suggestions here!Wut? The skill gem rewards are the single biggest issue with beta right now... they're plainly broken... I've been offered 2 flameblasts and 2 groundslams from a single quest as a templar, offered no movement gems, very few core support gems... I know they want us to test the new progression but without the gem rewards being completely unfinished that's pretty hilarious.
Absolutely. I just get pretty distracted easily. There are so many great games I haven't completed simply because of my own attention span. I just want to give them another chance.
Here's the thing. You're not apart of the Red Sox Front Office(presumably). You don't know your record by the trade deadline. I've seen moves which made no real sense to me. If Betts does end up in Philly you're gonna look really dumb. Or at least feel cheated. Either way I don't rule anything out. It's a fair deal IMO.

If they were in their jdub uniforms (men: off the rack untailored suit. Women: ankle skirt and blouse) I'd ask what church they were from, and then announce that their rude behavior turned you away from talking to them again. Hit them where it hurts. Their imaginary image of themselves
The TL;DR is TLDR; An insatiable urge came over me to suck cock, any cock, anywhere, anytime, just give me a dick in my mouth and let me listen to The Miracle on repeat. He just put it at the front because it wouldn't be useful at the back.
Hispanics are the warmest couples on the planet, I swear. I've never known any other people as public about their love as my people. It's a blessing and a curse.
I do 4 shakes a day bro, get on my level.All kidding aside (I do have 4 daily fwiw) and to answer your question:* Salami/Pepperoni* Jerky (buy in bulk, or make yourself)* Nuts (almonds especially)* Protein bars (I'm partial to quest being on keto, but metrx is supposed to be good, and pure protein too)
HAHA that's exactly who he is named after. Funnily enough...Scooter was almost an Ellie until I had him probed.   I've decided to name all my hoggies after BL2 characters once my collection grows a little more.
Well, then we could also say that Messi should never win a header over my Chiellini, but he sometimes does. That's how it works. I actually have really hard time recalling my Evra being as fast as Bale to be honest, yes they get a slight pace boost, but if they didn't it would make the pace even more overpowered.And please don't tell me that his Sau is always going trough your TOTY Silva and Luiz like a breeze all the time. We both know it doesn't happen verytime. Whenever i face some1 with those two at the back i really have hard time going past them, unless it's a race towards the ball, then ofc they can get outpaced. 
B'more's not bad, barricaded my door the other night. Reports were showing events coming closer, but light of day proved otherwise. Any thoughts re: licenses? My home base is a compact state (unknowingly lucked out), but I'm looking at all the areas I want to get to and questioning if I want to go through all the bureaucracy and paperwork. Same with checking out a different company.
Disclaimer: I'm a smoker, and I read the thing, so it obviously doesn't work for all.It focuses on the ways that you are rationalizing smoking ("nicotine brain"), and that the feeling of need and fulfillment surrounding smoking are not real, as you can only be as satisfied by a cigarette as a non-smoke is without one. It's a mind over matter thing, and I found it inspiring and helpful, but I'm still fighting the fight.
You and I know that, but to them we're the ignorant ones. As far as they're concerned, our knowledge is no match for their faith. They can use that exact phrase exactly the way I stated it, and it would make as much sense to everyone that believed the way they do.Use that big brain of yours to put yourself in their shoes and tell me it's not exactly the kind of thing you'd could hear a diehard fundamentalist say with absolute conviction.
thank you for clarification, I doubt my isp is at fault here, more likely my lack of understanding the UI.I get that manual dropping is superior to autodrops, believe me I learned it the hard way when the guy dropped on my kawachi literally 1 km away from the ship leaving me with nothing to do but eat the full spread. So I said okay, let me try the same. Well easier said than done, because for some unknown reason the edge of the dashed circle is not the exact point for the start of their run. Occasionally it will also randomly turn the manual drop in some random direction for no reason (my guess is it somehow locks on and tries to do an auto drop with correcting for target velocity which ends up wrecking the drop anyway)....eh, never mind my wall of text, I'm rambling. I understand how it works in theory but when it comes to executing in practice the controls are just so imprecise that it's frustrating the hell out of me. more practice needed I'm guessing
For slightly more clarity, the console showed that a calculation was done which seemed to be some kind of time calculation multiplied by my Soul generation, which was negative at the time.
WINDOWS PHONE UNITE! Really wish they release top-tier windows phones outside of the US... The only available Windows Phone in Rogers was the Lumia 830 (Fantastic phone, just wished for a 1080p screen and a better CPU and more RAM) 
I'm okay with poor people spending their money on things that make them happy (breast augmentation, video games, cars, the like). Reddit seems to believe that you have to make a certain amount of income before you are allowed to decide how to spend your money.
Bombed an Econ test. Not too worried, since the worst grade's dropped. Talked with one of my best friends from back East for a solid 2 hours which was great since I hadn't heard from him for quite some time. Getting a stuffy nose. Decided to participate more rather than lurk. Possibly going to make a new account soon-ish.
Blue Origin isn't exactly generous with information. Most likely, they didn't want their competitors to know that they were working on a methane engine and didn't announce the BE-4 until after SpaceX described the Raptor as being methalox. Don't take my word for it: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4)
Where I do agree with you, I also feel as a soon to be teacher that the teachers shouldn't bottle up these thoughts and spout it out when they can. Instead they should be genuinely concerned for some of them and focus a bit of their efforts to mentoring them a bit more. 
In general, the current shingles vaccine only reduces the chances of getting shingles by about ~50% (and if one gets shingles with it there is ~60% reduction in the chance of postherpetic neuralgia).  So, like DrTestificate stated, she may have been destined to get shingles and she was one of the unlucky ones.Some people do get a shingles-like rash near the site of the injection.  Did she get shingles where she got the shot or elsewhere.
true...and that's why democrats are un-American IMO. Al-gore with Al Jazeera, Obama cozying up to Iran and Cuba, allowing Mexicans to cross the border for vote with your hand out democrat votes.... yes..  they are the un-American party by far
I sexually identify as a Navy Seal. Ever since I was a child I dreamed of being the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. People say to me that having over 300 confirmed kills is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a secret network of spies trace your IP right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. From now on, you're fucking dead, kiddo. If you can't accept me you need to check your gorilla privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things.
Yeah I don't even live in the same town anymore and am only FB friends with him. I guess the flip side is that I am apparently an alpha female? Or something.... 
Not my argument. It was used by Malcolm Fraser, PM of Australia during some of the Vietnam war, (http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2015/03/lnl_20150320.mp3) mostly WRT Indonesia.
Make an appointment with your Headmaster/Principal. Ask for their advice on how to handled this. Be truthful about what happened. Then follow the advice and let the rest of the year play out.
Um, why do you think that matters? It wasn't ILLEGAL for them to give them the money. That was their CHOICE. They CHOSE to discriminate against people who 'were criminals'. They were not legally obligated to.And for the record I am 100% pro-gay rights. I just also happen to be 100% Business owner rights. In the government, they should not be allowed to discriminate against gays etc, however a business owner should have the right, and if enough people really don't want businesses doing that thing, the business should fail that way.
Everstones pass down the holder's nature, not IVs.The destiny knot passes down 5 IVs, but it's random from BOTH parents, not just the one holding it. Alas, getting a 6 IV isn't as easy as breeding a perfect Ditto a couple of times.On the plus side, the effect it has on the end stats isn't that much, so it isn't really that important unless you're playing competitive where every single point counts.
I believe the technical name for what Kennedy's doing is REVERSE racism. It's a thing, look it up and educate yourself LMAO #serenachachaAlso, Kennedy is the worst, but this is not as bad as that nazi bitch Sharon.
Well yea, its the watermark for the free site. The point is you are making comments on things I've already pointed out in my post. These are things I already know. I wrote specifically what I was looking for comments on in my post.

&gt;Bale is not worth £100m in any sense.that doesn't matter. he's one of the best wingers in the world so they'll pay whatever is necessary to buy him. it's the real madrid way of football.
How is IGN still going on about this game? how can they have been playing it from day 1 and STILL playing it... it was an interesting game at the start but it had absolutely no content... 
YEP.Knew someone in college who was almost raped and called both police and campus security. Campus security got there first, and spent several minutes telling her how stressful and terrible a police investigation would be for her, and so she should just let them handle it so she didn't have to go through that. (Of course, if it's not reported to the police, they don't have to put it on the crime statistics they post for parents of incoming freshmen...) She pretty much told them to fuck off, but it's always made me wonder how many other people were talked out of reporting...
I didn't mean to imply that the statement was actually petty, just that it could seem petty to think that simple accessories would make a big difference. I think Yooka would look pretty good with gloves.  His hands are already a different color, might as well give them more emphasis with actual apparel.  If Laylee is female she could probably use some earrings.  It's somewhat cliche to give bat characters earrings, but it would go a long way in giving her more character, especially since kazooie has pretty noticeable eyelashes to make her look more feminine.  If they do add something to the designs, they should be thematically consistent with whatever personality the characters might have.Edit: Donkey Kong is another good example.  He would look like a pretty generic gorilla if not for his tie.
I have them in one of these:  http://www.amazon.com/National-Garden-Wholesale-SunBlaster-Propagation/dp/B00AKKU71M/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430439835&amp;sr=8-22&amp;keywords=seeding+tray, so 7 inches.    If it passes it shake out cruise, tomorrow I should have my space bucket ready to go, so then these guys will be under an LED UFO.   Two of them are destine to go outside, and two will share the bucket until I run into size issues and then I will figure out what to next.  
Putting you in a match with people around your skill level. Pubs are usually very diverse in skill level, so there is usually one person dominating the entire server. Matchmaking tries to pair you against people of similar skill level so you can enjoy the game more.
There are many reasons why that won't happen.  Mostly because, since they drafted him, Mariota's salary counts against the Titans rookie cap.  The Eagles would need to draft a Titans pick at 20, then trade him (to mitigate the hit the Titans would take) and that would be insane.  
BOOBS! Having boobs is seriously so great I can just sit around with my hands on my boobs and it's awesome. Also shaving legs, then swimming is awesome but dudes can do that too.
I'm graduating college, actually. I had to take some years taking care of family matters, but I can finally move on to the next round of adult responsibility.Good luck in college! Only advice I could give is trying out new identities and personas is natural in college, just don't let people pressure you.
Never understood why people don't use that anyway. Get up to 96% chance to ignite, never have to curse, still one-shot almost all blue and white packs up to level 76 maps with a 2 channel conc effect hit.
Good luck. Is this amateur or smoker?Anyway, just have confidence in your training. All the nerves will turn into adrenaline once that bell rings (or when you take your first hit). All downhill from there bro!Lemme know how it goes haha
It is now legal to post your rsn, password, PIN, jag, and intent on a page for Turks to serve you, according to jmods inforum (Rules page hasn't changed though from "likely to be banned").This could be risky.
Thanks for highlighting that, looks like the uploader breached the Terms of Service. Submitted a request for deletion as that's an unbelievably shitty and downright malicious move, *probably* illegal as well.
aww man. I thought it'd be like $150, because that's a similar price to where it's being sold at... that made it be a frontrunner with the BLU win hd lte... but now. well. Has there been an official release date yet?
sure, I know the hunt ends because of that and not just because the hunter gets kileld, but it could be that this time, the source is Mergo, while previously it was some other great being, with other stuff going on, it doesn't look like all "hunts" (if more than one) have to involve the same great beings all the times
Kerbal world is small, and the day is 6 hours long. Kerbals are smaller than humans (I guess?). So it's not awfully unrealistic, just Kerbals have it easy.Plus, with brutal rates resupply missions have to be regular, and mostly fail-free. It can get tedious for some players so I totally see why default rates are forgiving.I use x4 rates for food and water and x6 for oxygen.
Was doing some research on END and heard they don't mark down the items' value to the sale price on the receipts for customs, so you end up eating the customs fees for the full price.  Anyone know if they stopped doing this?Also could you possibly dodge fees by placing multiple &lt;$200 value orders so that they ship in multiple parcels?  I would drop a good bit of money on this sale if it wasn't so iffy on the fees that I might incur.
I saw the two candidates running for election.  I was worried to be honest.  Both seemed really bad, but Hilary would have been the lesser evil.  I'm wondering if there is hope if this guy really is what he claims to be.
The trickiest parts I've found with self check out: bringing your own reusable bags, buying produce, buying marked down items, and buying alcohol/restricted items.There's some simple steps to avoid issues with these, but mainly,  figuring out produce was the hard one for me.  If it doesn't have a sticker on it, write the 4 digit number on your grocery list as you pick it up.  When you get to the check out there will be a produce option,  and an option to type in the code.  Then it'll ask you to weigh it,  or ask for a count.  Some produce is by weight and some is by count.  Good luck!

I mean, in this specific instance I am still correct. The exact terminology is off, but given the spacing of the card in question the new mechanic shouldn't* be on the same line.Basically, I was right, I just used the wrong terminology. I'm aware of all the specific rules an exceptions, I just didn't have the correct jargon.*shouldn't, meaning based on convention it probably should be a line lower but there's no rule saying it needs to be that way. 
Oh no....who let you out of the Church basement again!?  You know you're only allowed out during cross burnings and child bride marriage ceremonies!  Back to the catacombs with you!
Isn't that frustrating? Ugh, I know that feeling. I was looking forward to getting my hard drive that never showed up. Thankfully that seldom happens but my opinion of that company is forever altered in my memory, and I will always think they are deadbeats who can't even get a fulfillment right.
Is there any way to successfully report people who are intentionally deranking on your team. i.e. 2 guys on team have script to make them go in circles to keep their characters moving.Or is the deranking issue a non issue that is just accepted in the community?
Try http://www.goodrx.com/adderall-xr/price Also consider switching to adderall IR, and consider asking your doctor if they're willing to prescribe a higher dosage for frequent use that you can split during the day over a longer period of time to take advantage of any bulk discounts. e.g. if you take 10mg twice a day, ask for 20mg 3x/day you can split in half and save a little money on but go longer between prescription fills (instead of 60 10mg pills for a month, get 90 20mg pills to last you 3 months).

I'd suggest starting with 4 grams, and add one gram per hour if you don't feel anything. Dose on an empty stomach and maybe drink a hot beverage after to help break down the capsules. 
I love my 8. It's got it's downsides for city riding (as does *any* inline 4) with it being a little... tempermental at low speeds, but once you get the revs up above 6k, it's got great power. One thing I'd recommend for the low-speed stuff is a G2 throttle tube with a wider cam (to make the throttle more controllable at low throttle positions), and a fuel controller to increase fuel at low rpms (and to trick it into thinking the throttle is open all the time so it doesn't cut fuel and give throttle snatch). It's light enough (for me) to be comfortable, and with a few upgrades, it's actually not a bad sport tourer (I've done a few 2000+ mile trips on it). It's a good bike, but needs some serious upgrades to make it a *great* bike (mostly suspension, fueling, and brakes). 
If you watched the entire set that was linked you would see that the WFT didn't over-rely on the move at all. It was mostly used for recovery from below the stage and horizontally while he also added a lot of mix-ups when recovering from above the stage. At this point in the set the other player probably just lost his nerve from losing the past two games in a pretty one-sided fashion.
While I can't consider you "plus" at all, I agree with everyone else that you have a wonderful shape! Like, "yes trainer, of course I will tell you my goals while doing these fucking burpees" great shape =P keep on keeping on sugga!
I didn't see anything in this article that is cutting edge to the rehabilitation community. And the reason some of them aren't used in therapy (e.g. TCD stimulation) is because there is not sufficient research to determine efficacy and safety.

What use are these "generalizations" and "trends", most of which are very weak correlations, in interacting with women on an individual level for seduction purposes?Of all the poor logic in TRP, this is probably the most perplexing to me. Your entire approach to what you are ostensibly trying to do is completely wrong. The study of general trends in social behavior is only useful to those who are looking to manipulate large groups of people, like governments and advertisers. An average dude looking to get a date or hookup is interacting with women on an *individual* basis, and thus needs information about the specific *individual* being seduced, and the context of that individual's environment, in order to craft a successful seduction strategy. In other words, the intellectual skills required are closer to those of field anthropologists and not of biologists or statisticians. 
You are a genius, the only problem i can see with that is the ants, but hey, ants can lift like 10,000 pounds or something, i saw it on animal planet. They can help us rebuild. 
**Concept Name:** [The Horror](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotaConcepts/comments/30njt7/the_horror/)    **Reason:** If I had to choose my favourite Gimmick concept, that'd be like choosing my favourite DotA hero. While not always the most supposedly balanced, the idea is there, the spells are brilliant and he even does in-depth analysis on his own concepts. Nonetheless, I do have one whose theme I have taken to liking which is this one, the Horror. The general idea of the guy from all those jump scare horror games is amazingly made. Would love to see this guy in the mode you guys are making with all his crazy shenanigans.       **Personal Concept &amp; Critic:**    Concept Among Others: http://www.reddit.com/r/DotaConcepts/comments/2yfirw/the_guide/     I'll admit I hardly leave critiques as I am generally bad at reviewing what is necessarily bad but I have given it a shot.

Corporations don't have common property. If one person cashed out of a corporation the rest of the corporations assets don't need to be liquidated. When a marriage falls apart the big things get sold. 
now, i know what to fill up my suitcase with, when i'm in japan next time.  KMC and squid/scallop snacks.... i eat them during FNMs to disorient my opponents.

Tbh, everythin's fun until that last guy summons the giant snakes. Fuckin' unavoidable. But you know, am talkin' about the design and the intensity of the battle, it was fun fighting a gank squad xD
I think it's the other way around. People with high elo spend time in this sub. Its like entering a hospital and asking why there are so many doctors around. 
That is what I am thinking...I have plenty of PVE LMG's so this will do fine in PVP. Since you only have to reload once per heavy the reload speed wont kill me too bad. 
Saw this graffitied in downtown Portland and asked people on twitter what it means. I forget, but I don't think it was an SJW thing. I don't remember.

If you want to invent a new language, you write a compiler for that language in another language that already exists.  Once that compiler is stable enough, you rewrite it in the new language and use the previous compiler to compile the new compiler, a process known as bootstrapping.  From that point on, you use the existing version X of the compiler to build the next version X + 1, and you can discard the original compiler written in the other language.  The result is a language and a compiler written in that same language.C's original compiler was written in assembly before it was bootstrapped.  And the assembler was written in machine language, which is a direct expression of machine instructions and doesn't need a compiler.
Thank you! I will give those a try. What are some of your favorite snacks to help you stay full throughout the day, while getting in those healthy calories?
good question. i haven't found any indication that there is any interaction between them. i have found a few folks recommending taking nootropics *instead* of SSRIs, because they work better with less side effects. also worth mentioning that 5-HTP is another option there.
Small changes in your input delay from lag game to game can make a big difference. The sluggish games are just usually slightly laggier. Just not directly noticeably.
You've said yourself that you haven't introduced yourselves yet, so I'd go about it as if you're meeting him in any other context- "Hi, I'm RockinSocksReborn..." will usually be answered with an introduction of his own.If he is taken aback by the introduction and doesn't respond with his own name, you can take a leaf from the book of tryin'-to-be-cool males everywhere and pull off the good ol' casual "Hi, I'm RockinSocksReborn [a brief pause...] You're SeldomSeven, right? I sit, like, three rows behind in Math ..." Guys do this to come off as "not a stalker" - you can do it too ;)  
I'm really tired of hour long videos of these guys. Like the normal reviews, but there are just so many of these top ten this that and the other thing videos, they feel forced. 
Awesome to hear! I am hooked on RTA's and think this will be perfect. My KFL+ is a daily user at work. Have a Goblin and Lemo 2 at home. LOVE the Lemo 2 (just got it today and haven't put it down). The flavor is fantastic, and may trial a few mL of 5 Pawns in it, even though sub-ohm isn't ideal for their liquid (so I hear).

When you donate to a campaign, you state where you are employed. If you look at it closely, you will see those are individual donors who are employed by the University of California.  
Lol you do raise a valid point. I do understand living in my means. Socal rents are ridiculous (grew up in HB), so I didn't think this was over the top for what I wanted. Thank you kind redditor! I will be visiting SoCal this summer, so please let me know if you want me to bring some water :)

Wow thanks for the strats! I'm close to unlocking perfect Kamehameha so I might go for that one. It'll prevent enemies avoiding me like when I use final flash too. 
Because that's how unions already operate. Our government does little to protect our liberties as it is. What makes you think that they would suddenly change? 
I've purchased A LOT of Apple products the past 11 years, and I would say that amount of lemons I get is about consistent. They've always been out there. 
But the sellers wouldn't raise the cost of the goods at. 1:1 ratio. Part of the cost of the goods goes towards the minimum wage employee, but a large part of it comes from material costs, non minimum wage employees, foreign trade, etc. so the amount of money put into circulation would be more than the inflation. Rich people don't want it because their salaries won't raise in comparison. So while the price of the goods increases, their salary won't. Plus, the money going towards poor people would be immediately circulated back into the economy, finding its way back to the employer.
There are a good number of subreddits that hide the upvote or downvote or both buttons with their themes, and they don't want people to be able to turn that theme off and use them. 
So if you are saying tech jobs are better why don't teachers get a job in tech? Because they can't because they don't have the skills. If teachers made more than engineers, engineers would become teachers until the price lowered.It's basic economics. They should seriously teach this shit in high school.

He also wants to increase the cap on social security tax from 110k to 250k. Pennies on the dollar for those who are already paying that 110k, and will be a great hurdle in easing the pressure on social security. 
It's also not unkown for that very police department to "forget" to put seat belts on their detainees (but remember to shackle their hands and feet, of course) and then drive around bouncing the prisoner like a marble inside a can of spray paint.http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-rough-ride-and-police-culture/391538/
Why does it matter unless you were the one to have married them and didn't know? And even then, if you don't want kids and were attracted to them the whole time, does it *really* matter that they were once a different gender? (I realize many people would have a reaction to not having been told, but is it rational? I don't think it is)
its something iv always done with others, im finding myself speaking to a lot of people on Facebook right now, like people who i haven't spoken to in years ad were getting on realy well which is cool, going to get of now though and do some meditating so far it has been and an amazing night, feels good to do it at home when im not drunk or stoned. Like i can appreciate the effects more.

I saw serious potential in Sandow as a serious babyface badass character on Monday before Axel came out. They have to tease us so much. I hate this new thing already. Just book him in a serious fashion. Why is it so hard? Why can't we just see a guy we like get what he deserves? We're not asking for him to be WWE Champion. We just want him to be taken seriously. I know he's over AF but I would much rather see him in his old heel gimmick. That was much funnier than this. I JUST WANT SOMETHING SERIOUS WITH HIM. Rant over.
Philippine-American war or US backed Guatemalan governments' mass massacres were not happened in the 300 BC.Also, genocide and numerous crimes against Native Americans continued in the 20th century buddy.
&gt; Given that it sunk to the bottom of the river, and didnt float away, I say its made of metal. Glad to know that if it's airsoft it's filled with helium and made out of styrofoam and balsa wood. Your general knowledge is very helpful.edit: also "next cheapest gun is probably a high-point" Bruh, I've seen hi-points in the $100 range from big retailers.
Old is good, in this case. :) It helps that it was played on a violin built to baroque specs, by the leader of the Irish Baroque Orchestra!ETA: And the octatonic scale simply alternates tones and semitones all the way up the octavel. Lovely melancholy feeling to it, and somehow it makes tritones feel very stable. 
I configured my Sager np8651 for $1500 with an IPS screen and SSD. I've never reached the limit of the GPU (970m) while playing every game on max settings. It's not a feather, but it's not huge (5.4lbs, 1 inch thick)
I did that on purpose. If you hover over them the individual announcements will fully reveal. I did this because they were interfering with some of the banner images.As for updating them, I am not sure who regularly does it. I have updated the meta thread part a few times but I mainly just edit the  CSS. We've talked about trying to keep the side bar elements updated though.
Hail again :)Why would you not just build one driver and wire them all in parallel? This supports up to 20 amps. You have a potential draw of 10.5 amps with 10 of your led's in parallel.Just change the led's to a parallel configuration instead of series like shown.
Is there a writeup somewhere that has a balanced overview of this theory (discussing both sides objectively)? I tried googling for one but could only seem to find stuff trying to definitively state one way or the other. 
I'm talking about in MLB 15 the show. This looks pretty accurate to a late season batting practice for a double a team that is going no where. They did nothing that wasn't already programmed into the game, is what I'm saying
Fair, I didn't read your comments outside of anger towards Texas. I just saw hate for Texas and raged back.But that's the points I wanted to make, our elected officials aren't getting it done. Republicans are getting elected because they are Republican. I'm waiting for my parents and their generation to leave the voting booth alone, they're rewarding dipshits for wasting our time, money, and are making life alot harder for people they shouldn't be messing with. Regardless, it won't hold up in court, horrible ideas get proposed and farther along in the process than they should, but this won't see fruition. I hope all this negative karma steers clear of your baby, best of luck. 
Thanks, homie. I'm going to go get a can of something volatile now :DI will of course, spray it into the intake manifold, as it's injected (no carb) 
I honestly don't know any names, but I'm sure you could call some of the realty agencies and ask if they have someone that would show you rental properties. Some of the realty places around here are Lindsey Realty (same as the apartments), but they might only show you Lindsey properties. There is Coldwell Banker Harris McHaney Faucette (yes that's the name of one agency, not multiple), Weichert Realtors, and Crye Leike. Those are the ones I can think of in the area. Happy House Hunting and congrats on the new job!
Hayne is mostly a returner - I doubt he sees much play as a RB.  And we've kept 4 RBs several of the last few years, so... i don't see any reason why we wouldn't.
While I think he was an awful GM, I have a hard time demonizing Hurney because he has given nothing but praise for the current staff. It's hard to hate on a guy who has been such a class act after his time here.
I'm not sure I agree with you.  You can look at their base but you can't look at their traps and CC troops.  My understanding is that when the server send this information to your client it has registered your attack to have started.
You can get a Fire Orb from Pyro lady which is nice.  And after you kill that little dude after Freja, you can go back and Great Fireball which is awesome.  The flame salamanders drop those spells (as well as the basic fireball but it's a rare drop)  Now on to my favorite spell: Yearn. Use it. Know it. Love it. (Carhillion sells it)
Thanks to a post here, I took advantage of the Cult sale a couple weeks ago and got a great deal on those. The polishes in the second set were part of a kit so those were about 60% off as well! I found the OPI ones at TJ Maxx, and they were only $3 each.By the way, has anyone else had an issue with the caps on the Cult bottles? You can see that on a few of them the outer square cap twisted on the smaller cap inside and now it doesn't line up when the bottle is fully closed. Annoying :/
I'm not in the dextroverse at this moment, but I started out of pure curiosity. I didn't know what it was like to not be in this world. 4 years later, here I am. It has made me curious about many things, and I find myself researching string theory and possibilities of extra dimensions. I love doing too much, and dosing almost my full dose right away. I have had my best revelations in the rough come ups. I don't know what else to say, so, goodbye, fellow dextronaut.
You may be splitting hairs about spitting.  The reception of returning soldiers was met with hostility from many misguided civilians.  Mothers, students, flower-children etc. were documented in the media shouting epithets to GIs.  It's an ugly ignorance of citizens that was largely corrected during Desert Storm
I find it curious that they were able to address it (solely) server-side. I'm going to assume that ability cooldowns are "owned" by the server, and that the game UI just shows whatever the server sends back to it.
You're welcome. If this is just a mod repository where people work on different mods, I'd avoid calling it a project. For a lot of people, especially designers and developers, a project implies a single working goal or product. If it's a bunch of modders coming together to change and modify things, I'd go for using "community" instead to make it clear that these are all different mods with different designers and intents.
Cutting magic logs has always been a waste of time, like 100k/h profit, and pretty much only bots ever cut them so fuck them, screw bots.If you're a legit player well... get 72 slayer and go to wyverns. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The laws of physics apply just as much to video games as they do to real sports... That's a really strange things bring up... Also sports do change rules similarly to patches. You happened to mention Tom Brady,  someone who actually had a rule changed essentially by an incident he was involved in.Esports have some level of physical requirements, they're just a much smaller sub set of requirements. Calling them athletes is doing a disservice to those who have put in the work to run 4.16 40s and stuff but to act as though LOL Pros don't also put in work to hone skills and physical acumen us unfair. 
&gt; back. I'm not sure Reddit may be the best area for us to get specific feedback on this so we are exploring a few other methods.Judging how they handled the feedback about the PTS flight changes before they got pushed to live, it's hard to say if they even know what constructive criticism is.It seems like anyone who isn't sucking their dick or saying that the changes aren't that bad are the only people getting attention.
As a white male with an advanced degree, I won't even bother complaining about this because no one cares, including me.  I'll worry about myself and not about the system, because that's a more productive use of my time.
Smash makes me feel really bad about myself. I know I shouldn't play but I love it so much. But I get shit on by other competitive players and it really bothers me. Smash is a complicated subject...
The school psychologist said this to my brother. He graduated college and is a tv producer for major networks sports programming. People who say shot like this should not go into education.
ugh, some people are /r/eagles were actually hoping that trade would go through. I can't believe that shit, they really want to trade away Cox+Kendricks for one player..
&gt; As you can see here, % change in debt follows % change in returns..I don't really see it as a "chicken or the egg" kind of problem, but that chart clearly demonstrates that margin debt is a lagging indicator of peak SPX performance and, thus, is an accurate predictor of SPX under performance.The thing that is missing, that you can't chart, is that the current central bank policy of QE has never really been employed to the extent that is has been over the last 8 years.  And, in a more meta way, the QE policies of other central banks (Europe, Japan and China (and Russia and a few other lesser central banks) are sort of being timed to play off one another.  This could significantly reduce margin debt has hot money runs off to another stock market/central bank combination to make better returns.  That's the kind of thing that could force the FedResInk to discontinue QE and raise rates (a double margin debt whammie)
Huh? A man [born in 1972](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Gularte) would be at most ten years old in 1982.And a man born in a millionaire family would have a very good chance of getting whatever diagnosis his legal team wanted.He was just a dumb but rich spoiled kid, let's not make any mistake about that. No matter how you feel about the death penalty, this case is getting a spin that was paid for by a very rich family.

Why not something simple like Fighter, Slayer or Ranger 2 (gets archery and  other weapon use going) and Brawler the rest of the way. You'll have tons of feats to spare. 
Oh don't get me wrong a nice tube is a nice tube. I just always try to support local glass blowers when its feasible. And thankfully I'm lucky enough to live in a town that has three nice, locally owned, head shops to choose from.

It's not even just on the court. Imagine the amount of bullshit other players would get into with that money/power/fame. LeBron's been a model citizen and hasn't committed any sort of crime in his tenure. He just switched teams.
The salt is strong but I'm glad chip didn't give into their insane demands. They're gonna still suck for a long time before they become relevant. Way too many holes on that team
Gonna have to disagree with you, when I went to college, the cliques were strong with a lot of the better looking girls. You would have lost out to a guy in the right fraternity even if you had all that.
The girl that stopped texting me for two weeks (I stopped making an effort because she didn't text back when I texted her on two separate occasions) suddenly texted me, I still have yet to figure out whether it's a good or bad thing. Mostly because I'm not sure how I feel about her myself. For something completely great apparently me and some of my friends know all the lyrics to "Never Gonna Give You Up". We shall soon be experts at reciting it at the most inappropriate times.
Well I certainly wouldn't mind people preventing it. I mean I am glad I am trans, because after being born I realize that if I wasn't it would change something core to who I am. Even if I was a cis female, and life would have been a lot better it still wouldn't be my life. I wouldn't be exactly the same. However if someone isn't born yet there is no reason to make them suffer. Their gender identity hasn't developed yet and isn't a part of them yet. All for prevention. If it were safe of course :) 
Seriously asking EME to ban a guy for trolling? I mean I understand if that person was hacking but we have like at least a hundred trolls (including me :D) in ZMR.
That's pretty incredible, to think something as advanced as aircraft were during world war 2 to be taken down by an eruption. This is close to what I wanted to find out I suppose but I thought it would be really interesting to see an actual battle happening as close to an erupting volcano as possible. What would generals do in that situation?
ah union square. happens every time one race even looks at another the wrong way. people are such self-entitled rich assholes with nothing better to do here 
To be fair, as of early 2014, electric vehicles account for [only 1.1% of Oregon's cars](http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/analysis/drive-by-numbers-tesla-in-all-50-states.html), which is a drop in the tax bucket. Given the fact that these EVs are among the lightest cars, and therefore least damaging to our roads, I'm perfectly fine with letting them slide on the gas tax. Let those who make grocery runs in their 9mpg Hummers subsidize the EVs. 
Finally some real ideas amongst the down vote storm. In the UK cctv coverage is almost absolute - and I've read they also use algorithms to detect distressed voices etc in order to quickly notify operators. This would go a long way to ensuring public safety.
Mate what the early backers received was a little model of the Xian Khartu-al. One that you can put on your desk in your hangar ingame or something. Not the actual ship you can fly.Sometimes backer rewards are handed out during certain developer milestones. This can be some UEC, a little trinket for your hangar, a piece of personal armor, .... But always things that will also be available in the universe. So they are fun little things to get but by no means game breaking or even important.
Thanks for your input! The way you phrased it struck a chord with me (jack off all you want; don't jack off in the 'default' fashion). I guess because I don't watch porn, masturbating without porn is the 'default' for me, so I was viewing it as the default for him too, and porn is like taking it a step further from 'regular' masturbation. I'll think on this, thanks! And yeah, we're home together a lot but we're also doing our own thing a healthy amount, so if this is really something he craves I think he has plenty of opportunities to do it, regardless! 
It would be interesting to see if there were any long term studies that showed kid's developmental assessment results from age 2/3/4 compared to how they do when they're older. Do you know of any? My sense is that there are no statistics on the kids who end up doing well, because they never actually get tested again in the future once they no longer need intervention, so it's simply something that is not even measured. 
Add all ingredients except water. Fill to the half way mark in your pressure cooker. Seal and cook 30 minutes at pressure. Natural pressure release for best results. Voila, done.
This. This right here is freakin awesome news to hear (read). Still haven't seen the doc yet though... has it already been shown on HBO and/or released publicly yet?

Fallout's example sounds like a super neat way to depict harm against children, actually. Would be nice to see that sort of in-game consequences in more recent games.
Only issue I have is that there should be different weight to the itemslying for example.  one word - one word that can create untold amounts of trouble in all areas of your life, trouble which may not be recoverable, once thought of a liar by your boss, your girlfriend, whomever how do you ever establish the contrary?Additionally great stress what did I tell him?  what if they get together and compare what I told them?  The truth makes life much easier.

Ray gives him a cold expression, and ignores the question."Just checking something. Thanks for the help, though if you did that to get your sentence reduced I'm afraid to say I have no such power. I could put a word in with A, but I get the feeling he's preoccupied at the moment".Keeping his pistol trained at Zaeed, Ray opens up the comm line again. "This shall be my last broadcast on this comm channel unless someone responds. I need emergency assistance here. I am with prisoner HCMΔ-1610-IC, and have just been attacked by a Galen Marek Clone."The message sent, Ray turns his attention back to Zaeed. "How did you escape?"
Legally it wasn't her winnings, according to the law, which is what matters here, it was their winnings... To which she illegally hid.We do have enough info, you just choose to distort it.
Mine is  8 months old and clearly  has worked out who is fun parent. He was waking  up from a nap and we were  having  a quiet  cuddle. (Side note - aren't the  slightly  sleepy cuddles  just  THE  BEST?). Daddy  walks in and  my calm placid sleepy muffin  clapped his  hands  frantically  and started laughing  hysterically . Totally melted  daddy's  heart!
I think most adults don't understand mental illnesses much. They tend to always say things like "get over it" "it's just a phase", because that's what they were told back when there really wasn't much explanation for what we now know as anxiety, depression, ptsd and what not. Edit: By this I wish my mom knew I wasn't just faking my anxiety to get of doing things as simple as making a dentist appointment.  I wish the thought didn't make me want to cry.
Bullshit. She disrespected him by talking about how great the sex was with someone else (to the person she was fucking no less) and more importantly concealed a past relationship. It's a huge red flag, especially because she's only only upset because she got found out.
Or anybody hit by a bus, or cancer, or accidental electrocution, or live bomb in a body. Hey, have they had a biohazard event lock down the hospital yet?
I really like Wii fit, but I don't collect, so I'd prob take out of box. Sorry. But if I win, Ike would go to my friend who I think doesn't have one. Sharing the goodwill, yknow? :)
I've fallen in love with this character someone created. He unfortunately did not have any sliders, and I've been trying to reproduce this characters for 3 days since I bought my copy of DA:I. And then I finally had something close... and got stuck in the Fade bug in the beginning... So figures I'm kind of desperate... If someone will help me out with sliders I will make a drawing of their favorite DA:I character!

Well, every company follows one golden rule. Is it cheap and making lots of money, keep doing that. Is it sort of on the expensive side but still making money, ok maybe once every x months. Is it not making money? Burn that shit to hell.
Whatever team comes in first place should have their ward skin kept in store for a few weeks after the split while every other one is taken out, and the ward skin itself shouldn't be removed, because they won the split.Secondary idea would be the top idea but instead of everyone else losing ward skins they bought for teams that didnt come in first the ward skins everyone bought would all turn into the winning teams ward skin, to use or not to use.
One great thing about a painting like this: Everything is on purpose. You may have a scene in a movie that looks like this, or a staged picture, but there will be accidental things. An actor making a lazy face or a hand in any position at all. You make this painting and everything is precisely where it is because you meant for it to tell a story. My favorite is right next to the guy getting his head grabbed. The woman seems to be absently moving the cowl of the bearer in front of her to get a better view. Her face has a more curious expression than frantic or urgent like many of the crowd. She's almost a mirror of the woman on the litter. I like to think the person being carried was a decoy for the woman in the crowd, who just kind of wants to see her again to thank her for giving up her life so the other may live. 
he probably should have revealed them on fishman island. And I dont want him to change his fighting style I want him to not become useless by not evolving it. A zoan or paramecia devil fruit would help evolve his fighting style as well as the kick slashes and soru. Hell the strawhats need to continue to steal from cp9. Imagine life return monster point chopper or shigan robin. 
Like with the cage match... I was really hoping to see him be a new type of chickenshit heel, where it's what he does because it's who he is, but when backed into a corner, the old Seth Rollins comes back. Like, "yeah, I'm a coward...but you forget I'm a coward *who can fight*." 
Cacique's line goes B-C-D-DD-DDD-F-G-H, which in translates to UK sizes as B-C-D-DD-E-F-FF-G. If you're happy with the fit of your 38Fs, you'd still be a 38F in UK sized brands, though you'll need to be aware of different shapes. I've found Cacique's bras to typically to be average to narrow wire width and fairly projected in shape (except the plunges, which tend to be shallow) with a good underwire firmness.Panache tends to be about the same width or slightly wider but with much, much taller and firmer underwires. Freya tends to have softer underwires. Elomi and Goddess are often wider and more full coverage. Curvy Kate, IME as narrow and projected was a disaster.
At those rates you can pick from basically anyone in Chicago. Why risk it with the unknown?750 an hour is straight up theft and higher?The top rated lady on TER is 700 an hour. That's the #1 provider in Chicago.#7 is 400 an hour and everyone raves about her. (I tried seeing her, didn't work out.) Yet.No I won't tell you. Sign up.
I haven't seen this laid out anywhere, but I am glad too. With a little variation in the beginning and skipping a rewatch of Agent Carter and Daredevil (as I had just finished DD before doing the rewatches) this is how I went about it. It really does make sense this way. Thanks for sharing.
You will spudder around in circles and not learn much.  Sure, you may learn to play a sloppy amateur version of a song, but is that really what you are after?
I have two children and I'm not 100% sure how to do it. For now, I hide it from them but I foresee that once they are older (thinking mid to late teen) or when they start to show interest in intoxicants, I'd let them know what's going on. I like how /u/formerly_on_totse 's dad say that until he's 18, any weed found will automatically become the dad's. I'd actually tell my kids if they wait till 21, I'd buy one for their birthday if they're interested. 
Day ten in the switcharoo jungle. No end in sight. There are references flying all over the place. Provisions are being strictly rationed. I don't know if I'll ever get out of this god forsaken place alive.
No it doesn't. You feel nobody should care about giving up account security for a third party client. It has everything to do with what you are talking about. Appreciate the downvote though, truth hurts doesn't it?
Flea markets are a gold mine for classic game systems!! I bought a box full of stuff! (I.e. 2 snes's an original NES, a Sega genesis AND an Atari! Plus a bunch of controllers, and a few games for $60) garage sales are good too! 
I agree. it's difficult to feel there was not some exaggerations about the "energy" I would get this trimester. Still I'm early in so maybe it'son it's way? I may just nap until it gets here.zzzzzzzzzzzzz
TL;DR at 8:30pm&gt; Police say woman who had been placed into the backseat of police car -- already in police custody -- exchanged gunfire with officers. The incident/shooting started inside the police cruiser.&gt; The woman was detained during a stolen vehicle investigation.&gt; It's unclear if police searched the woman prior to putting her into the police car.&gt; Police were not injured.&gt; The woman is dead.
Your mom's boobs weighed 69 lbs, which she thought was 2 2 2 much, she wanted them to be 51, so she went to see Dr. X for 8 sessions, and this is how she woke up in the morning. 55378008
They're spanish playing cards. We use them in Argentina for a very popular game called "Truco". Micho and Maxi are showing monster hands, almost the royal flush of Truco.
This is a big problem in the US. People can spout all they want about cost/benefit financial projections analysis that you should have done and personal responsibility, but do we only want rich students whose parents can pay to become doctors? Or even, how financially motivated to you want your doctors to be? Looking at 4-5k payments every month for 15 years will surely have consequences. School costing that much in the first place, and the thinking that a kid should be a risky investment just the same as a business or commodity are the problems. 
I can take a photo with settings on the camera that will make the image not look like reality at all, however the image would still be unedited. Regardless, unless you are taking a raw photo the camera is editing the image for you.
&gt;  still can get you in jail. And does. Often. And aCANCAN if you are gonna quote me, dont take it out of context please ;).I agree with what alot of what you are saying, but I think we digress in that there are very few cases when I think statutory rape is "Ok".
I don't generally run Euphoria currently as it'#s pretty much negated on any fight where you're not standing still for too long - which currently appears to be a fair few of them, on top of Hellfire looking equally as movement orientated; though that's not to say there are fights where it would certainly excel.I just feel like if I'm not in Solar casting Wrath, I take too long to do any substantial damage besides multi-dotting, but gain this could simply be down to my break + being in what is effectively pre-Highmaul gear. 
Your question is based on an incorrect assumption. Scientists don't think everything they know is true. What they think is that something should be *tested* to find out if it is true.Without scientific testing all you can have is a hypothesis.
Chretien, as an ex PM, still represents Canada to people around the world and must comport himself accordingly. This being the case he should be adopting the same attitudes toward Putin and his policies as most of Canada feels. I am sure Harper represents the majority of Canadians' views in this area, but judging by Chretien's past careless regard for our feelings, he probably represented to Putin that Trudeau will be more forgiving and accepting of Putin.
Human nature is changeable.  Teenagers do not think or feel the same as the elderly.  Something changes them.Besides, you don't have to change human nature to change behavior. Human nature has many facets that can be accessed with various methods.  Designing a program with the idea of 'blacks are oppressed' versus 'blacks need to be more ambitious' is very different.The first targets the oppressors, who have little reason to change.  The second targets blacks, presumes they have power, and focuses on a population that has many reasons to change.
&gt;Yeah, I think its been shown that at best his timeline was a good five years off. All the stuff that was supposed to happen in 2008 is if you look at it like this actually starting now.Ripples man, ripples...  By coming back and commenting the way he did he changed things for us.&gt;2020 though.../me *shivers*
This kind of word is often said by children. First children learn words individually. They'll learn 'look', then they'll learn 'looked', and treat them like separate words.  Then, they learn rules, like adding 'ed' to the end of a word to make it happen in the past.Often, you'll hear kids "overgeneralize" these rules. They find the word 'looked' because that's the past tense word, then apply the past tense rule to make 'lookeded'.~This also occurs in AAVE (African American Vernacular English) as seen in your videos. I think this is the answer you're looking for.  Using this form of word can show that you're part of the AAVE community. Linguists theorize that it is a hypercorrection - an attempt to correct their regular speech to 'proper English', but overshooting the mark. [Here's my source.](http://www.modlinguistics.com/sociolinguistics/dialects/convergence%20of%20sound%20and%20meaning%20in%20aave%20language%20and%20culture.htm)
Just get them fired. I agree though. I have worked with people in the past who were always doing once off designs despite us having standards. Always call them when it's 1am and I've got an incident for their once off's. Haha. 
the difference is australia only has a population of 22~million, compared to USAs 300~million. australia is  ahead on percentage but the actual number of fat fucks is not even close.
Grew up with an old mutt named Turd.Also lived for ten years with a cat with no name. He was just "the other cat," as in "Yeah, we have two cats: Munchkin, and the other cat." His vet paperwork just said Othercat. I don't think he cared.

Yes I'll post up pics soon. And I didn't get the first packages w shitty stealth so I wouldn't know how bad it was I just know it's getting fixed and that's what matters. We all make mistakes its a good thing no one got in trouble 
Also, one of Lord Fray's men (it might have been Roose Bolton) told Lord Fray that he escapedOr it may have been somebody telling Tywin Lannister idk
I took it.    Honestly doesnt seem like the questions were granular enough.    Question 1.1 when asked what program/website it didnt list any specific game collecting website.  vgdb.io darkadia.com collectorz vgcollect.com etc.    question 1.2 with the companion question on 1.3 (justify my "no", which there was "no" answer). the justifications did not make sense.    I am not satisfied with google docs because i just organize ti in pc folders? What? It would make more sense if a response was like "doesnt track prices" or "does not have custom fields". I get that you have an "other" but I would have to much to add to that.    If this information is all you need, I just feel that the data you get wont be that useful (at least from my perspective)
People said the same thing when the Legend of Zelda Oracle games came out, but they turned out to be completely different games - worlds, dungeons, everything. We'll just have to wait and see with Fire Emblem.
&gt; no one has the right to tell their own storyWell, I didn't specifically say life story "rights," simply that you need to secure the life story as in, "you're better off if you get their blessing," because while they can't stop you from presenting facts, they can challenge the presentation of such facts.  And whether the law is or isn't on their side is a separate issue from whether or not they can sue.  &gt; You can't defame if you are telling the truth, you can also not defame a dead person.True statement, hence why I made the note that OP implied the subject is still alive.&gt; if you have taken just the bare facts, that are evident in several of the biographiesThe several sources bit here is really important.  If you can't corroborate the fact with other independent sources then it creates a conundrum.
This is why I believe European authorities should allow Islamic terrorists to carry out attacks, they literally gain nothing by stopping it, compared to increased power and public support when they allow these attacks to occur. 
Pat Robertson has acknowledged that trans people exist too, although he couldn't help but go on about that stupid "boys will pretend to be girls to get into the girls' bathroom" bullshit when there was an attempt to pass a law related to that in California.
 &gt; The problem was Juve’s habit of signing players, then loaning them out for six months to other teams — exactly as happened with James Troisi.Fair call then.
If Nintendo does start selling the cards I bet they'll sell it like Pokemon cards where it's random ones in a pack but there are 10 different illustrations of each character. Obviously "rare" ones are shiny ones. Then again, I don't want to fall back into the slippery slope of "just one more pack" from my Pokemon fanboy days.
Well, 30 tons is more than you need for a 2 ton Tesla car. So using just 20 kW, which will make the car hover but not rise up, the 85kWh battery pack would be exhausted in 4 hours. Using the engine to move forwards would use slightly more power but I think we'd still get a few hours flying time using current battery tech.I doubt the engine will be that efficient... It seems too good to be true.
It's a bad, straw man argument. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament too. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
i dont understand how faker is in any way related to this conversationi understand what they are trying to do, i just think its odd you drop a guy for "international success" when you havent played one international team yetand faker is the exception not the rule to pretty much everything in league of legends
The argument isn't "manual makes me the most connected to the road that I could ever be" its "manual makes me FEEL more connected to the road than I do when driving an AUTOMATIC" 
Holy shit this would be so interesting if done right. Like a bunch of people from all over the MiB, from the lowest ranking to some really higher ups deciding upon the fate of a convicted alien.

I love Hardy, and he's one of my favorite actors, but I don't see him as Bond.  While he's a pretty good looking guy, he seems a bit brutish for the part.
It is. I invited some friends there, and they aren't really the type of people who indulge in any kind of "nerdy" things, so they reluctantly came along. Long story short, we had a blast, and try to do it at least once a month.
Its like you're playing a match in league or something and you about to clutch to hit top 1 in whatever division and then KABOOM, some fucking Hunter Killer OP Shitdrone comes at you!
This is by far the best option I've seen so far. I love everything about it, even the outside. I'm pretty certain this is what I'll be getting. Thank you so much!
I have a riot shield with overkill on my back on all shotgun classes. It helps so much for just 2 points. Perks are always Lightweight, Low Profile, Blind Eye and Blast suppressor (with the S12 scavenger as well). Attachments are different from variant to variant. On my Sledgehammer I only use Emag and AR, on the roundhouse I put on Laser Sight as well. 
Cheap Chinese batteries that will fail or a higher prices nintendo battery? I don't think it's worth considering, unless you want the hassle :/ I've been pondering getting a nin ext battery as well but I sit close enough to leave it plugged in so haven't pulled the trigger
SpyFu has keyword groupie. But like Realsan said, it's not a perfect piece of software. There also exists many other free and paid (even Google has one on the AdWords site). The truth of the matter is that the human eye is best at making a decision as important as this.Just my 2 cents
I saw the crease and decided to consider it part of the uniqueness of this one pair...I think the color is accurate for the lighting of that pic, by which I mean, in the dark these boots are like a deep brown with some red, but in the light you get much more of that color 8. I'm pretty happy with the color but I have yet to see them in strong daylight, I got them a few hours ago, unboxed them with the camera, wore them half an hour, went out for a run, just got back and it's dark out. Tomorrow!edit, in the light the panels don't really match, the sides are more red than the toe box. But it's not easy to tell, and the reddish #8 is a great color. I'm psyched to see how these age over time.
There was not a *single mention* of Freddie Grey in the thread that led to this one. [To quote Jesse Wililams,](http://www.salon.com/2015/04/28/so_exactly_what_kind_of_violence_dont_you_like_actor_jesse_williams_baltimore_rant/) "exactly what kind of violence don't you like?" 
No one knows.My best guess for USA: check sites at 3am for them after wave 4 releases on the 29th.That or wait for the placeholders to go up and then set up page monitor.
The tax burden is usually averaged out ... but we also have an intensely *huge* economy and a *vast* amount of income is going to the top.   They squawk that they pay a larger "percentage" but in total ... they're making so much more it doesn't mean much.http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456This is the Federal taxes at least, which everyone thinks somehow should be cut more and more.
Life. I only put in a lot of time when I was a student; High school, University. It just took too much time once I was working. The expectation from guildies or friends got to be too much. I had to be firm that yes...I really do need to log off.  It was easier to just quit playing. I have gone back to my single player games. No more MMO's. I may pick up a game for myself once a year, more if a really good one comes out. 
I've seen Webs solo-commentate before (Melee) and he was really good, but that's also because Webs is just an awesome commentator in general. I can try to find sets to link you when I get back to my computer
Yeah I thought about that -- perhaps I can use that little decoupler that fires both ways and then just knock it out of the way. Thanks! I'll let you know how it goes.
Ha! I just had the opposite happen. My DH just gave me "his" room to expand my office. I guess he realized the more space I have, the more money I can make. 
I recently downloaded Hearthstone on my phone and have been playing it for a good amount of time this past week. Thing really takes a toll on your battery though. The small amount of data it uses is freaking crazy though. 
If you haven't been suckered into paying money for a survival game yet don't start now...they never get finished and there is no point to them the sandbox gets boring quickly spend your money on a proper game
Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.  And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :)
Ok, so if you are a normal human, you can extrapolate that since it is so close to a 980, then it would be logical that it is much better than a 970.
I'm at 900 miles on my 2015 with the short throw shifter. Gear changes certainly aren't as smooth as I would like but it shifts like it did the day I got it. Unless this is a new problem for you I think it might just be a design flaw 
Exactly the onus of proof is on the police to prove he isn't Thor, as soon as he claims to be Thor.  His conduct seems like something a god might do if he/she felt the inclination. I'm just a mortal, my mind is to puny to justify humping a tree, but to a god, maybe tree fucking makes sense.
Attemdance and active faith are down because the burn agains have turned people off with a literal reading of scripture that cannot respond to contemporary western societies. You did it to yourselves by using Jesus as a cudgel to justify your own social conservatism that in no way represents a contextual view of the New Testament as a Christian Constitution--which like any constitution, cannot be prescriptively applied, it must be a living tree, with the ability to grow.
Fairplay for doing the difficult thing. I know it's easy for us to say, we don't know this guy, but he really sounds abusive. I can't imagine what it's like having someone you love giving you grovelling apologies like this. But, he has made so many unreasonable, unrepentant, demands of you that it seems as though he's only apologising because he's realized you've had enough. That basically sets the precedent that he pushes you as far as he possibly can, and you let him because you want to be a good spouse, this is pretty textbook conditioning for an abusive relationship.
Aahh the secret: use a shampoo for dyed hair, wash and rinse in cold water, and most importantly, rinse until the water is COMPLETELY clear. If the rinse water is still tinted, that means there is still loose pigment, and that will readily contaminate your other colours. Once out out the shower, immediately squeeze as much water as you can out, then wrap it in a towel, then swap for another towel after a few minutes, then maybe a third. Drying it faster means less time for further loose pigment to transfer. This will also prevent you from staining your pillow cases and shirt collars!
These fighters don't have any personal connection to the Kurds or Syria, whether it is a man or woman is irrelevant IMO. It's rather selfish to go off and risk orphaning your children, especially given that the YPG don't seem to have a manpower shortage.
I'm super excited for this new scent. I've been looking for a "scotch &amp;amp; cigar" scented shaving soap. Hopefully this will give me my fix being that it has some tobacco leaves in it. 
*[V](http://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/34g169/v_reintroduced/) notices the new guy covered in blood and walks up* Hello there, I haven't seen you around before.
[Here](http://imgur.com/MuIorEA) is a bonus shot from today. Before, I used to brush my hair in the shower and just throw huge clumps of it away. It was dry and unmanageable and I thought it looked decent because it had volume. I straightened it all the time.Now, I co-wash once every day or two, S2C, and comb, not brush. I also use a little bit of gel before plopping overnight. I never knew what to do with my hair, and while I'm not 100% satisfied, I know I'm on the right path!
Two things I take from this:* On the one hand, this shows crazy potential; if he is 8-0 and looking dominant already, imagine what will happen now that he is training with proper equipment and other fighters (instead of sparring with his dad and 17 y/o brother)!* On the other hand, this might very quickly lead to him becoming a big fish in a little pond, as Matthews will be training with the likes of Dan Kelly, aka that guy who fought Sam Walsh in Colorado in what looked like two dads brawling at a bbq.
You probably can do it yourself for cheaper; the question is do you want to do it yourself...  Honestly, with the way this is worded, it seems like you already have that answer.  You don't need validation from a bunch of Internet strangers.However, FWIW, I have Vivint, and have had it for some time.  I also have a separate veralite that I use for all automation excluding locks, and a camera.  I feel no regret in having vivint, because although I could have done it myself, I didn't want to go through the hassle.  Also, I'm a fan of the vivint sky app aesthetics, and find it to work well; ideally though, I'd love to have the 2gig panel as a secondary zwave controller, but it seems vivint has that thing too locked down for that. Just my $0.02
I got the bright idea to sneak into the community pool with a friend when we were younger. I thought it would be awesome, just the two of us, male and female in a dark secluded body of water... I had a panic attack in the middle of the pool and she had to talk me through it... 
Im going to assume this is pulsator without clicking on it in which case, i dont need to post what i was going to which would have just been like 80 all caps pulsator!'s
It's definitely running at 720p but fps might be around 30-45 or 50 if I'm guessing. You're right it definitely hasn't been running under 30fps but it doesn't seem to be above 55 either. Another thing to consider is that when looking at the livestreams that have been around the past few days you have to remember that twitch's quality settings might be a bottleneck in some cases considering the pc that they're streaming from has to be able to handle above 30fps. Derrik from GameXplain was streaming two days ago and he said even though the game is running higher than 30fps, that's the max we'll see because his pc can't handle anything higherEdit: holy shit grammar I need food
I figured so but asked because I wonder how that sort of thing is done accidentally. Then again my most advanced computer knowledge consists of bolding text with HTML.
what the fuck's your problem? Calling somebody a bitch just cause they asked a question. They obviously don't know much about opiates and are worried. No reason to get all pissy. 
I love how random the curse's methods are.Loss by horrible beating.  Loss by submission.  Loss by weird KO, followed by leg snap, followed by positive test.  Loss by mental issues and drug testing problems.  Loss by zombie knee tissue.  Loss by criminal accusations.  Loss by get real Aldo isn't going anywhere.
If you place all your value in PPP sure, but there is a lot more to a strong middle class than the ability to buy certain goods when the inflation of more essentials (healthcare, higher education, childcare, etc) are placing them further out of the reach of the average American.
If you had to select healthy food, and you had only one metric to go by, that would probably be the best one. Processed foods don't even list their ingredients, so evaluating their nutrition value is not possible. But when I'm eating an apple, I have a pretty good idea what it is.

You wouldn't have to make minimum wage higher; the wage would rise naturally as they have competition from the basic income. So people would be replaced with machines, or wages would increase to get staff. 
I PvP by myself and kill the entire server easily.  For money and xp heists with that ping aren't awful at all.  Seriously man.  You're missing a lot by not playing with others.  
Why do you want to age this beer?  At low abv, very few non-sour beers will last a year, let alone a decade.  Red/amber ales are not particularly known for their longevity.  Having the beer in a fridge helps, but only to an extant.  I doubt the results will be positive.
Yeah, that too. It also allows different Gem characters to be assigned noticeably different levels of strength and durability, without weaker characters having to either die, suffer permanent injury, or display unbelievably good luck.
I do. My friends all went their separate ways. Marriage/kids...Me making friends was not just gonna happen so i have to go out and get it. I go to bars by myself and initiate conversation with people. Its hard but you end up meeting cool people.Life begins when you leave your comfort zone.
Ugh that sucks. I run on a grassy path that's been totally worn down in places and has the odd tree root to try and trip you up, but I'm getting used to it now! I hate getting all excited for a run and having something out of your control spoil it (my last one was during an early heat wave when I discovered my sunscreen melts into my eyes whilst running!).Hopefully you can use the Google maps measurement function (right click anywhere and select it) and satellite view to measure up an appropriate section of your nicer track instead?
Gravity is a theory. If you can tell me why gravity works (or rather, how it works) head down and pick up your Nobel Prize. There's also a law, which is what you are talking about. Pretty easy to prove that one. This is exactly the phrase I came here expecting to see somewhere, and to anyone who has studied physics, you sound like an idiot. FWIW I'm not an evolution-doubter either. This is just crappy defense.
Well, an exaggeration of the situation to the point where it's an epidemic is a bit much, but even if it was, against innocent owners' private property and ordinary citizens of Baltimore? Not even close. Against the police? It would make more sense, but still no. The crimes of a few do not justify attacking the total group.
Not trying to be a dick. I just thought you might look it up after asking. It is a compiled list of testings like GC/MS, NMR and a few others. Wasn't trying to be mean.

Same thing happened to my in the exact same ranger. It ended up being the line that crosses the front k-member. It may not be the same location for you but that same truck rusted through the rears the year before so i would start there.
Gingerbread Cookie is okay, didn't really wow me. It was a little strong by itself at 5% I found. I personally wouldn't use it as a standalone, but it definitely has value if you used it with an icing/custard/vanilla. That's something I'll actually be working with this weekend. Thinking:* French vanilla 4%* Gingerbread Cookie 2.5%* Whipped cream 3%* Something else that'll probably run it :P This was one of the two flavors (the other being Dulce De Leche) I didn't really feel I had a grasp on. Kinda just sat there vaping it being like "hmmm, I taste...umm...hmmm...a little....hmmmm" I may have to mess around with this again at different %'s.
Not even that I was accepting as a kid (as a fat kid I was kind of forced to be based off the fact the only friends I had all had mental handicaps because everyone else called us freaks) its just that as a kid the only thing i cared about was whatever toy/franchise/tv show at the time I was enjoying. for all I care you could have told me my uncle joe was hitler; he fucking bought me transformers mate! hiel hydra and all that jazz!
Losing is aways a ding and can only be offset by a lot of winning like your example.  6/10 is incredible - making the finals 10 time is rare, and winning 6 is also hard!  Lebron is 2/5 right now... he's lost more than he won and needs to win a lot more. What if he ends up 4/8?  I would take 6/6 over 4/8 every time.  But if LBJ ended 6/10, which means he goes 4/5 from now forward... and he has two more repeats or a threepeat, then I could seriously include him in the GOAT conversation. 
If you don't like Lucha Underground, you not a REAL wrestling fan like me.  it's the best thing ever ( le FACT) and I came exactly 6 times during the last episode. People who don't like it are gay and enjoy sex with men.
Not trying to be a dick. I just thought you might look it up after asking. It is a compiled list of testings like GC/MS, NMR and a few others. Wasn't trying to be mean.
Thanks for the comment - I definitely found a trend when I was researching the piece with users shouting 'troll!' when actually they were just in the middle of a discussion. Not always a mature discussion with good, considered points being made, but more than just trolling for the sake of it.I like this summary - 'A troll isn't part of the discussion, he tries to transform it into a clusterfuck of anger, frustration and wasted energy/time - where he can be at the center of it.' - it covers most of the different troll personas I was trying to create well!
I'm sure you can pick up something. Mostly stuff like proper positioning and general tactics, but I bet you can get something from playing with the more experienced players. I'd give it a shot.
In previous reply, I asked...&gt; The numeric parts are 4, 12, 36. yes? &gt; What is the greatest common factor?You didn't respond.Can we try again?If you see that part, then do the same thing for all the s parts. If you want, start by listing them.
I get shit from time to time playing Sheik and Jigglypuff, but that just makes the chaingrabs, tech chases, and rests so much more delicious, just ignore em, sheik aint as easy as people make her off to be anyway. :)
Yup. My father was killed by a drunk driver in 91. He got 12 years, got it after 7, and has been back at least 3 times since his release then for DUI. A lot of people I know that don't know about that will be having conversations about their weekends, and just laugh saying things along the lines of 'oh man, I was so drunk, I don't know how I made it home' or 'I don't even remember driving there' It really gets my blood boiling how many people think it's fine. And even worse - the people who say things like 'Yeah, I know it was dumb, but I mean, I didn't hurt anyone' 
It is, but as /u/Bzerker01 said, now its ideal for non-Americans, we exist too you know, we contribute with our time, money and effort, we are also being hired to work on Star Citizen in the UK and Germany (and in all likelihood, outnumber US staff too!). Non-Americans, they're just like Americans... they're just not in America. ;)Maybe once in a while they'll be able to get out of the office at a normal hour, expecting them to stream live outside of US work hours, when they're in the US, im sure isnt exactly ideal for them either.Also, isnt this the same time the show used to be done? It only went later when they pushed AtV later. It managed to run for months at around this time, and so 'Apparently you have not watched the resent shows' can be returned as 'Apparently you have not watched the first/previous 20-30 shows'. All they've really done, bar a couple of recent eps, is moved it a day later.
it only really happens in the middle of rounds, not really towards the ends of them. it's weird. when I have to cluch I focus hardcore, but every other time I can't seem to
Well my 8th grade science teacher had a picture of a female student as his wallpaper and got fired 3 times for sexual harrasment so i guess thats nice...
Awesome! love a bit of good dnb :) rolled last week and whilst I have experienced mdma on quite a few occasions last week was an eye opener for me as well, has spurred me on to move forward and stay positive! hope you have some lights to enjoy :P
Oh. I know. I have more guy friends than girl friends. My feeling is, of you can claim 3 women you've been friends with for longer than a year, you're golden. But I lived with a girl who literally had NO friends that were women. At all. And she is the poster girl for the kind of woman were just lampooning. Just. Could not be happy unless every man in the room was paying attention. And was aweful to any woman she felt threatened that. None of us are in contact with her anymore.
Couldnt find 2016, but I found 2015 if that helps: http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-maya-2015-service-pack-6.htmlIt doesnt look like they have released 2016 in their support section yet.
Chip Kelly spent the night running naked through back alleys in Philadelphia high on bath salts and reeking of toilet wine. He will be making picks based on the advice of Mumbly Joe who he met around the burn barrel. 
Still, it would suck if you fell for someone of a different species and wanted to have a kid with them.No kidding? I thought that there were centaurs and shit running around! /s
I used to have dreams that I could fly, but only if I furiously flapped my arms.  I couldn't make it very high either, like as high as the 2nd story window.  I'd always get out of breath and sink back down to earth pretty quickly.

STOP TRYING TO BE FRIENDS UNTIL YOU ARE OVER EACH OTHER! No contact with him. Seriously. You can't be friends with exes until you have moved on. Two and a half months is not long enough to get over a year long relationship. Stop hurting yourself. You are only making the chances of you actually being friends in the future worse.If you are lonely, go hang out with ANYONE OTHER THAN HIM.
I use maple syrup instead.. But I also drink almond milk and eat lots of fruits which from what I understand in the U.S. are entirely pollinated by commercial bee hives.
It was well laid out and yes of course, drawn beautifully but a lot of people are upset because it incorporated little to no in-betweening or "actual animation" and is rather just a set of very still keyframes
When me and my little brother were in elementary school, our parents weren't able to pick us up on time after school so we stayed at this daycare hosted by the school.  One day, the one adult there asked my brother to stop running.  I forget what my brother said back, but he made a rude comment back.  The adult grabbed him by his shirt and said "I could knock your teeth out right now if I wanted to." We told our parents and they weren't too happy about it.  My dad came in the next day to "talk" to him.  The adult ended up puking from the conversation he was so scared.  
Awesome job of the hat!Which reminds me that I wish Ferrari would return to that style on their logo. The Ferrari logo and the style of writing is so much better then that Marlboro inspired crap they have currently.
The description is fine, but the photo is different. Maybe they updated the design of the camera? There were no rippled ovals on the front when I bought mine. 
I'll just add that I use VB, and overall haven't had any *serious* issues with them. But there have been minor issues here and there:1.) When selecting the "ETF Free" commission structure, *sometimes* I am still charged for purchasing ETFs. Not sure why.2.) I had some issues when setting up my accounts with VB, but it was resolved with a phone call to their customer service.I only use VB to buy a few ETFs and re-balance only once a year.

If they ever force me off I will just not pay the bill and let them send me to collections. Fuck off Verizon. Its not like I won't ever get a house or a car or an apartment because I have an unpaid cell phone bill
Nope. I actually had him my senior year (last year). He seemed a lot less bigoted. Still a smart ass but wasn't an outright asshole anymore. To my knowledge he's still at the school
That's nice to hear!German is a very hard language to learn. So let me teach you some more:Baden as a noun is a region in Germany (as in Baden-Wurttemberg).Baden as a verb means "to take a bath".And while you were close, the bathroom is Badezimmer, no n.Hope that didn't sound too condescending...
Holy, that's a badass helmet. I love how it turned out. Is the link broken for the airbrush site? It won't load for me.I like the design, it's like a reverse venom meets vindicator. Good luck in Toronto.
I miss them because there was a proper story mode. I don't care for the "Universe" aspect, and the reliving past matches thing was cool for a bit but they sort of peaked with the Attitude Era one.The old PS2 Smackdown games had a better "Universe" mode with Be A GM where your cards and rivalry's were rated, even that shit is way better then the current state.
Hers is also curled cork bark, however I broke it in half and firmly planted the bottom in the substrate and made a middle section with bark buried horizontally added more packed Eco earth, then finally added the top of the cork. Topping it off with- you guessed packed econearth. :)
Nah, it looks like pretty decent tech. So it should have a gyrostabilizer. Heck my small palm sized quad copter has one. The more weight put on an area, one or two of the rotors will speed up to stabilize it.  
My aunt sent me an email once after Christmas chastising me for not being grateful for getting gifts at Christmas because she didn't hear me say thank you to everyone. Another reason she is my least favorite aunt.
I would skip around my living room like a giddy little school girl  if they did a darker spin of the theme song when winter comes. Not too different, but noticeable.
I like how everything varies, it adds to it.  You'll have some low calm stuff then all of a sudden a head is lopped off.  Or a character basically threatens lives likes it's nothing.
I don't recall being either passive or aggressive.  For someone looking for people with good attitudes and so forth... you're awfully upset over extremely temperate replies. :&lt;
So i did some research on this, and found a book called [The Tower: Guardians of Destiny](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15808475-the-tower).....
Prepare for the worst traffic of your life if you choose Renton ...especially if you start work during rush hour. Like most places, you get what you pay for. If you want to be closer to more and higher paying jobs with less of a commute, you will pay more. I pay $1,600 for a 2-bdrm in Redmond, and it's nothing special. . . but buying a place here would start around $500k for anything we would actually want. 
My pleasure! It's fantastic that you are able to manage them so well - good for you! Interesting how our bodies work, isn't it?Also, though I'm Canadian and just guessing you're American, thanks for your service. The Navy is badass!
I was in a orchestra last year with cello, and was Ok (First chair, district orchestra, professional side by side, higher level group, accompaniment to my school's choir).
i have medium to weak facial hair genes. i have spent upwards of 2 years (on and off cycling; on half the year for 4 years) on doses well above supraphysiological including injecting straight DHT, tren, masteron, test.....legit chinstrap came at the 1-1.5 years on high doses (800 mg-1500 mg per week) mark, full beard is just now rockable as stubble and will not be legit to grow out (not that i will grow it much longer than 1 cm) for about another 2 years of on time.i have also used plenty of minoxidil and dermarolled the fuck out of my face.also, accutane was used by me, which reduces DHT's ability to do it's thing in the skin.
But seriously, surely the machine shop at Mercedes isn't idle, especially with Ferrari looming in their mirrors?  Doesn't each team try to pick up a tenth or two each race from car refinements, and more from multi-week breaks?  Do you think they're just being coy because of the press they were getting after dominating in Australia?  
Hey Marc, most people probably won't see this since this thread is old, so if you really want people to know you should just make a new topic. If it's not that important to you, I wouldn't bother. Either way, it wouldn't be a bad idea to give these guys a quick reminder about Ragefest every now and then. I won't do anything unless you give me confirmation.That flair is funny. Marisa=Reisen?
Actually most people know what time zone they are using. Clearly since they are based out of Seattle USA they are using the Tasmanian time zone, I mean what else would they use?
Exactly! I've got a feeling that his Bankai will (I can dream, can't I?) be amazing.When I was re-watching the anime, I noticed something I think I missed in the manga. During the FKT-arc he was stressing over weather or not his healing abilities were up-to-snuff to save those injured by Ayon. I believe he mentions that he was originally in Squad 4 and that he hopes his talents have waned too much since then. Clearly, he was a stellar healing-kido user back then. I hope that he trained his healing Kido from FKT and on and maybe even became quite adept at it allowing him to save himself after being "gutted" like he was. At least, that's the explanation I want to happen. :( 
44/64 available Gods were picked/banned in the LAN this weekend. That's only 3 sets. That is *no where* even *close* to the same exact bans every time..
Couldn't you tone orange out with blue the same way you can tone out yellow with purple?  Granted it wouldn't make it lighter but it would tone it down.

Not just parking lots, test server 1 has a foundation deck built across the main road at wake hills hamlet.Also barbed wire across the roads in several clutch area's on the east side of the map.  I don't know why, it's pve and a test server, unless the test was "will dbags dl the test server?".

&gt; people who use the place as a part of their identity and are threatened by people who would come compete with them for houses, jobs, eligible mates, and friends. Well....yeah. I was born here and like it here but it's becoming increasingly difficult to afford to live in the place I've spent my whole life. 
I've always said that cat-days are just as important as sick days. Sometimes your cat is doing something that is just so goddamn cute/inhibiting your movement and that is not your fault.
Assuming there is on button i would stay there and push it all day. Not just for the money because that guarantees I don't die by other button pushers. Because as long as you stop and let other person in your survival is no longer guaranteed. 
The movie folk want people in the states to be chomping at the bit to see it. Money. Hold it off for two weeks, minor spoilers leak from over seas. Boom more people want to go see it opening night so they can be in it too.
This always killed me on the PS2. It's like nobody with any UI experience at all ever looked at it.Why in the *world* would I want to acknowledge that the save worked? Why in the *world* would I want to confirm that I actually do want to pick up where I left off? And why aren't you already loading the last level I was on and the last save I made while you're showing me silly cut scenes and menus? And why would I *want* to download a demo, wait for 20 minutes for it to download, then come back and have to push a button to start waiting for 20 minutes for it to install??
When asked to provide it for a 'security question' for most accounts I generate a maximum length random string and store that in my password manager. Unfortunately banks pull that kind of thing from the public record for authentication.
Besides /u/Terk1000 on-point remark, the pros and college are two different games in style, schemes, and rules. Also, what motivates college players, and what motivates pros, are two different things. Just because you're great at car sales, doesn't mean you'll be great at real estate, or retail, or software sales, or...you get the idea.
Better than most since she has a higher amount of shields and health compared to most of the frames, and it's not like mesa doesn't have the same problem once Loki uses Radial Disarm :3
North Carolina voters were *tricked* into voting for these idiots, but they'll still suffer from the consequences...FTFY.That political deceit is not limited to North Carolina and neither are the widespread repercussions that result from them.  Be careful what you wish for in life.
Hero dmg is the most irritating newbie stat in the game, we all had that "I'M BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU BECAUSE LOOK AT MY HIGH HERO DMG!!!" guy on our team at some point, at the same time the fact that he has more deaths than the other 4 team members combined doesn't seem to matter to him because "HERO DMG!!" -.-"
I would be more impressed if the charity they did was anonymous. Instead, many churches strike me as doing charity as a form of advertising. "We're so nice, don't you want to join us?" Other churches are so blatant that they'll [refuse to work with nonbelievers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/in-season-of-giving-atheist-groups-charity-rebuffed/2013/12/19/45ddbef6-68f2-11e3-997b-9213b17dac97_story.html) or [withhold charity to those who don't share their beliefs.](http://www.rawstory.com/2013/11/catholic-church-yanks-major-ymca-grant-over-links-to-lgbt-support-group/)And of course, the rumors of religious charitable giving [have been greatly exaggerated.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/the-flesh-is-weak-churchgoers-give-far-less-than-they-think_b_1846516.html)
You can buy a big bag for around $10 at St Michaels Special School. The money goes to a great cause for the school. Those kids are great and need all the help they can get. It's just off Tchoup next to the Saulet. 
I do need to be more careful. I just can't imagine what else to cut down or out. I already eat lots of veggies, salad, lean meat, no sugar, little fat and little carbs. I think being more religious about Journaling my food will help for sure 
You think looking at people's comment history is "stalking"?You should really talk to someone about these paranoia issues you have. And while you're at it, have you given any thought as to why you attract so much negative attention on this website? 
Hm.. I should sell Cellulase as an emergency food item and become rich. "One package of Cellulase, 1qt water, and 1lb of grass. Stir for 5 minutes. Makes (not so)delicious, healthy survival soup!"
Earlier he said the same shit he's been saying. They're doing the same shit. Difference being they aren't fucking chucking their possessions away playing too fast. They're playing at the same tempo they just aren't giving the other team the ball every other time down.    Thibs didn't do shit, the players just got sick of being outworked by a much shittier team.
Wow!! I will have to *eventually* go to court against my abusive ex and his friend.  I went to the police almost 2 years ago and there's STILL no trial date yet...I feel like I'm stuck in a nightmare sometimes. No one in my family knows about it...its a huge weight to carry :-(Unless people have been through it, I  don't think people understand how hard/stressful it is to be a victim of crime and have to go through the very sloooooow, very confusing and very scary court process.That's so awesome that you can now close that chapter and have all that weight lifted!  Good for you!
Ayeee, Like I've said before, I have flushed them. And once everything cools down, I will start smoking again, this time, taking extra care that no one knows. Besides that, I'm going to stay with a buddy in Chicago all summer, so much bud will be smoked, so I am sure I'll forget all about this Hydro nonsense.. I just so badly needed a filler.Oh and I like to be high, yes, but i can go without it. Once before, I went 4 months without using any substance to get high at all, so I think I have pretty good will.
I guess this applies to playing with as well as against but, Guqin Sona. The sound effects with this skin irrationally irritate me. It makes my skin crawl and my fiance trolls me by playing with the skin all the time.

i used to dislike terrorist especially during in its early stages, but when the later chapters came out i started to realize that they are the most emotionally-investing couple of the four pairings (if that makes sense). shinobus really serious and it just proves that the pair isnt just "for fantasy". theyve got some realistic aspects into their story that made me like them a lot. (kind of reminds me of why i like yukisa too ahaha)
Fuck, what a bunch of assholes. This sounds like it happened in the US. Cops over there really seem to be completely moronic dickwads. I feel sorry for the people living in the US and having to deal with such lousy police.
I have the same dream every time I am about to get sick. I open my eyes and I am inside of a giant sphere. The sphere is pretty much a hollow Epcot. Same triangular build and material. I see a hole open in the top and a ball drops in. Instead of falling, the ball circles around the sphere as it slowly comes down. The second I look away from the ball, I look across from me to see one of those scrambler rides. The ones that spin its arms in a circle while three seats attached to the arms also spin in a circle but in the opposite direction. On it, is a damn marionette. It's dressed as a cowboy and aims a shiny gun at me and right as he's about to fire it, I look for that ball again. It's feet away from me and it's about twice as big as I am. The puppet fires his gun and the ball smashes into me. I wake up and I am full on sick. This dream I have had every time I come down with anything more than a cold. The first time was when I was 6 and had pneumonia. 
I was being abstract because that guy was talking about abortions in general. But yeah that was my first thought as well - how can she even survive the pregnancy at ten? The risk to her life must be extreme.
"Hmmm." *Kris strokes his chin and goatee as he searched for another box. Spotting none in the places he checked so far, he turns to Amai hopeing ahe had better luck.* "I can not see any, although maybe there might be another one at a different store?"
Law school is a game (a VERY hard one, obviously) and part of it is to hype up the difficulties to new potential students.Ask yourself these two questions: do you want to be a lawyer? And are you willing to spend three years of your life studying when you could be earning income?If you do your homework and answer "yes," then disregard everything else. If you are willing to throw away three years of income to become a lawyer, the workload shouldn't concern you. It's hard as hell, but if you truly want to be a lawyer then it won't be miserable. And it pales in comparison to the financial sacrifice (lost wages plus tuition and living expenses) that you know you're incurring when you walk in.If 1) you have an idea of what it means to be a lawyer, 2) you're aware of the financial investment, and 3) *you still want it*, you shouldn't be scared off by horror stories.
From a few weeks to several months, depending on the severity and the treatment options. This guy will probably have permanent injuries because the top part of his back is gone now. His muscles are probably  necrotic to some point and don't get me started on the chest wounds (that we can't quite see in the image).
Ok, I love the feel of being connected on my bicycle, or my '48 farmall, as well as my E30. No matter the vehicle, manual control over the gears has always made me feel more connected, more in control, and more part of the driving experience.
Halftime Four FactorsFactor | Bulls | Bucks------|-----|-----EFG% | 59.2% | 39.4%OREB% | 27.3% | 04.8%TO% (est.) | 14.1% | 20.2%FT Rate | 14.3 | 36.4I did these Four Factors breakdowns for some Duke games on /r/collegebasketball because I like to see what some of the stats say about the game, and whether it agrees with my eyes. Here, it basically confirms everything we're seeing: the Bulls are shooting really well and the Bucks aren't, the Bulls are doing a lot better on the offensive glass than the Bucks, and the Bulls aren't turning it over as much. But what I don't think gets captured is the percentage of opportunities that the Bulls are converting compared to the Bucks. The Bulls are outscoring the Bucks 15-1 off of turnovers, which exacerbates the disparity in turnover rate. They're 7-7 from the line to the Bucks' 7-12, neutralizing the Bucks' advantage in free throw rate. That's just my two cents.
I grew attached to Matthias in just a few days, even though when I first got him he hated me. I think it's really hard to kill them with anything but brute force. Just watch where your butt is going X_X
The risk of being the best in a draft system that rewards the worst.  Which is ok with me.  The "problem" with Philly is that our teams tend to be good, but never good enough to win it all.  And not bad enough for long enough to bring in superstars.  So we always have good players.  But never great.
You could throw it away and tell her you ate it all. Or you could just not eat it, because you are above binge eating now. Or, just eat a little with dinner when it gets served. A spoonful or two won't hurt you that much, so long as you count it and don't eat a whole serving.
This video highlights the true nature of law enforcement in this country: absolute disregard or concern for public safety (and instead a focus on revenue generation and non-violent drug offenders)
It might be because the meta is so new, but T10 feels very disjointed. The towers are too far spread out, and that might be mostly because of the design of the maps not properly meshing with the current playstyle. Typically towers are captured so you can spawn up there when you die. I don't think people are really getting the incentive of the towers, or grouping up in one "siege area" to duke it out for the towers. Good tower placement is easier in longer maps, sw:bf for example.
I mainly play support. As a Zed (or other midlane assassin) are there certain supports you like or dislike seeing on your team? Awesome job with your content, it's really informative stuff!
I am able to read, I don't need to go to "a message board", whatever generic board that is, and make a post at your behest just to find out something I already know the answer to. Just because a majority of people believe something does not in fact make it true. It also doesn't refute anything I've said about OKC. I watch a lot of nba, I talk to plenty of people who share my opinion. Some generic concensus on "a message board" does not mean more than real informed opinions. As someone who can't see the hypocrisy in criticising the Clippers being an OKC fan, you are not someone with an informed opinion.You've spent all this thread talking down to people complaining about the referees, half of whom aren't even Clippers fans.
Well, the more complex you go, the easier it gets for the DM to twist it, so I would stick to something relatively simple.  I think pet dinosaurs are pretty cool, but I also just generally like dinosaurs so.. maybe wish for like a pet beholder or something.. er.. wait.. no, that's too dangerous.
Yeah I expect anything relating to this game to explode in terms of popularity and recognition once E3 rolls around. And I can't wait!! It's going to be fun welcoming all these young'uns into our community :) 
I feel they are synonymous. If you focus on your persona first though, you'll spend a lot of time doing so. If you work on joke writing, you'll not only get the habit of how to write a joke but throughout testing them out will naturally find what type of jokes fit you, thus...persona created.
I feel very lonely. I've been thru shit no one around me can relate to and get annoyed when I keep bringing it up because I've got to talk about it to feel better. But I'll just pretend to be happy and shove my problems in a box to feel when I'm alone.

shouldnt these police.... be solving real cases where real people are being harmed?          edit: noticed the police was pissed, the reporter was wasting his time
With yes means yes laws and crap like that it won't matter. She can withdraw consent at anytime for any reason. So even if she did sign your still fucked. Not to mention the fact that she could say you coerced her into a sexual act via the oral or anal check blocks. They hold all the cards and until there is true equality in the eyes of the law and society we are always walking a thin line.
Oh...well, then stir the pot!  I didn't catch the sarcastic haterade.  I was on board with 2 firsts and reluctantly Kendricks, but NEVER Fletcher Cox.  He's too valuable to the team.  Boykin I would love to part ways with.  Lets get something for a guy in a contract year who wants to start and will leave in FA anyway.
&gt; so, did you get laid anyway?&gt; If they still had a sticker on the door, I would go mad at them as much as politeness towards the girl allowed. They drew in my business, leaving me confident to accept bitcoin at the door with the sticker and then when the bill arrives, make me look like an idiot? Oh, how I would want them to regret that mistake!&gt; Trust me, to woman, it is just as cool to draw money from your bitcoin wallet. And don't you think it's amazing that you can live 100% on bitcoin now? Why NOT have a bitcoin debit card, there is no excuse. Use Bitwage to get paid.&gt; Hope she was moved enough to give you the happy ending afterwards&gt; Still get laid?Top minds, each and every one.
Heck, the only serious Russian incursion in Ukraine to date was 1,000 Russian soldiers in August that had the Ukrainian military in full retreat to Mariupol. You're replying to a guy who doesn't know what he's talking about at all. Throw 10,000 soldiers with some modern tanks and AA and the Ukrainian military will be chased back to Kiev as fast as the column can roll.
That's pretty much exactly what my pup does!  I love to see them take so much joy from such a small thing.  Dogs teach you that it really is the little things in life...
The Katamari Damacy OST is delightfully diverse and though the game's opening, too, *is amazing*, this particular track holds a special place in my heart.
This is what I fucking mean! Strasburg looks like a totally different pitcher inning to inning. That's what frustrates me, not that he struggles sometimes. He goes from absolutely dominant to unable to get an out.
One of my teachers was a hag, she dumped my backpack all over the floor while I went to the bathroom one time (I can't remember why, I think cause she thought I was lying about not having my homework or something), and I always got more homework then everyone else, my mom went ape shit at her, she also called two dark skinned boys in my class niggers while she was giving them a talking to for getting in trouble for something, after that she was forced to retire.
As a 5th grader two of my three instructors forced my parents to get me tested for several days because they thought my IQ was too low to be in regular classes. I did well, the person administrating the test guessed that I wasn't doing work cause I was bored. My parents kicked that out of me right there. I always wonder what would have happened to me if those two teachers would have gotten what they wanted, which essentially was just me not in their class cause I was hard to deal with.
I demo patios just like this all the time at work. We would start by cutting it into a few squares with a demo saw (only cuts about 4" deep) and then using a bobcat with forks to try and pry it up snapping the concrete. If that didn't work we would rent a jack hammer that attaches to an excavator. To be honest it sounds like hiring somebody with heavy duty equipment is your best bet. If the heights allow for it you can always spread an inch of sand over it and lay pavers/bricks/bluestone. Then just regrade the lawn around it with loam. If you want, take some pictures of the area it's in and I'll give you a better plan of attack.
I could maybe make the drive. I'm in the Tri-Cities, but my bro has been bugging me to make a daytrip your way.And tbh, I don't see there being many Bernie fans in my area...
In the real world I think most people would prefer to be casuals with girlfriends than no life hardcores. But the fans don't think about off-screen Kripp, the hardcore gamer with Pornhub on his most visited sites.
The past few nights, the battery has been at about 40% when I've gone to bed. I don't use the watch overnight, so I don't mind charging it. In terms of functionality outside of the gym, I don't think there's much of a comparison. 
Life is so much more interesting through your own eyes.Knowing that you are getting life with no distortion (or as little as possible) is great.Your balance is much better so do stuff! Now is when it is possible. there is lots of good evidence that those balance requiring things make your brain so much healthier.
Personally I think we should make a move, even if it is for a short term contract, for Lamarcus Aldridge. He has the potential to add a lot of size and skill to the frontline. His time in Portland is looking very questionable and coming to Toronto would give him a great chance to dominate in the more front court light eastern conference. He would be a great compliment to JV in the starting line up.
I was going to give you gold, then I realized I'd need gold to keep these nifty new styles. If someone gilds this comment then I'll gild /u/roj2323Or you could cut out the middle man and just gild them directly...probably a better idea anyways.
I have the same issue, I chatted with a lady at Xbox support and tried a few things that didn't work, she said they'd been getting reports of it and are working on a fix, figure if you try in a couple days you should be fine. I can give you the steps we tried if you wantEdit: the steps we tried had worked for some  ppl
Does that justify cussing about a kid? The teacher is drawing a paycheck, they did pick teaching as their career of choice. This is not something they were forced to do, and frustrated or not. Venting like that is not ok.
of course you have to give something to get something, that's why I just donated half a day's wages to the campaign... in the kickstarter and patreon era, people power is the way to go
&gt; "Oh, the deposit holds the car so we don't sell out to someone else while doing your paperwork"How would that even be possible?  Wouldn't the "someone else" also need to do paperwork?  How would someone else get the car without paperwork?
I only really use SwiftKey because of its dark theme (slate, I think). The prediction stuff is normally great, but I care about aesthetics just as much. 
Was [this the one you used](http://www.everydaycookingadventures.com/julia-childs-bearnaise-sauce/#sthash.bWMJdY7U.dpbs)?Should work well. Did you possibly reduce vinegar too much? Did you have enought tarragon?Final salt/pepper balance is very important. I get the seasoning 'nearly there' then add the tarragon, then season again.
&gt; It really is unfortunate that she's so into what she does and that results in her getting dumped on because of the history of "token females" in the gaming world.I'd say it's not just that but more that they're copying a particular show format which pretty much always has a very attractive female playing this exact same role. It is a shame though that these previous instances of women hired as 'token females' has made the whole role seem like its pandering.I've seen a few occasions where Meg has been more relaxed and less frantic in her presentation and hand movements, and I honestly think she'd make a decent presenter given the right show.Free Play isn't it though, at least not yet. I think they could definitely rework it in to something longer and calmer, with more interviews with RT members/exclusive content while one of the hosts plays a game or something since it's called "Free Play". Meg doing sit down interviews would probably work quite well.

As long as you go into it knowing it isn't his usual fare you'll be fine.I had issues connecting to the main character, so I didn't like this one. I found his other one better and read it several times, but I barely finished **Mr. Mercedes**.
I wouldn't spend the money on it for a grind machine or to have the FOTM. Even after adjustments and balances, though, the Calliope is going to be one of those things that some people just really, really want to have- rocket artillery is *rocket artillery*, regardless of cost or effectiveness.
It looked extremely sloppy, almost as if she started two weeks ago. But I think she may have been one the of the new signings to NXT from a week or two ago.
Pretty great patch, the randomized rewards are great, get some pretty nice things from it.The Calliope is nearly 10k eagles... Ridiculous. Haven't tried out those American TDs, look like fun.
Yeah, I would agree with that. Friendship had a place in the same way it does in real life. Teamwork and all that jazz. We can't channel our friendship into freakin' Falcon Punches.
not the same thing, per say, but could you imagine how r/nba would react if it existed back in the late 90s and this duncan kid had to be "the man" on a team that had robinson? sometimes i think the whole "following act" is a bit overblown. i'd like to believe that LMA (who has said that duncan is his idol) would love the chance to carry on the great big man tradition in san antonio. and the opportunity to play with kawhi is pretty appealing as well, along with pop being signed on for a few more years (and then messina most likely afterwards). but that also could be my bias as a spurs fan hoping he comes i guess. 
 Network, late-night, talk shows, can't be political or controversial. All they care about is ratings. The show will have no teeth, no balls, and it will suck
go play diablo 3, or go play path of exile if you really like the color 'brown' or like playing the story 3 times before you spend points or restart when you put the wrong skill point in. Ok you get the picture path of exile is bad, go play diablo 3.
As a project manager, this couldn't be more wrong.Sure, it'll delay production release a little bit... but that's better than staying 14 hours and coming in on weekends to find the problem, while getting chewed by management.
Those curtains she calls pants are too small!! They didn't even measure her for proper fitting pants. She probably needs to wear something 3 sizes larger. 
I say this as an Asian, but the restaurant on Gloucester Green isn't really date appropriate. Unless I'm thinking of another restaurant, that place is more like a Chinese cafeteria.The opium den is nice. I like Soho across the Worcester bridge and near the said business school. 
Huh. I despise the Hobbit films... yet my enjoyment of LOTR remains the same. It really is puzzling to me that people's enjoyment of past films can be that influenced by future films. 
So as the crow flies, its about 700km to vaguely the north of Scotland. The air speed of an owl is about 45km/h, so assuming ideal conditions, and no rests, its a 15-16 hour flight from London to Hogwarts. That seems like a good reason to me.
Haste and crit are very close stats, but while haste pulls ahead singletarget, crit is better in multitarget encounters and there is no known softcap (for either crit or haste).You have to deal with the long cast times for the start, but it gets better with gear, especially if you get the T17 2p bonus. Currently i have around 900 haste i think and my starfire casttime in the raid is 2,3 seconds.Just focus on getting items with Mastery and try to avoid getting versatility, the start is rough as a moonkin but it can only get better
Not to be too much of a homer, but might I suggest [these options for helping repair Baltimore?](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-volunteer-donation-opportunities-20150428-story.html#page=1)
Oooh, thanks for that. *Wood Wife* definitely sounds like something I'd love. I've never read any of her work written under Megan Lindholm (although, I recently picked up an anthology and was delighted to find a short by her included). I'll have to look for that as well. Oh, Mt. ToBeRead grows again... :)
If you really want to save money. Buy Oats. Make oatmeal. Enough for week worth of food. Takes 30 minutes to make and your good for breakfast for the entire week. I think i got a container that was like $5 on sale maybe? Prolly last me a month. Add honey and cinnamon. Eggs are super cheap too. $1.50 by me for 3 meals if I buy a dozen.
If the modder is your spouse I'm sure he or she will get you a free copy. More to the point nobody is claiming you have to get paid for everything you do, the argument is you should be able to charge if you want to. Which is true for the spouse example as well unless you are claiming that your spouse should be forced to work for you for free.If you dont think the mod is good enough to pay for you dont pay for it. Did you honestly think that the other side of this argument was you will now be forced to pay for every mod ever made? Again, nobody has claimed you are entitled to get money for something, what you are is entitled to be able to charge if you want to. 
I have to say I'm highly sceptical about all this but if you want to increase the performance you could increase the cell count of the battery pack to raise the operating voltage. That would be hard enough but then you would need to ensure the inverter would be able to handle that without letting the smoke escape. Then you would need to change a whole load of firmware for battery management and who knows what else. The cooling system would require a major upgrade too but that would be trivial compared to everything else. If they can pull this off I'll forgive them for what they have done to the front and rear bodywork.
I'm amazed how faggots like this completely ignore all the actual violence that niggers commit and instead blame themselves for violence without actually doing anything.What is the cause of this guilt? Brainwashing? Mental disorder? There is definitely something wrong with this man (if you can even call him a man)
I just don't know how to respond to "I think it does." Do you have any evidence? A difference in the place of articulation between /t, d/ and /k, g/ would be something I think would be discussed in the literature, but I have never seen it. And yet, I do have a lot of experience teaching undergraduates who are *convinced* they're doing something articulatory that they're not.
Nope. Packed him and sold him for 8. And he isn't worth that either. Isn't worth 5 mil either. His finishing is not worth 9.3 mil. And that's the most important aspect for a striker IMO.
I have scoliosis, which has greatly affected my hips. It's not apparent in my posture, but I've never found it easy to run (and never could understand how others manage it for such long periods of time.) The pain is constant. I'm not a man, but I still love feeling my heart race and muscles ache, being outside, and I'm rarely in a bad mood.Then some women are cunts, and it's all because they don't have the nerve for that mindset, or the drive to simply lose weight, despite a lack of health problems otherwise. That's actually just people. Some people are gutless.
Sorry I should have elaborated. I don't mind Arabs that come to America or practice Islam here. You are right in that they are extremely hard working. I just do not like that they commit genocide in the Middle East over a religion, while in doing so goes against that religion itself.
Well, you know how people are. Just cough up some numbers to make it seem legit and it's k.Our data is biased you say? HOW DARE YOU QUESTION OUR DATA! IT ARE FACT BECAUSE PEOPLE **DIED**!
Since it doesn't seem like you have a lot of gold I think it's better to pass on this. The prices are worse than what most gold sellers post them on the AH for and those two are amongst the least desired TCG mounts.

Sometimes I have to go for the fist bump. I am a nervous weirdo and my hands are often dripping after a match. But I let them know that I'm just gross, and not meaning to be rude or anything. Everyone so far has laughed and appreciated not being subjected to my sweaty palms.Someday I'll be cool though......
Hello sabishoikouen :-)It's really nice to hear from you. What is it you feel you want out from? What is the reason you feel that you're stupid or can't process things quickly?Why do you do all this translation too from the HK news? that must take quite a lot of time?
Definitely ghetts for me, there's not really a single song of his I play and generally don't rate his flow and bars. Sounds too much like his words are getting caught on the way out of his mouth it's quite disorientating
I'm not a lawyer but don't you have to declare your assets during a divorce? I assume lying on that declaration might be construed as contempt of court.  Surprised she didn't get some jail time too. 
I find myself wanting to agree. I don't think cashing in for a later time is a bad thing inherently, especially if someone is playing a face (who are supposed to play fair.)Cash in earlier in the night, declare that you'll be facing the champ in the main event. Or cash in on Raw, declaring that you'll be facing and/or adding yourself to the main event of the upcoming PPV.
You know I have like three of those left in my fridge. I wasn't crazy about them. But I also have a few of their stouts in my fridge too and they are CRAZY GOOD.
Yes, DanMachi is great. And pretty much every moment with Hestia makes me smile, haha. She's so fun!My personal favorite is Plastic Memories. What do you think of it?
Holy shit this is amazing.... Jettas are my favorite. I got a mk6 myself, not as stanced out, since I live in Virginia and stancing is hard here, but it's definitely ridin' low.
I honestly hate the pounce, but i feel its needed. I do think however there are some bugs with it. Some dont matter some do, like for example that vid shows the goliath pounce him but they both "Teleport" between them and facing a diff way. other times, i have been pounced while i was behind the monster. I sat there shooting him, saw him go into sneak mode, then he just pounced me and i ended up a few meters in front of him as he "Jumped" away from me. He did this in mid combat when it was me support and medic waiting for the trapper. That was stupid. 
Can anyone put a tuxedo to the one on the left and a wedding dress to the one on the right? I'll greatly appreciate the work and if you can put us in like a cool background even better.The reason is because I told her I wish we could marry our characters in game if I was a male character, but there's no option in the game. So I wanted to surprise her with an awesome picture of both of us marrying each other.Thanks to everyone!
Here's one for you, some making of from the Chopper movie :) It's SUUUUPER interesting! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt2io3NPrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt2io3NPrk)
No sport has been able to deter cheaters with sufficient punitive punishment, it just doesn't work. It is a matter of removing the opportunity to be successful. How you thoroughly catch cheaters in minor chess tournaments, I have no idea....Technology allows methods to become ever more ingenious. Imagine a chess computer the size of a postage stamp, better than any human. Its not far away. One can easily imagine a method of communicating with this chip, say using your toes, and it delivering outputs via a micro speaker or by vibration.
Just because other people are paying that much doesn't make it reasonable. As long as you aren't taking out loans to pay for it or affording it by taking out loans for other expenses. Like you said, AirBnB isn't reliable. You should budget based on the worst case scenario.
The Damien Sandow segment of every show is going to be the segment I watch in stunned silence with my hands on my face and my eyes looking on in horror just at the annihilation of what was once the best part of the show.
If you or Kip think that the Titans only had the allotted 10 minutes to trade Mariota then you've got to be kidding. It's wasn't a shock at all that Tampa was going to take Winston.
In the second grade I got the same thing.Graduated from Caltech.And funny story about that: I went up to my guidance councilor to give her the good news about my being accepted in Caltech. (I had been accepted by their early acceptance program, meaning I knew in January that I was going.) And when I told her that I had been accepted, but before I could show her the letter, she told me to stop being stupid and applying for an impossible school--that I would be better off applying to Fresno State and then eventually maybe transferring to a University of California school--but not Berkeley because that's too hard to get into.I looked at her, showed her the letter, informed her that she had mis-heard--that I had been **accepted** and not just applied, then after she read the letter and looked up at me, I looked her in the eye and said "fuck you," and left. Never interacted with her after that.
Don't stress out, 8 weeks is a lot of time. I would say keep doing what you're doing. Finish U World then write another one, at that point really start focusing on what your weaknesses are and let the NBME's guide you. TBH I wrote one 11 weeks out from my exam and got a 213 before finishing U World and having made 1 pass of pathoma etc. Now that I'm done U World and done my incorrects I'm going to give it another go. I'm also 8 weeks out currently. UWorld is the key. Take your time with it and really try to learn all the information it presents. That's just my opinion
Generally it's more of a "clicking" upon being exposed to something or the idea of something, IIRC.  Although some people just seem to have always known since they were presexual children.Similar to how some trans* individuals seem to have known since they could talk as infants and others only realize it after being exposed to knowledge of other trans* people as adults.
"It's fine. Just a little...open." *He says with a shrug, glancing around the alleyway they were in. "Hence why I'm traveling around. Seeing the sights, and all that." *He says with a forced smile, wishing that his hood could hide his whole face and not just the top half.*
In singles I like using Slurpuff as a win condition:* Slurpuff @ Sitrus Berry* Ability: Unburden* Adamant 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spd* Cotton Guard* Belly Drum* Drain Punch* Play RoughAfter setting up one cotton guard, non-STAB physical steel attacks rarely endanger it. If you can get two cotton guards and a belly drum, the game is basically over. Drain Punch keeps your HP up, and Unburden gives effective 486 speed as long as you don't get Whirlwinded out. This also means that if a Choice Scarf Imposter Ditto comes in, you will always go first, so your boosts won't get stolen from you.
Past 4 months "Mariota is Chips guy! Get out of here with your logic that he won't be picked" in every thread. Mariota goes to Titans "Fuck you guys it's not over yet! You're not right, even if it's a slim chance it could happen! GTFO of this thread!"
Wearing a long skirt =/= promoting religious violence.&gt;Why did you move to France?She is 15 so most likely born there.Just stop talking, you're only making yourself look stupid.
All of the above. I'd put them in one of my Etsy shops, promo them on my blog and social media, and have them out and about when I go vend. It's more a question of what I should paint.

Pinterest is a website where people can post photos and pin them to "boards" much like tacking photos or ideas onto a cork board. That being said, Pinterest users are notorious for posting pictures that are aesthetically pleasing, yet difficult to do just from looking at a picture.It's very possible that you either look very aesthetically pleasing, picture quality that she'd post onto a board, or you have a really cool sense of style that would be difficult to replicate. My guess would be the first :)
For the longest time it was the most effective way to make white people feel uncomfortable. But now it's so over used it just has so little affect on people.  
I've got you beat by a wide margin, age-wise, and I also am easily the best looking, in the best shape, and the most confident I've been. No comparison to any other earlier time of my life.  It takes commitment to oneself, and work, but any RP man knows that.
I have a friend who is much better than me in basketball, but he's kind of weak mentally, so I spend most of my time covering him trying to get into his head. Wouldn't be surprised to see this happen to Giannis in the future. Strong emotions in this game. Disappointed to see Giannis play down to that level. He'll learn, though.
They should just give him a freakin' leap. It's like they really wanted to just give him Anhur's 3 but felt like they couldn't because then they would look lazy. 
I actually just got home as I've been either at work, or working on term papers all day. I made this post assuming it would be preemptive, though.I just checked, and I'm still at .16 with "BEING RELEASED SOON" in the bottom right corner of the main menu.
There was no loot nerf in OS, the chests always were once a day.  What killed it was making siege blueprints tradeable and taking the portal to OS out of EBG (due to about a million requests from players).
I think the elevators get a bad rap. It's better than looking at a loading screen. And there's always some squad banter or galactic news.Congrats on the plat, it's one of my favourites despite the multiple playthroughs needed.
it doesn't make sense. the joke is the top line introduces something, then the bottom line is like something funny that's also tight. its the wrong meme. verdict: not funny.
In order for something to be libel it has to be a published false statement that is damaging to a person's reputation. A picture of a person is not a "false statement."
There's also the question: which version of the original movies? Undoctored, fixed SFX, or one of the numerous attempts by Lucas to 'fix' what wasn't broken?
I remember reading something similar to this happening in Florida. Classifying somethingas illegal, but if someone did whatever it was they immediately fell into a new category and got away with it. 
The Imp trinket is a bit better than Scales for combat, but it won't make a ton of difference. The DST is great and you even have a socket, so keep that. What's hurting you a bit here is that they're 665/670 and Scales not being amazing for combat to start with.I'd have a look at http://shadowcraft.mmo-mumble.com/ and Ravenholdt.net. I'd also keep an eye on https://twitter.com/fierydemise, especially now that 6.2 is getting closer.
This is how desperate I am for Witness news!  "Oh cool...he's unpacking something.....now he's compiling it.  Oh the shader does a thing.  Something, something, if then statements.  Cool...."
Umm I see Borderlands 2 there, 98% and $40.. Civ 5:complete is 97% and $80, Civ 5 is 97% and $70, south part stick of truth is 97% and $33, talos principle is 97% and $40 and that's where I stopped looking having handily demonstrated that your title is absolutely false.
&gt; It exists on it's own in a world of anonymity where names are easily taken and easily discarded and inherently meaningless. No, it doesn't.  This is real life.  A real human being made that, and someone is attempting to minimize the benefit they can get from providing free entertainment.  There is absolutely nothing to be gained from stopping the creator of a work from being able to enjoy the benefits of making said work except giving 4chan pseudophilosophers the opportunity to circlejerk about the magic of "anonymity".
I first got into him because my old roommate was a big fan and kept telling me to check him out, I think I fell in love with his videos when I watched him play "Knock-knock"
Probably around 300+. Not sure since I slowly played my hunter to 30, then rush my Warlock and Titan to around 28~29.But got it last week during the weekly.Ironically I got it when a friend who took a break after playing since launch who has many more hours than me still hadn't gotten it yet. But they got it the next one.So there is hope that you may luck out.Edit: Long day in the office causes me to have brain fart in grammar. 
She is right. Keeping up with the flow of traffic is essential to safe driving.  Rule of thumb  I was taught is when 1 person blows by you, he's an asshole. Two is a coincidence.  Three means I'm the asshole. 
The voice is gone at least. I kind of like how there are some "tics" like the preposition and how he sat next to Axel to show development from his old gimmick. It was just the nine-year-old comeback style that bugged.
They're not exactly competent (Google "Rutgers ddos") but thanks for the help. There's a residential network for the dorms but there's no network I can connect to besides the one for laptops.  
Let me know if you need someone who works in rehab medicine =) Occupational therapist here, the profession nobody knows about but most hospital patients need. I'd be down to answer questions on how injury impacts sensation, movement, cognition, and daily activity.
I see rounds 1 to 4 going to Pacquiao, rounds 5 to 7 goes to Mayweather, 8 to 9 to Pacquiao knocking Mayweather down in one of them, 10 to Pacquiao, 11 to Floyd, 12 to Pacquiao. I predict **MY** scorecard to be 116-111 to Pacquiao with the rounds being really close.**3 Judges scores: 115-112, 115-112, 114-113 for Pacquiao***If there is no knock down, it could possibly end up as a draw with close rounds.*
I always take mine on an empty stomach and I try to take a magnesium supplement regularly as well (it helps with the potency/tolerance I believe). Make sure you're taking the correct dosage as well
It's not "hiding" it's the basic principal of equal protection under the law. If you're wondering why it wasn't brought up previously it's because homosexuality was seen as immoral by most people until we started getting more civilized and realized it wasn't hurting anyone. Same thing as the right to marry someone of a different race. That was "hidden" until the 50s.
Where do you live? I'm in Oklahoma and our natives seem to prefer crack and crystal over pot. It's also much cheaper than any weed that would have enough trichs to produce kief
i was just addressing the 3MB/EX pulls question as noone else had, although it is a very unbalanced deck, over a 3 match game with card control and having more higher cards than lower its a necessary tactic that works well. A lot of people use the word unbalanced here when talking about RTG decks when what they really mean is too many weak cards, having 14 great cards and 6 weak ones is unbalanced but shouldnt slow you down too much, whereas vice versa it will make a big difference as the few great ones drag the others into a higher level than they can beat far sooner, meaning far longer grinding +1s for lower cards (switching to uncommon method is usually better here with this kind of deck) so going back to my first reply, its better to do that to balance out the middle of the team without moving up as quick for balance as opposed to stretching your deck with 1 higher level card that wont help in EX/KOTR and makes it harder for the back end of your RTG deck
set your whitebalance using a white card and try to use a burst mode or sports mode to take a bunch of frames.. if one of your cameras has raw mode you can also edit it later 
If you got a note in your letter box saying your house was going to blow up on Monday, would you pack your shit or would you reply on the authorities to protect you?
&gt;The only time someone 'frames' another person is when they are both intimately involved in the crime.Do you honestly believe this? As far as you are aware, no one has ever been framed for a crime they had no involvement in?
Personally I would like to see Enforcer get Fast Swap like mechanic does. Because the pistols(beagle) are so good, and shotguns currently so buggy, being able to use my pistol as my main long range engagement gun has been a necessity. Reduced fall damage could disappear from all classes and no one would miss it, when you can pull your parachute ripcord 5 meters from the ground and never take any fall damage. The Rep perks need an overhaul over all 4 classes for sure, and I agree Enforcer isn't offering the team much currently with ammo being its only draw and mechanic taking its crown as the CQC king due to shoddy shotgun hit lag :( Give us a reason to play enforcer Visceral!
Nope. Extreme Rules 2012. Tables match for the IC title. Cody gave Show a dropkick as he (Show) was on the apron and he sold it by stepping on and breaking the table. 
&gt; Today I learned breaking the law is no big deal as long as it's a little law. Especially as a cop.Seems like a pretty general statement that wasn't made about any one state or police force. 
This must the weirdest place to put this, it will probably get removed. But we need to see this, I know all you guys love Japan, but this is seriously bad.
Let's close it out tonight! My heart can't take many more close games, but it's especially bad since I want us to win so badly vs such an unlikable team like Clips.
Know how we start? The immediate removal of the Max/Comp/Trim Comp cape.I maxed in 2011, continued for comp like two years ago and said fuck it because of quests.They are quite honestly the most cancerous pieces of content in this game. If you remember, social activities such as House Parties used to thrive. I frequented them all the time just to have fun in the dungeons. Once max/comp released that *entire* niche group died out. "xp waste" was never a mainstream thing, ever, until those capes came along. The entire focus of the RS community (at least the majority) has shifted from socializing and having fun, to grinding, gaining XP, gaining items, blah blah blah.What am I even saying it will never happen lol
&gt; has usb ports but don't need a dongle attached to the computerDoesnt exist.How did you fry ALL the usb ports on your motherboard???Maybe just buy something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA76H2GT1742&amp;cm_re=usb_pcie-_-9SIA76H2GT1742-_-Product
Space Gates have special things attached to them though. They don't have space gates in the Milky Way, at least none were shown in SG1 other than the supergates.
I didn't know about it. And since everyone is just acting like it's obvious instead of explaining it, I still don't understand how it works. You say "lots of people try to know about things that don't always directly effect them" which is what I'm trying to do right now but nobody will actually tell me how it works.
I'm just wondering if there's any way to change the way the reply button looks since I don't like it and I figured I'd ask if there are any tweaks which could change it, it works perfectly fine but I just think it looks terrible.
Your argument still stands, I personally wouldn't say one is inherently easier to read then the other but that's just my opinion, but as a note compilers like `gcc` will actually optimize `printf` statements that only print a single string along with a ending `\n` into `puts` statements for you.
Hey Everybody. I just found an Kurki and i want to go towards ZDPS Doc. what should i roll on my weapon?http://eu.battle.net/d3/de/profile/Demitrios-2931/hero/58828561
"I want a Wii U because Nintendo lets you have access to all of their old games!"It would sell itself. These are old games that everyone has played. Most Nintendo fans have experienced all of these games. Even have a paid membership or just through amiibos if they seek profit.. I would do it.
May I know the nationalities of you two? @burnt_wick and @ChicagoBoy2011 ? I'm from the MidWest and I live not far from Jeanette Lee's club in Indianapolis. I haven't met any Americans playing snooker...
Oh, I didn't see that bit. When I see a linked post, I usually think the post you were referring to is the 3rd post down (default for context button). Now I'm not sure what to think... 
Last year the only "stupid immature shit" he did was scream FHRITP. Everything else was constantly being brought up from his past because of the bullshit rape allegations. 
Just finished DS9. Trying to watch Voyager from start to finish now. Its not bad but its like staying at a party thats dying down and all of your friends have left.
By that logic, having sex with your relatives is more natural than worshiping Jesus.Are you trying to say shit got better when we started to worship Jesus?
Solid arguments from everyone in that thread imo. The fact that it can either really help you or really hurt you when you draw it is what has me hesitating. 
I dunno. That's a good question obviously. I consider it equal to fucking a severely mentally handicapped human. It's pretty despicable behavior. It doesn't feel like it is the same as a cold blooded rape of a human but it shouldn't be brushed off as "it's just a dumb animal. Who cares?"Lots of people are saying "it's ok to kill them and milk them but not fuck them?". Yeah, I can sort of identify with the hypocrisy but we are talking about the custom of eating to survive and that is far different than just fucking a goat cause you want to. They are two different conceptsMaybe I am just feeling a way that I was taught to feel? Maybe there is no difference in killing a goat and fucking one but I feel as if it is very different
&gt; Your anecdote proves nothing about food safety...Well if you want to go down that road.  Your outrage over slightly less tasty food doesn't really prove or mean anything either.  Other then you don't really seem to understand that frozen meat will remain safe to eat ***indefinitely.***  6 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, 6 years, when it comes to **safety** it's all the same.   Now if you want to talk about flavor and texture, that's a whole different conversation.   How dare they feed anything that doesn't taste great to **young children**!   
Yeah, AokiRemix, but you seem to be a fan of [a performer who pretends to be doing skilful things when he's not..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sxfp_Cycvg).  So maybe your contribution to this conversation, while apt in its own way, isn't all that valuable.
Dunno if this is a thing in other parts of the us, but I (and other people i know) say "yeah, no" all the time. It works to kind of change the direction of the conversation. Like if I digress too much I'll say "but yeah, no I really liked it." Or something along those lines.
I think you need to have both of those for any of what they are planning to work. Daycare costs can be the cost of a mortgage for two kids, hell sometimes one kid.
I have to use the sarcasm tag. Sorry that came out way too aggressive. Believe me I know its a few loud-mouth cretins giving an entire sport a bad name.Sorry dude.
no, they are related in the fact that one platform (or set of platforms) got fucked over on each of them. what's wrong with his statement is him blaming PC gamers for overkill's shitty business practices and acting like they deserve a broken MK for it. 
Hold two separate award tickets on the route (award holds are 5 days) then book one of them. You should get the 10% within the hold period and at that point, pay for the second hold
1. I don't like crit reds anymore after the static shivv nerf. I think lifesteal quints are viable , I just personally dont take them.2. I feel like jungle yasuo could be viable, but it's just not possible in the tank meta we're in right now. And if you think support yasuo is bad, you should try out a kalista/yasuo bot lane. Its pretty nasty.3. I go a lot of AD because I like to trade very aggressively in the early game, and gain my lead off of that. A lot of people even in master/challenger don't expect Yasuo's level 2 damage with AD runes.4. I could see someone going Cutlass first, but I personally would never do it. I 100% always rush Static Shivv just because of the huge damage spike.5. Yeah, Yasuo is definitely a "tank buster" His ult just shreds through tanks. You should be able to 1v1 any tank at level 16.
You'd be surprised how abrupt some of the changes related to aging can seem. I feel like one day I woke up and bam, a huge vein across my boobs that I had never noticed before.I won't jump on the anti-OP bandwagon here but you may benefit from a session or two of couples therapy prior to starting to try for a baby so that you two can work to sort out the fact that you (I'm assuming) got married for reasons beyond the fact that you're both 10s and that your relationship will withstand the inevitable toll that time takes on all of us. I think you may also benefit from considering that do many things about pregnancy are really out of our control. It concerns me when you say that you will "only gain the minimum doctor recommended amount." This really sounds like you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Even the best of plans can be completely sidetracked by medical wmergencies, being put on bed rest, etc., and you should address those possibilities as well. Good luck. 
Definite starter potential there. Byron Jones is a super freak athlete, might take a bit of time to refine his skills. Peters is a big, physical, man corner, but will have to learn how to play off. Both could be get significant play time right away though.
God, same. And yes, I love them! They're so nice and they're magnetic too, which is fun because they snap together and the like. The blushes I have are Orgasm and Desire, and they're both so lovely. I'm so hesitant with blush which leaves me usually blush-less, though. I really wish I could just slather it on and show it's beauty.And I hear about Ruby Woo all the time. I'm thinking about getting it tbh but how much different is it from Russian Red, if you know? So many reds already...
Save states are the issue. You need deterministic character physics and efficient resimulation of all game entities (Stage effects, particles, audio).Time and moolah.Time and moolah they had.
Did anybody read [Gladwell's article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-engineers-lament) in the latest new yorker? Like I'm usually not a huge fan of gladwell, but as an engineering / econ double from undergrad it made me think just how many of these issues apply equally to economists.&gt; To the engineer, a car sits somewhere on the gradient of acceptability. To the public, a car’s status is binary: it is either broken or working, flawed or functional.If you replaced a few words, this could just as well apply to the general public's perception of economic problems. Economists make policy recommendations fully conscious that there are tradeoffs involved with any policy. But the general public loves seizing on specific failures and crying foul at the whole system.I was kind of impressed that a general interest publication published a long form article that is actually sympathetic to the expert's point of view.

You will get crushed by pretty much everyone in PvP. 3 ADP will get you hit in every roll. And even if you manage to dodge an attack the 69% equip load will make it easy for the opponent to just backstab you after the roll. Also you chose a very slow main weapon that relies on poise while you don't have any.You have the range advantage but every half decent player will close the distance with 2-3 rolls and then you're screwed.It may be fun in theory but I doubt you will have much fun in praxis.
&gt; amount of peopleAgree with the sentiment, but can't resist jumping on the criticism train with you... I know, I know... I'm sorry...&gt; ~~amount~~ number of people
Yeah I read that one also. If it was a remote site like new housing area with little traffic for a couple hours I could see that but I'm too paranoid for that. I'd be worrying about it being hauled off or tipped over.  That would literally be a shitty situation!
It's realistic, though. Actual space programs don't engineer for optimal flight performance, they engineer for optimal cost performance. And the basic rule is "engines expensive, fuel cheap", leading to as much fuel as possible to be put atop an engine. Also, seeing a gigantic rocket slowly ascent from the pad just looks epic.For instance, the first stage (boosters included) of the Ariane 5 (GS variant) produces a thrust of 15,175 kN at liftoff with a liftoff mass of 777,000 kg. Liftoff TWR of 1.9. The core burns about 231 kg of fuel per second. After the boosters burn out after 140s, it has lost 546 tons in it's boosters, and 32.34 tons in it's core stage, leaving the total mass at 198.66 tons. Thrust goes down to 1,015 kN, bringing TWR down to a whopping 0.5. My rockets never fall into negative twr during ascent, so I lowered launch twr to adjust.
&gt; In Oregon, all an employer can legally say is that you worked for them for those dates, and I think whether they would how you again.That simply isn't true. Your employer may tell you this to explain why they have a policy of saying nothing more than what dates you worked. they may have such a policy to protect them from getting sued for libel or slander. But they retain a First Amendment right to say whatever they would like to about you it's simply that they choose not to do so for fear (probably ill-founded fear) of being sued.
When I was in middle school, 7th grade I think? It was PE and we were out on a field playing football and we just hear a bit of yelling from a nearby culdesac that led to the field , then BOOM BOOM BOOM. The coaches ran us inside and locked down the locker room. I went to school in a not so nice part of time. I have plenty of crazy stories about that place.
Lol..I don't even know what to say about that story, but it had a happy ending. That's good. But would you ask your six-year-old to try instead of yourself?
Europeans tend to have a "pure-bred" sort of look. This is changing now as there is increased immigration into European nations, but in the case of people whose families have been living in one country for hundreds of years, they tend to look very much like their countrymates. Americans tend to be mutts, mixed from all the people who immigrated to America over the years. Most white people are combinations of Irish, British, German, French, Italian, and a bunch of others they don't even know. If you look at them and try to guess their ancestry it will be pretty hard, since they look like a mix. TL;DR: If you can't tell where someone is from, they're American. If they're white and have a strong look that reminds you of people from a certain country, they're probably European. 
[M] I figured it'd be an appropriate response to a critical failure on a d100, huehuehue.[S] One of the most notable pieces was a New York Times article blasting the Chinese government for alleged hypocrisy-pointing out how several plutocrats who backed the Chinese Communist Party have been allowed to maintain or even enhance their personal fortunes.  It was in English, but a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai would have significant numbers of foreign language speakers.
I went to a house party where a girl did that too, she fucked a few guys before she committed to staying naked and all the guys just put their clothes back on. She was not attractive at all, I kept thinking it was like that nightmare where you're naked giving a speech but for her it was real.
If anything, Superman makes Batman more necessary, because Batman is the only person who could devise a plan to actually take Superman out if he ever turned against mankind.
There is a difference though between punishing a criminal lightly and punishing an innocent person. I get much more angry at the latter since our system should be set up to not do that. Obviously punishing criminals lightly is a problem, but punishing the innocent is an even bigger problem.
Only they can truly reform Islam. IMO, they're are very convincing arguments that completely dismantle the Hadith literature. Hopefully then Islam will become a docile religion like Christianity. 
That "don't weigh me" thing is so dumb. Do these people not understand that a lot of medications prescribed are based on weight? The doctor can't just go "Ehhh, you look about 250," give them.a dosage based on that weight, and it ends of doing nothing because the person is actually 350. Or the opposite, doctor thinks they're heavier than they are and ends up killing them because they had way too high a dose of medication.

I'm seeing this a lot on this sub "Can I not fix this known bad part?" If you want it to run properly you have to fix it, I don't know how bad it is bent but it must be pretty decent to eye it. If that axle is not spinning as designed it is going to be throwing weight around every revolution and causing more wear than you bargained for. It sucks, I give people bad news every single day, but its the cost of driving, and its random as all hell.
What's a good nature for a competitive Yveltal?

Well, its a controller that seems to be for an NES gaming system. Judging by its appearance id say it has a D Pad for controlling movement, A and B buttons for actions, and turbo A and B buttons for performing them quickly. 
a company I worked for ran and SMS service mainly for server monitoring and such, but companies can and did use it for membership reminders and such.If you replied with *anything* you'd be placed on the opt out list. Searching over the opt out list for random curse words was always good for a laugh.
I think Amethyst getting taken out repeatedly says less about the relative strength of the monster and more about how headstrong Amethyst is.  I'm sure that if the monster went after Garnet or Pearl it would have a much harder time doing any kind of real damage.Another thing to consider is that it catches Amethyst by surprise just about every time.  When she actively goes and attacks it she holds her own until her body gives out and Garnet distracts her.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN, I GOT A HUNT 2 KIRIN TO LEVEL 140 AND GODDAMN, ITS LIKE THESE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE, EATING EVERY ATTACK AND SPAMMING POTIONS LIKE ITS LOW RANK, AND COMPLETELY IGNORING KIRINS WEAK SPOT, MAKE THE QUEST TAKE FOREVER AND RISK CARTING EVERY 2 SECONDS. ITS NOT LIKE WAITING FOR OPENINGS IS HARD, PARTICULARLY AGAINST ELDER DRAGONS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PUNISH RECKLESSNESS LIKE NOTHING ELSE.
I'm honestly having a hard time coming up with an interpretation of that claim that's remotely controversial or surprising. Can you help me out? Are you asking me to explain why people *expect* college campuses to be safer, or why they are safer in fact?
I'll always upvote the Keyes loop, though I don't know if it's so much a tactic as it is strategic brilliance. Commander Keyes saw an opportunity and he took it, but I highly doubt you could ever recreate it.On a related note, I'm a fan of the time a young Preston Cole dropped an emergency beacon mid-battle with Insurrectionist forces and, as soon as the two ships' docking bays lined up, he fired a missile straight into their gut.There's also his last stand, wherein he literally destroyed an entire fleet by dumping a whole fuckton of nuclear bombs into a gas giant and briefly turning it into star. Shame it ### *killed him in the process*.
Probably because you're not as fierce a competitor as he is. When you're giving it your all, you tend to become pretty irritable, and even the slightest of things can get you to go off.
Ha, that's awesome! I run a derevi "creature tribal"... It has a whopping 54 creatures in it and plays similar to a sliver or elf deck.Everyone is afraid of derevi, but without winter orb or Stax she's not very oppressive at all and much more fun to play with/against. When people say derevi is a problem, I just show them this deck and say " Derevi's not the problem, Winter Orb is the problem!". http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bantsploitation/
The largest province is the wasteland in Quebec and is, in terms of size on the map, about as tall as the distance between Athens and Danzig, and about as wide as the distance between Paris and Constantinople.The largest non-wasteland provinces is probably Kola, but that's only due to map distortions - IRL that territory is about the same size as Romania.
&gt;Are they secular opposition Yes and no. Southern Front is the most secular by far and I have strong doubts that some form of Sharia law won't be introduced because of the Sunni majority driving the revolution and how important Sharia is to the culture. Although Sharia law if introduced by the FSA wouldn't be anywhere close to what JAN would introduce. Still secularism is a very touchy thing in modern Arab states and is usually frowned upon, even by moderates. &gt;How separate are the fsa from the JaN coalition? They work together and support each other's interest, but ideologically they're different. However FSA has said "We are all Nusra" before. &gt;Are there Islamist brigades in in their forces? Yes&gt;And is that why this question is so complicated?This war is complicated

You know that the left is strongly divided, eh? At least rightwingers have the same values on average (family, church). On the left, you have SJWs who hate men, gays who hate bis and other gays, feminists that hate men (including trans men), trans who hate cis etc.You should just associate with reasonable people (including gay men who have no phobias). 
Wow, what a brilliant, well-thought out and fantastically-executed argument, with loads of information and background research to back up your claim./s :)
I know you already know it, but this is what happens when you stay with somebody who cheated on you.Also "i's" isn't a word. The word for that is "my." 
 I trust that film makers (especially high-budget features) won't waste money on films that aren't going to be watched by as many people as possible. They're very good at it by now. I can't imagine that they *don't* cater to the market as attitudes change over the years. I suppose it could be argued they're almost the perfect cultural barometer. If films are male-centric, then only a tiny majority of people seem to care, and they're not going to make any changes to the film industry.
How do you smoke these little balls? I keep seeing them on the sub and dont want to be caught in a more awkward than average situation with these someday

Doesn't madara say something like if you had aimed a little higher you would have killed me.. Or something like that. You can't have guy beat the "main" villain, that would be dumb when the show is about Team 7.Addition:Thats what I mean by plot. Eight gates guy was very capable of doing it but wasn't allowed to because the series was ending and Madara was the main villain at the time. It had to be like that, I'm not saying it was a problem like plot armor, but that's just how this stuff works. I would actually be kinda upset if madara killed naruto and sasuke and then guy sacrificed himself to end madara. Like seriously if that was the ending I would shed a few man tears for kakashi.

That's my issue with Hungry Dragon as well - it feels like more of a "get *more* ahead" sort of card. Now, I think those cards definitely have a place in the game, they just don't suit my preferred style of play.
When I was a child, I had a recurring dream where my parents were divorced. My Dad lived in a trailer. There was a monster that lived outside near his trailer. Whenever my sister and I would visit the trailer, the monster would come looking for us. Sometimes, I'd be stuck outside with the sky black and red flowers all around waiting for the monster to find me.
utapsweets really came through. they processed my initial request so quickly and when i mentioned that i was missing a few items, i received a speedy response and received said items without any issues or delay. they made this entire process pleasant and i couldn't be happier. thank you again! :)
I use to think it was odd at first until my two year old niece would kiss me goodbye and I made a big deal about her kissing me on the lips. My sister told me don't be such a fucking homo, she loves you, lol. There is an age when it gets inappropriate though and I started kissing her on the cheek and forehead at around five when I would drop her off for school. 
IF you are doing leg work that day that is a terrible idea...probably not  agreat idea for upperbody eaither, if you are doing tabattas right you shoudl be really drained...
It's not just race, it's gender too.Like when that female astronaut went crazy, Lisa Nowak. Many people were thinking how poorly it reflected on women, how women aren't fit to be astronauts, and related the whole issue to women instead of just her. If a male astronaut went crazy like that, no one would be using thinking that men shouldn't be astronauts.

I just want to say this is a lot of fun watching the draft with you guys, except for that motherfucker that called me Toby.  It's almost like a game day thread.
Yeah good job on the edit. Be careful about which one you buy. They tend to need a lot of space and good airflow, perfect for an unfinished basement or attic. There is the possibility of ducting airflow through them though that raises the upfront costs but also helps by diverting cold air outside during the winter but inside during the summer. What models are you looking at?
Titans trade you their first round pick for your second and the condition that you start Tebow at quarterback all season, unless NFL signed doctors decide he's physically incapable.
You're mostly right. In New Testament Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and then in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman. THIS FLOWCHART IS A STRAW MAN.
To some extent, blaming the world can be ok. I blame the world for monopolized education. I would love to be in school right now, but don't have the large sum of money necessary and don't want to go into debt.
gosh, i guess i can't really defend my facetious remark.the stronger point is that harry dismissed muggles as not doing anything of interest in the 1200s, when they were certainly doing things of interest. they started putting clocks in european towns and keeping track of time. accurately navigating and mapping the seas with compasses and other cool sea navigation devices.oh, there's also the fact that half of the european population died under not very well understood conditions, soon after magic started to decline. worth further consideration!note: i am aware of a eurocentric bias here, but i support that with the idea that perhaps the decline in magic is specific to location. i don't remember exactly what knowledge declared 800 years ago as the timestamp, but i am certainly neglecting china and egypt and the middle east because i have little knowledge there. thought i know they had clocks thousands of years ago.
As a side note, I'm here in Emporia, KS spectating the tournament with /u/weatherstation, so we probably won't be very active online during the day, but you might see us in the gallery if you are watching the live coverage! :)
Btw, any tips on how I can make my game go better when trying to take over everything?  I try to conquer stuff but it always wants to bitch at me that I need cassus bellums or something.

It's not a "mainstream" thing though. It's never entered mainstream culture, you've never seen anyone saying it on the 5 o'clock news, and that makes all the difference here.Saying that someone's grandmother, who may very well have been a victim of discrimination herself, is in any way comparable to the sheer number of people you see repeating the phrases this article is talking about is a massive false equivalency.
I guess that's technically possible. But Correa is still in AA. He has get promoted to AAA, then continue to hit ridiculously for an extended period to even have a shot at being promoted. By then, we're after the All-Star break and Lowrie might be back, and who knows where the Astros will be record-wise? Correa seems to be one of those real talents where having that extra season of control down the line really makes a difference. There is a lot of talent in that organization. Just my opinion.
I'm just happy to know someone is sharing my frustration! I've gotten so used to reading the update before going to sleep, it's become routine. It's 2:30 am. I need to sleep. But... I... Cant... Deej! Come on buddy! Let me sleep :'(
That's definitely not true of Japan.  Middle schools  (≈12-15 yo) are not streamed. Senior High Schools (≈16-18 yo) have entrance exams for tech schools and academic schools  --  and I think it's a pretty good distinction actually.  If you want to do a trade, why study French?  Some of the elite senior high schools are very competitive to get into, but plenty aren't.  It also provides a pathway for poor but bright kids to get into a good university without a private education.
I can do any time tomorrow between 9am and 1pm EST. Unfortunately I'll be traveling for the rest of the weekend and don't know when I'll be able to get an internet connection.
Ya exactly, that's what i was getting at.  Which is why those meters are "felt" over common time signatures, cuz who wants to write or read in 3/3 or 3/5?  Haha so I guess OP should just subdivide a more common meter to get what he is looking for
The singing is better in this scene, but the singing wasn't bad to begin with - that's the problem. The singing is supposed to be bad in that scene, but in the Spanish version, it was fine. Not great singing, but not bad either.
&gt;I really enjoy reality TV, especially the kind where all the cameramen have to do is follow people around. No real plot, no plans, nothing extraordinary. Do you mean bs like this :http://www.kabeleins.de/tv/achtung-kontrolleAnd here something crazy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCveijvx_-E&amp;list=PL8WdbyA7d6JD-TwvqUlGcSYRopO_DciiDWell german TV is not so good. I think the only things that are good here are documentarys like Terra X, Quarks &amp; Co etc.
We should have kept Rod,  writing him off then was one of the biggest mistakes in spurs history.   He went on to have a better career than any spur at pg until parker. Instead we ran the only true second star to play next to Robinson,  in his prime, out of town.  We did it a second time with rodman. Rod, Willie Anderson, Elliott, Robinson, and maybe Rodman would have won a few chips. 
There is nothing wrong with people having children, in fact we need the population.One of the big problems is a lack of easy access to supermarkets because low income families often do not have cars. If they don't have easy access to public transport people often revert to buying less than nutricious food at the local corner store or chippy. It's also why when I was at school the porer kids were more likely to buy a pie from the tuck shop for lunch whereas the middle class kids tended to have packed lunches.

In addition to SkyUI, I would say Skyrim Unbound. It removes the really fucking long cart ride at the start, and you can drop in as just some random traveller in the world and go from there. It doesn't start the main story, it is just a sandbox. You can pretty much do everything as usual, but without the rails at the start.
&gt; Getting my ass kicked, being overwhelmed by the passive tree &amp; stats I didn't understand (charges for example), etc. It made me fall in love with PoE.If you're not a strong willed/hardcore player this would be incredibly discouraging, information isn't readily available and you have to go out of your way to understand how eg. charges work by looking to the wiki.I noticed the sort of tutorial when I first started on the beta client, I think this just needs to be expanded significantly through all of normal.Having Nessa guaranteed to have a ring would work, perhaps the quest description for it could mention she *might* have one to sell. Additionally it would be a good opportunity to basically explain vendor recipes with an iron ring and a blue gem.
I've got a baseball and hockey game both on, so only enough attention to spare for watching the website. A question for those of you watching, what's it like without the legion of Jets fans in attendance? 
Is really depends on the market and your current industry experience. For instance, if you have experience in the asset management industry and are a CPA in either New York, Boston or Kansas City you will be a highly sought after asset.

&gt; I don't see why anybody should make claims about things they know no one knows.Well, if it's the first step in a series of things that might lead to new knowledge (ie, a scientist making a hypothesis) then it's reasonable. But otherwise, I agree that people should be prepared to support their claims with evidence if they wish to be taken seriously.&gt;  A statement of belief is sufficient.Keep in mind that someone who says "I believe a god exists" *is* making a claim.

Or if your upload speed on your home network isn't stellar. I tried the Vita remote play from not-in-the-house, it's basically unusable for me. MAYBE if I was patient I could use it to log into Destiny and go buy shit from Xur on a weekend. But I wouldn't be able to actually play the game effectively.
I think it's largely just cultural now since a lot of these problems are fixable with computers now, but were the legitimate reasons it's become this way culturally. 
I wouldn't take or ask for a penny from him ever, especially because of that last part at the end about money = control. Even if he turns around and offers it to you, tell him something along the lines of "I don't need shit from you." I'm sorry you lost out on a parent helping you out when a normal parent would, and that a promise was broken, but I wouldn't pursue the matter. 
Congratulations.  Hope you have fun, although I would definitely make sure you have a plan to travel to at least a few other destinations than just Cairns.  Australia has lots of great places to visit.  Hire a car / van and drive down the east coast over a few weeks. Shouldn't cost too much. 
SEO optimization is including a lot of keywords in your title to make it more likely to show up when those words are searched. This isn't really that, since the title is explanatory, not a word dump.
My only advice is not to mess with any shit you don't know much about. Why would you /want/ to get into paranormal stuff? Like really, it most likely won't end up well for you.

So did Yacht Club Games work with Rare to include this secret level? I mean this is only a level on the Xbox One, and everyone is hoping for a Battletoads announcement this E3. Maybe this is a sign?
I dunno, I prefer a definitive answer to a complex problem. Especially if it can be said in a single sentence and reaffirms all my biases. It's a big cozy blanket of assuredness.  
Thanks for the input. This was my first track I recorded with a friend (the drummer) so I'll be sure to tell him someone liked his drumming. I'll definitely just record and practice and record and practice my singing. As far as tuning, I was really excited to finally be able to record (we live in the cold midwest and record in a barn) that it just slipped my mind. Also thanks for the compliment on the lyrics. It really affirms what I was iffy about. Just thanks in general, it means a lot that you listened. I liked your track insomnique by the way. I wish I could sing with that much confidence. I also Liked the instrumental progression of the guitar and drums with the organ sounds. I know it was a demo but the way the vocals were layered over the instrumental felt kind of flat, for lack of a better word.edit: I also really liked WAKING DEAD too. Also, The Only Song I Ever Wrote is fucking amazing.
If machines can provide for an easy living for everyone, so what if some people choose not to contribute materially to society.  I think many who don't just don't know how because their family and peer network all struggle at shitty, useless jobs, and they didn't have access to productive and creative people to learn from.  Many people would use free time to do awesome things because contributing creatively to the world is a basic human drive it seems to me.  Look at open source software and the hacker/maker crowd. If someone is too depressed to do anything productive, requiring them to eat less and evicting them won't help them.

That's just straight up mental illness on the mother's part, and probably a lot of mind-fuckery directed at her son to make him think this is in any way normal. They both need to get help.
IMO 25 mph is for a reason like a school zone. No way get pulled over. Doing the allowed min on a highway which I believe is 40 in a 70 could get you pulled over if causing traffic issues. I would guess be an easy ticket to get out of though. "So I am not allowed to go the posted speed limit?"

Sounds good, I'll do some research. Thank you! Someone claims they have LSD that I know, but I'm not so sure. I feel like someone selling legitimate lucy would have a different vibe haha. Hope that makes sense. 
Interesting! This will be very very very important information actually. This was the resource I was using to determine if I could donate [link](http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_general.shtml#Can_nonUS_citizens_contribute). I don't have a green card, so I think I am still considered a foreign national, despite being considered a permanent resident for tax purposes. I've always believed that a non-citizen could not vote, do you have any resources that state otherwise. I'm going to look into it too, specifically I'm in California. 
All the molten Rex weapons look pretty cool. The gunlance looks especially badass, but I currently need a rathalos ruby *and* a dire blastheart for it. Fuck that. 
At ng-conf, they stated that clearly that their strategy was to watch the traffic patterns for Angular.io (v2.0) and Angularjs.org (v1.x), and as the traffic shifted, it would determine when they start promoting 2.0 over 1.x. Those same analytics would also influence where resources get allocated, and how long v1.x is supported. That fits with the idea that Google is very driven by analytics.
The specific frame I linked was kind of tongue in cheek, I only linked it because it was also pink, but the thought behind it was sincere... if I had a frame prone to cracking that shit would be gone before I bothered to charge the battery. I've also had a boner for a hardtail sportster for a while, which is why that's probably how I'd go, but if you're willing to spend an extra ~$500 or whatever you could just get a replacement softail like frame. That said, I kinda dig the paint scheme, looks like 1992 to me.

I'm talking about all noise recently. For instance, some guy thinks that tampons and pads are not necessary for women and then there are the big topic issues of fat shaming and thin privilege. There's just a lot of "he said she said" flying around. I don't mean to call people out, but I can't help but feel we can get caught up in it all and not remember that being a woman is actually kind of awesome.   
Dude, that's like a business projection. Like projecting next year's revenue based on the current year.You were clearly accusing me of [psychological projection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection), which is completely different.

My mouse always used to hide under some furniture in my dorm room. I would routinely move it to get the mouse and put it in its cage for the night. Then one night I did that, and heard an awful scratching noise. It was *between* the two pieces of furniture instead of under one. I put it in my hand and watched the color fade from its eyes. I cried a lot. The thing is, mice are small, fragile and curious creatures. It's hard to keep them in one piece. You're not to blame.
Ah ok, I think he's smart for sure, but like I said I still don't consider him tough. People have gotten in his head before and that's why I don't consider him tough. I respect your opinion, and can understand where you're coming from.
Accept it? ACCEPT IT?! Lets draw parallel here and say that in your precious little PvE carebear circle, right before you get into a space station to unload your cargo the station up and disappears on you. Sure this may not happen every time, but maybe half the time the stations you fly to vanish and you have to seek out another. But here is the catch, the stations are never in the same place and are on the move.Then to top it all off, when you read the forums said stations are complaining that people keep docking in them and taking their money! Oh noes!You've created your perfect little world for you and your ilk, kindly keep your opinions the #@$% out of ours.
I think you're pretty cute already. I am definitely happy that you are trying to lose more weight only because being overweight is very unhealthy. I think your long hair is pretty hot, it is definitely coming back into style for a lot of men. If it gets long enough, try doing one of those sexy buns. I am female so I don't know if my opinion will help you much but I can definitely seeing you being stupid fucking hot once you lose some weight. As I said before, however, you are still cute to me now. Its all about the way you rock it and present yourself. Biggie Smalls was married to Faith Evans dude, all you gotta do is dream.
You're much too focused on the direct "hard skills" associated with most other fields.  Philosophy, for example, would tend to reinforce soft skills that translate easily to any other field....critical thought being one of the best examples.
Yeah, thats my point. You can spend about 200 bucks on a router that will get you damn close your full speed on wifi, and then you can stream your 4k 60fps porn when you are laying in bed.
My mom likes black licorice. Her taste buds are definitely non-functional as evidenced not only by the disgusting black licorice but also the insane amounts of garlic she's able to tolerate when she cooks things. She must not be a vampire though so that's good. 
If you are in massachusetts call the state office in charge of insurance. I have forgotten what its called, but you can find it on the mass.gov website. Mass has strong consumer protection laws and I'm pretty sure they can't drop you fro selling your house. If you are not in Mass, try whatever equivalent office your state has. 
I understand your point and my friend has raised this issue as well. I will be sure to keep it in mind.I am going to see how that works. I am about 10 min from my office and where I am working is pretty relaxed, so hopefully it will be doable. Thank you for the advice!
Reading your comment put a picture in my head... What if someone modded the game to turn either the main character or a companion into a Besalisk, with duel doublebladed laser swords?! I just picture running around as Krell hacking away at enemies. You would need so much additional animation to get it to work, but I think it would be fun.

I would say you could have a bad antenna cable or the connectors are not tightened, but more likely your antenna is not optimal for your situation.  Your antenna is indoor and Omnidirectional, which picks up signals in a 360 donut shape for about 10-12 miles at best, but most of your channels are from a single direction about 15-17 miles away. A better alternative is a Directional outdoor antenna, which picks up signal in a smaller lateral arc but with a longer reception area that accounts for signal reflection caused by obstructions.  Pointed at the SW at about 232 degrees,  a directional outdoor antenna on the roof or at about 20 feet height and with no obstruction from buildings or trees should pick up at least 13 channels, possibly 15.  
Well I'm seventeen, so my Pre-Raid rituals are a little less dicey. Take the usual piss, if needed the shit as well. I post on LFG, looking for a group. I gather my weapons from the extension or app, and then I crank up Spotify. Then I take my sixteen CapriSuns, snort a yard long line of crushed up Smarties, inject myself with a 1000ccs of pure Grape Kool-Aid, and call it good. All jokes aside, mine is pretty normal, the players just change every week.
Manipulating reviews to extort people is as old as reviews themselves. Claiming impropriety of reviewers because you received bad reviews is only minutes younger.Business owners have a clear conflict of interest when it comes to claims made against those who review them. Ethically speaking, you should be very suspect of their claims and take them with a huge tablespoon of salt.So to answer your question (sort of), the more that make the claim, the more likely someone would have some proof. So doesn't it make you wonder why so many businesses claim that Yelp has acted inappropriately but not a single one of them can offer up any shred of actual proof?

"We girls are different.  We have to be pampered because we're delicate and refined." *scarfs down dog food*Wen's aging scene reminded me of Indiana Jones.  Only creepier.A lot of theme stuff has already been talked about, but let's not forget the first scene.  Spike is on the operating table having his fake eye put in before he jolts out of the memory.

I would love to get Yoshi's New Island. Everyone says it's bad but I think I'd enjoy it. It definitely has cute going for it! Thanks for being such a great sport.
Nowhere in the Torah does it say there needs to be a physical or blood sacrifice to repent. There were also incense and flour sacrifices. Also I answered your question of "How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice?" There are other commandments we cannot perform due to our exile. Such as pilgrimage to the Temple for the festivals, many tithes, any many laws associated with ritual purity and impurity. Check out Leviticus 5:11-13 where it tells what to do if you can't afford birds for sacrifice. This clearly shows that a blood sacrifice is not needed.
Testing some things on the assassin. Playing with arcane strike (?). When progressing with normal gear (could have been a white katar), I 1 shot normal mephisto with a 3 charge arcane strike. Will see how it is higher lvl but low level scaling is pretty ridiculous. There aren't any synergies, maybe synergize with Mind Blast? I feel the damage won't be any good come hell.

Agreed. I'm really disappointed in him. As a guy with a temper I can relate, but he needs to keep it cool and in perspective in a situation like this. He may have got a short term emotional release, but it's going to cost his team and in the long run, it's going to eat at him as a personal failure. Hopefully he'll reflect on it and improve himself.
I have, and she acts as if everything is normal and she doesn't know what I'm talking about. The family issues were with her mother, so this is unrelated, but I figured if she wants move out now, she isn't going to want to live together in the future either. 
Not really. Just means that you don't have time to do it yourself! I'm sure you could if you had a hand with the app work. It takes a lot of effort to make an awesome app with a back end when you want to get it to market asap.

Does this benefit Portland in any way, in terms of the salary jump not happening yet, so maybe he'll make less than he would of had he signed a new contract a year or two from now, allowing us to pay other guys more? I have no idea how this shit works, just asking.

My thoughts exactly; I hadn't ever seen Italian gun camera footage.  You just can't compete with eight .50s with an assload of ammunition.  Of course, late-war German interceptors had an almost comical amount of firepower (4 x 30mm Mk 108s), but only carried ammunition for one pass against a bomber wing; they couldn't just go crazy like a Thunderbolt driver could.
Agreed, though the end of the article does mention 32GB and 64GB versions were upcoming (hopefully for not absurd prices). I just wish it didn't have capacitive buttons and a poor GPU.Edit: mistaken on the GPU, getting my phones mixed up.
A lot of this will technically fall under commercial use since you are providing a service.Check your area for SAR groups. Some of them might be doing this anyway whether they are allowed to or not.

Yeah, that's bad. (At least for Bards, I'd imagine the same would be for Summoners).Bards should always keep their dots up if possible to maximize dps and have bloodletter recharge as much as possible. Occasionally they may fall off during a song or a mechanic, but they should go up asap.Also, there is a bug that if the dot doesn't appear under the boss health bar because there are too many dots, it won't reappear if it is refreshed before its cooldown.
This honestly *does* feel like she is excited in a history buff sort of way, the same way I was excited when I saw the Grand Canyon for the first time, just because the location has bad memories attached does not mean we have to be sad when we go, we all enjoy history in our own way. For example, slavery is shitty but I really want to learn all about it, why it was done, the benefits and negatives to early human slavery and all that.. does that make me racist or a piece of shit? No, it makes me someone excited to learn about human history.

I was single for so long that when I finally got back into a relationship, it was difficult to sleep with someone next to me. Didn't help that he wasn't used to sharing the bed either, and often curled up with my extra body pillow and blankets - thus giving me even less room and making his body like a thousand degrees so I couldn't get close to him. If I kicked off the blankets, he'd somehow get cold.  That relationship has since ended, and I'm dating someone new and I absolutely love sleeping next to him. He's the first person who I am comfortable being big spoon to. He does hog the bed a little, and I've woken up squished between him and my cat, but he talks in his sleep and it's absolutely adorable so I forgive him for sprawling out. It's also partially my fault for only having a double.

The document isn't illegal. Forcing OP to sign it likely is. WA allows an employee to pass up meal breaks and this form is encouraged by the labor board in that situation.
Besides Dylan, most of the hype surrounding these guys wears off very very quickly. I think Nat Wolff generated more buzz all across social media when he was being speculated than Asa Butterfield has which is kind of concerning.
I don't think you understand. Local currency in Germany is the Euro. For a 25 k USD prize pool you need to buy dollars. And since the euro lost a lot of value recently it's more expensive for Take to provide the prize pool compared to previous years.

What I love is the childish boy scout version of superman. The simple do good no matter the cost. The simple non judgmental.. non political hero who protects the weak. And never backs down from being that. All the power in the world, and he just wants be good.Superman makes me still cry like he did when I was a little boy. I wish he was real, to make so many bad things stop. I know we'll never have him, but we can try to be superman... Yeah I know this'll be down voted and people will bash on me no doubt. But superman is a hero to me.. 
Seriously! I was talking to my high school counselor about taking AP classes because I wanted to go to university. They told me no and that I should instead focus on getting out of high school, taking the easier classes, and getting an AA at JC/CC or going to a trade school. I decided to go over their head and asked the principal to allow me to take the courses. I passed all of them. I'm now finishing my fourth year at a UC and am staying a fifth to complete my second major. Anyone who tells me that I can't do something is someone who I don't want backing me. I want them to tell me it is hard, I'll probably fail and then help me lay down a course of action to succeed.

Of course, the great DBG can do no wrong.Don't you know that this patch was *like really solid* and that we would *barely notice the changes at all?*
Items on a list should be separated by commas. Clarifications and qualifications for particular items on the list should be placed in parenthesis after the item name (with no comma in between them).
Isnt this a repost....pretty sure ive seen this b4 got in an accident and had headaches much later, found maggots, or were they botfly larva? Pretty sure just maggots. Def repost though. All board the karma train.
Israel consists, and SUBSISTS, on torture, murder, and terror! That (and the fact that Uncle Sugar is giving them nearly $12mil per day as her own citizens starve in the streets) is the only reason that terrorist apartheid state still exists and hasn't been glassed yet.Well, that and the Sampson Option...
Everyone knows who the beatles are. Maybe not really I was in 10th grade in 2009. During PE our teacher began singing here comes the sun and asked the class who sang it. I quickly said the beatles. Across The Universe really sparked my interest in the beatles as a 14 year old. 
Only 5 here. Two in Tulsa, once in Dallas, twice in Vegas.  I think he made two stops in Vegas the last tour, and while I could have gone, I elected to save the money (which came in handy later, due to unforeseen circumstances).  Of course, he didn't announce he wouldn't be touring for awhile until the END of the tour...had I known that at the beginning, I would have made more of an effort to go.
Amiibo: Little MacIn Box or Out of Box: doesn't matter to me in the slightestPackaging: again, doesn't matter at allReason: When amiibo were first announced, Little Mac was the first character I knew I absolutely had to have. I had no idea how many of the others I would get, and my amiibo are all OoB and I only have nine. Unfortunately, nearly all of wave 2 disappeared before I was even aware that they were available, and Little Mac hasn't become available since.EDIT: formatting
I go to Drexel. No one plays Dota, everyone plays League. Dunno how it that translates to the Temple population but tons of people go here for the game production program and Dota is still pretty much unknown so I don't know how much luck you'll have unless you're particularly inquisitive on campus. 
serious question here, arent they suppose to pay workers when the store is closed on a day it shouldn't/holiday? or is that depending on the policy of the store?
Actually quite a lot - marriage, very weird and icky but not a sin against nature.Blood, she needs to be buried alive and the earth she's under needs to be salted so nothing may grow there.
You are the one too far on the Hiko fangay wagon to use simple logic and avoid "dumbass statements". Cloud9 didn't listen to Hiko when he initially wanted to kick players, but that has obviously changed with the 2 roster changes made by the org. The more we learn from Hiko the more it becomees obvious Hiko wanted the org to be Hiko9 instead of Cloud9 and wants an org that basiccally gives him 100% freedom to pursue whatever opportunities come his way (sponsor wise/stream rev wise). I could be off with this, but for sure Hiko isn't ALL about winning. If he was he would team with the best players (Cloud9) despite w/e issues he has had with the org. At the end of the day Cloud9 sent these guys to every event and always had a bootcamp for them in a sick spot to ensure peak performance. Even if Cloud9 had some restrictions that seemed unfair to Hiko, it would not stop them from having the best chance at winning.
Doom.edit: the joke was he asked where duke nukem was from so I said Doom... Nobody seemed to understand and thought I was being serious about where the doom guy was from.
I need good recommendations for a spatula that can get under a fried egg with it easily. my plastic one don't do that very well and also they end up melting because it's cheap
The biggest site I fully manage is standardised - I have a 90 page word document that goes into great detail about why it was designed a certain way, why certain hardware was chosen, the fine detail of the design and hardware.Most of the time I don't refer to the network diagrams or configs, I look at the design document and it becomes clear very quickly what should be happening.
I'm 22. My objective seems to be play games. I have a kinda profession, i am a computer engineer. But what i would really like to do is live off from playing games. Like the twitch people.   So yeah, my objective in life is be able to play and be able to life of it :p  If you haven't found yours, maybe it's because you haven't found that one thing that keeps moving you forward eh. Maybe love or some shenanigan. Good luck finding! 
whenever you are being praised, you assume it must be a set-upMy daughter's favorite was when my mom told her when she graduated from art school at barely 21, "I feel proud of you, but I don't know why."  You see an art degree is not worthy.  She went to one of the top 10 schools in the country on scholarship and won awards.  Even worse my daughter had to point out to me this was an N thing because I was so used to it.  Most of the time I tune my mom out.  My aunt told me recently the best night she spent with my mom she just ignored the words and let them wash over her with no content.  My aunt is great, she loves and accepts my mom, but lives very far away,
Not gonna lie, I hate it lol. It's more of a personal thing though, left a sour taste in my mouth after catching on fire the first day I bought it. Then the alternator died and left me stranded the next day.
&gt;self-serving and counterproductive altruistic punishment by idiots.Doesn't that make it NOT altruistic punishment, then? It's not the definition of it, anyway. 
&gt; Pogba has had a few great long shots and performances but he hasn't consistently won matches for Juve, he hasn't consistently scored last minute winners, he hasn't won trophies due to his individual brilliance, he hasn't even had one season of great end product despite playing as the most attacking midfielder let alone 4 years of consistent end product.has any attacking mid ever done that?
I'd say something about missing the point of his character development, with him keeping the copying gimmick, but...... Well, it *is* WWE.But this is egregious even for them! 
No official source. It's heavy rumour at the moment but I've heard that a company noted for doing high resolution Digitial intermediates has been working on the SW films in preparation for an impending 4K blu-ray release. 
let's not sympathize with his frustrations that he's not getting fouls called, his team's getting fucking smacked, and 60% of the fans on his home turf are bulls fans; no, let's just make a dim, narrow-minded comment for some juicy reddit karma. 
This article leaves out several key pieces of information. First off, about half of those officers killed in the line of duty are accidental deaths, mostly traffic accident-related, not killed by another person. Second, as u/TopHatJohn points out, the numbers used for police killings of civilians is certainly higher in reality, as these are figures that departments self-report to the FBI and not all police departments participate. Finally, the article does state this, but it buries it and some people will only read the title, so it's worth noting that the black men killed by police is in addition to about 300 white men killed by police.Police brutality is a real issue, and shouldn't be seen as a liberal or conservative one either.
Most schools, while not having the best food, do not serve their students anything this bad. It may not be fresh, but it's usually some sort of soy meat that can't really go bad.
thats the biggest thing. I *think* I could eventually get Spotify where I want it, but I had more than a few playlists that are going to be an absolute bitch to redo.   edit: Hmm. My Grooveshark everywhere sub was paid yesterday. I'd better get that back.   edit edit: ~~It occurs to me that I think the 29th of the month was the norm for everyone's payments. Nice job, upending everything the day *after*. :|~~ whoops. Didn't know they were back in the courtroom yesterday.   edit edit: if you tried the groovebackup last night with no/little success, TRY IT AGAIN. All of mine are there now. 
For the Fourth of July my family travels to southern Kentucky to go boating and they have a drive-in around there that we would go to. We saw the first Transformers there, which I have to say, really works well at the drive-in.
Let's not fool ourselves.We've always known cheating existed in this game. It's just not rampant because-good aimbots cost money. Free aimbots are 50% malware.-pgi has a strict no-mods policy with no grey zones, and we're not sure how successful they are at detecting an aimbot-a large percentage of players has spent money on this game. Being banned for a cheat and losing that investment makes most hesitant would-be cheaters retreat.
Great, another racist jerk who has probably only done 5 minutes of research on Islam, via sources that were probably against it, and considers himself to be an expert... Regardless of what I say, you'll continue to smirk and smear, so instead of wasting my time, I'll just give you a /pity :p
It depends. Everyone has pretty messed up thoughts to some degree, but as long as you don't act on them, it's fine. Unless they're causing you distress, in which case I would see someone.
Jobuii.  All great questions and important to consider when deciding to put money to work.  Instead of me writing an essay (I'm still at work and won't have time to until later this evening), it would help a great deal if you summarize your own answers to those first and I'll promise to provide you with my feedback and thoughts if anything is missing.  
I enjoy being sober because I enjoy my life. My friends are cool, my environment is good, my job pays decent. My health is good. My relationship is good. There are stressors, but nothing that compels me to need an escape so much that I need to abuse a substance to do it. A good experience with friends or husband is just as much of a release from stress.
Hate to break it to you, but that link is to BF4. Granted the dogfighting sucks in that game but I think he was thinking more along [these lines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5I8rsQQnk)
I never mentioned lag. Playing offline, in-person, with a training partner next to you who can instantly use his full range of communication (not just voice chat) is a superior learning environment. Especially when it's also a fun environment of sitting on a couch with your friend playing lots and lots of Smash Bros.
haha I definitely do pay the electricity bill! Usually all it takes is about 12 hours (sometimes even only 10), and I haven't noticed a big difference in the bill... maybe because it's on so low and the oven don't have to work as hard? 
I actually understand this, sometimes the most innoculous things don't cross someone until late adult stage. Just read up some AskReddit threads lik: "Reddit, what common fact evadade you until late teens/later"
Sounds like a goldmine from here.I personally don't even look at gender. If I like it and wear it, it's masculine by definition so far as I'm concerned and I won't bother expressing my disdain for the 'fresh' smell.Can't wait; I'll look forward to your post and thanks in advance.

So, the first thing you should do is eat right.   That means limit dining out.   Someone posted a bunch of links above.   I subscribed to those when I moved out.   It helped a lot.   I got leaner and lost a bit of fat.   Second thing is, invest in a gym membership.   You'll feel better as you exercise.   Never worry about if people are looking at you or anything.   Nobody will stare unless you act weird.   Just pretend they aren't there.   I had this problem.   It took a while for me to get passed it.   Focus only on you when you're there.   Think only about what you are doing.   Then just practice.   You'll get stronger, faster and have better endurance.   Just remember, baby steps.   I would look for better paying jobs too.   I worked for CVS for 7.5 years only to get paid at $11.  It's not worth it to work at a place that long for little pay.   
I'm not sure Airbnb is good idea.From what it sounds like, you want to create a better personal space and avoid distraction and I'm not sure hosting strangers from the internet is the best way. Couldn't you find an additional roommate that fit your lifestyle?
You know what's childish? You and you're faggotty little attitude. First of all, I love how you've said you "don't care" about a dozen times yet you're responding to everyone because you so clearly do. Second of all, how would you like it if I came to your shithole of a country and didn't bother adhering to any of your customs, or have no problem not paying people for their services. I bet you'd be bitching on Reddit about how rude American tourists are, yet you're  entitled Eurotrash brain makes you think it's okay to do whatever you feel like here in our country.
As long as we don't go so far as to make a reddit version of Clippywhich would be mildly horrifying.:-)It seems to be a combination of NP mode with the HTPPS. Something is going off the rails there.
I really am liking how happy Fowler is and how grateful he seems. Tears coming down the steps, and then prepares for the stage by building up that swag. 
It would be great if, after you ask a question ... your party fellows would not respond to your question with sarcasm and, instead, would give ME a chance to respond to the question that you asked me.This bill will provide a tax benefit for businesses that operate in a communist fashion.Tax cuts to any other businesses are not considered.This bill creates a large, federal bureaucracy to have its hand in these communized businesses.Now, you folks like to claim that you want LESS federal, centralized government ... but here you are creating a huge bureaucracy to manage the communized businesses.
If anyone gets hit by Glacier Bash, it's the tank's fault. If anyone gets hit by Glass Dance (bow cleave), it's their own damn fault unless it's been specifically stated that the tank will be positioning her away from the party for it. It takes no effort to dodge the bow though, so really just make sure you're behind Shiva for it. If you can't or don't want to put in even a **tiny** bit of effort to play the game, find a new hobby.
We got the QB who doesn't fit the system...I know there are plenty of differences we can go over between Vince Young and Mariota, but it just looks like then same situation.
&gt; It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good.Do you think that a test is only meaningful if it assesses whether the characters and story are good?&gt;Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead.When I search for a definition for unbalance, the first noun form definition that I get is:* a lack of symmetry, balance, or stability.This is what I mean: a lack of symmetry. When I search for imbalance, the first result that I get is:* lack of proportion or relation between corresponding things.This is also what I mean. Both words seem workable to me; why would you avoid "unbalance" in favor of "imbalance"?&gt;Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.Nor does it claim to. 
I hope for a return to sanity, but it will only happen when WW3 happens. I now pray for death and horror to be inflicted upon the world so that we shall be reminded about what is important.
Yes I believe we will..depending on the time jump between where this season ends and who survives I think mid season next year we will see the suit we know of
Motherfuckin' Bordello of Blood was my favorite Tales from the Crypt movie.  So amazingly shitty and amazing at the same time.  Like taking a bite out of a pancake and realizing its full of shit, but right before you throw up you have to admire the craftsmanship that went into stuffing a pancake full of shit and you not noticing until it was too late.
I'm not a big fan of the Q build- I don't think it has as much range/ isn't as useful in teamfights when you need to stay back from assassins as the W build, and it doesn't have as much sustained damage/can't kill tanks like the on-hit build.That said, I play a lot of ADC  in LoL, which is why I prefer on hit build anyway.
Had that happen the first time I tried too get to YZ-, I ended up stopping in stations on the way and setting my medical clone too that station. So I wouldn't have to make the 45 jumps again.
Exaggerated humor. We are emotional because this group hasn't released anything as a group for 3 years. Sure we might say things like C R Y I N G, and perhaps we could be crying, but most of the time it is just an exaggeration of our emotions.I hope you don't take EVERYTHING literally in life.
Yeah but my point is I might be the exception not the rule. I know that if I were playing hoping to get good drops it would be annoying as hell playing my heart out to only be shafted by the RNG while others get insane drops.
Wax if you dont like plucking until you can laser it. I wax mine I use the Venus (I think) diy wax strip things for legs. There's two types in the box, wide ones and thin ones.. I use the thin ones cause they're the perfect width for the space I want in my eyebrows and I cut it into like 4ths or 5ths so one strip will last me like 4 or 5 times... Its faster than plucking and slightly less painful I find.
&gt;lost in rd 2 in 2013 You know what the best part is?That would literally have been the greatest regular season and playoff run in the history of your franchise. There is no team less relevant than a Toronto team.
This article and the Metro one it links to are total fucking crap, with no detailed information whatsoever.  This is exactly what we *don't* need floating around polluting the internet when we have states fighting for legalization.  This is lazy at best, disinformation at worst.
I just got into paracord recently. Made a couple collars and love them.  I was looking into making a leash as well, but all the ones I've seen are very bulky.  I have a couple of small to medium small dogs and the paracord leashes are just too much.  Now I realize that whole comment probably doesn't help you much, it's more of my observation of paracord leashes so far.  All that being said, maybe weaving in a small pocket or something that you can stuff a few poop bags in for emergency.
They have marks and alualu as interior dlinemen so they don't really need williams.  What they need is a good pass rusher off the edge, and fowler fit the bill perfectly.
Brandon Schereff is the best linemen in this draft by a massive margin. Love to get him, but Williams is just as good as long as the Raiders dont shit on the parade. 
Actually, the pay gap is a mommy pay gap, not a women's pay gap.  Straight childless women don't have much of a gap as well.  It's just that if it's brought up that way, women will fight themselves to the death.
I also got profiled by my administration as a "Stoner" and they used a BS excuse to search my car... for water guns.Through a lot of BS and them overstepping legal boundaries, I ended up with a suspension, and the teacher I stayed with "talk to all my friends" and they said I was "angry" when in reality I'm legit like the least angry person, and my friends all agree. She also said I'm a bulldozer who forces my ideas upon people, but I was just tryna say my side of the story and she wouldn't even let me
Thank you.A business card is already bundled with the (I think it's SS-8 still haven't checked for sure lol) form I have mostly-ready for the IRS but never confirmed it was the right way to do this.And it says "manager" with my name and the store phone number and e-mail address.  I read the checklist the IRS has - I was something like 20/22 absolutely an employee.She did try to gaslight me about it, I told her I needed to research it further and she left it at that (probably because it shut me up)... but I believe talking to an authoritative source [like the IRS] is well within "research".  I really did give her a chance to give me the right paperwork.
Holy shit after seeing drogba these last few weeks, that scenario sounds like a goddamned nightmare. So perhaps a blessing in disguise. Lord knows we felt the luck in the CL the past few years

Yup, which is one reason why I was glad to learn they provided free two-factor authentication tokens. Too bad their implementation of two-factor makes it worthless.
&gt; Now, they aren't allowed to discriminate, but that's only really applies to things like race, religion, disability status, and sexual orientation in some placesAnd frankly, that discrimination should be allowed too, by the Non-Aggression Axiom.  I am not obligated to make Bob a sandwich just because I agreed to make Jerry a sandwich.
I'm pretty certain they are not cloned machines.I'll try to set up the network switch to route all traffic to a particular port to see if I can grab information that otherwise wouldn't appear.
"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle."http://www.116pages.com/2015/03/the-miracle-of-forgiveness.html
Don't listen to anybody that tells you he can't win.  He's been winning elections that he "couldn't win" since he ran for mayor of Burlington VT in 1981. Go Bernie Go!

Of course, because as we all know corporate logos specifically designed to induce brand recognition and customer loyalty are *totally* not sigils. If they were sigils, they would probably have some kind of manifested effect given their extreme pervasiveness in our culture, like absurd multi-billion dollar cashflows and mindless consumerism - hell, maybe they would become so powerful that they could even influence governments, control the lives of thousands of individuals, or create economic chaos on such a massive scale that millions of people would be suddenly forced into poverty.Good thing that's totally not a real thing. By the way, check out this new iPhone I got...
So, wait, are parents like, required to teach their kids about videogame systems that were popular before they were born? Did our parents teach us about, like, early PAC-Man and shit? 
Oh god I have SO many stories. Where do I even start... the ones I immediately recall:* Back in college, a "friend" gave my roomies and I a German chocolate cake. After taking a few bites I wondered if GCC was normally a sour-sweet cake. Then realized what I thought was powdered sugar was mold spores. Later, "friend" told us that the cake had been sitting in his dorm room through all of spring break, and he'd given it as a joke, thinking we'd notice the mold.* Was washing white rice once, and wondered why some of the rice was squishy. Looked more closely, and realized I had writhing maggots in my hand.* When I was a child, my mom fried whole fish every so often. One time, I'd gotten halfway through the fish, to the underbelly, when I realized it was filled with worms. Couldn't eat seafood for weeks after.
New patch is alright. Still, Americans have a hell of a time beating ANYTHING with the shitty battle ratings / Matchmaker. I'm so tired of getting disabled in the first shot and then killed in the second shot. New TD's are "alright" since they have good guns, but no damn armor! I want a competitive damn tank for the Americans that I don't have to pray to the almighty War Thunder gods for a side shot. Hell, glorious all powerful ostwinds are killing my Shermans ffs!
This list is for f2p that are casual enough not to intend on members. Same reason I excluded maxing total level and combat level."Should only be done if you like the cosmetic aspect of it"There's also a prayer bonus, unless I'm wrong. I agree that it's still primarily a status symbol, though."Eh, neither are really that useful"Cremation is cost saving in f2p. Big bones + cremation is vastly more efficient than any other method without members. GH armor is just aesthetic for f2p except for the cape, which is by some measures better than the teamcapes and veteran capes most people use.
I'm working on fusing Veromos now. Just need to level up and awaken the fusion mons, and fuse the wind vamp. I'm so close!As for Giants, I can auto B5, and I've used a rep to unlock all the way up to B10. I'm not exactly where to start because they've all been unlocked though. I'll have to do some testing I suppose.Thanks!
I'm going to say that you're probably better off going Intel, as suggested in this thread, however it's true that the AMD processors score extremely well in BF4 benchmarks as BF4 is one of the few games that takes full advantage of them. Basically, if you only want to play BF4 then AMD is a good choice, but for other games it generally isn't. I'm not sure how things are for video editing.I personally went with the AMD FX-8350 for my gaming / audio engineering build, and I don't have any problems so far. I think the fact is that both Intel and AMD processors are very powerful these days and unlikely to limit you much compared to the GPU in most games. In Ableton Live doing multitrack recording I was actually limited by the hard drive read speed rather than CPU, and got a big SSD which really helped matters. Not sure whether this is an issue for video editing, but indeed an SSD could be a good idea.
Please impart more wisdom oh wise one.Seriously though you don't understand words or something? Learn some reading comprehension then get back to me 
Steelback got a lot of exposure. He played solid, but arguably he is the weakest link on the team and Rekkles is a better player. He seems like a top tier challenger team ADC and I hope he can find another team but it would be foolish not to take Rekkles (assuming that he is willing to make it work and everything, but objectively Rekkles seems like the better player)
So I have 8 GB of crucial Ballistix low profile ram in my computer right now.  Can I use the non low profile version of this with out something conflicting? The LP uses 1.35v and the normal one uses 1.5v. 
My great grandma had a weird  remedy for this. Take a bowl and put a piece of bread in it. Then cover the bread in milk and soak the toe in it. Sounds weird but she swore it took the infection out

This guy explains perfectly my indescribable feelings for the MLP CCG.Basically I just don't enjoy playing it. I gave it a shot, but it makes my head hurt with all the complexity.
I am assuming since he was talking to one of the girls, and got info one what was commonly on the notes, not only did they read it, they knew what was going on and continued going with it.
I am sexually active, but have only been with one person. We've both been tested. I've gotten a UTI twice before a few years ago but I didn't get a vaginal exam from that, they just checked my urine and gave me medication. I understand the importance of an exam now though, so i'll definitely call and make an appointment for next week. Better safe than sorry. 
Well I've heard in Kill La Kill that there was a charachter half American that was a giant. Unless that guy's family was from some unknown island that had giants. 
Loads of people swear by him but he does say a lot of stuff that never turns into anything concrete. It doesn't mean it's not true, just that he seems to report a lot of inconsequential stuff.

At least a handful of games don't warn you about exiting if you just saved the game. That's always nice.Really, if I just saved the game less than 10 seconds ago? It's because I'm trying to quit out. Take my word for it.
The previous info was work related about his next work site and where he'll be because he works out of town and buddy buddy chummin it up. It wasn't anything i felt i should be concerned about except that one part. "I think I'm going to bite the bullet and finally buy what I just text you about." His response was okay, and nothing else was said so I assume the conversation went to texting at that point. 
considering you're apparently twisted enough to ask such a auestion, it's likely that you probably already have this fucked up task covered........"no", in any case
This is great advice. My players will almost always move quite slowly through the story and it is up to me as their DM to help keep those storylines relevant and interesting to them. I do that by having a brief synopsis of the last sessions events at the beginning of each sit down (to remind everyone where we left off and important moments that occurred). I also will have present characters mention more about the story or pertinent info if we take too long to ensure that no matter what's actually happening in the party, they are reminded that the inhabitants of this world are interested in seeing the storyline get resolved too.
I'm there too. It's a shitty feeling and I hate not having an excuse for the way I feel sometimes because of it. I feel your pain. PM me if you want to talk. 
Glad to see someone actually wait until the puppy is 9+ weeks before bringing it home. Enjoy those puppy days...they're adorable, and absolutely fly by!

At Auburn, the joke was Lim(GPA -&gt; 0) Engineering = Business.Oh the chuckles I had at that joke. Though, as a CS major, college really did jack-all to prep me for an actual job in CS. Somewhat off-topic though.
I really don't know, it just makes me feel good and relaxed, and also sounds nice. I can't really say what exactly I like about how it sounds too well.
Ordered tuesday, vendor set to shipped yesterday.  Had another supposedly great vendor who I ordered from on monday and it's still set to pending - I think we're all getting fucked on that one though.  Seems to depend on the vendor.

Thanks so much. I'm a massage therapist and get discounts on insurance. I called about the dental and it was a great deal unfortunately they don't have any places in the state I live in but they have it in the surrounding states but I'm not about to travel way out of my way. Thanks so much. I'll have to look into delta dental. 
There is a precedent  for a National government, but one excluding Scotland would effectively be the end of the union. best out come is a minority lab govt with the SNP giving confidence and supply (they have too much to lose by joining a coalition) leading to a through overhaul of the UK constitution -  
My home is protected by 12 guage and K-9.  Very few people are protected by an 11th bullet in a pistol/rifle, the revolver exists for a reason.  I'd rather have 10 shots per magazine than Christian extremism.
People who cut themselves are going through their own type of depression. And a personal hell. They know the consequences. They know the side eyes they'll get if others see the scars. Reminding them, and trying to shame them out of it is a terrible way of going about it. They are struggling, and the only way they feel any kind of escape is through self harm. Do you know how miserable that must be? Depression, mental illness, self harm aren't talked about enough, and when it is, it's just to alienate those who are suffering./rant

Don't. Its a bait and switch. One of the top threads on /r/lifeprotips is talking about this very issue.If you signed a contract then its signed. You don't owe them more than the contract you signed stated. If they have to take the vehicle back, then they are breaching the contract and are actionable for damages.Tell them that you will not sign a new contact unless the terms across the board are more favorable for you. As in, lower interest rates, lower monthly payments, fewer total payments and a discount on the purchase price of the car.If they are unwilling to meet those terms, then you are unwilling to sign. Tell them that they can not get a single penny more from you under any circumstances without taking you to court, and if they don't like it then you will see them in court.As long as you do not sign a new contract there is nothing they can do without making themselves look bad and possibly getting owned in court.

People do get mad over flu vaccine, and the people who don't get that vaccine are just as idiotic. The single correct thing you've said in your half-coherent post was that more people die annually from influenza. Easy fix - get the vaccine?Bandwagoning? I guess so. I do this for a living. This is what I care about, what I'm educated for, and the reason I'm currently 3000 miles away from my family at yet another conference to talk about and plan for these completely avoidable outbreaks. And it really sucks seeing people get sick and suffer, see our hospitals get stressed and resources wasted, see time and energy spent - all because some stupid dumbass thinks they don't need a simple vaccine that's proven to work.

I wanted someone else, but it's impossible not to like Mariota as a person. He seems like a hard worker and I will support him until he throws his pads into the stands and spends $5K a week at Cheesecake Factory.
I wouldn't call it the classic ovechkin shot. Usually he's left wide open, this time he was fully covered on the rush and holy smokes I can't believe how he managed to aim that laser beam so accurately. 
When a player is on the DL they don't take up a roster spot ( 25 on MLB roster). They had to option Montero to the minors to be under the 25 man limit after his start but instead landed on the DL. They had to rescind the option because a player only gets an x amount of options (3 I think) before you have to put them through waivers and other teams can place claims. 
I actually only bothered downvoting your first comment. And I didn't steal it -it's called content sharing. Y'know, 90% of what reddit is BASED on? Thought it was a fitting thing to share on this subreddit.There's also a link to the creator's site in the comic, by the way.Anyway, I'm done with this conversation. You're a pretentious,  condescending little cunt.
I think you probably know as much or more about anime production as I do. I am mostly familiar with Disney after reading the books I mentioned (and combing the Internet for anything I can find about animation in my spare time).I didn't really know that only Disney had the resources to do what they did. That's interesting. Do you think that was true even in all the clips you mentioned, or in much older anime? I suspect that newer anime probably got better equipment, but I don't know.

&gt;Also you completely ignore the other elements of what that causes, (like higher taxes for everyone (including those who dont have enough) Untrue, Universal healthcare option tends to be cheaper on taxpayers than private healthcare. However your suggestion that states should do this on their own would cause problems in tax codes, especially pertaining to the states who take more federal govt money than they pay in. You are also going to have to cite sources on single payer healthcare failing for first world countries. All scandanavian countries and our neighbors to the north are extremely successful with it.It would also not affect doctors nearly as much as you suggest. It would affect insurance brokers (useless middlemen), and big Pharma. Some doctors may receive pay cuts, and the option to be a privatized physician would still work although would become less profitable unless your customer base is people who can actually afford expensive medicine.
Yeah there's plenty of racism to go around in r/louisville among other things. Im glad I am somewhat insulated from hearing about stories like this because I know exactly what side most people would fall on around here, like they always do when our local sports heroes are accused of awful stuff like rape and abuse.
Fair enough--harsh but it's hard for me to directly refute anything you're saying except one part: I conceive that gender and sex are independent concepts--yet, normal sexual selection depends in some part on gender display. It's an issue I continue to learn more about. I just try to admit that I don't know everything. And I don't. 
When I'm on my motorcycle I'll more often than not pick up the offending item and throw it back through their window. Everyone else is smiling but usually the driver just tells me to fuck off so I don't think they learn anything from it. Still, it's fun to ruin their day when they're used to getting away with it.
Wasn't Winston's something about his grandma or someone being unable to travel and wanting to be able to share this with his family?  I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

Had to laugh at the centrelink one.I have some distant rellos on Facebook, every so often there is a post about being 'ripped off' by centetlink or DoH.Funny thing is, all of their mates come on and it's like some kind of para-legal discssion on what forms to complete and what entitlements they can apply for etc.  If they spent 1/5th of that effort in an actual job, they would be going places.
I was going to test it out until it said that you probably shouldn't do it on your personal PC. I'm part of the program on the One, and part of me knows they're probably saying that to cover their ass. I can't be selfish with it though because unlike the One, I'm not the only one that uses the PC. I can wait a few months. 
The key is to just keep pushing, and to never let it get away from you. You gotta empty the tank, and just not give a shit about the pain, just worry about your place. -a person racing a total of 5 miles this week.

Well, actually doesn't matter what type of setup you have, the important thing is if you are happy with your setup :DI have an old Q8400 with 4GB DDR2 and a Sapphire 7870 and I like it very much, games run smooth on it with normally all in High/Ultra and it's a pretty cheap (and old) setup with a very good cost/performance.
You should read the apocryphal Childhood Gospels of Jesus, where lil Jesus shoots birds out of the air with mind bullets and withers the limbs of bullies. The Gnostic Gospels of Jesus are pretty fun: he can walk through walls, fly, teleport, and shape shift.

I'd move on.  You want a copilot and she's definitely a passenger. This is what dating is for. You spend time with someone to see if they're a good match. She isn't. Move on.

"This guy's unbelievable. He's in the backfield all the time."Show 3 clips where no one blocks him. I surely hope he's in the backfield on those plays. 
No foul on the keeper - the attacker makes contact with the ball before the keeper had any control.For the second challenge, the attacking player has put his body in the way in order to shield the ball from an attacker, totally legal. Also I'd say that means no foul from the defender who has tried to go for the ball but been blocked off.So play advantage, I'd say.
Lots of folk feel similarly to how you do. I'd check out the community at restoringforeskin.org, which is super supportive and has great resources not only on non-surgical foreskin restoration, but also on dealing with dysphoria and emotional turmoil. 
For sure. We have a small local dairy community here. All family-owned and operated. Nice people in general from what I've encountered. I've seen some horrifying videos of the dairy industry with the same violations described here. It was always the large, factory-type farms that this went on. Lax hiring, disgruntled workers, and out-right psychos seem to be more of a problem there.  You have to imagine that a company that big cared as little for their employees as they did for the cattle.
Check out living near uptown, I love above vitesse the bike shop (10 min walk from campus) and pay $365 a month including utilities. It's kinda crappy looking but it's fully furnished, decent sized and there's free laundry so that's cool.

Well only bands are being added and yeah there is Pitchfork, Melt and Longitude that same weekend but it would have been cool to have some more experimental electronic music at Camp. They also waited pretty long to start the booking process which I'm sure hindered things but the main booking for camp this year was by the dude who manages Big G so I'm not really expecting much interesting stuff to still come out. Regardless I'm going to camp for the Biscuits first and foremost so anything else I like is just icing. 
While Triumphs are designed and assembled in England's glorious bosom, the Midlands, and every Briton should do their patriotic duty and buy one of their fine products (proud Street Triple rider, here), part of me feels like it's almost *more British* to ride a Japanese bike anymore. Or possibly an Italian one if someone else pays for the servicing.
Whether it's a winner scene or not, it perfectly establishes Mike's character.  He throws himself headfirst into everything, fights as hard as he can, and probably tries way too hard for his own good.
I mean Chuck was going to side with the Grizzlies anyway.  After all the shit he's said there is no way he couldn't.Out of all the teams left in the playoffs, Memphis is a classic Charles Barkley team.  They play inside out with two big guys that can take you down low.If the Warriors jump on the Griz this series like I think they will, I am going to be really excited to see Chuck try and spin it so he doesn't look like a total jackass.  If it were Houston he could say that Dwight is soft and they don't run the right offense.  If it were LAC he could say that they play Blake too much on the perimeter and don't go to DeAndre enough.  With Memphis, he's going to have no excuses.  No team fits the "Charles Barkley Championship Mold" better than the Memphis Grizzlies.  He's been saying all year that's the type of team that will beat the Dubs in the playoffs.  If it doesn't happen, what is he going to say?
The greatest unguessable one will always be 必. Not only is the stroke order crazy (looks like 心＋ノ?

&gt;  I'm so pissed off at myself and I feel so disgusting and stupid for allowing it to happen.Why?  Not really meant as a question to get you to talk further.  Anxiety is the thoughts and it is tough for us to go through unstable situations.  You don't need to talk about your situation - you need to realize its anxiety and let it run its course.  Know yourself - your goal is to find a stable life.  That means the man, his family, the friends, the job etc.  Settling down.  Stability is easier.  Find strong people.Take every opportunity to get towards that goal.  If he isn't ready to settle down then whats the problem?  Choose to be with him and take a chance or not.  Be upfront about what the relationship is and keep moving towards your goal of stability for your mental health.
The problem is that we waste a shit ton of money with a military designed to take on conventional standing armies when that's not the kind of battles they fight these days.  We conquered Iraq's standing military in days, and spent a decade fighting guerrillas.

I know you said you didn't want to co-wash but I've been alternating co-washing with regular washing (shampoo every 2 or 3 days and co-washing each day in between) and have found my ends like that a lot better than shampoo every day. I've been using organix/ogx shampoo and like them better than other things I've tried but I still haven't found one that I feel is perfect. I'm using the keratin one now but also liked the biotin/collagen one. When I co-wash I use mane n tail; it's popular and cheap and it works well enough but again I'll probably try one of the other popular options next.edit: had some extra words

I'm really happy because that's a sign she might be interested. (Just to be clear we don't know each other, just our names).
This is what they do. Governments that rule by terror have to maintain an atmosphere of arbitrary violence to terrify the public into submission. For example, starvation. During the late 1990s, Kim Jong Il bought expensive MIG-29 jets from Khazakhistan even as he deprived  millions of North Korean families who had been deemed disloyal, starving entire families to death, one by one.

What angrysprinkles said. As long as there's reasoning behind a negative opinion, and it's not just whiny, I think it's fine. It can still start discussions and some criticism is healthy anyway.Personally, I like Yooka's design (though she could use an accessory) but not really Laylee's. I couldn't pinpoint why, but it's what OP said. It's cute, just a bit too dumb-looking to me.
Whenever we have an out in our game cases I put my deleted games in there until we get the other item back in stock. But I currently have like 9 waco bins filled with $20 and under video games sitting on my clearance section that aint moving at all.

However, what is the pixel depth? I know when I made my Pedestals, still have 3 to make &gt;.&gt; that my Pixels were actualy 4x4 on Photoshops depth, I have 72dpi when I make. So since I mapped based on in-game sprite sizes, perhaps there is a difference.I know another seemed to have much much higher quality pixel art, closer to Chrono Trigger Style sprite work but was also the same size so Pixel Depth is likely the cause.
You made the extraordinary claim, that we havent shown any cultural or internal development, so the onus is on you to provide extraordinary proof to support it. So what makes you feel that way about us? Because we arent good? Thats not good enough.
I just got to say that you are the most talented writer ever. Breaking bad could've just been "another TV show" but you and your team made it into one of the best TV shows in history. For that, I ask you to keep it legit. I hope the success doesn't change your mentality or talent.
This is not a good idea. You're losing $70/month on PMI, which is wasted money. What's the point in buying a house, if you have to rent out a bedroom or two to make ends meet? How do you know you'll be there for 5+ years? What happens if the roof collapses the day after you sign the closing papers?Continue to rent for a while longer, and save up a much larger down payment.
Instead of asking the guy who already captions two shows, why not start captioning other shows ourselves? If this guy captioned every show he was asked to caption, he wouldn't have any free time.

The most interesting fact to me was that Baron Rivendare doesn't double up deathrattles when they're executed, only when they're queued (he appeared mid-phase and didn't double up the following Ancestral Spirit deathrattles)EDIT: Actually, an outstanding question would be if a second minion died later in that phase, would Baron Rivendare double THOSE deathrattles.
Yeah, I find it funny that one of the best naps I ever took was in 29 Palms after we got done with our run and I crawled under the RSO vehicle and slept with my head on the dirt in 90+ degree weather.
You'll eventually conquer stairs.  Going up and down will become second nature and you'll do fine in time.  Me, I prefer inclines rather than stairs going up and the other way going down.  I look retarded when I walk down an incline and I can go down stairs really quick.Now, one thing I have tried time and time.... and time again with zero success is.... running up stairs.  I just can't do it.Don't worry, if you work your legs out properly and keep good posture, you'll be able to walk up to people in shorts and they won't notice your leg is gone.

Nothing at the moment besides the currently airing shows.I'm also trying to figure out if I should continue with Kara no Kyoukai and Initial D or start something new. 
3 2hr long films sounds the most ideal to me, it would condense the story well enough and not be an overly long series.Ei Aoki I'm a bit mixed on, because while I LOVED Fate/Zero and KNK1, stuff like Aldnoah.Zero just left a bad taste in my mouth. But Takizawa Shinsuke I would be on board with 100%
I don't think there's anything wrong with Hooters. It's also not like these types of things are exclusive to women. There are male equivalents like Chip n' Dales.
&gt;That may temper the reality a bit, but if that was the point of the review then it is either poorly written or maliciously edited.To me, it tempers it a lot. Suddenly the statements about why women might do worse aren't *personal attacks* they're *academic arguments*. They might be arguments you or I would disagree with, but they're still relevant arguments.In any other context, such statements would be blatant sexism.But yes, the excerpts still put a bad light on the reviewer. Then again, there are a lot of ellipses in those excerpts, indicating a lot has been missed out, presumably to make the sexism clearer (which could result in creating the appearance of sexism where there is none).
Unless you're concerned she's going to cause a scene, invite her.  Spoiler: she probably won't even come.  Really, it sounds like her only fault is she doesn't really like you.  Big deal. 
I don't think an individual increment of a statistic is "a" data (singular), I think the overall percentage is "the" data. You could use "datum" for multiple statistics.     "the *data* from each one will be calculated separately, and the overall *datum* will then be averaged together..."
Hispanic immigrants come here by choice, yet their outcomes tend to be pretty different than Asians who come here by choice.  So I think we can toss out that variable.Although, as Ted Cruz recently pointed out, those Hispanic immigrants tend to be hardworking.  As Cruz said, you don't see Latino panhandlers.
I agree that an OW heavy game is a bit boring, though that's the precise reason I love Infantry OW - Unlike virtually any other class aside from Guardians, Infantry can push forward and still yield devastating OW. Having the option of Offensive OW is a lot more fun than eternal ambushes.Regardless - your squad comp sounds really interesting. I can certainly see it working well if you dedicate yourself to going hard or going home!
You're increasing awareness. How many comments in this thread say more or less, "I don't wanna cheat but can someone explain how this works?" Some of those people are gonna go use it. And some are gonna tell their friends.
There's no law/regulation covering that, if that's your question.  Meaning it is open to negotiation although the building might choose not to play.  Aside from pure greed it could be part of their way to force less affluent people to self screen themselves out.  If you do pay it, insist on a written receipt for your highly specific handwritten check because there's an off chance some low life is gouging you on the side.

The amano have really helped with the hair algae. Biggest tip I can offer is go with less light duration than you think you need and move up if necessary. It is easier to prevent algae than it is to get rid off it. Don't be afraid to yank out a badly infested plant and quarantine it. 
That's good to know.  My battery may have just hit the end of its life.  The laptop is a Dell, but I'm not sure what model.  ([It does *look* like this one, though.](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-15-6-Inch-Operating-Definition/dp/B003LNDMT4))
Yeah you can, and I do believe that moobot is what they have cause Ray/Tina set up the stream originally and I think RT are still using it the way they set it up.
As much as I hate you and envy your collection, I have to congratulate you! I can't imagine when I'll finally be able to say that I've gotten every vinyl Halo. You go, dude.

You can't expect a subreddit called electronic_cigarette to cater exclusively to advanced vapers when the name itself is very entry level. New vapers are going to search that term. There should have been a new subreddit for advanced users instead or new users.

My shiba had a phase where he decided he didn't like to head this one direction on our apartment block. Was randomly fine with walking and then he suddenly decided it was terrifying. He refused to move, did a shiba scream and yelled and howled like I was torturing him and I was so embarrassed I took him home. He eventually got over it. Now he loves walks but I think they're rough at that age because they can't walk very far. Maybe they get scared you're going to take them on a long walk? I can't figure out shiba logic myself.
It's not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning is that a rainy alleyway being watched by over by Woody Harrilson should absolutely be a Tekken stage.
He won't since sanders is running for the democrat nomination, we'll have a race between him and hillary, the winner will then go on to go up against the republican nominee- with the full backing of the democratic party.
I think it is completely ok to throw your own baby shower, create a registry and invite all your family and friends! Gifts are nice but even more - I think babies should be celebrated!!  Also, if you want to buy some of the bigger items yourself, you can go ahead and start. We purchased our own nursery furniture - crib, changing table, armoire, rug and we are planning to go shopping for a glider in the next few weeks. I might be in the minority here but I don't think anyone owes me anything so any gifts I receive are just for fun. I'm not relying on them. I am mostly looking forward to just celebrating!!!

&gt;"Leading experts in several fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The Report is edited by Professor John F. Helliwell, of the University of British Columbia and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; Lord Richard Layard, Director of the Well-Being Programme at LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance; and Professor Jeffrey D.

But the people who formulated this weren't complete idiots. They've got the experience and the credentials to back up what they're saying.

Dragging myself or I can't walk, if I am walking or running it's like I have lead shoes on and everything in slow motion, had this dream for some 15 years now.
In a sense I can agree with you. Weed can be dangerous. For example, it can be abused. A non experienced toker can smoke to much weed and get too high, and let's say that same toker were to operate a motor vehicle, well chances are he's probably going to crash that car. Like anything, it should be approached with caution I 100% agree. But overall, is marijuana honestly safe? Absolutely. Don't be an idiot about it. Smoke responsibly. It all depends on the person. I personally do not use heavily anymore simply because it isn't to me what it once was. But I'll be damned if I won't try to spread the word of this wonderful plant sent from God almighty. Stay easy dude I appreciate your reply! 
Yeah, I suppose it's  sore subject with a lot of non-religious people because they may not be religious because they had a bad experience. Still no reason to be rude.

You wrote a lot, but didn't really tell us anything about your situation.  You are in a job you feel should be filled by a TSgt and were given an additional duty, that again you feel should have been filled by someone of higher rank.  ok, the AF has downsized and a lot of us are doing a lot of work with fewer people, and if your an A1C, you shouldn't expect to be treated like a TSgt.  Not trying to bag on your rant, but tell us more about why you feel like you 'won't have a chance to do what you thought you could do?'
Ronaldo is ten times the fifa card messi is. But Im a messi fan not Ronaldo so when they were both 15 mil and extinct I ended up choosing messi. Ronaldo is just way too cheating. Messi isnt far behind though 
But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time.
No, when Doris Grau died in 1997 they retired the character out of respect like Phil Hartman's characters. When the Lunch Lady was brought back in 2006 she was named Dora and was voiced by Tress MacNeille.

To be honest, I don't feel the homeless man was discriminated against due to his gender. I think he was discriminated against because of his clothing and appearance. Sure, she was advantaged due to him doing that, but to be honest it was his choice. I'm not saying chivalry needs to die, but then women act like its for granted. **THAT** pisses me off.
If they don't... I don't even know. I hopefully they'll have some sort of way to transfer the profile or even just download a .txt file of your collection. 
This is why I don't understand why they wouldn't stockpile picks. That coach is going to be PISSED when he gets fired and the Titans still pick in the top 5 next year.
Lol its hilarious how apeshit men go at the idea of being taught normal rules of consent, but are fine with women being told at every available opportunity the usual crap that is used to blame them later.If you are not a rapist, you don't need the education, and we're not talking about you. Not everything is about you personally. Educating men about consent does not mean treating them like rapists. Jesus.
Honestly if it's school versus dating. I always choose my grades. Anyone unfortunate enough to mingle with me during one of those stressful times is usually cut off but at least I'm honest.If I'm not interested I just say so but sometimes to some people busy and not interested mean the same thing.

How else would you have wanted the FTL neutrino thing to go? It was pretty well handled by the scientific community, I thought. Pretty much everybody kept a skeptical head on their shoulders while more effort was undertaken to study the phenomenon until it was clear what the error was. Like really. How the hell else should that have gone exactly?The only people I really heard saying "EINSTEIN WAS WRONG!!!" were those in the MSM that basically get everything somewhat wrong nearly all the time. Not ideal for science, not ideal for anybody.

I haven't had TV for almost 20 years, so all the TV I watch tends to be stuff that people already dig, long after they've been on the air. I think I watched "The Wire" only because I heard about the series finale on NPR and they were raving about it. The only time I think I've actually sat down in that time to watch a show live was the last season of Lost. I really got into it in the last season. 
I've said it once and I say it again: if she gets pregnant with her dead husband's baby that *will* be the absolute final straw for me.  If that doesn't happen, I'll hang on here until the end (probably) but if we go with that cliche... *ugh ugh ugh.*
Dark matter and dark energyThere is something out there that is exerting gravitational pull, but we can't detect it through any other means. You can't see it. It doesn't put off any radiation, or reflect radiation. There are no detectable particles. It's just there, and it's having an affect on the universe.

Well, it will be what it will be.  If it's blown, maybe just run the new front speakers back off the deck and skip the amp.  You said you were getting rid of the car anyway. 
Anything done on this patient will be under general anesthesia, but yeah, I know what you mean. Also, don't worry about it, if you have a roof over your head and don't live in your own filth, this kind of things don't happen.
I recently reported a worker for calling a customer stupid. The customer was not upset in any manner and was trying to let the worker know there was an issue on the floor. For me, that's actively hostile.
This is great, I absolutely love The Tool Library, such a useful service for $50/year. I've used it a handful of times for basic jobs in the last few months and had easily paid for itself.
As an engineer that designs power plants, (coal fired and now nuclear with some natural gas in there too), I will say that natural gas is going a very strong footing with lots of our work going to retrofitting coal plants to run on natural gas.I'm much more interested in the future of nuclear technologies but I would keep my money clear of yeshiva/westinghousenuclear and their new AP1000 modular designed reactors. The calculations supporting that thing are rubbish.

I bought the stack guides, honestly, it wasn't worth it. There's been no updates and the information is freely available on the website. I think the website is great, I'm a huge fan, just disappointed with the stack guides. Feel guilty slating them, but I'm just being honest. 
Dude he's just asking you if you've personally tried your MXE. That's a pretty easy way to tell if it's legit MXE or not. It might not be your cup of tea, but if I were a vendor, ~~I'd never sell anything to my customers that I haven't tried on myself first~~ EDIT: Perhaps not always a wise policy depending on what one sells; still it's the principle of the matter. More importantly, I'd be using independent lab to do purity testing every batch of every chemical before selling it.Such measures can and do save lives; and there have been far too many deaths that could have been prevented by simple due diligence. A Danish vendor and a kid in California died way back in like... 2011? because the vendor didn't bother to analytically test his product before selling it or trying it himself.I'm just saying dude, be careful, you know? For everyone's sake. What sort of analytical testing are you having performed on the sample? Just curious.
Since when? The original discrimination in X-Men comics was very openly based upon racial discrimination in a still-divided America. Charles and Eric are(were) pretty openly designed to represent MLK and Malcolm X in terms of their different ways of opposing the segregation and discrimination they experienced. There may have been some degree of influence from gay rights and backlash against homosexual members of society, but it was most definitely more of a racial issue in the 60s and 70s. 
I think people just aren't being as vocal with their support, but they still support her. I think it's because she wasn't doing so well in the beginning of the season, but then she had the redemption story line and turned it around. That's when people really got on board with Pearl. It's just that she's done well for the last few weeks, and it seemed like she was gaining momentum only for her to underperform last episode. I'm just hoping she turns it out next episode, so that last episode was just a one time thing and not a gradual downfall.

There are protesters.  These are not protesters, they're rioters.  The protesters are the ones forming a barricade to defend the police.   Being a protester means you are civil.  Not being civil makes you a rioter
Thanks. This is kind of what I was expecting, it just seems so redundant - why late to start collecting sub fees? I wouldn't be bothered but they send you a pre-order code in your email, and I just want to be 100% sure that this won't greenlist them for the current a realm reborn content. Anyways, I wound up putting a customer service ticket in so I can get the answer from the japanese mega-horse (savage)'s mouth. Thanks for taking the time to give your point of view, I appreciate it.
While what he said was untrue, the message was a good one. Unless you are going for a very serious major (ie engineering) a trade is an amazing way to make money.
I doubt it'll take that long, there's been a lot back and forth since GW2 was released and I bet they tried to avoid an expansion and see where Living Story led.It seems that they changed that route by the end of season 1, as things like precursor scavenger hunt and new legendaries that was meant to be revealed at the second Wintersday was postponed and withheld for the expansion instead.
That's what I thought too. Cartoon violence vs gritty violence does make a difference, and it was the latter that I was thinking of when I posted this thread.
Was what they said about PTR true?  I mean he seems like a nice guy, but apparently he threw a huge fit when he heard that it was a possibility that he was going to get cut from CLG.  Can anyone confirm this?
Did you go to school in Illinois? Because I had a math teacher and a computer science teacher do the same thing. They would constantly talk about girls and pretend like we had no idea what their "codes were". Hell one of the teachers asked a girl to get the "gay" out of his youngest son, who was a classmate of hers. Last I heard he has a very painful form of cancer. Did I mention this was all in front of students?
&gt;Yuck.  I'm sure Cheba Hut makes extraordinarily delicious food, **but how could anyone eat anything that came out of that location**.  Remember what was in that building before?  DISGUSTINGLY FILTHY!!
I have a phobia of dogs. I have it mostly under control now, but it was pretty bad when I was younger.   I used to have recurring nightmares about a doberman that would chase me around. But the doberman would glide around on it's hind legs, and would always pop out of hiding, like from under piles of toys. Whenever it caught me it would knock me to the ground and a word balloon saying "no" would pop up. I know it sounds stupid but I was terrified of that thing.   One day my mom told me to visualize myself standing up to the dog, and the nightmares stopped. That's also when I started lucid dreaming.
Hell, I enjoy watching the little guys and I'd be all up for it if I thought there were enough fighters for it. Problem is that we've seen there's not enough guys to run a real 125 division - we're like 2 years in and it still feels like it's just gotten started and we're scraping together title fights.
Realistically, most of the regular, reliable audio engineer gigs out there are for megachurches. Unless the congregation &gt;10k every sunday, they don't pay shit. You might score the odd recording gig or maybe doing the tech behind indie film scoring or folio work, but other than that there's not much regular work. Maybe a local TV station, but that will only be for their non-syndicated programming. 
Idk. Not all smokers smell like smoke or have their sorroundings smell like smoke. I also hate the smell. Especially when you walk into a house or car and just immediately smell cigarettes. If you smoke keep it away from others and hopefully have enough self respect to be sure the smell isn't everywhere that you linger. Of course your kids shouldn't suffer because of your smoking. A person who keeps the smoke away from their children of course already knows this BECAUSE they're keeping it away from their children. So making sure you blow the smoke outside the window and keep your children out of the room doesn't make you dumb. It makes you smart.
No, it's a pretty shitty strategy considering the lack of cover at the drop zone doesn't make up for dropship lasers, especially when mechs are being dropped out in the open.  Even so, it doesn't matter. If you want it changed, keep spamming it. Make people annoyed enough that it starts to affect the player base and make pgi act.

Since he's bonded with the kitten, he probably would like a younger rabbit, but with puberty comes potential fights, so maybe bonding sooner is better than later as long as the kit is properly weaned and as long as the little one has a couple safe places to hide if things get rough. So to be clear I wasn't suggesting less than 8 wks., but adults and toddlers can get along surprisingly well. 
U-turn is the main draw early game, as it is an intensely powerful pivot. Late game it can sweep after walls have been weakened and priority or scarfers have been removed. I find a lot of people complain about M-Bee just because he is frail, when they don't even know how to use him properly. If the opponent has priority, you shouldn't be staying in.
You mentioned armor piercing weaponry, that could be interesting if special weapons variants are added back to the game. Perhaps an armor piercing cannon with less ammo and slower reload but can punch through really strong armor.
I think my main issue is that Pearl is a top 6 or 7ish queen talent wise, but she is getting a top 3 edit.A lot of it comes down to the sub noticing the edit and becoming disillusioned by it in face of the probability that more talented queens will be sacrificed in the coming weeks for Pearl to make top 3. It is just like last year. Was Adore an immensely talented and charismatic queen? Yes. But did producer manipulation help her to the top 3? It sure looked like it.
I can't believe people still sent understand that matchmaking for end game activities is an awful idea, all the reasons have already posted. IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO USE LFG OR 100. Should there be an in game solution? Would be great. But that's something that can't feasibly be added at this time. I'm not even sure the last gen systems could handle any more huge mechanic changes.

riven is not strong in the tank meta she gets rekt by cc and is also easily countered by armor (dont really know why but she has huge problems with high armor enemies not like other ad casters)and this is basically what every team hasriven is the same as master yi kata etc. if the enemy knows how to teamfight properly vs those they are gonna be useless
They could make it were the resistance was stronger or only applied to the one the spell was casted on. All aggroed units would receive a smaller or no resistance buff.

You may also want to check out places like renaissance fairs, civil war reenactments, etc.. Places like etsy might be worth a look as well. I can't imagine that such clothes will come cheap, though, unless you want to go for Halloween costume designs, but they're likely inaccurate and probably of poor quality. 
All classes get "a bunch of utilities". Mesmers get (at least) 4 Wells. On top of that, they get a new Shatter, and a very powerful exclusive boon.The bonus of 2handers are 3 more weapon skills, if you count the autoattack. And that's not always a good thing, as I already said. It's not like these new weapons are going to completely eclipse the old ones, and 1handers are more flexible.
Thank you for citing me! I will, at the very least I will open up my dropbox to redditors (i amybody wants to read like 300 pages of gmargin stuff lol). 
First off, im sorry but fuck you. Thats a bs comparison and u are most likely a troll.Secondly, blizzard just released the swarmhost update and reaper grenade update, if anything dota is the one firing back
Completely agree. But I still do think it's a parallel scenario - orgasm isn't quite the point OP should be going for here, what he should be focusing on is mutual reciprocation. It absolutely wouldn't be fair for her to engage in a particular activity that makes him feel good, whereas he doesn't do the same for her in return. Whether or not they orgasm from that, while relevant, is a little besides the point. OP may be able to orgasm normally with handjobs and PIV, but then again he might do so significantly better orally. What it comes down to is that he's not full-filling her needs adequately, despite promises to do so.
[Pointing out the obvious](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32plim/hestia_going_mainstream/cqdgu7k) and [quality shitposting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wt9ho/take_a_picture_of_an_anime_character_and_add_some/cou0bkv) That's what I'm here for!
We give every host an IPX address, we don't use NAT because we'll never run out of IPs in our public /24 and we always use Standard ACLs as firewalls. Haha. Yea, I agree with you.
She's only trying to get his attention when other girls have his attention. That is just crappy. It's not sincere. If she really liked him, she would start flirting with him without other girls around. If that is her subtle way, it's not working for her. OP is clearly not psychic enough to get her clues.
They may be like the seasons, affected by magic. It could be the only way for Weirwoods to grow is by magic, or perhaps they never grew at all, and were with Westros since its creation, whatever that may have been. 
If you want, you can try using Paint Tool SAI. It has a stabilizer tool that stabilizes your stroke.Or, if you don't like SAI, you can use Lazy Nezumi instead.EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwtrp9tQt5gHere's what SAI can do.EDIT 2:Just found a very nice video that explains how to get nice lineart too =3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM1KJGo4XQE

Not being a medical doctor, or knowing what illness your mother makes this story quite worrying to me.  I have read of people treating themselves with [antibiotics they buy themselves online](http://knowledgeweighsnothing.com/fish-antibiotics-for-human-use-no-prescription-required/).  So I guess at the very last resort, with APS not being able to help, or anyone else, this is what I would try.
I should win because I live in a small town, The next "big town" is more than 3 hours away from me. I don't drive so I never get out of my small town. I live in a town FULL of nerds and college/university kids. There is NO such thing as getting something rare, because one of the many "collectors" go into stores and buy them out then put stuff on Kijiji to make a quick buck. So pick me because I can't ever hope to get them otherwise... without paying... a lot.
I don't take time away from my family to go to lodge to hear fart jokes. We make some funny clever jokes during the business portion, and it helps to break up the monotony. But if someone was farting on a candidate while waiting for the first degree, and everyone was OK with it, I would spend the next day looking for a new lodge. That's just not appropriate. 
If youre looking to buy shoot me an email Shawnharris@dominionlending.caImo the 3x gross looks "right" as in thats what id be comfortable with at current rates if i made that money. I have people come in all the time trying to buy at their max and i always tell them not to lol. 
If Sandow did what he did with Axel (sampling another guy's moveset, only to finish it with his own) then I'd be satisfied. He's still a stunt double, but he's mainly his own man.But please, stop with the vocal mimicry..
Do you just torrent all the Purple Chick stuff? I've grabbed bits and pieces over the years but I'd love to get organised with that stuff and listen to it all in order. 
10 years in Internet Years is like 100 years in dog years. They had a hell of a run. In these modern times, if an **AA wants you shut down, they are going to shut you down. You have to have a squeaky clean system, process &amp; legal backing to make it. If any of the IP Agencies even think you aren't legit, it's all over for you. As long as there is a stream though, it can be intercepted and analog converted into an mp3. You may lose some quality, but hell... back in the old days we were happy with a cassette tape quality. 
I found it very distracting how everyone kept really enunciating "Vincent Van *GOFF*" throughout that episode. Maybe that's the right way to say it, and Americans are assholes for saying "Van Go", but it still seemed really weird every time.
Anyone about to take AP exams? On another note, has anyone read the manga, "At least like that snow"? It's one of the few manga that makes me feel a pain in my heart every time I think about it.

Why is anybody having an issue with this? The punishment should be determined by what damage is done, not by who does the damage. If somebody breaks the law and that specific law has been valued at a certain amount; you pay that amount (whether that payment be time or money).The counter argument to this is akin to saying "two people want to buy an apple, but since the first person is much wealthier he should pay much more.. Because, you know, its unfair that person number 2 has less money and has to pay a larger percentage for the same thing". While the wealthy person may be able to pay the difference it would be unfitting to charge more based on that alone.
Final offer: 14 car dealerships, weekend income on a Waffle House, weekday income on a Perkins but only as it relates to Tremendous Twelves OR M/W income from Medina Ballroom but bowling only. 
why do you say: &gt;disillusionment that existed from non-black Americanslike blacks feel different from whites? You may not be racist or hateful towards black people, but this kind of thinking is inherently racist. Edit: Looked up the word racist and I agree, I am wrong. I am going to post it here for anyone who's never bothered. &gt;a person who believes that a particular race is superior to another.
Hrmmm.... I'm not really well versed on what is coming in Skywind...but I think I'll still hope to use Survival and Camping mods like iNeed and Campfires. Also things like the Arrow Recovery Overhaul and Lockpicking Overhaul would be helpful.

One of my soldiers decided to lose his ach, ach cover, flc and pouches for the flc. Needless to say he had a very long day. Platoon fall in drills, squad leaders smoking the platoon because they(the squad leaders) lost accountability for their SI. Put on saturday cq because another team leader started whining to the psg. And just all around dumb army things. It was a good week.
It will be hard to find a place that is showing the fight for the regular cover charge.  It's a $99 PPV event. And bars are being charged by their capacity level. ..with some paying $10k just to host the fight. 
Spend some time in California Adventure. Disney pumped a ton of money and effort into Buena Vista Street and Cars Land, and it really shows. Radiator Springs Racers is a blast to ride, even if you're not a fan of *Cars*.Make sure to see the new shows for the 60th anniversary, too - fireworks, parade... even World of Color is getting a new show.
There's 80 million families. Of those, 16 million consist of families where nobody works.SO and I are retired. We don't work. His mom is retired. She doesn't work. My sister is retired. She doesn't work. Four of my cousins are retired. They don't work. Not having a job doesn't mean that you're desperately searching for work and can't find it. It also doesn't mean that you're on welfare.
...because despite that, its still way further left than my tastes and historically is CPGB affiliated which immediately lowers my opinion of it significantly, as does its historical association with Soviet apologia even if that was in the past. Its "the West is obviously at fault" narrative with regards to any international issue pisses me off too, and they're anti-EU. These issues matter to me because compared to most voters I'm more concerned with foreign policy issues.Is it as harmful as the Daily Mail or an equivalently far on the political spectrum paper to the right? No. Does that make it a good paper in my view? Hell no.
Can only speak for Austin, but there are a number of really great trailers to hit up. Arlo's is good for post drink grub. It's outside of Cheer Up Charlie's (one of my favorite bars) and has a pretty damn good vegan bacon cheeseburger. Also, you're in Texas, so BBQ is a must. Try BBQ Revolution. Seriously. Jalepeno Mac N Cheeze. Oof. And tacos! You have to have tacos! Give The Vegan Nom a shot.EDIT: Apparently I suck at reading and you've already got BBQ Revolution covered. So I'll throw in some bar suggestions to make up for it! White Horse is pretty good and usually has an awesome two-stepping band playing, as is Shangri-La, Liberty and Jackalope (it's one of the few places on Dirty Sixth I'm willing to visit). 
It's more like the beta is on a completely new server for the time being.   You won't have to reroll toons but instead will get a full respec for your guys.   Your builds and gear may need changes is all. 
Athletic, but really needs to develop in the NFL. Williams was a chalky pick, this team needs impact defense and he could bring it. (Granted he has an almost equal chance of failure fail)
Woah that was seriously a dangerous play, can't say I'm unhappy it happened to dunleavy tho, he provoked him trying to get a technical on him, he got what he wanted.
Just because you stay operating doesn't mean your business model is successful. A successful business model involves being able to adequately compensate your employees. 
Was on a school trip to some cottage place to do some Geo work, our class is female (hot) teacher, 2 girls and me. It was a huge trip with other schools in our federation, so anyway, we go, get to this old house, pretty neat, me and a mate from another school get put into the smallest room possible...being the tallest people in about 50 students.So, we have to walk heads tilted. Anyway, go for a shower, light goes off, fucking sensor is behind the shower door, get out, get the sensor working, finish up, go outside trying to dry up as the shower is just a mess. Walk out, teacher comes to walk in, go to run and jump under bed covers, hit head on wooden beam and fall on the floor nude. So, that was interesting. But, she was hot, so there's that. Hopefully she doesn't browse reddit. 
I used to fake it, but the eyes are the key to the brain. You can glean pieces of information about a person by looking into their eyes. Plus the eyes are the best looking part of the face. Fight the urge to look away. I do it every time I talk to somebody even though it feels awkward.
As I understand it, sort of, yes. It'd actually be a little more like you're reaching out, grabbing the fabric of reality, and using that to push yourself about.Which is quite literally what the EmDrive seems to do. You're just using a machine to do it instead of your hand.So imagine you reach out in a given direction, grab onto nothing (and something) in the air (but not the air itself), and push off of it. If that makes any kind of sense.
Haulover Beach is not far from where you will be. It is America's best clothing-optional beach. You might want to make plans for Fantasy Fest in Key West come October.
When you have a car thats fun to drive, sometimes you drive like an asshole. I admit I have pissed off a few people when in fun mood. But most of the time I am very courteous and always let people in front of me if they want to change lanes etc.
&gt; Was the van driver african american? If so its an extremely important detail since whites and white cops seem to be the current target of much of the outrage.There was an interview with an African American woman who is a relative of the van driver.  She claimed Gray was injured by the arresting officers, and was afraid that her relative would be unjustly blamed for the man's death.A black police officer charged, and ambiguous evidence might be the best recipe for reducing racial tension if there is a protracted trial..Of course, the Truth is always preferred.
Yeah, everyone said Kendrick got him on that track, but Pusha was too much. "Gem star razor and a dinner plate, arm and hammer in a mason jar thats my dinner date"
If only Clinkz had some sort of damaging skill that did extra damage to catapults. And if he had some sort of attack speed skill which could synergise really well with that damage skill, that'd be unbelievable. We can only dream of a another skill that would let him kill a high HP creep, like a mega creep, to give him ludicuous amounts of damage and HP to tank a creep wave.
Most of those pics show Black Canary doing the cry with a lot more panache. The actress just opened her mouth and because she didn't actually scream while portraying it, the whole thing came across rather blank and awkward. The lack of sound wave effects and/or wind blowing her hair didn't help either.
Well Canada is somewhat referred as a environmental villian, he obviously hasnt destroyed it but his choices as leader are destroying it and hes doing nothing about it.
It's mainly because "ape" is a term that has a long history prior to the discovery that human beings are more closely related to chimps than chimps are to orangutans (both of which are apes, with no controversy associated).  I typically refer to human beings as apes, personally, but the definition used by society at large (including the scientifically literate public who accept evolution) only includes non-human hominoids.
Encase in Ice should be pretty self explanatory. Stubborn Denial vs Edict effects and Wrath effects such as Foul-Tongue Invocation, Crackling Doom, End Hostilties, Crux of Fate, etc. Aqueous Form vs decks that clog the board up such as Abzan Aggro/Midrange, Temur, and some R/G aggro variants. Ordeal of Heliod vs fast aggro such as RDW or Atarka Red. I also like it in Abzan Aggro but some dont. Disdainful Stroke vs decks running lots of 4CMC or more such as R/G devotion, Abzan Control, and Esper/U.B Control. Treasure Cruise vs decks that try to grind out the game such as Esper/U.B, Abzan Control, or Sultai Whip. Not sure about the Island. 
The onions will get incredibly sweet on their own.I make SMOG all the time (Steak, Mushrooms, Onions, Gruyere) and if you're patient with the onions, the balsamic doesn't take away from the sweetness at all. I add a splash of worcestershire sauce along with my vinegar.  It still tastes like I dumped a pile of sugar into the mess, but it was all natural onion the whole time.Adding sugar only increases the likelihood of burning, and the calories.  Really it's only appropriate if you're taking a shortcut because you don't have time to fully caramelize the onions on their own.  If you're cooking them for an hour? Skip the sugar.
I found that the best way is to actually use specific examples even if you have to make them up. Use specific names and then create situations that would favor your argument.I'm not really the kind of person knowledgeable to judge someone else's essay but I did get a 11 on my essay using specific examples.
Não esperava aprender uma coisa nova a estas horas, nesse caso desculpa-me e obrigado!PS: Então quer dizer que cada vez que me corrigem ao dizer não é "ter pagado" é "ter pago", ainda tenho mais razão em reclamar? :O
Um, ok.  I think you're under the impression that we enforce the "circle of trust" in that region.  The gulf is crowded, straights moreso.  When I was over there prior to the Iraq invasion (aka high tensions and combat readiness) we had ships and planes constantly inside our bubble, and never did a thing about it.  They wont now, either.Also, thats the first time I've ever heard it called "circle of trust" :/
He is probably *the most* influental and prolific KSP youtuber, and extremely famous in the KSP community.He's also not the only person that Squad pre-releases to, I'm told that there are several youtubers that get prereleases, and authors of the most popular mods may get them too.

Currently trying to create a rogue deck that uses Gang Up to adapt the deck to the opponent's archetype (ganging Belchers and Healbots against aggro, skulkers against zoo, Loatheb against spells, etc). Tried five games with it, lost all of them, and scrapped the decklist. Anyone have advice for making this work?
Yass! I'm finishing my PhD next year, too! Uh, fingers crossed.We have a campus-based university, so partying undergraduates are commonly encountered on Thursday nights as they make their way to one of the clubs in town. The often confuse *me* for an undergrad and let's just say...hilarity ensues. In any case, good luck to you, me and all the future Dr Evils!
Do you know she wouldn't let you pay?My boyfriend and I pay back and forth. I'll pay for the first date, he pays for the second. I'll get the movie tickets and he'll buy the snacks or cheap dinner after. It's ruder to not listen to someone's wishes than it is to not pay for them. 
Hoosier used as a derogatory term. Most of the country knows of the word, and that it pertains to Indiana, but around here it's a mild way of saying trailer trash.
Is nostalgia seriously blinding us so much that we're remembering the worst parts of BC2 as amazing? Medic trains were horrible. They basically made any encounter into a mini Operation Metro.

no, but as a fellow 20 year old i can say that was just an insanely stupid play and he would have fucked over the bulls (and himself honestly) so bad if dunleavy got hurt there (which he totally could have, his entire ribcage was exposed on that hit)
Modding wasn't paid to begin with, so I'd be baffled at those who decided to dedicate so many hours to it with the purpose of hoping to be monetarily compensated for it. Would be really weird to not realize that they should have chosen a different area to try and sell their work/skills as opposed to one that isn't monetized.That's like someone who wants to be paid for playing sports joining an amateur league and being surprised they aren't getting paid. They obviously won't, since they didn't pursue the leagues where income is actually expected.
Can we stop the bullshit about higher min wage is bad and we're taxed too much?Denmark literally pays people 20+ dollars an hour has free education free healthcare and a higher standard of living than we do.Our tax burden is like 32% to their 38%, it's just getting beyond old.A single payer system is cheaper than what we have in every way possible.
I hope the boos get louder and louder until no one can hear anything that awful man says and they have to abort and get someone else to make the announcements. 
I don't think so? I'm not entirely sure. I check her all over every week. And it's our garden so I know there's no pesticides or anything harsh that could harm her. I have to keep a close eye on her though, because she's fast when she wants to be. You might have an easier time with a BP. Mine just sort of lied there.
Everyone should be able to survive the suicide mission regardless of romance if you play it right. And so long as you don't lock in romance with Jack *in ME3* (me2 doesn't matter) you can still romance Liara in ME3. 
I guess I didn't see Samaritan's actions as calculated and deliberate.  I saw them as impulsive and reckless.  As soon as it was online it went to work hunting the poi team.  It did the bidding of its human agents without question while the machine took time to learn.  While I call it impulsive, I don't mean to say it's any less intelligent.  I think that the sense of tact and focus just comes from extreme intelligence it possesses innately. And I think the parallel was supposed to be subtle but accessible.  Elias isn't a perfect representation of the machine, while Dominic isn't a mirror of Samaritan.  The relationship between them however, is much more closer the ASI godhood dynamicand of course just my opinion
I like the bit you said about the scourge tracing back to Queen Yahrnam's bad blood. Very interesting point you make there, and I feel like it could be true
The concensus among Christian moderates seems to be that God did this to provide a missionary opportunity.  Fundamentals are blaming gay marriage and Obama.   Meanwhile Hindu fundamentalists are saying that it was caused by Nepalese leaders eating meat.

I worked at an alternative school (where all the kids who were too bad for public school went) for a year where I learned so many ways on how not to be a teacher. Here is my worst story:A group of students always went to the bathroom immediately after lunch every day. One day another student asked why they always did that and my colleague replied "Because they're gay! They have to finish their circle-jerk before class!"I was stunned speechless by that one. Another good one from that school was the science teacher telling a kid he looked like a transvestite. 
I think the earlier point was that someone said Javaris may have gotten someone to take the test for him and then another person replied with "no way dude is smart because he got a 3.5 gpa so he must have gotten that 1400 SAT". I just said it doesn't have to be the case and essentially, it is possible that Javaris got someone to take it for him.

I believe this refers to the Post-52 Multiverse. He says that Multiverse-2 was their last big meal - they are currently ripping it to shreds. At the same time, Convergence and Secret Wars are doing away with each of their universe's concepts of multiverses.

The silver goes over the top of the blue pretty well. But the red is much darker on top of the blue and the gold is really thin and will need many coats to not appear green. So I'll probably end up carefully masking off everything that wont be blue before laying that color down.
Damn, Texans fans on twitter are already falling over themselves because "Now everyone else in the Division has a franchise QB". Lets ignore the fact that Bortles wasn't very good, and Mariota has proven absolutely nothing right now.

They're not as rare as you'd think. Compared to the amount of animals, their numbers are few. But there's at least 1 in every section of the jail. Problem is, as soon as other groids catch wind of it, they pretty much disown that person.

It's not that you focus on magic pen, but Kennen's kit often requires him to be more in the middle of the fight. Using auto-attacks for w passive, using e, and especially ult, Kennen is often closer than most mages and less safe. Hence why defensive items are generally more rushed.Zhonya's Hourglass is a must-have, and gives him more armor, and gives him more effective HP with health. Rylai's is also good on him to get many procs, and gives him higher effective HP coupled with Zhonya's. Haunting Guise is strong because it gives him more health (not just magic pen) and if coupled with Rylai's can be strong for kiting and damaging both the backline and the frontline. Abyssal gives more 'magic pen' (technically magic resistance reduction), but also makes it easier for him to survive.It's not that magic pen is so important to Kennen, it's that Kennen can play more like a frontline than most mages and typically builds more health and resistances, rather than large AP items.
The sad thing is that the Sparrow's work is really needed in a war torn land, and if she'd use her influence to steer them away from violence it could have been a true force of good for the realm.But Cersei wouldn't be Cersei if she didn't touch something and turned it to ashes.
I don't read/post in /r/news often, but I'm thinking it's frequented by Fox-News-watching types, hence the downvotes and denial of reality. I posted something similar earlier. Basically saying that even in the outlandlish scenario that the mayor is malicious, she wouldn't have admitted to it. People in this subreddit seem to project their idiocy onto others.
What it might be is that there's a list of "default" subreddits that everyone is subscribed to from the get-go (e.g. /r/funny, /r/TwoXChromosomes). If you don't want to see those, you can go to the subreddit page and unsubscribe from the ones you don't like.

See, I like that, because I can at least understand Vince's logic here:  he got over doing imitations, so he should be the move-copy character you always see in fighting games.It's not working, but  there's plenty of good ideas that just didn't work once they got in the ring. Which is much more than I can say of fundamentally insane ideas, like trying to get Roman over by feuding him with Big Show.
Surprisingly, yes! In the consensual yet unexpected sense as the one perpetrating the crime. To be honest, I wouldn't mind even the whole breaking in part of it, either. Done safely and with a severe level of forethought. IE: 'breaking glass' to get in, when it's done with a key but have a small thin sheet of pane glass and a hammer over a basket type setup. For that initial, 'What the shit', reaction. Then just. Let it go from there........And you gotta have the proper burglary kit. Well for this situation anyways. Can't very well let the lady home alone make a lot of noise or stir up shit. In the end I figure the only thing that would be 'taken', is a lot of time, and probably a hard cider after the deed was done. ... Then a bowl of popcorn, some aftercare and fuck yes netflix.

Did you look here? https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/4.8Well, the first official preview of 4.8 is not released yet, so maybe they'll still add it.It's really annoying because the changes for ovr linux support are apparently relatively small: https://github.com/3dluvr/UnrealEngine/commits/4.7-linux-ovr
I haven't been yet and I'm still saving up for a trip but Thailand is well known for the abundance and quality of tropical fruits like durian, mangosteen, jackfruit, mango, rambutan, lychee, bananas, etc. Should be easy as well to find plenty of rice based dishes that are vegan. Not sure if people surf there but there's plenty of ocean coastline so I would imagine there's good surfing somewhere.
I thought it was pretty relevant since Chip and Belichick are pretty close... Hell Ozzie Newsome gets my vote for the best GM in the league. I was honestly just mentioning another coach/GM, would have mentioned Belichick regardless of which team he was coaching. ^^^^Except ^^^^for ^^^^the ^^^^Steelers... ^^^^I ^^^^fucking ^^^^hate ^^^^the ^^^^Steelers...
I would choose the plane crash scene (The one with Walt in his pink sweater) which ties the black and white scenes together.I also think the Fly episode as a whole is fun to analyze. I believe the fly is supposed to represent Walt's guilt. To me it explains his irrational behavior in the episode.
Right now, I have a bubblegum that is so spot on it makes me grind my teeth while I vape it.  Tho my regular all day is a mix of berries (heavy on the raspberry) and vanilla creams.  Good call on the locked up at work!  
What I have found from playing 300+ games of Uther is that most of these people just need a little direction. Ping the map when you want them to do something, ask them to group up, etc. Other than that, just do your best to shield and heal them even when they go full retard.
From my experience, to find a job in a relatively specific area like that you would want to supplement your education with an internship. If you can't find an internship, you would want to supplement with your own projects geared toward that.  There should be a web development and a database class. I took the database class, it will give you a very solid understanding of databases to get you started. Can't speak about the web dev. class with certainty but I think they cover javascript and php and get into jquery. 
Marcus Smith, Trading Foles for an injury prone QB Bradford, at the same time giving away picks, Tebow and not getting Mariotta. Chip is really not a good personnel guy.

I am (happily) not a lawyer, so I'm not aware of the finer points of contract law.  Their counter offer may very well be what pushes this from shady to illegal.  I don't know.That said, I probably would have walked out if they tried to change the deal after it was agreed upon, too.
Are you trying to remove it from within manjaro or are you using a live cd? Explain the situation a little better. Why are you removing manjaro? Edit: as in are you looking to install something else. 
Brunhilda - a steatoda, otherwise known as one of the dreaded, but in reality harmless, false widows.  The media has created a witch hunt to make themselves relevant.  The spider's bite could hurt like the dickens, but ultimately wouldn't cause any permanent harm.  It's unlikely to bite in the first place.
I dont see a gut. I see a barrel chest and rib cage. I suppose its possible he's overweight, but my girl has the exact same body shape and she's in no way overweight.
Awesome, thanks everybody! I like having buddies over for BBQ's and to watch UFC/Fight Nights. We regularly play stuff like Street Fighter or Mortal Combat which are a blast, hoping some 4 player local games will be even more fun :) I'll certainly take a look and try out the suggestions so far. 
My 7th grade english teacher told the principal that I was a nigger lover because I defended my reading of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" for a book report project.  I was sitting right next to the principal's office door and heard her say it clearly.  
Kudos to you, MycTyson. I really like the fact that this sub focuses on mushroom cultivation in a higher level sense. It is obvious that almost all the players on here are familiar with actives and are not ashamed about it, but nonetheless I find the discretion and restraint exercised on this sub to be commendable. There are so many people who have much to contribute out there, but would never fit in or even want to be part of /r/shroomers or the Shroomery for instance. I guess I'm saying that there is a unique overlap between both communities here and that is what makes this sub special. Still learning so I don't post much, but I've been lurking and really enjoying all the content so far.
I've been paying monthly since premium launched (or maybe a month or two in?) rather than yearly simply because I want them to take more of my money. We recently picked up a second subscription for the house too. The quality and integrity of the work they do should be rewarded. 
Be careful not to get caught up on any one girl. This girl is taken. I know local comicons have "geek speed dating", and it sounds like that aligns with your interests.In short: put yourself out there and try to meet people who have similar interests. Meeting new friends (guys) will help your confidence and self image.
This is my issue. I feel like everyone who voted for it are missing out on what was one of the best aspects of RuneScape: Bank sales and Forum Trading. The joy of finding someone to buy your wares and/or finding someone selling what you want is underappreciated here.
Yeah i remember that. Man watching those guys age in the ring just hits home the reality of growing old. They used to be so athletic, Undertaker was athletic far longer though.
Been a little over half a year and I've only just broken even on the expenses this year. :P I'm still quite a bit in the hole from my tools and material purchases last year.
Do you plan on never aging, or just relying on plastic surgery to maintain the physical status quo? Your body will change, your breasts will sag, you will get wrinkles and crow's feet. Best-case scenario is your breasts have sagged because you're providing nourishment for your child, and the lines on your face will be laugh lines instead of frown lines. I, too, worry about your attitude towards your body and relationship affecting your child.
Thanks everyone for the comments and the help! Your willingness to give me some insight about the game and enthusiasm is great! I'm going to jump in and enjoy the game like all of you have. Thanks for being an awesome community. 
Received 6 emails for shipment received. These were shipped out Monday so they probably received it either yesterday or today. 5 ZTE Valet and 1 Alcatel C1 (not sure why they didn't receive the 2nd Alcatel C1 as I shipped all 7 on the same day). These 6 devices are brand new condition (Valets are reconditioned) and there's absolutely nothing is wrong with any of them. I better get the full amount of these (I highly doubt I will).Also, the 5 ZTE Source that I shipped last week has no update yet.
[](/twiponder) Fore some reason I think that J. K. Rowling would write a good MLP episode, even though I do not think she is that good of a writer. But she knows how to write for young people and make it entertaining to the adults too, and also her books share some morals with the show, so that could be interesting.
I'm watching her video where she explains it and damn she wears SO MUCH BLUSH. The island look fits her better.Also, how is making a living out of horse racing blue collar and not no collar?
I mean...it certainly would be very weird to see a Halo character in Smash.But, if they could make a really good moveset and make him fit as much as possible...I wouldn't mind too much.
&gt;On a brighter note, I think these stories make us better people. All the humility and shame, breaks down your ego, you know?No, I dont think so.  Maybe yr exp. of those differs from my exp. of those, but for me, they just reaffirm and reinforce my engagement w/ the fearful distortion of life I constantly find myself uncontrollably constructing.  and i just try to hide from it, but attempts at hiding have been accounted for, in my construction, and counter measures have been designed.So no, i don't think negativity coming from yr own system of entrapment can lead to growth.  but i might b misinterpreing yr words.
All of Hawaii is beautiful and much of it "lush," but we're the only "Garden Isle!" Our east and north sides are the most green and the south and west the most brown (as are all of the islands due to the prevailing NE trade winds). Not sure why- possibly our mountains rise more steeply from the coast causing immediate orographic lift and reaching the dew point more rapidly as compared with the Big Isle or Maui where the lift may be more gradual? Being at a slightly more northern latitude causing more mixing of warm and cold air? Having its high point in the center of the island so that we receive rail coming from every direction? Combination of all of the above? Doesn't really matter too much to me as I look out of my classroom window (Kapaa High School) and see the bright sunny sky and the waves off in the distance. All I know for sure is that I'm grateful to call Kauai home for the last 20 years and hope to for 20 more! Aloha!
I totally agree. It's time to switch counselors for sure.  I promise you, no feels or ill will, will be had by anybody.  This is a very common thing to happen at a methadone clinic. :)
I think Moonkins have the most fun on any fight with more than one target. Bethilac was probably my favourite, and Ryolith wouldn't allow me to be below top DPS.
I started thinking the Jags were gonna do something stupid and draft a WR. I'm glad they went with Fowler, I think it's a great pick. He's gonna be really good in a couple years.
You don't spend 25mil for someone with potential and nothing else. I dont' think we expected him to be Hazard level in his first season, but no one spends 25mil for a youngish player who can't even nail down a starting spot. We wouldn't pay 25mil for Towsend and he's english.Lamela's the kind of player who could find his feet and really capture his potential in the space of a season, but the chances of that are pretty slim and like /u/straplessbrad said, if we get something in the vicinity of 20mil for him you gotta take that. It's effectively giving us an insurance policy on that transfer.
&gt;Ah but now you dropped solely, you are saying something different now. Work your shit out.You aren't comprehending. Solely not being the only 'trait' in the law, but solely meaning that an employer can't fire you "solely" because of your sexual orientation (along with other protected immutable traits). &gt;I'm bisexual and currently dating a guy and if anything it affected work more when I was dating a female.Cool. http://www.bna.com/lgbt-minorities-face-high-unemployment-job-discrimination-low-wages-study-finds/&gt;So the US passed straight/white/majority discrimination laws?You don't seem to be understanding this point. It adds sexual orientation as a protected class (in certain respects). Heterosexuality is a sexual orientation. &gt;See the problem here is "cause of action". What is that? What does that entail?It entitles you to file a legal complaint. It will be dropped if it has no merit and you will be charged a lot of money in attorney and filing fees. 
I don't believe in the Sub/Ob division of "reality."That division is, itself, "subjective."I will say this: a normal person will have an empathetic burst of 'ill-ease' when witnessing something that we would call 'bad.' People who do not have this sympathetic reaction are 'psychopaths' and do not count as human cognitively. Even a psychopath knows when they've done something wrong. They simply don't feel bad about it. Which is what makes them inhuman.You *know* when you've done something bad. Everyone knows.I don't buy this pure logic "I'z totes Vulcanz" bullshit.
SMS is better than nothing but I'd rather have something based on crypto rather than "trusted" channels like SMS. It's possible (difficult, but possible) to eavesdrop on SMS.
For real. I didn't really follow him, I'll be honest. I heard all the talk about deflected passes and shit. About 10 of the 18 were thrown directly into the gut of a zone defender.
Update: VLC for iOS handles .m3u files well, so as a temporary fix, using .m3us works for me :DActually I feel like this needs further explanation.  So if I have files file1.ogg, file2.ogg, and file3.ogg, I would also have something like an oggplaylist.m3u, which contains literally the following    file1.ogg    file3.ogg    file2.oggWhen I point my VLC for iOS under Network Stream to http://192.168.0.50:8080/oggplaylist.m3u, VLC for iOS plays, in sequence, file1.ogg, file3.ogg, then file2.ogg
The story and characters will differ completely and supposedly even the versions will play differently from a tactics standpoint.  So that's quite different than Pokemon.  Plus, everything confirmed is true for Japan only till proven otherwise since they are getting it much earlier than everyone else.  
All he said was that people should have a good standard of living. Everyone except sadists agrees that everyone should have good standard of living. The only question is how to achieve it.
Decent if you're still in the experimenting phase, where you don't know what kind of look you want to commit to. However it's a poor investment in the long run. 1 or 2 pairs of nice pants is much smarter than having to rebuy some $25 pairs over and over again. Never been a massive fan of fast fashion chains since there's little to no innovation. Its just watered down version of whatever's trendy. imo you can't be anti-PacSun but still be a fan of H&amp;M or Uniqlo.

He was phenomenal in that series. He shut down Ovi and Backstrom and essentially forced the caps to rely on third and fourth line scoring to get it done. He (and Halak) were pretty much the only two players keeps the Islanders alive in game seven. His stock is super high in my book

Seriously, I genuinely don't understand these people that get rid of their pets after they have kids. My parents had a cat before they had me. That cat was POSSESSIVE of me, sat on top of my stroller, and loved me. And of course my parents taught me not to be abusive toward her because... that's a good life lesson? These people utterly baffle me.
This change is going to be with us for a while, you don't want to half ass it.I think we should just make Australia change their flag, we had ours first.
Well... she's  just the opinion of one chick out of half the population. Some chicks like it, some chicks don't. It's gonna be 50/50 any way you try and swing it. 
Well, from my perspective, the larger priority isn't so much balance in representation, but whether this is what people want. Even if the result is an imbalance in media, I'd have to argue that it seems women are getting what they want more often than not, so I don't really see a problem.Besides that, regardless of whether the aggregate pass/fail results for the test show anything useful, I was originally posting from a technical perspective to show that maybe the design of the test could use a little work.
I have the Terpz brand enail.  Loving it for the $250 or whatever it cost.  If you don't mind analog you can get the 710whip for $150 or so.  I had that too, but digital was nice so I sold it. 
What would you consider low end in this situation? I'ved noticed pretty much all bikes in the ~$500 range have "lower end" (I guess?) suntour forks. So are you pretty much saying you shouldn't buy a bike unless you're spending closer to $1000 on itNot trying to sound like a jerk/idiot...it's a legit question.
In WWE's Music DVD from a few years ago Jim Johnston said that Rock's theme has always been nearly the same from rocky Maivia all the way to his current, it's just been changed to sound a bit differently.
You kind of come off as a lone wolf. What kind of shit do you like to do that a potential love interest can partake in? You can even put some clichés as a conversation starter. For example, "I've been to country X. While there i saw (insert tourist attraction). It was amazing! I'd really like to visit country Y some day in order to see (insert tourist attraction here)" then when someone reads your profile they have something to connect with. 
That's the thing, when it comes to Anti-SJ and the different forms it takes, they've done nothing but prove they're just trying to justify literally anything they do. "True" Justice? "True" Equality? Men's Rights? Ethics in Journalism? All a crock of shit. All they really care about it being pseudo-edgy shitheels and justifying/trivializing it afterwards.
I bought a Sandisc 32gb class 10 card last year for my S4, and it worked for like a month. Then it was unusable, not even being read by my PC. I just sent it back to be replaced, as that has been a common problem. I just bought a 64gb sammy class 10 card for $22, and it's been working good for my S4. Just stick with a Sammy card.

&gt; Even Harry Potter book fans bitched about every divergence in each of the Harry Potter movies.The HP fandom is the only one I've seen that was a bad about differences (and as whiny about it) as the ASOIAF community, which is saying something because that one was composed primarily of children and adolescents.

To add to this, our biggest problem today is that we very rarely discuss issues across ideological lines. Words like "socialism," "conservatism," "capitalism," "libertarian," etc. mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Theoretically that's a great thing when it comes to policy discussions because it allows us to tackle problems from a variety of perspectives. Sadly we often view politics as the battle of ideologies rather than attempts to solve problems together. Ideologies are big, abstract, and general things. All too often we get lost in considering what policy is socialist or conservative or whatnot instead of actually looking of the policy is going to fix the problem in an effective manner. Yes, you can and should work from a set of principles, but all too often we forget that our aim is solutions, and we hold the principles we do because we think they will lead to the best solutions.
Raiders aren't gonna let Cooper slide especially with Carr at QB, that will be a deadly combination. Williams will probably go to the Skins and I doubt anyone is gonna trade up for a RB in this draft.
Cant post jag code. And if you did it would expire by the time any turk got around to it.And i was thinking keep bank locked, just have them power lvl wc or mining or something :PNot something Id do, its a terrible idea, but I was just curious.
Again, there's nothing confirmed that we offered them anything...just a bunch of rumor and heresy. I don't think Chip would be that stupid to offer those trades...he even said he wasn't that stupid explicitly, and yet still the rumors abounded.
I can't tell if you are joking or not.  If you are joking, then I would say "haha yeah, NGE is totally ripping off of FMA."  If you are not, then I should correct you because NGE came out almost 10 years before FMA, so I don't think it NGE could reference something that hadn't even come out yet.  Also, that symbol is called "The Tree of Life" and is a Hebrew symbol as described [here on the Evageeks Wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Tree_of_Life), so it is actually a reference to a real thing.
Wait, what about a family protection act? If human beings are acting like loud fucks it shouldn't matter how old they are, loud is loud (and kid loud is ESPECIALLY loud.)
Oob is the ultimate prodigy. He has the strength of Majin Boo with no training whatsoever, far suppressing anyone's potential. FRIEZA was a prodigy of his own, who also had no training, relying on pure natural talent instead, had the strength of a Super Saiyan, and with little training was able to stand toe to toe with ascended God form Goku. Oob, being an order of magnitude more powerful than prime Namek saga Frieza, is on a whole new tier of potential compared to Frieza.
Titan vs. LC: I really don't believe in Snakeskin. It seems like if Titan bans out Tyr (which they probably will) he's going to really struggle in lane especially against someone like Confrey.C9 vs. Denial: I'd be very surprised if this game didn't go 2-0 in C9's favor. Apparently they've been on a grind since not making it to LAN, and since Denial doesn't even have anywhere close to the amount of practice working as a team as C9 does I think it's going to be a pretty clear victory.
Lol, I know that. I wasn't talking about the fee. I'm well aware HR 4 can do some HR 7 quests, if not most of them. I'm also aware of the refund once you cancel quests. Its not the money that bothers me. Its the people buying the second quest literally right after I buy the initial quest, which in MY experience at least, is usually what hunters go on, in a sprt of first come first serve manner. That is of the lobby leader isn't already buying them, as per ettiquete, their lobby, they choose the quest.
I was *really* hoping for mainhand focus, where the mesmer summons illusionary weapons to strike with instead of striking with real ones.I suppose *another* offhand is fine too...
I hear you, but it can still be a little exasperating when you first start reading contemporary research papers. Sure, it might be simple for the ten people on earth who work in the area that the paper is aimed at, but as an undergrad trying to grind through it...It's something you get used to I guess. 
How do you give him that gr8 theme but drop the gimmick so hard. The mocking would probably be nice occasionally but not like how they're using it already.
well i guess thats the thing. I dont low ball, like i said, im not pros like you guys. if the deal is there i take it. i might ask for 5-10 dollars off for the psychology of it but i never undercut by over 30%.secondly, I update the ad so I can have proof that I am a safe seller. I always post "please search for my posts" and it puts people at ease. I've found it to ease the nerves of people.
First few picks are most of the time...it's about to start going to shit soon.  Leo will go 4, then who knows tbh I really hope Chicago doesn't get Cooper.  Ugh I'd be pissed.  And I hope white busts if they get him.  But if they're smart, they'll go defense

How is this a matter of greed?  An oversight by the Council perhaps, but are you really suggesting that the Council, Chorus and the ISPs all sat down in some sort of shadowy board room and decided to fuck with the poor and elderly by providing them with a high-end product that many people would willingly pay extra for?

We aren't getting a new era in DLC, if it was something they could do in the month and a half it takes to put out a map pack don't you think they'd have just done it by launch?Maybe planets from the new movies, but even then I'd rather they not blow all the dlc on the new movie so we actually have something to look forward to when the new Era battlefront gets released with the whole trilogies worth of battles.My money is on Yavin, and Lothal as DLC planets

having read the book twice and watched the movie a number of times, it does it plenty of justice and the book gave me the same treatment as the movie did. I can understand not liking it at first because there was so much in the book I wanted to be in the film, (going to vegas, hawaii, etc.) but repeat viewings made me realize it's bound to become a cult classic in the future.

Thanks for your input! I have been reflecting on my study habits between my different classes recently and I know that I should have done more practice problems throughout the term - especially since there was little to no homework formally assigned in the two courses that I didn't do too great in. I kinda wish that I knew this at the beginning of the year, but I guess that was part of the first year learning process :)
Nah, it's just people learning from mistakes, nothing wrong with thatYes we should forgive Steam and give it its right praises, but we should *not forget* what was donePlus, what's wrong with putting eggs into more than just one basket? A basket that's even DRM free 
I know that. But that doesn't change the fact that he was very raw and didn't get that much interest from other big time programs. He barely played as a freshman and had to be developed 
Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for your help . I have an MBUS front sight so it seems kinda silly to me now to get an FSB just for the bayonet lug that I probably wont ever use. 
I'm not a teacher, but this happened to another student I know in my economics class. We were all working on our worksheets, then, out of the blue, my teachers ask the girl "are you a cutter? Is that why you wear long sleeves?" It was so offensive and uncalled for. Many students began to defend her and he shrugged it off as if it had no impact. 
The problem is by having a 100% cap, but allowing everyone to constantly gain ATB it goes from free-flowing attack as you get ATB into 'rounds' ordered by your speed.As a mechanic the way it's implemented is really braindead.  It'd be a lot better if it figured out who is next, how long it would take them, and then everyone else gets their speed * that amount of time.  If someone else is at 100%, nobody gains anything.
In Ontario salaried employees are legally required to be paid for overtime or get it in lieu (based on the equivalent hourly rate of what the job contract hours/week is) unless they are managers or certain professions. I've had a few salaried jobs and I have always gotten overtime pay (and it's 1.5 after a certain number of hours). 
That would be because it would be all about turning your respective countries into so much radioactive black glass. You do great with your geopolitical bullying until the threat of a big firework is known. 
My department has hired from it before. I've gotten about 3 messages from recruiters a year since I've started working and using it.Your mileage will vary depending on what you can put on it.   Recruiters are looking for people with a skill set for their client. If you don't have that skill you won't get messages.  It's not a tool  for people without experience
That seems unlikely to me. Do you have a source?If the minimum accuracy of the barge's GPS is 3m and the accuracy of the stage's landing is ~10m that means it could easily be off by 13m in any direction. It seems likely that the barge and rocket ping each other to get a much more accurate relative location. Such systems are cheap (off the shelf) and lightweight.
Before the French flag joke shows up: a Japanese guy could just draw a red dot in the middle of the flag and claim the Moon for Japan. Then the US would have to drop an atomic bomb on the moon to get it back I suppose. 
I think he re-signs in Detroit, but those aren't bullshit reasons. I mean, connections are a huge part of getting any job. Doubly so in hockey. And Nicholson and Babcock absolutely have a connection. Hell, that's a huge reason Chiarelli is in Edmonton after 9 days of unemployment. And wasn't a small part of the St. Louis trade because he needed to spend time with his dying mother in Connecticut? Nobody thinks it's conclusive, but it's far from a horseshit reason.
Actually, the ancestors of the Greenlandic Inuit, the Thule, arrived in Greenland well after the Vikings. The  Viking discovery of Greenland occurred in  AD 986 and the Thule migrated into Greenland about 300 years later, around AD 1300. However, the now extinct Palaeo-Eskimos arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. They disappeared from across the Arctic around AD 1000 as they were displaced by the Inuit.Edit: grammar
Agree on the diversity point whole heartedly. I just cannot wrap my head around how anybody can say they are a wrestling fan and actually WATCH LU more than one episode and then say LU doesnt work for them. I'd like to hear your reasoning. 
When you said "deep voice" I knew exactly who you were talking about!  Budapest popped up on a playlist I subscribe to and I really liked it.  Turns out he was opening for a show I already had tickets to, and when he walked out I thought it was the sound check guy because I was expecting a 30 year old bearded hipster.
Confessions:- I initially hated Robin and Lucina because 'Who even cares about Fire Emblem'. I quickly took that back after watching a Let's Play on it and playing as Robin and Lucina- I also initially hated Palutena because of her 'god powers' I assumed she was gonna be OP and broken beyond belief. I also took that back after watching Chuggaa's Let's Play of KI:U. And by Chapter 8 of his videos I really regretted hating her.- I didn't think Pac Man would be interesting until I played him- I actually like using Final Smashes- I actually don't think Dark Pit being a carbon copy of Pit is a bad thing since it's actually canonical
When they thought Iranians would support their cult. When they had to pay foreigners to attend their rallies. When they had to conjure bullshit claims about Iran's nuclear program to remain relevant to the US and Israel.
It's not selfish. That's the number one reason I will vote for presidential candidates. I don't agree with any of their policies in general, but I would like my life to get better at least.
Mortal kombat is still on the simple end of fighting games, at least mechanically. Games like guilty gear have characters with more special moves than MK characters have strings, Marvel vs capcom expects you to learn 3 characters and how they work together. look at this system list http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=Guilty_Gear_Xrd_-SIGN-  Guilty gear is a game where you can cancel any move at any time with a single button, this greats A LOT of depth. And once you've gotten that deep Mk is shallow in comparison, but i feel the varations make up for that. People have been playing fighting games for a long time, and a lot of skill transfer over. My years of street fighter made me a intermedait smash bros player the second I grabbed the controller, so for some people getting it down isn't as hard because of years of dealing with similar things.

Holy crap, you remind me of how I played on my first 1CC: really aggressive stages 1 and 2. You're a bit worse at getting to the POC, but a crapload better at bombing. You missed some great POC opportunities in Stages 2 and 4, but at that point it wasn't essential to your survival, so it really doesn't matter. Also, on Misdirection, you didn't have to stay on one side, but switching sides hasn't worked for me lately, so I suppose you found the better tactic for now. Good job on Remilia, though.If you're anything like me (which I highly suspect), PCB will be somewhat easy, IN will be about the same, (let's ignore PoFV), and MoF will be really easy, and you'll get stuck on SA. That's how it went down for me.
Grill marks make sense on a steak cooked on an open grill e.g. charcoal, but if you're using a pan ditch the fake grill pan and sear in a regular pan. This way you maximize the delicious maillard reaction.
I get to the park about an hour early for our shift every day, just so I can sit alone in the stadium and watch workouts, so I've had a few. I had a chat with Tommy Hunter while we watched Chris Davis smash BP homers the other day, and ran into Rick Dempsey on his way to the booth on another. This is my first year with the team, so I plan to have many more!
Or go for an LLM, or a doctorate in your useless undergrad degree. You might never get out of debt, but people will have to call you doctor. technically.
I dont think the Rangers will move Talbot until the deadline or possibly hold onto him until he hits UFA. They're contending and are in no hurry to get rid of Lundqvist's insurance. If possible I'd like to get both. 
If I was at the game, I likely would have boo'd.  I would have thought twice about it later, but it's pretty tough not to be pissed off at Wilmer right now for fucking us over in such a critical game against our rival.
I'll definitely see if I can get the car inspected by a local mechanic, hopefully the dealer will allow me to do so. Also thanks for the advice and I'm sure I'll love owning one, ill post again if I do end up buying the car
just recently moved to Burlington, VT where Sanders began his political career as mayor, and he is hailed as a god around here. really cool progressive guy though. 
My older brother committed suicide two months before yours. I've only had two dreams about him; in the first, it was Christmas exactly like when I was a kid. The excitement waking me up at 4am just to look at presents for four hours until my parents woke, the smells, the snow lightly falling. My big brother was standing in front of the Christmas tree with an emerald dress (imagine the Queen's dress in the Silver Chair, BBC version). In the second dream, he had faked his death to get out of student loans and had come back to see me. It was a terrible mixture of fury directed at him for faking suicide and the most incredible relief I have ever felt. I have yet to dream about my little brother's suicide (3/9/14). 
I mean, there's clearly contact there, but also a bit of flopping. It's the playoffs, it gets chippy. Should've been called as a foul. It's blatant players are getting under each other's skin all series. It's unnecessary and should be punished, but it's playoff basketball. I just think the whole tackling a player into the first row at home is exponentially worse.  
After Calgary gets hammered by Anaheim I suspect Anaheim fans will look [like this](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/de/de0d49c2382968aae63704bfdd8ee19ffdc60d4173bfd320a569d16c23229f50.jpg) when trying to get people to hop in the bandwagon 
I pick 33. Old enough to know better, but young enough not to care. And I like to bet my age in roulette and that was still on the board. I would have moved out of phoenix earlier, but generally prefer not to want to change decisions because it is all a series of events that lead to my life now and it ain't so bad. 
I let my mouse free roam around the End Table and couch arm; he would normally not be able to go anywhere from there except this time I had forgotten I had a blanket up against the side and he crawled down. Just don't be stupid like me; keep your rats barricaded, even though it's super satisfying to have them be so tame they won't run away :c
Right. In a certain sense they are *infinitely* different; velocity is not really the "natural" way to parameterize reference frames, which is done with something called the *boost parameter*. The boost parameter to get to c is infinity, and the boost parameter to get to 0.999 999 999 999 999 999 999 9951c is a boost parameter of a little over 27. The time dilation factor is 3.1 x 10^(11).Yes, it is at rest in its own reference frame, as anything is. And photons do not have reference frames, because there's no frame in which they are at rest. The math for viewing things in rest frames breaks down when you try to apply it to things moving at the speed of light.
I know I should be used to it by now, and I shouldn't feel so offended by it but I still get irrationally pissed off when waitstaff try to give me English menus and suchWent to a sushi place last night, the woman working there led me to the seat, and then reached over and turned the iPad ordering thing into English... I then instantly sat down and turned it back to Japanese. I knew she was going to change it too. I know she's just trying to be helpful, but it still pisses me off every time.EDIT: Also, there was a vibrator behind my bike in my apartment's bike parking lot. I'm not even mad, just wondering what the hell was going on in the bike parking lot. 
Probably depends on where you live but in the U.S. it's the freedom to walk, or drive, or hang out without being hassled by the police. Generational benefits also grant both income and a better chance for a good education. On the other side of the coin, we bleed when cut, cry when hurt and sometimes are able to look deeper into other cultures and see their struggles.
Caring happensIt just doesEgo is forced into anUnsustainable positionLike a cornered animalAll conceptualizations witheredPutrefiedNot solvingNot dissolvingAnythingEverAnd then(Which is another nameFor now)Love happensIt just doesDon´t beat yourself too hard. I avidly follow Mooji´s every step also (I hesitated [ego] to even answer woo since I seem to be in a sort of lurker period, but well), and the ego is there even on sages. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ew4ysq53mI) could both prove and ´unprove´ that Mooji has and has not ego, kinda like they used the bible to both justify and deny slavery.But (like he himself says) I will keep quiet about these things with the ´uninitiated´. ´You´ may accept the truth that there is ego even on saints, ´others´ may accept the truth that you get to a point where there is no ego. They are concepts, allowed by love. TLDR; Love is the answer to everything. 
Haha that's funny. The only things we have come up with is Kevin Bacon, Nathanial Bacon, Alexander Hamlet, Piggy Smalls, or Swaggy Pig. None are that great... 
"Yo...Bruce...Ima let you finish... But first... My gal Beyoncé had the BEST dick out there!

In fact, if he didn't have such an ugly ego, I think I'd really like Kanye; I just cannot get past a man who believes no one is capable of giving him constructive criticism on his music or recently, his poor choice in business ventures...

Some additional thoughts:1. Electrics.  If you have children, consider upgrading your electrics.  This gets you an 'RCA' box which trips instantly if there's any current leak to ground.  You might also need a new electrical wire if you want to install an electric oven.  This can cost around £1000.2. Will you want new carpets?  Or at least clean the existing ones?  You can rent a wet vacuum for £50, or get someone else to do it for £100+.  Worth sorting out before you put all the heavy furniture down!3. Upgrade to double glazing?4. Replace the old water tank etc with a combi boiler?
Do you wanna know what cured my crippling gender dysphoria, which was so bad I craved death daily? I'll give you a hint: it starts with 't' and ends in 'ransitioning'.
Thanks, brother. I'm such a huge fan of TDWP, and so I just like to support their stuff whenever possible. I just happened to have bought the vinyl earlier that night because I saw it on their merch table, and I am one of those guys who just sits and waits for the crowd to disperse so I don't have to deal with all of the people leaving, so I was just sitting there waiting and saw Mike come out, so I went for it!He really is such a cool guy. We talked for a moment about living in Japan, he said he wants to do more gigs out there, which I think would be awesome!Oh, and if you were wondering, I had him sign it on the flipped side, not the side you'd play the record on haha
Looks like the Jacksonville Faguars won't be scoring any points for another season. I'll be looking forward to playing whichever defense plays them on my fantasy team YET AGAIN.
The source video posted above doesn't show his face or seem to confirm he is actually alive (his voice could be dubbed), but it is even more disgusting than the gif so you should check it out.
No. Then the reviewer could point to specific claims not backed by facts. In no way can they malign the authors by suggesting that their gender is somehow impacting on how they interpreted the data and that the best recourse would be to bring some men on to help.
Fight was an exhibition between [Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali) and a young [Michael Dokes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dokes). Here's the full fight, including a short interview with Ali at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxljffDkH5k
Not sure what this means. All I want to know is if the watch serves as the receiver and takes data directly from the gray thing stuck to your side. I would actually hope that the watch end was open to competition and could be any number of watches. What exactly are you saying this means? Do you still have to have the dexcom receiver with you all the time, or can you go around with just a watch and the transmitter? This is what I want to get a clear picture of. I don't care who I pay as long as I get a watch with no other junk required except the transmitter and sensor stuck to/in my side.
Pompey has been my biggest disappointment, he's struggling hard at the plate, and has made some crucial errors in the field. I don't think we will be a successful team if he's up all year.
Not that he said it was a, but what's so bad about a sleeve as a goal? They're expensive, time-consuming, and usually take some thought. Edit: Spelling
If you're playing hungry dragon without a semi-sure way of dealing with up to 3 health, you're just hoping that you get lucky.  Imo, it's a poor play to play hungry dragon by itself unless you're very ahead or very behind.
i also like that about FH. but one of the things i like about AHs videos is that they are so long. i have basically stopped watching TV because i get plenty of entertainment from AH. there are still a few shows i enjoy, but RT/AH has taken over the majority of my media consumption, and i am happy about that.
Alright, so we appear to have hit a dead end. We're going to start making a video that will summarise everything we presently know in a few days. It'll probably be posted in 1-3 weeks. This one won't be a text update because we understand how boring they can get. We're also going to try to analyse the last two videos as much as possible. Thanks for your patience in this matter, we're hoping something good comes up soon.
&gt; Real condolences are private and are delivered in person or over a phone call, even a text message is acceptable.I have family that lives over 4000 miles away. It would be extremely costly for them to travel all the way here for my funeral, were I to die today. Posting a message of condolence on Facebook would unite them with the rest of my grieving family and show that they are still a part of the family even though they are far away.Also, I have friends that live some hundreds of miles away that I have not seen in years. I may not have their parents' numbers, if I've even met them, but I still may wish to express my condolences without going to the funeral.Don't you think it would be rude if everyone kept scrolling after someone posted that their loved one had died? It would seem to the person maintaining the FB page that their loved one had been lonely and friendless.
Confirming mage works wellI did this and my chugga died turn 3. Ended up winning by duplicating mirror image twice. I didn't even draw ooze, water elemental! Thanks man!
I totally get and agree with your point but the lion example was taken way further than it needed to be. If the kid's walking to his friend's house (as he should be able to) and he gets nabbed by a lion, that's a much more comparable example to what we're talking about here. Most women who are gang raped by strangers on the street weren't walking 2 miles to get water for their families - they were just walking to a friend's house, or to work, or some other innocuous activity that anybody should expect to be able to do without being gang raped.
Great thing about the Conda is you can get these type of results almost anywhere in the Galaxy.  I have 21LY jump loaded with 452 and routinely hit 600K per stop.  I have moved around alot as I pull out as soon as the market drops below 550K per stop.  Thrudd's and TradeDangerously will provide enough potential runs too stay in the 6M+ per hour range with no problems.
I should say 80-100 is the goal for the first 8 or so months, rather than recruiting huge amounts on the first day of a campaign. As with any focus in XCOM it's affected by the research tree I'm pursuing and how quickly I expand to other continents. Generally I'll camp one continent with 4 or 5 interceptors for a long time, and strictly focus research on beam and aerospace, with minimal foundry projects and usually 2 SHIVs to help carry squads.
Is your use of comedians in your casts a habit or a preference? Bill Burr may be one of the best in the business at the moment, and I'd love to hear why you find them worth the dramatic roles you've written for them. Thanks!

Marriage isn't a religious institution, that'd the fallacy with the gay marriage argument. If marriage were a religious institution then it wouldn't be seen across such a wide array of cultures. 
I could write volumes on these issues but they would fall upon ears that have been conditioned not to listen. :(It boils down to:Until Joe Average loses all their consumer junk (I.E. their "investment" in the system), and liberties, there will be no uprising.When that time arrives it will be far too late.Generation by generation they increment stronger controls in your lives, lessen your "freedom", change what you eat into garbage unfit for consumption, etc ad infinitum.I'm shocked by what people are willing to accept today and you will be shocked by what your children will accept.The most unfortunate part is that those in control have patience and long term planning, they have played this game for centuries, and they know, proven by history, what they can and cannot do to their cattle.  :(
There isn't one simple answer to this. inconsistency can have a lot of reasons. Couple of pointers: * Look at your demo's and have a close look, don't look at your highlights. Look at the whole demo and take it slow, look at your actions and decisions. Have a look at the information that you got. * Crosshair placement. This is very very important, just in case you have not seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mvXfnY8wU), do watch it. This  should help you an insane amount. * [Corners &amp; perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk) * Play more! Really, if you aren't playing well - do not lose motivating. Just keep it up. 
And that is what they are for, all I mean is that people should learn to defend their lives without a gun as it wont always be there or practical to use. And I just firmly believe that if a situation doesn't need a gun involved by no means should one be introduced, don't get me wrong I am also a firm believer in CCW sometimes i just wonder if there shouldn't be a more rigorous training for getting out of situations without ever needed your weapon before you can be licensed to carry.   
OK, the Squire Classic Vibe is actually a good guitar? I see this everywhere but..... Just..... SQUIRE!! they have one at my local shop for 370, should I pick it up?

I'm not seeing any either, apart from the paint sets with bundled brushes.It's possible that they are revamping them yet again, although they seem to do it every two years.  Maybe they had to switch brush manufacturers again?
I hope it's what speeds he says he gets. For me, I have 300/20. It sometimes dips but I'm not getting throttled by Time Warner. Hell, I even torrented (not pirated) a super mario galaxy disc image for emulation and got no throttle from them.

I have small scars on my arms, chest, and upper back mostly. It's almost all self inflicted, something I very recently found out is called Trichotillomania. I do it mostly if i see an irregular mark or spot, nervousness, and because it strangely feels good to pick my skin and scabs/cuts.

If it details the post 1613 name then it certainly does use Londonderry. If you want the map to use Doire then you should also object to just about every one of the counties shown for Ireland as they are post Norman inventions.

Yeah. I want to know if you select the Lightning Rune and make your whirlwind deal Lightning Damage, will Skull grasp increase this whirlwind damage to 700%+ Weapon Damage as Lightning, and thus will CoE then buff up the weapon damage as lightning portion during COE: Lightning rotation, while also buffing Dust Devils during the COE: Physical rotation. If it worked that way, I think it would be a decent synergy to get as much use out of COE as possible.So this setup:Whirlwind: Lightning  ( Dust Devils : Physical )Rend : ColdOverpower : Fire So that *Something* is *always* being buffed by CoE instead of how most barbs run it, only getting burst 1/3 of the time by relying on Physical.
Wow your life sounds amazing.  I legit had a smile reading through this post.  Thank you for your advice.  It's funny because I've read an article today and it had the quote, "not all who wander are lost."  I think it's a fulfilling thing to move from career to career since people do change and their dreams change as well.  I wish I can make the most of life like you have.  Stay awesome and thanks again : )EDIT: The article I read was about a woman who quit her 90k paying job to scoop ice cream in an island and she's thinking about doing other things in life.  I thought this relevance was pretty cool.  She seemed super happy as well : )

I've had panama red awhile back. I actually was trying to buy wholesale from them for months, and they never replied to my emails, and then finally said they were going under. Here are my thoughts: * I do think they used white vinegar.  * Scotch bonnets and habaneros would both work, but scotch bonnets would actually be closer I think. * You are correct, I think they use ground yellow mustard seed, not prepared mustard. I'd suggest using a lot.Also, two sauces you might consider as replacements are Howler Monkey Red (nearly the same ingredients), and Lotties, which is a Barbados Style mustardy hot sauce (which I actually prefer over panama red, but thats just me).Good luck!
I think he meant people make under 30k a year(USD). I agree with his main point. Go to college, major in something employable and spend less than you earn. Everyone(Mentally handicapped aside) in the USA can go to college. If you wernt lucky enough to get a scholarship, than working during the day and taking classes at night to pay for school. Or take out student loans (which the ONLY requirements to get is be a citizen and be a student) if your confident enough that you will be able to pay  them back in a normal time period. Also the average yearly salary for the bottom 10% is 12,154(Source: NY times), you would make more working full time at McDonald's. It does seem like a choice to be in the bottom 10%. Maybe a choice they are not aware they are making, but a choice none the less. Also if you wanted to convince woody of something John Oliver is not the way. He thinks he just talks about problems and offers no solution. 
Start at zero and work your way up vs start out high and slowly slide down.  However you forget that women can also create their own worth like a man can.  No it doesn't work out to sexual attractiveness as well, but women can create worth in their lives.  I'd say the true disadvantage is the developmental loss that comes from starting out on an easy level.  Men run the gauntlet and are told from day one that they will only be worth what they achieve.  But women don't start getting this message until later in life when there's less chance to grow in that crucible of doubt.

I planned on running stock until I learned notifications were broken and there's no support for LED notifications. You gotta pick up your phone to check for notifications because most of the time it either won't notify you or the notification sound is so low you can't hear it. I flashed Chroma and its just like being stock except notifications work like they're supposed to and you have total control over the LED. Not to mention you can also see the battery percentage without having to install another app. Not sure why these basic functions were taken away but they were. Chroma adds everything back so Im sticking with it. 
It's not that easy for non white people. I'll link here soon but there is a study they sent out 4 ( exactly the same )applications 2 with obviously white male and female names and 2 with obviously black male and female names. The white names got 400% more call backs.Please do not act like they can just overcome this vast adversity. Also they are imprisoned more often, given harsher sentences for the same crime. There schools aren't up to par. They don't have the helping hands from parents that whites do, partly to do with the high incarceration rates.http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minoritieshttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/06/05/when-to-punish-a-young-offender-and-when-to-rehabilitate/the-race-factor-in-trying-juveniles-as-adultshttp://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/03/21/292456211/black-preschoolers-far-more-likely-to-be-suspended
First franchise to ever make the list with only two films. And they managed to pull it off before Age of Ultron was even released in the United States.
Hmm with 4 ships it didn't take long, the ghost ship will absorb your ships hp and use it to regen it's ship which can make it a problem if you don't have enough fire power!
I bet you're a talented author! Good luck on your story writing:) Sorry to hear about that. I hope everything gets squared away soon. I'll be wishing your family gets it all figured out without too much stress. Good luck on your GED! My sister in law got hers a while ago and she just finished getting a certificate for some job in some health care job. She found a job a couple weeks ago. I wish you the same luck she had:)Thanks! I'm excited to be going in as a history major. I've been looking forward to this for so long:)
Well there are obvious risks associated that hes bringing up.ESL can simply "starve" leagues out of competition. This isn't a problem for right now, its more money for teams currently.The issue is down the road. They've raised the gap by raising themselves up so high that all their competition has either relegated to lower-skill teams or folded altogether. Then ESL, with what is nearly a monopoly, implement policies and other things that generate a lot more revenue for ESL that would be practices otherwise avoided. Like hypothetically, what if you had to buy a season pass to watch CSGO, instead of freely on twitch? A monopoly could actually make that happen really quick.He brings up a completely valid point.

good luck paying for 500 mods that cost 5$ each, some of them just a few lines of script or a couple of days modelling,  and thats per game,  and the publisher is getting nearly 50% of that money for doing absolutely nothing ( it even decentivises them to finish their games ) 
Greece. The workers have democratic control over who they vote for to lead them, they vote for a leader, and that leader is in control of the industries they work for. You can't possibly suggest that socialism is when all of the workers democratically vote for every decisions ever made by every industry. That is completely implausible. They also vote for their Union leaders, their government at all levels, etc. Greece is a perfect representation of socialism. And it's a complete failure. A welfare-state is just synonymous with socialism, it's the entire point of socialism; Everyone is treated the same under socialism, regardless of their skill level, work ability, health, etc.
I'm not sure how you haven't figured this out but yes you can fully mirror your iOS devices image to the TV with Apple TV (some apps like HBO go do but support this but there's and app on Apple TV for that). You can mirror an exact display of your Mac (2011 or later) as well and even use it as a second display with you mac running 10.9 or later.
Edit: Nothing bad was said, but what he did was. Once told by a person that worked at a school for kids with special needs. Substitute teacher was caught holding a severely autistic student against the lockers by his throat. This was after the student was having a negative behavior and the substitute tried to roughly pull him off the floor. The sub? Slap on the wrist. Why? Former district aministrator. Parents? Had their wishes granted because the district wanted to avoid being sued.
The mod will get the same amount of battery life (plus minus a couple percent to account for board efficiency at different input voltages) with the cells in parallel or series. Remember that while the mAh stays the same, the Wh (total power) we draw from the cells is doubled when they're in series (due to the voltage doubling).
Final Fantasy IV, the PSP version. I'm kinda stuck though, I think I might be under-levelled or something. And it's weird, Final Fantasy IV for the GBA is one of my childhood games. I beat it multiple times back in the day, yet here I am struggling to get through Sylph Cave despite the fact my team's at about level 42 average. I've just been grinding like a crazy person recently. But those fucking Malboros will be the death of me....And on console, I've been playing Earthbound. That's a pretty cool game. I just haven't touched it in about a week, which is a bad habit of mine: put a book/video game/TV show down then never touch it again forever. It's a great game, but I guess it's my ADD in effect.After I beat Earthbound, I'm probably gonna start the Persona series for the first time ever, so I'm hoping that'll be good (I'm starting with Persona 3 FES).

Thanks for perpetuating the stereotype my man. Minorities do not have a more difficult time getting ahead in the corporate world. In fact I've seen more qualified white candidates passed over for the sake of being able to claim corporate diversity. 
&gt; I couldn't find a way (yet) to implement changes like the increased int-gain on InvokerIs there text for leveling stats? If so it could go there.
Pretty much, you priveleged, white, cis, male, patriarchy supporting, republican, oppressive, scum.  Did I leave any relevant issues out?Edit: the thing where all the letters aren't thre.
Obviously hoping Petty and Goodley go fairly high in the draft, but the player I'm really watching is Bryce Hager. I think he's a great player and hope someone picks him up.
Ike in or out of box doesn't matter, same with packaging.I've recently gotten into the Fire Emblem series and have been completely entangled into its story. One of my goals is to collect all of the Fire Emblem Amiibo.
&gt;She's not going to be responsible for raising / caring / **financially supporting these kids**Legally, she would, though that alone wouldn't be enough to deny access to the embryos.  &gt;He's also somewhat older, and it's totally possible that he might not have kids without these embryosMen have viable sperm pretty much until their death. He signed a contract, end of story.  He can't have the embryos. 
is it a vanilla installation, or are you using dsfix? try disabling it if you have it, to see if the issue depends on some dsfix settings; I don't know what you've set in the setting panel for your graphics card but I've never seen this issue, whether the gpu settings were modified or not?
What would I do in that situation? Follow the drop caller and win the match. It may be dishonourable but it does not breach ToS and is a valid tactic. Of course the enemy team is free to call you dezgra.Any kind of sabotage would be a worse act and potentially breach ToS.Personally, I would only use this tactic if I thought there was no other way of winning. I always prefer to go for 48 kills.
It only takes one girl to do that to have a lasting impact on a guy. Guys tend to take life lessons to heart, especially with emotions and feeling vulnerable. 
Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from the Old Testament. It happens in the New Testament too. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman. THIS FLOWCHART IS A STRAW MAN.
It's so subtle but it really changed peoples view.  Gore had made it a signature move almost to try and throw people off their talking points.  A single light hearted nod completely shut him down, and made people think less of him.GWB's campaign team were very good.  They managed to make Al Gore seem unfit for office despite having been a solid VP for years, and John Kerry seem like he didn't care about serviceman despite the fact he *actually served in Vietnam*.
Everything you have said is extremely accurate, they only thing I could add about these two bikes is the madone is being reworked and 2.5 is essentially a 2014 as the frame is identical to last years. I would absolutely pick the Emonda over the madone for that reason. Last fun fact Emonda Madone and Domane are all anagrams of each other.
Their story line in the book is what caused me too stop reading. It wasn't poorly written or anything but I just couldn't get engaged.   I mean there is this huge world, dozens of established characters, story lines and families, but let's introduce another one, with a new group of people that you have zero attachment to, and follow their religious and political battles for a woke
The line art looks good form what I can tell.As far as the painting portion, I'd focus on your values a bit more. (Separating the darks from the lights) Right now, his eye is kind of getting lost in the dark spot on his fur.You're also using a very soft brush, which is making the fur look out of focus. I'd start working with a harder brush.
I'm glad you're not getting hate for this. People need to understand that saying that you're less impaired driving high than drunk doesn't mean you're promoting driving high, its just pretty much a fact at this point
I don't know because they were scaled by level and you are supposed to be a lower level for owb plus i thought it was better playing owb first because you have no clue who christine or elijah are and you can read elijah's journal. It was far more interesting to me especially after finding the communist camp where elijah was.  Plus by the way just finished dead money on hardcore mode 2 days ago and already beat hearts and owb.. Hardcore mode is so much better
People have a love/hate relationship with Chuck. While Shaq seems like a cool guy in general, when he commentates he gets worked up when they take shots at him.
My god. Am I the only one whose sick of these fucking goggles? I remember back in high school they had us put on "drunk goggles". Pretty much everyone just fucking goofed off with them. It was nowhere near being close to drunk, and theres noway on earth there going to show you what the world looks like while your high, because state of mind is a massive part of that. Sorry for the rant, but it just pisses me off to no end for some reason.
If you want good US banter, the closest I've found to a US Top Gear at UK Top Gear ~~quality~~ fun is old episodes of [Roadkill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EkWEjTBZ9Y).By "old," I mean episodes before they got bought by Dodge. Hopefully being "powered by Dodge" doesn't make the show suck, but I can only recommend pre-Dodge episodes.
2013 Sahara. "Dozer" color though it's more like sand. It came with all the bells and whistles which was nice. I came from a 2004 mustang and am 6'9" so I feel like I'm in heaven right now. Can't wait to get her muddy! 
We need to get off this planet. Find( a ball of water, put it in a big plastic blowup bag and bam we could be doing spaceaquaculture.If we took just 30-50% per annum of global defense spending we could end mining on earth. We could create vast farms in space. Closed loop systems utterly free of any bugs.Instead we senseless waste earths resources. For what. We ain't going anywhere 
So is this *just* the Sharks' bracket? That's pretty damn impressive, all things considering there were only 281 groups/people ahead of us and all that means is they predicted numGames differently.I honestly think the odds are good we ace round too, as well. TBL/MTL is the only iffy matchup in my eyes though upsets are always possible.

No they are not introduced to just "sex" early - they're introduced to unhealthy and outright malignant images, attitudes, and portrayals of sex within the toxic society. If children are introduced to healthy concepts of sex younger, and aren't shamed for playing house or doctor with their friends, they should learn to develop their own healthy sexual identities and would be able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy sex much earlier in life.
Fairings. They could not handle the might of my booster stage!With fairings base plate destroyed, earlier stages were cut off from command module, so Jeb had to return to base.
Democrats voting against Hillary for a third party in the presidential election  is the reason republicans control the congress?  Explain that logic please. When President Obama was elected he had 59 democrats or independents that caucus with democrats  in congress. There are now 46, what does this have to do with third party presidential politics?  The irony is without third party politics there would be no Hillary at all. She would be as relevant as Eleanor Mondale.  Bill Clinton became president because of the very strong third party candidate taking 19% of the vote in 1992, the great majority from Bush 41.Vote count was Clinton 44.9 million Bush 39.1 million Perot 19.7 million. Never mind Hillary without a third party we would have never even had a Bill Clinton Presidency.

smoke weed everyday 🎶haha seriously, it's medicinal.  helps with the pain and lets me relax.  my emotions get really crazy too, so what I do is take a couple of nights to myself, get all the yummy treats I want, smoke a bowl and watch some of my favorite movies.  some of the movies need to be sad/dramatic ones so I can cry and rage and direct all of my pent-up emotions towards those scenes.I feel **so** much better after that.
Planned parenthood also offers contraceptives but you immediately conclude from the image that the "girls night out" (implying casual sex, presumably) results in an unwanted pregnancy. You're making my point for me.Clearly the people laughing at the Chinese restaurant next to the cat clinic find racial stereotypes funny. I hope I don't need to explain that one to you.
The fact that this article tries to highlight this woman's  affiliation to Satanism and then connect it with abortion is to me a petty clear example of an agenda against abortion. Double speak... Anti abortionists are the loud minority and this kind of nonsense does not help.
I keep all my ships at one station.   When I buy one that's not there,  I just buy a cheap sidewinder to get to the buying station,  sell it and buy my new ship.   The loss on a sidewinder is hardly notable.

Could we say "human directed" or something? "Non-natural" is such a strong claim, and requires distinguishing between natural and unnatural causes which is always a bear.
Gamestop did do preorders for wave 4, they were in store only on April 2nd. According to them, they sold out of all of their wave 4 stock during that event, so it's unlikely any more will be put up.
I think they couldn't have a funeral.  The decision to let Dempsey out of his contract happened somewhat abruptly, not leaving time to coordinate all the necessary actors to make a believable satifying funeral.  Shonda was stuck in this regard.  Can't please the fans by skipping the funeral.  Can't please them by giving him a funeral without Cristina, Addison, Taye Diggs, Derek's mom, all four sisters, and Thatcher.
So if all you care about is the chemistry of the hosts, why not give some new hosts a chance, see if they build some chemistry, and maybe you'll like them?
A group of guys was coming down my street at 2:00am yelling and screaming. Sure they were having a good time, but I live in a residential area and it was early Tuesday morning. I asked them to be quiet because people were trying to sleep, and, of course, they shout back things like "come make us fa****." So I looked at the scenario, 5 guys vs me, and I didn't let my pride get in the way of things. Went back into my house and they were gone in 5 minutes or less. I think if it hadn't been for the situational awareness and humbling of bjj, i would have done something monumentally stupid. 
You wouldn't let your child participate in a practice that teaches proper tackling form? Just because they have some kinesiology based scientists there taking readings doesn't mean this is any different than normal practice. We did helmetless practices all the time back in peewee and high school football. With all due respect you don't know what you're talking about and I'm not sure if you read the article. Trolling or not you're misguided 
I like using my Baymax most. I try to get it activated as often as possible so I don't bother to wait for fever.

Obvously it's not mathematically, but realistically picking up and becoming a &gt;100k a year player is literally less than 99.99% of this sub, who at least know something about poker. It's just not the avenue to success it used to be. 
What they did is they made Level 2 Cache Shared between 2 cores, you have 8 fully funcional, 100% cores where 4 eat off of the other 4's cache, which kinda slows memory performance on die, but isn't too too bad. There are 8 fully loaded cores, capable of each handling their own thread (unlike hyperthreaded cores), but, the thread takes longer to render. Around 1.5 Intel cycles = 2- 2.3 AMD cycles depending on generation.
/u/20150501 is /u/20141220 you fuckin noob. You hardly know anything about this subreddit and you're making all kinds of claims without knowing shit about either users. It has been proven without a doubt that /u/20150501 is /u/20141220. A dozen other people have already asked him questions that he correctly answered.
Looking at the original Modern Masters, on Channelfireball, there are 5 cards that cost more than $50 (non-foil): Goyf, Sword of Fire and Ice, Vendillion Clique, Cryptic Command, and Dark Confidant. These are the ones that would trigger people to drop, I think.Of those 5, Sword is a disgusting bomb, Clique and Cryptic are very good, Goyf is fine and Bob is unplayable.Is that distribution better than the distribution of the rest of the rares? There's a bunch of Blood Moons, Glimmervoids, and Chalices in there to chill with Bob in the unplayable section (I counted 13 cards that I thought were clearly worse, just about 1 in 5) and a bunch of others are playable but still worse than a Goyf. So I think I rather add those five rares to my pool of potential opens than take them away, so even if I had to return the cards after the GP I'd still choose a preregistered pool.

To summarize their thoughts on "Allies of Al-Qaida in Syria":  Any group fighting with any national pride is to be foughtThis includes : "Islamic groups" fighting for an "islamic emirate""Islamic groups with secular/nationalist allies""secular groups allied with islamic"and "secular fighting for secular"  ..Basically everyone but them. (Also: Kinda hypocritical seeing as they wish to be a state and have "wilayats" that have names). If I missed anything dumbing it down go ahead and let me know. Still feeling disgusted after reading that, internet points for trying.

The problem with that diagnosis, as I see it, is that Borderline personality disorder can cause problems with personal identity. If they also had Narcissistic personality disorder, they would be obsessed with the person they don't even know that they are. 
So happy Calista is a power. I wonder, Wolfe gave his powers to her, as she could absorb them like he could, so does that mean Christian can get his powers out of her now?
The optimal place is always to take off from the Mun when it is closest to Kerbin, and burn as much as fast as you can until your periapsis at Kerbin really slows down.  Then wait until you are at apoapsis around Kerbin, and burn there to drop your final periapsis to ~30-35 km in Kerbin's atmosphere.This method takes advantage of the Oberth effect, for maximum efficiency.  Also, make sure you orbit counter-clockwise (west -&gt; east).
It's often said that Miles was a better bandleader than soloist. But he was still a great soloist who created a new sound and took the trumpet in a completely different direction, away from the prevailing clean sound of Armstrong/Eldridge/Gillespie. Personally, I think Coltrane &amp; Pete Cosey were perhaps the only two soloists who overshadowed Miles. 
I suppose I should have expanded. My discomfort comes from the moral dimension. I don't feel comfortable playing the part of an army that was involved in such atrocities as the Wehrmacht was. I like playing allies partly because the USF fit my play style well, but also because it makes me feel like I'm on the right side. If that makes sense?I also started playing allies as I heard it was more of a challenge, but that's rather evened out now.

Floresta de Tijuca is the largest urban jungle/rainforest/forest in the world. And the crazy thing is that it's man made. It used to be a coffee plantation and then 100 years ago it was replanted as a forest. 
Its like... your speaking.. LOGIC.This was a system that had a small chance IF done right and was giving 100% honesty. The chance was blown and maybe wont ever have that chance again after the backlash. Some warranted some Not. 
I can't tell if you're trolling or not, so I'm going to assume you're being serious.In science, the word "theory" means something very specific. It doesn't mean the same thing as "educated guess".A scientific theory is a fallible hypothetical model that has been thoroughly tested and has yet to be disproved, wherein fallible means it is something that *can* be tested, and model means a set of reproducible patterns by which we understand a certain phenomenon and which can be used to make predictions about similar phenomenon.God and the mythology surrounding Him is a hypothesis only, and it is an infallible hypothesis, meaning it cannot be tested against evidence. One can make a claim that He exists, for example, and never have the possibility of being proven wrong or right about it.I could go on if you wish. But maybe you have more specific questions now?
Saying episode III is better than VI is not a stretch at all. At least with III Lucas knew how to end it, where as in VI they just throw a big blanket over everything, tell the audience to close their eyes and be in awe at the happy teddy bear celebration music at the end. Other than that, yes, IV and V are amazing, and I and II are horrible.
Problem is, you can't compare ice with whatever Pica's golem is made of. I personally think that One Piece NEEDS another timeskip. What's the sense of 19 year old becoming strongest being on the planet and king of the pirates?
ItI'm watching less content myself. But my point is that it's impossible to talk about how the company is going to die at their current rate without knowing what kind of financial shape the company is in overall. It's not like we're getting hints of them being in trouble like massive layoffs. In fact we're getting hints that point in the opposite direction, last week Burnie was talking about how the employee count is going to get up to (I believe) around 120 because of projects they'll be working on later this year. That doesn't exactly sound like a company that's freaking out.
look likes it's probably at fair value now,but probably investors will buy here at the dip so momentum up will create more resistance to down trendsneed to check competition , moat, honest management... ?i would probably won't buy it
that's almost impossible unless you are wealthy..... they give everyone money.... there are also private student loans you can do. I didn't qualify as an unemployed student but my parents were able to take out loans for school on my behalf. I came from a no-money family and my parents didn't send me. went to a small private college... I got loans all the way through.  I don't accept your excuses.... get to school. if it's graduate there is NP excuse... they give out graduate loans like we can pay them back one day!
I'm actually pretty amazed that after a cold boot, I can get into Skyrim or Dishonored in about 7 seconds, from clicking "play" to interacting with the character in a loaded level. And that's loading it off spinning disk. I can't imagine how they can load skyrim faster than my chromebook boots.
Fuckin Yomi. I have a max skilled U&amp;Y and can't get my hands on a Yomi. A full size Sun Quan would be great too, I have a mini and he does the job but the awakenings on the real deal are just too good.

Idk, I only read New 52 so I can guarantee you that Batman couldn't get hit by a random thug unless he was surrounded at all sides, and even then it's doubtful.
Have you looked into learning GML? It's actually pretty easy to pick up on. There are tons of tutorials from folks like Tom Francis on YouTube and others that will help you out tremendously. D&amp;D can only take you so far until you need to know some code. Plus it's so much more customize-able.
Unfortunately, the moment you mention CCTV/public surveillance you get the knee-jerk suggestion that this will turn us into a police state/Big Brother system. Maybe if people stopped being such asses to one another, we wouldn't have to set up cameras. 
"I don't think that's true, Mr. Huckabee. The laws and freedoms of this country made you governor of Arkansas, even though God clearly made you an idiot."
No. Bashed patches only merge the levelled lists etc that are already there. The dragonborn items arent actually set up to appear in Skyrim at all, they have to be added with a mod. It also adds some other things like Brand Shei will sell dragonborn stuff, and there being an actual useable shrine at the shrine of azura etc
There is nothing malicious behind what I am saying.  When I deal with people and real life stuff I keep to myself as well, but when discussing a comic book movie?  Thats just being super uptight in my opinion, but to each their own.  I will pay to watch this movie in theatres thus supporting its production I think i'm allowed to critique it.  Comic book heroes have IMPROVED this last decade because of fan backlash over the garbage we used to get.  i.e. No way we get a rated R Deadpool movie if it weren't for fans shitting on The Wolverine's Deadpool. 
But in Europe people don't care about nudity so there is no need for shower curtains. I have been to countless shower rooms in many european countries and most of them look like this: http://jurahaus.ch/tl_files/jurahaus/gallery/haus_annexe/Duschraum%20Damen.jpg

Really shouldn't be an issue, however depending on the temp difference from car to when you bring it into the house, i would not turn it on for an hour or so to ensure any condensation has evaporated. I believe there is a min and max temp for many parts though, but as long as we're not talking Arizona desert or the Arctic it should be ok. 
I heard a teacher ask a student why they ran away from home.   The phrasing was "I understand that you ran away recently and that is why you were absent so long.  What is so bad at your home that you had to leave?  Your life can't be THAT bad." Turns out kids older adopted brother molested him for years and his step-father abused him.  The whole family was a mess.  Seeing them at teacher conference was always a... treat.   The kid attempted suicide a few weeks later.  He had it pretty rough already.    
I feel like we could pretty easily feed/cloth/house/vaccinate every human on this little rock... if only we would put the right resources into the right places instead of everyone squabbling over 2000 year old arguments and an ever-shortening supply of limited resources (of which we could easily become independent of, if, again, we applied our resources properly).
Levi jeans are way too short for me. Especially the bootcut, I suppose because the curviness of my thighs takes up all the fabric. I buy 37" jeans from Buckle or Alloy (highly prefer buckle) and tailor the waist myself. It's the only way. 
Please note that /u/7693385781711 is referring to a moral right to know your grades, not a legal right.  The University will not release your grades to anyone unless you grant them permission to.In any case, I agree with the sentiment here - I don't think you are ready for university.  Your actions have consequences and it is unfortunate that you are only recognizing this now after it is too late.  People can help you, but no one will hold your hand.  If the situation is as dire as you describe, you'll probably be forced to leave UBC.  I would perhaps suggest taking a year or so off to work a minimum wage part time job to motivate yourself a bit - because that's where you'll likely end up for the rest of your life if you continue on this path.
I was completely kidding, why u have to hate lounge as I love it better than reddit, lounge can have a ridiculous price but that's cause the player base on there is 100x bigger than reddit. I get more offers on lounge than here, but with that being said I have a lot of love for this subreddit. This subreddit had some used better than lounge as good deals usually go to the hot page where they are more likely to see.
25% is not awful though, you're really overreacting. I made about 5% on the dota 2 items I worked on and made a killing off them. A good mod project that deserves to be bought would make the developer a lot of money even at 25%Also the money Bethesda made pays for the work they did on 1.0 release, but they've continued to support the game long after. They don't deserve at least 30% of mod money? 
I think all of these outfits are cute. I don't mind the visible socks with the sneakers, though I guess it's more ideal to have the clean lines of no socks/no-show socks (I have never worn no-show socks so I don't really know how practical they are...I tend to just not wear socks if I don't want them to show but I think I'm in a minority there).I think the black boots look great with the jeans rolled up, and, in the outfits with the coats, I prefer the boots to the sneakers.I love that jumpsuit with the white t shirt underneath.
I know, none taken at all! And sorry if I gave you the 101, I just read some other comments and somehow assumed that you were new to them as well. My bad.
No.  If she doesn't want to she should just come out and say directly.Open and honest communication are the foundation of any relationship that's going to last and be mutually satisfying.
Oh God, this was my first thought too !My dad was dealing before I was born and he would sometimes disappear for days, and my mom would have to shoo off the people knocking at their door when he wasn't there. And they kept coming back basically every 2-3 hours until he got back. Must've been terrible.
I had a dope dream last night. Usually i wake up tired and grumpyBut I got some bags from my buddy in the dream and did not do them yet and was instantly elated and was abruptly awoken and that elation carried over into my morning even though I didn't actually cop. That rise in dopamine must be real. So dope dreams don't have to be all bad. Previous they all were but this one was different. Maybe because I woke before getting to use. I think that must be why telling myself that I'm going to cop tomorrow or its on the way and other mental tricks seem to work sometimes. Weed is amazing because it helps just say fuck it about emotional stress.
Doesn't take 2 weeks to drink all of it. Damn i love me some fresh squeezed oj. I mean freesh freesh. edit: Like before you even cut it open, before its even a tree.. That freeesh. 
Imagine if you could just put in a cd or download something from the devs and then just play it with no drm or service that needs to update ever, and doesn't have people that can make retarded decisions like making something that used to be free, paid.Nah, it'd never work.
Went to a conference (I think, could have been just traveling for work)...Got to the hotel and took a shower, got dried and for some reason just lay on the bed naked (not something I usually do)...All of a sudden door opens and guy starts coming in, he hears/sees me trying to cover up and walks out again...I get on the phone to the front desk and say what the fuck...The front desk had given him same room and identical keys. I got two free nights in the hotel.
No, it's not that.I have co-ords to the planet but I wouldn't know where it was underground, since it was a while ago and on a different version. Oh well, thanks anyway :D
IDK man when I was choked out in BJJ it would have been conforting to awake to an african dude giving me the equivalent of an over aggressive high school handjob 
Next year is my last year. I've always been passionate about fitness and biology, so it was naturally for me to go into dietetics. -So far, I've learned little about nutrition that I didn't already know-Biochem is the hardest course of the program IMO-I spend alot of time worrying about matching to a DI-Being a guy, I feel like I can't be myself without doing something offensive to females-Being black, I feel like I stick out too much, instructors personally email me when I miss class-While nutrition was always something I was interested and involved with, If the Army didn't pay for my tuition, I'm positive that I wouldn't have chose this as a career field.I wasn't from the wealthiest family, so the average salary is still desirable to me.. But the DI you're required to complete is whats contributing to my uncertainty 
He didn't say he's experiencing it for the first time, he simply said that was his experience when he first played.  He could have played it back in 2008 for all we know.  It's a shit post, trading nostalgia for karma.

It's in his wikipedia page:'Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan Genocide became trivial: "I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad." One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, "You need to take a look at what you were doing." "And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective."'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper
After partially filling out the form on the website, I started to get bad juju's. Rightly so. After looking in to it, apparently Lending Tree fancies selling your information to companies that perform unauthorized credit checks.

I haven't watched streams; frankly I don't want to because I want to play the game completely fresh like I'm playing Xenoblade right now. I knew zero about the game coming in and the experience has blown me away so farRegardless; even if it's not running 60fps, but it's running a solid consistent &gt;30, that's amazing. Nice to know me seeing a few super silky Gifs is real gameplay!So pumped for the NA release!
Tangential question, because I always enjoy leaning more about professions: as a hiring manager (or what have you) how is it that one would have the necessary skills to recognize talent, professionalism, and quality in fields that diverse? You did you it's changed over your career, but I can't imagine you have a background in all those fields. I'm not saying that is necessary to make the right call (obviously it isn't), I just know as a layperson, I'd feel out of my depth trying to hire someone for a field I've never worked in, or wasn't educated for.

It's actually better for you to drink room temperature water as ice water actually slows down your digestive system. I started drinking room temp water when I started vandwelling and now I can't start ice in my drinks unless it's tea or a soda.

Lou said he'd trade his pick as well. Say we package Phil to the Devils for their first rounder and more, and then move up one to 5th.We could have 2 of Strome/Marner/Hanifin. Nice.
Except the last 2 sentences are meaningless because even your Jesus didn't say it.  The reason it was put in there was purely to convert pagans, nothing more. Anyone looking at in objectively can see that. That is why people at times refer to it as Paulianity sometimes, because he made up crap, said it was the holy spirit, then wham, no more following the old laws.Also even when Leviticus calls things abomination, it doesn't mean what you think it does. It context of Leviticus abomination= against tradition. Additional, Leviticus was to show why Jews are different from the gentiles and many of the laws were to create that separation. Cultures in the area, religious rituals included priests and what would be considered homosexual acts, hence why it was in there. Put on top of that, Jews were in exile when the OT came about and wanted to ensure their numbers would grow.

Well funny thing is that Australia started their journey into the fibre world with the last government who were going to roll out FTTP to 93% of the population (rest would be satellite). Then, the new government has come in and tossed all that out the window and going with a "mixed" technology mix where its a lucky dip of HFC, FTTN, Wireless and FTTP. We had our chance and blew it!
Exactly!  Just remember this isn't new. The Detlev Bronk thing started around 10 to 15 years ago. He used to start screaming "Don't fucking bring that name up on the show" every time Howard brought it up. I think he found this guy on Wikipedia and that where the bit started. No way he could keep a Wikipedia page going for this many years. 
You could plan for ten minutes of alone time with your spouse. You'll want that anyways on the day of even if it seems unnecessary during planning. Go makeout behind a tree then bring it on back.
First things first how could you forget about [pole guy?](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/c0.0.851.315/p851x315/135125_469626799727359_909392863_o.jpg).Moving on, it is very possible that like you said most men and women (I doubt Suki and her group are the only Kyoshi warriors that were trained in the 100 years of the war) just up and left in order to fight for the earth kingdom, but i doubt that they just got upset with the war and decided against it, but rather they lost contact with the Earth Kingdom (i really think that the EK communication system was a mess seeing, that the highest general´s weren´t even updated on the situation, while there is a random town that sends people to the war front to be led by who?).After not hearing anything they decided that the safest course of action would be to claim neutrality in case the Fire Nation had conquered the Earth Kingdom. At least that´s my theory.
I dont find oliver that funny as his humor is more about yelling at the camera about a small tangent. I agree that Colbert is funny as hes witty. I could write oliver jokes as the connections he make are obvious (in terms of things to yell about)

I'm not convinced it would be a valuable experience because it might noy be something I could share with humanity. And if whatever I discovered would benefit only me, I don't know that is a desirable goal. . I would prefer all humanity benefits from the experience of the journey. How would humanity be enlarged by waving goodbye to travellers they would never hear from again?
Yeah, I don't like how this article reifies the model minority myth. It presents Asian-Americans as this monolithic group that is super-successful, which is just untrue.I kinda understand the sentiment behind the article, but since it buys into the very problematic premises of the model minority myth (all Asians are the same, all Asians do well, there are no problems in the Asian-American community, Asians don't face racism because they're so successful, etc.), I can't say I support this strategy.
I don't  think it is,rng is just being rng with me. I have full sets of nats and mara and found tons of other rare things  but not a simple plan. Last season it fell really  quick  for me. I honestly havent found many recipies this season as it is.
I have that inkling too, but I'm sure the media will portray her as a juggernaut as she goes on to steal the farce piece of theatre that is the primaries.
hello reginaldtato- this was a stock div that went ex on april 27th which means the price at close of business april 24th was adjusted by the stock div 565.06-(0.0027455*565.06) so on the the 27th it opened at 563.50862777 +/- any after hour trading. You probably didn't notice this but your shares were trading ex div until today, the pay date, where you received the stock which your broker then sold because (im guessing) it was a fractional share.
This is not the idea, for sure. It's ridiculous. How are consumers supposed to install this chip into their electronics? How can that ever compete with mining operations in Iceland?
Yeah, so you stay alive because of wk's aghs, and I guess when you die it improperly says it was reincarnation that damaged you since there is no other icon to fit 
WPF here after all these years. It's a dual-display media playback kiosk application. WPF video playback isn't ultra reliable, so the video player is a WinForms application hosting AxWindowsMediaPlayer. The two executables are separate processes and communicate with each other over NetMQ.

It costs them absolutely nothing to spit out bullshit and on the off chance it happens they can be all "SEE DELUSIONAL BLAZER FANS LOLZ" instead of actually understanding the situation.                However, there is most definitely a chance he will leave and its higher than a lot of blazer fans seem to think imo.
MLS is a very top heavy league (in terms of earnings). The disparity between average wage and the wage of the average player will be much larger in MLS.
Interesting, thank you! I've recently been introduced to liquid lipsticks and will probably purchase another in the future.  I went to Sephora thinking I'd get the Kat Von D ones since everyone seems to rave about them but none of the colors seemed remotely okay on me.  I wanted something to wear to my wedding, but I'm not sure I'd be interested in any of those colors even otherwise.I ended up going with the MUFE Aqua Rouge ones and they are drying but I've been really impressed by their lasting power.  I'm interested to try out the Hourglass ones now though.
Everything you do is rape.  Rape for breakfast.  Rape for lunch.  Driving to work is rape because the car never consented to you penetrating it with your body.  You should probably stop all the raping.
LEO's need to be held to a higher standard when they act criminally. In my area, we recently had a couple jail employees arrested for having sex with an inmate, among other things. The first gal was sentenced to 50 months prison and the second hasn't been sentenced yet. I'll attach the story....but, point being - when you are in a position of trust and you break that trust, the penalty needs to be harsher than it would be for the average person. http://www.kptv.com/story/28108918/washington-county-jail-employee-pleads-guilty-to-sexual-misconduct-with-an-inmate

First off, for much of those five acts he was already Bec Noir.Second, Jack is not a main character. He is behind a lot, but he doesn't really get that much screentime, and much less than Karkat does.I wouldn't call him a side character, but I wouldn't call him a main character either.
Give the writers some credit. They've made practically the entire cast (recurring and limited appearances) out of nothing. And the characters are so full of depth. I doubt they're going to be molding everyone into a pre-determined adaptation.

Skiing and scuba diving. Respectively one thing I stopped doing because I got too big and one thing I've never started because of my weight. I also want to dress more fashionably, this Admiral in the Old Navy is retiring, I want to be the Oligarch of the Banana Republic instead. Oh, and looking forward to some other small things like living longer, avoiding diabetes and heart disease and spending lots of fun, active time with my daughter and not being a sweaty unhealthy disappointment. On the shoe topic I was trending towards slip on shoes because bending down to tie laces was a chore.

Honestly I don't find the new black cleaver to be that good on AD carries at all. 3K gold for 40 AD is extremely inefficient. You will be setting your build back by a lot... BF sword gives more AD and is half the cost. So I doubt its good on the likes of lucian, graves, sivir, jinx, kog, vayne.Ad carries I would consider cleaver to be ok on: Corki, Ezreal, Ashe (pre rework), Kalista.Its good on Kalista because she can build Bork -&gt; Runaans -&gt; Cleaver, with you proc'ing the armor pen on runaans bolts, and you still do damage. Its good on Corki/Ezreal because missiles/q will apply cleaver. Ashe because low CD arrow.However, ADs depend on having IE, AS item, LW for damage, and 3K gold is too big to just use on 40 AD and CDR + phage utility.Also please please please don't go cdr boots on lucian, they were ok last season but now you really want to be playing him like an actual adc. You will do more damage with AS boots, and you shouldn't be using e off cooldown anyway
providing basic advice isn't always victim blaming. If he said "men, don't walk down Dodgy St after midnight because it's a common location for assults or roberies" there would be zero outrageIf he said "there was been a spate of home invasions of late, so make sure you lock you doors", there woulds be zero outrage.Providing basic advice on precautions to take to avoid dangerous situations is not victim blaming. It sucks that these precautions may need to be taken, but that doesn't mean it's outrageous to suggest them
It's Tribalism. Very deeply ingrained in human nature due to humans being organized as small tribes for millions of years. The "us versus them" mentality is not going away any time soon. 
As I see it, people love zombies because they can connect or relate with them more then other enemies. Zombies are created by man being greedy and ignorant, while most enemies are created by nature, magic, fantasy, etc.  Most enemies have many special abilities but zombies have very few, which people can relate to.  A zombie wants to kill and eat you, just like most enemies, but zombies also can infect you will their virus and turn you into one of them.  By killing a zombie not only are you happy that it died instead of you, you are happier it didn't turn you into a zombie.  To be killed by an enemy is a bad thing, even to have it lay eggs in you is bad too but having the enemy make you roam the earth until you die, killing any living thing along the way, even possibly your loved ones is the worst.  When you kill a zombie you are telling yourself that its a good thing, that you are helping to end the spread of the virus, even though you know in the back of your mind its hopeless.

Morally, almost everyone's life is priceless. Realistically, a person's life is only worth as much as what we believe they can give to society and their net worth.
No one  seems to be giving you hair parting options so if you feel like trying it you could go with a side part, but that's entirely up to you. I don't think you should wear makeup until/unless it's something you want to do. I don't understand this subreddit. I mean, people give a lot of gravity to what others think about them, and I can see how it would be tempting to ask, but not everyone finds the same things attractive. Different people find beauty in different things. I mean, I think big noses are attractive and a lot of people seem to think that a big nose is a bad thing. It really just depends and you'll never get a definitive answer from a group of people.

Sucks if your cash gets caught on a bulk buy though :/ Real deal I think the gov keeps hands off for the most part bc this shit is keeping USPS afloat!  Without DNM packs theyd lose a chunk of volume.  
I think that's a bit disingenuous. A Turkish German would describe themselves as Turkish if they were talking to a white German who could trace their ancestry back to a village in Hessen for the past three hundred years. But I've met Turks who have German citizenship outside of Germany and they have described themselves as Germans. Which they are. It's like when I am talking to another British person I say I am a Yorkshire folk. When I am talking to another European I describe myself as British and when I talk to someone from outside of Europe I describe myself as European. 
oh yeah my biggest qualm about ganking with him is that I actually have to walk up to the target and reserve Q for when the target starts to run away :(
I disagree, Steel and DaZed are a lot older and influenced Swags decisions. I think Swags personality is more susceptible to suggestion because of his age, and his older teammates knew that when they asked him to throw. 
My senior year, when my homeroom class was noisy, my teacher looked down at me and said very quietly "this is why I told my daughters I wouldn't pay for their education if they were teachers, so they didn't have to put up with this shit".
He played decently enough for his first real NFL season, and then had disappointing performances in the playoffs. I'm not ready to call him a bad player at all.

as long as you trade with guys that seem legit (Clean steamrep, good cashrep etc.) You should be fine, never heard of someone getting tradebanned because he bought keys someone scammed/paypal scammed
Does SHE want a larger diamond though? This is something you need to ask her. I was really clear with my now husband (then fiance) that I did NOT want a big ring. I know he thinks I am worth it, and I know he would have gotten me a bigger one if I had asked, but in my mind, I did not want the pressure of carrying $6K on my finger all the time. What if I dropped it? What if I got mugged? I would probably have only worn it for special occasions. Plus, I have tiny fingers (wear a 3.25 size ring) so a larger diamond would have not really been the look that I was going for. I got a cool custom ring with a 0.5 carat flawless diamond and am much happier about it. On the other hand, if she likes big diamonds, then you have to decide whether you want to go for it or not. Either way, get it appraised and insured!
As someone who didn't play much Wow, Rythian's explanations of the original bosses and the raids are fantastic. And I love seeing him nerd out over all the awesome little details. Although I'm a little sad he didn't get to see Nefarion's reaction to playing Deathwing.
Dunleavy punched MCW right in the chin on a lay-up. Suspension probably incoming for Dunleavy. Anybody have video of it? After his good game today it'll suck not to have him for some games for the next series.
I don't know the psychologist and I don't know the kid however we need to stop pretending (the system as a whole) that college should be for everyone and that you will come out of it better - there are many underrepresented higher education options, like trade schools which will allow you to become successful in a different type of environment. 
Been to my fair share of GT games, most notably the huge upset against VT back in 2008/2009? Great atmosphere for big games although the opposing fan base usually gets their fair number in. 
What do you guys feel about heatseeker asi boots (warrior for attack speed steroid, ninja if no attack speed steroid) executioner, rage death bringer? Not as safe but much more deadly

Not really. I recall the Cavs FO was pushing for a deal that didn't involve Wiggins (not to mention other teams' offers). Flip could have easily caved in and traded Love away earlier but instead held out for the best possible deal.

But that's not all trans people who are being retarded tumbrinas. I'll give you a higher rate of mentally ill trans people, but to drag the entire demographic into the feminist censorship nutjob subsection is retarded. Hell I would go and say that the community was completely hijacked the same way feminism decided to hijack the civil rights movement which has fuck all to do with feminism. 
I went onto your website and downloaded the bot again and now it is working perfectly. Do I have to re-download the bot every time there is an update? Now the only problem seems to be that xmod is not auto searching? What do you think?
The thing is, though, many people with gender dysphoria have brain structures corresponding to the gender they identify as.Also, as far as I have observed, the only "treatment" for gender dysphoria is transition. Every attempt I've ever seen to force someone with dysphoria to conform with the gender they were assigned ended poorly.
This atrocity is why when, in the corporate world, I hear people in management talking about "drinking the kool aid" in meetings - I interrupt them, bluntly tell them I had an uncle who died in Jonestown and I don't appreciate the kool aid comment as that's where it stems from.   It embarrasses them and they never know I'm telling a bold faced lie. 
Yeah, we don't call Angelle Hall "The Ang". We don't call Maxim Doucet "The Max" or "The Douce" (although both of those are actually cool). We abbreviate Student Union to "The Union". You don't need to do any more.

make sure you're holding the reinforcement material in your hand when you hit the chest. If one of the item disappears, you did it right.Also, if you use the Name Layer Set Default Group command (/nlsdg &lt;groupName&gt;) it sets that group as your default group. After that, you only have to type /ctr to reinforce and it'll automatically reinforce to that group every time until you change default group.
Attack from the left in a wide arc dropping 3 rages infront of the air defences, take out the top and bottom army camps so you can funnel into the middle.
With the 2A I would try 1LL and 5xML with an xl300. This is still one of my favourite mechs/builds. Tips:When you are running from enemy's, turn your torso 90 degrees and look at the ground. This positions the huge dummy arm at the rear of your mech. Fire and relocate lots.Use the fast torso twist to roll as much damage to your arms.Oddly I've found playing with arm lock improves torso response. Enjoy!
I'm a college student studying to be a biologist here. We don't think we know everything. We form a hypothesis, test the experiment, and look to see if the data supported our hypothesis. We find out we were wrong all the time. That's why we run experiments. We don't assume we were correct, we go out to find evidence.
Captain FalconOut of box or inRegion doesnt matterI got caught up in the amiibo craze around wave 3 and quickly realized it would be too expensive and hard to collect them all. So now I just want the original smash 64 crew and Im only missing captain and jiggly!
&gt;  but to rule out anything you'd be otherwise inclined to believe because of something written in a non-scientific book is just ridiculous I don't see how that is applicable, why would I otherwise be inclined to support gay marriage if my holy book had not spoken against it?

&gt;Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode.
Hmmm I think they put some kind of of treatment on there because I can feel it with my fingers. I have a few other pairs of shell that didn't have this layer of whatever. But, you may be right!

Simmer 69 minutes. Say "Natas Liah!" 3 times and stir in the ground rhino horn. Chill and serve.
You can make spells that fortify Magicka while dealing damage - effectively casting for free. So yeah, destruction is pretty useful. Always annoyed me how slowly ranged spells move, though.
Yes.  But who needs a stage 4 item on their main that doesn't already have one?  If you are planning to get a stage 6 item next patch, it is *extremely* likely that you have already gotten your stage 4 item.  The only people that will still need the 1-4 upgrade items will be alts or possibly people switching mains, which is my whole point.Just because it is still *technically* necessary doesn't make it relevant or a good choice.  They have relegated the barn to providing the prior tier's materials.  Anyone bothering with current progression will have no use for it.
He's actually more accurately called a Social Democrat. He still supports the capitalist mode of production. The people over in /r/socialism are all bent out of shape over the misappropriation.
I was living with my best friend and her family who had owned a lodge (at this point though, there were no guests). I had just been broken up and was finding it really hard to get back on my feet. My best mate had a crush on one of the staff and she made this very known. In reality, he really liked me and we were always flirting in private and really helped me get over by breakup. One night drunk I ended up sleeping with him in front of the fireplace, in the living room of the lodge. Her little sister walked in and shit hit the fan after that. All I could think was that I was absolutely fucked. I got slapped by the mum and got a black eye in the end and my friend never forgave me, but she forgave him in an instant which still pisses me off. 
warshits are still on limited access beta, not everyone who wants to be playing has ability to play.3-8k is a huge spread, lets say 5.5k, so to reach warplanes level you will need to drop 5k players. you think that is going to happen overnight?
Coulson is alive, the HYDRA take over resulted in Coulson building his own SHIELD (which Nick Fury showed up and gave his blessing), and Skye is the Inhuman Quake.Oh, and the reason the Avengers start off the movie going to a HYDRA base is because Coulson suggested Maria Hill send them there.That's all you need to know.
They're not making the engine 29% more efficient, they're just making it more powerful and stating that it won't eat into the range, most probably because they assume most users won't be using the additional power so much that it will noticeably impact the range.
From the album [here](http://imgur.com/a/jtYIC#QtPLlCe), courtesy of /r/bicycling,  on the applications of titanium powder in 3D-printing applications for bike manufacturers. The whole album is engineering porn but that track bike is fucking gorgeous.
Your recent post: "I pay my bills, go to work, act responsible, and only play in the bath with one rubber ducky."Sounds like you're deep in the matrix to me.
But you understand he has anxiety right? Logically he shouldn't care what other shoppers think but it doesn't work like that.Edit: And it's surprising that he's being downvoted for expressing that fear. He opened up about his anxiety and is asking for help and he's being downvoted? This subreddit is weird sometimes.
He would be matched with players of the same level has him, if the player base would be bigger. So at some point (hopefully), that won't even be an issue.But if S2 can figure out a good Karma system, I think it would be really beneficial.
If either transaction was closed with a title company insuring the sale, you can make a claim to the title company for payment. You can tell if there was a title company involved because the deed should show the name of the escrow or title company used on the deed when it was recorded at the sale.
Aw, thank you! That was a really nice thing to say, and it cheered me up. (I have the flu for the first time ever and have been feeling sorry for myself all day):)
The frustrating part is when I tell my friends to jump with a Titan across and they reply "that's impossible". Tell them to tap the jump button twice without any delay and they don't understand. They do it wrong and blame the game while I'm sitting here thinking how I got myself in this mess.
Death is not the same as stopping you from progressing. It's why they made the Bible give you flight for a room so if you fly over and swap it out you aren't just trapped.
&gt;would you go as far as saying its immoral to accept money in a manner such as this?I'd say yes. This allows candidates to increase their budgets by changing their views to match those who have the capacity to donate more. It's marketing, not politics.But given today's system, I think it's necessary to flub on morality a bit to restore the system to proper working order. It may be the only way...
Not true. A lot of people do it for the stress relieving properties of the nicotine. Having a smoke after a long day at work was and is still a rather common thing.
My brother has an 06 golf. The coils worked but when I went to change a faulty one, they all crumbled and fell to shit with this nasty rust all inside it. Not massively expensive to change.

I'm not sure if it's the somewhat tortured language and non-punctuation of your post, but from what I gather, just about none of it adds up to even being relevant in this post. Care to maybe rephrase much more carefully?
Well the difference was that you might have thought yourself superior in some topics, but you at least were intelligent enough to recognize that you would look like an idiot if you tried to push that narrative onto someone.Meaning that deep down you knew that you weren't really that great. You just felt other people had bad taste.The guy in the post lacks any social skills, and any actual intelligence. You can tell because he doesn't mention anything that would make him really seem smart. He just goes on and on about how he's above people. Anyone who has to go on and on about that is probably not where they want to be.
In Blender, go to file-&gt;user preferences-&gt;add-ons and check the 3D print toolbox.    On the right hand side, select the scene tab, which looks like the sphere and cylinder under a light, between the world tab and render layers tab. On this change units from 'none' to 'imperial'.    To add holes to the basic shape, the easiest way is to create the shape, then create a cylinder as a new object, and use the BOOLEAN function to subtract one from the other to give the holes.  
We didn't, you do. You are just as guilty as "nagging teacher" in your story. Which is fine, just don't say things like:&gt; but I don't say degrading things.
I wouldn't mind it if he was just the chicken heel during the build to the matches but performed like he did at the Rumble and didn't run away from the fights ever chance he gets.
Your subreddit rules should probably clarify that definition of scam.What subreddit is better suited to submissions reporting this kind of internet fraud?
Well, we had to write tables (you know, the ones people make in MS Excel, except it was in our notebooks) for Geography homework. And let me tell you, there was a lot of stuff we had to try to compress in there. Wasn't easy...And you know what I did? I just scanned and printed the pages from the book instead of making it.And the teacher actually approved of it! I love my printer, haha.

My guess is that they didn't like the ARTS system, which is understandable. It's more or less MMO combat.I heard that once Xenoblade X is out there's going to be an optional download of textures and other resources so that the game could load and run faster. GTA5 did the same thing, did it not? If the low FPS really makes that much of an impact on your enjoyment of the game, it might be a necessity.
I'm 21. I doubt things have changed that much in 3 years. When a student was a shit they got failed. No one complained. Parents asked why they failed you showed them the fact they did 0 work. Stop over exaggerating things. Shit's the same as it's always been, you just hear about the bad stuff more since everyone has a camera on them and there's websites made for this type of stuff.
When there are lemmings left holding heavy bags, and the faith in the dollar falters......everyone runs to precious metals. Thats the crash im waiting on. Show me some weakness dollar. The us is only 14-15 trillion in debt. What could possibly go wrong? That bubble is bursting someday, and when it does.....i will be first in line
I absolutely love Ghibli cover albums! There's a variety of them including Music Box cover albums, English cover albums, and of course the Jazz cover album that you showed us. Thanks for sharing!
in 8th or 9th grade this creepy situation unfolded. I was in my history class and the rest of the students in here are of the same age. The male history teacher pulls out his cellphone at some point, and this girl who sits near his desk says "ew thats a fat one." The teacher responds by saying "Thanks, so is the phone" *wink*
I'm at the aircrew schoolhouse on Lackland and the word from the TACP students right now is that ROMAD's are being phased out and most if not all TACP students that graduate from the Medina schoolhouse will qualify as a JTAC in-pipeline. The first Medina class started 3ish weeks ago, word is the instructors are basically making shit up as they go.
I actually posted this with that in mind. I was curious as to whether there was any overlap between what people find attractive now and what was found attractive back then.
I've asked else in this thread, but question: I get that I need to print at the correct temperature, should I purchase an accurate thermal gun to verify that the temperature is correct, or can I pretty much safely assume the temperature I set in Cura will be the temp. I get? 
Yeah, he makes a good product... and if he was making good games that he didn't want to, I'm a little stoked to see what he'll do with a new project he's passionate about. ... maybe he'll pick up The Last Guardian!
The purpose isn't to genuinely fool anyone as to what you're doing, it's to avoid being hassled by the cops or getting a ticket.  In a lot of places, it does exactly that.So, no, the bag doesn't defeat its own purpose.
How do you avoid the disappearing player glitch?Is this where you have 10 players on pitch during setup phase and cannot move a reserve player onto the field?Frustrating!
No stencils used! I free handed it. I actually made the lines crooked where it says my name. I put my name there to distract from the accident, but it actually worked out for the better! 
Toast bread of your choice, spread avocado on each with a fork, add some sea salt (bonus points if it is pink), add ground pepper, drizzle with olive oil and devour.  This has been my go to snack for months.  I might try the egg suggestion soon however.
I veer slightly more towards the scientific edge of things, too, which is why I take a more cognitive approach in my work, but something I love about applied psych is that it has that "art and science" mix going on--empirically supported interventions that still rely on interpersonal effectiveness and intuition to really "work." My dad was a particle physicist, and I was always incredibly in awe of the work he did because I struggled to wrap my head around quantum physics at all. When I decided to go the route of the psychotherapist I wasn't sure what he would think--he was totally supportive and was behind me all the way. Bottom line, I think people (if they have the resources) should do what fits best with them. 
Fucking lol, idiot line. Hey guys, remember when we all agreed that the reds would probably be douchebags? Well, we were right. We also agreed that they have good reason to be and are the top level of button society, and can't help but look down on the plebes underneath them. Deal with it. 
&gt; My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI. Pretty much this. It's the sort of pseudo-scientific simplification that's easy to digest so it gets repeated to the point of drowning out more complex analysis.Fun Fact: In addition to being designed originally for a fairly homogeneous European population the BMI was not originally meant to convey information about individuals, it was only meant as a heuristic tool for statistical analysis.
a 20 year payout of 1.3 million dollars is gonna be $65K a year, so it's not like she can go out and really spend too much beyond her means. Obviously she could get a nice house (depending on local prices, I don't know Florida that well) on a 20 year interest only mortgage that she wouldn't be able to afford otherwise and that might be a giveaway, but she wouldn't be buying too much beyond what your average middle manager at a large company could afford.
While I am 100% on board, just like everyone else, I find it slightly worrisome none of the top comments are curious about his potential running mates.  The White House is a rough place that appears to really take its toll. As awesome as Bernie is, he is much older then average presidents. Should the stress get the better of our beloved Bernie who is in succession?
I think you misunderstood what I said. When you give them context at all they most often lose their humor. They only really work when they come up "naturally" in the course of discussion. 
Straight from the article (but conveniently added to the end):&gt; Note that the analysis does not include logistics, amortized capital expenses, overhead, R&amp;D, software, IP licensing and other costs.The cost of _manufacturing_ a device is not even remotely a fair comparison for how "screwed" a customer got. 
While i agree its not broken pounce is not without bugs. But what your saying makes no sense. Your trying to apply real life mechanics to a game logic. He is trying to say that the game mechanic isnt working how it should. While i disagree with him and think he got pounced because he was going to get pounced your argument makes no sense. 
In my family, such events have led to factions/permanent camps.  Those of us who are welcoming and open continue to hang out - and frankly, avoid the others.It's not like it's something you can solve by yourselves or address with a PR campaign.As everyone else is saying - their loss.  Definitely block and unfriend IMMEDIATELY and don't look back.Life is better that way.  
Ultimate nes remix would be nice. I never got to experience those type of games before and it would be awesome to play bits of them in my n3ds. Thanks for doing the giveaway man.
[Sure, here you go](http://imgur.com/QeFHUi1)Sometimes I switch it up with Life Steal rather than Soul Rip, but other than that this is what I usually run. I'll admit I'm not the best, but I do have really good rounds sometimes, and it's because of the skills and attributes of the Warlock class rather than me being awesome, heh.
Being that you like pasta and bread, here is an idea. Buy organic wheat berries (which is what they use to make flour). Soak them over night and make them into a porridge the next morning. That is your starter.Now put some wheat berries in a flat glass baking pan. Add water up to the top of the "berries". They will start to sprout and dry out. Add water twice a day until the berries are two or three times their original size. Make porridge from the sprouted wheat berries and/or put them on other food you eat. This is your intermediate step.Do the above but continue watering them until a green shoot starts growing. This is called wheat grass. Saute the sprouted wheat grass with onions or potatoes. Voila, you have learned to eat and like greens!
Forget the haters. Yes, they are probably a tad overcooked compared to what the co called experts say is correct, but I would still shove them in my piehole with a shiteating grin on my face. 
Late to the party, but one of my elderly white teachers called a black student a "dirty cotton picker" in frustration. Needless to say that didn't go so well.
there are guides in the KSP wiki I'm fairly sure, but I would follow any advice for planes in NEAR/FAR now that the stock aero has a good portion of NEAR/FAR code in it.  The basic premise of it looking "plane-like" (especially now that 1.0 has better aerodynamics), with the normal control surfaces (ailerons, rudder, elevators).  You also need to look at the Centre of Mass vs Centre of Lift.  CoL should be just to the rear of CoM for a good plane - I normally aim so the middle of the CoL bubble is aligned with the rear of the CoM bubble.  But try further forward and further back and see what works.Aero characteristics will also change based on speed and altitude (air density).  So a plane that works well at sea level doing 200m/s may not work well at 15km doing 800m/s.You also want something pretty stable if you are doing a suborbital hop like that..  it's a fairly steep re-entry.
I think everybody suffers from it, to a degree. People want to know that their tastes are good. But, there's a fine line between that, and feeling like you *shouldn't* like something because some random tastemakers say you shouldn't, for whatever reason.    I mean, half the responses here so far are legitimate talents that are labelled as... something. 
I think Jameis was told to stay home since Roger Goodell didn't want to shake hands and take pictures with him because of his past.  I think they also told Mariota to stay home since to squash the controversy of the #1 pick not being there.
Aren't we going to be close enough that it will have some consequences here on earth? Most noticeably that it'll blow a portion of out atmosphere off (this is what I've heard anyway). 
Well, fusions are pretty much never generic. Only one I can think of is First of the Dragons. And fusions need poly or something to summon. The idea is that decks that can summon fusion monsters can only summon a limited number of fusion monsters. Where's XYZ and Synchro decks can pretty much summon every monster. 
yeah it is pretty lucky i guess =) obviously i'd want to get things done as fast as i could but i would do anything for the safety of the fish first and foremost =). the only reason i chose these specific damsels instead of like yellow tails is because (at least from all the research i've done so far and people i've asked) are extremely docile and are not like any other species of damsels at all i know that the flame angel can get aggressive if not added last and that orchid dottybacks are one of the most peaceful dottyback but can be aggresive towards things in their territory but the rest (only saying from what i've heard were relatively peaceful) have you had any of them or heard any bad things about any of these fish? thanks =)
My personal experience from using crossfire(7770s before going to a single 7970) is that when it works, yeah 7950-7970 performance(I did my crossfire when BF3 was popular and had no hassles). Once you enter a game that either is iffy or you have to manually make it work yourself then it gets tiresome. Did I enjoy my Crossfire experience? Heck yeah. Would I do it again? No, I'm unfortunately not a fan of the minor nuisances that can potentially come with it.I'm quite positive that /r/hardware has people who ended up loving it, having a distaste of it, or ending up in between.
I agree.. Outside of turn 1 it isn't really that great. However, without e tele access, I feel like it is better because it's even more difficult to open with a combo. DS can help mitigate that 
[I currently enjoy New Belgium's Ranger Beer](http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=c35e8a3e-0a8c-404d-8b74-b03fe3e90c44&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Hygiene&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_content=Ranger&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwpYeqBRDOwq2DrLCB-UcSJAASIYLjXsgARWGLWkWKNvkfaZ0EWzHD5SWvDR1CW8OMohv0DhoCFfXw_wcB). Great IPA flavor and it's 187 cals per bottle. Plus at 6.5% it's not the strongest but it definetly packs a stronger punch than say Bud Light which is somewhere around 4%. Also those light beers are around 100 cals but taste like shit and I feel like you have to drink twice as much too get drunk. I much prefer getting something with flavor but keeping it under 200 cals per bottle/can. Ballast Point Sculpin IPA is phenomenal also but at 210 cals per I start to get a little guilty.  
steelbeck earned that spot. Rekkles can go suck a dick, it was his choice to leave, and now he goes crawling back like an injured little cub who made the mistake of not listening to his mother.
hmm that's true.  Thanks for the advice.  I've got it to the point where my closest approach is 3.1 km, so hopefully I can get to there and then maneuver to close the gap...here goes nothing...
Came here to say *Network*. Then *The Godfather Part II*. Since both of those have been taken, I'll throw out *Lincoln*, which is a bad film that is saved by an absolutely spectacular cast.
I love Earth Burger in north SA, especially the bbq and the fish less filet. They are the same people that run Green. Beware both are closed on Saturdays. It's really really really good. BBQ revolution in Austin I thought was just OK..maybe I had it on a bad day. In Austin I LOVE the Vegan Nom taco truck. 
Lone Druid bear can now solo towers, Nature's Prophet treant damage buff and new aghs, new Boots of Travel can teleport to heroes, high ground some what easier to push... and some other stuff, I think. Doesn't really have anything to do with comeback gold but yeah.
I go to metal shows, but I know OF shows can be quite rowdy. Now, that said, Earl's pretty chill, as is his music, but the crowd will most likely be OF peeps.If you're weary about a rowdy crowd, or moshing, just stand either 13-15 heads back from the stage, or cram yourself up against it. There's usually pretty good etiquette about moshing, so if you're outside the pit you shouldn't get crammed in. If you're concerned about falling/getting pummelled, it's also good etiquette for people to create space and help you up so you're not trampled.Though, most of this is learned from metal shows, where etiquette is necessary because shit gets crazy.If this isn't what you're asking at all and just want to know about buying tickets, fuck, I don't know. GL. :D

That's also just long term bankruptcy. It's not "forgiven". It balloons up and then you pay taxes on it. 20 years is going to bring about some interesting economic times. 
There was a time when I got so worked up over football that when I was asked not to yell when watching a game with my grandma I burst a blood vessel in my eye. I don't get that worked up about football anymore, I just try and enjoy it.
If looks are the only thing you are worried about you have made it the most important thing. I don't think you need to be punished for not having to worry about child care costs or insurance either but when the economics and other real life logistics are taken care of it lets us worry about other things. You are choosing to worry about this particular topic. I think for example because I am a pediatric nurse and I know the multitude of unplanned things that can happen in childhood I would worry about other things and that is driven by the particular slice of live I spend a lot of time in. It is natural because you are a 10/10 as described by your husband you focus on looks. We react to the particular things that shape our direct experience.

Sure, don't read the verses I cite, I won't read what you cite. I read the Torah in Hebrew, have you? Because God's covenant with Adam isn't a legal one like with Moses pertaining to specific things.
video yes, repair notes no (I just found them when I got my own 2612 because I'm a geek). Although I am interested in taking on watch repair or design as a hobby. 
&gt; He was, once again, seeing what he wanted. But Bruce died. Period.I don't agree.  At the end of the movie, you see Bruce with Selina Kyle.  We, as members of the audience, know that Bruce and Selina ended up making up and becoming allies towards the end of the film.  But all Alfred knew of her was that she was the thief at the beginning of the movie.  The majority of that relationship building occurs *after* he's left Wayne Manor.  Alfred would have no way of knowing at the end of the movie that Bruce is likely with Selina; as far as he knows they last saw each other when she ran off at the beginning of the film.  So we know that Alfred is seeing reality, since he's seeing something he couldn't have predicted.  
I'd use a tung oil finish, not straight tung oil but anything to protect the wood. On my walnut and maple wrist rest I used Arm-R-Seal to seal it, which is a wipe-on oil based poly-urethane.
I always felt that's what gave the original Terminator movies their charm. They embraced the paradox. In T1, Conner himself is a paradox. In T2 SKynet is the paradox. I kinda wished they had done something deeper with it, but instead things just seemed to get sillier and sillier.
I've been in the Seagate camp since I have 4 out of 4 going strong, and a bunch of failed WD laptop drives.One external Seagate from 2009 did stop working with usb, but I took it out of the case and put it in my desktop and it's been good for 3 years.I might diversify in the future so I don't get too biased in any direction.
Honestly, the policy that Jagex has for updating on Mondays does lead to bugs snaking their way into the content.As a glitcher, I look forward to every Monday *because* of the possibility of glitches being born/reborn from the updates. Even now, there are some interesting things you can do with the recent updates to Legendary Pets that could have been avoided had there been more time to test and smooth over the problems.
Yes, I feel like that quite often. I like but also hate being alone, I like it because I am not forced to have fun according to other peoples standards but at the same time I hate it because I feel left out and as if I am missing out on life. (M, 20)
Engineering Physics with a minor in Computer Science. And as for your stats, I know math isn't always for everyone, but do you really think you're putting as much effort in as you should? I've lied to myself about things like that too.
"She's like the wind"- Patrick Swayze Before FH and were engaged we were hanging out with a group of friends and talking about weddings and first dances and he jokingly said that if we get married that should be our dance song. I said "ok!" And it's just kinda stuck. I think it's pretty silly and that's ok because I'm thinking if I'm laughing, hopefully I won't cry because just thinking about first dances makes me tear up! 
My friends kid brother used to do that, the cats refused to use the litter box afterwards and were left outside because of it. Cats aren't like people that can share a toilet with strangers. 
Holy shit, I was in the same boat.I was told by my psychologist that I should just give up and see if I could get a job because it would be 'easier'. We moved a few months after that and I got into community college (thanks to a great charter) at 16, AA in Anthropology at 18.
I definitely remember a lot of the regulars and feel like you can see distinct characteristics that come through in limited ways based on their humor, writing style, and positions on various issues. There are certainly those I've come to like and some I don't, just like any group. It's also fun to notice SRD regulars in other places and vice-versa. I especially like it when I see people commenting in SRD that I just sort of thought of as "above" this kind of subreddit
Allowed... no.Required... yes.My grandfather was in charge of an army base during WW2... yeah, it was wartime, but if you were caught on base without a loaded weapon, you were in for it.
Every effects heavy movie, because CGI gets dated quickly.Most superhero movies, because either the world will get sick of them or the bar will be raised so high that current ones can't compete (Spiderman and X Men were awesome when the came out. In 2008 the game changed and they don't really hold up).The Harry Potter movies, on account of the first two already seeming so dated (and I love most of the movies in that series).Juno, but I think the general consensus is already that it's aged poorly.
They're somewhat related in mechanism of action, so it's definitely possible benzos can cause this.But yeah, ambien seems to cause these waking blackouts more from what I heard!
Right. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from the Old Testament. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
Thanks.A few more quick questions if you don't mind:Whats your skill order? Is it true you're not supposed to level up your ult?I played against a chaac and I got ripped :( is it a hard matchup or do I just suck?Also, last question, do you feel like baka falls off late game? I think the true damage is not as potent after a while and hunters seem to do more dmg to me than I do to them.

Kettlebell swings will reduce fat and add muscle to your ass. I won't promise it will make it smaller, but I will promise it will make it more shapely. 
I used to have that happen quite a bit back when I used an ego.  Best method is just to use a pair of pliers (needle nose works best if available) and twist it off. You might break apart the atomizer but chances are it needs replaced anyways if you're not getting any vapor.
Sports fans react hysterically and cry when their favorite team wins, and no one bats an eye. So why is it surprising when music fans react the same way when their favorite groups release new music? Fans are emotionally attached to their favorite teams/groups/shows, etc. This level of emotional attachment isn't limited to K-Pop. 
Sometimes with C25K, you need to go back a step or two while your body recovers. A couple things I've learned about running (severe asthmatic here), listen to your body and don't worry if you have to repeat an earlier stage a few times before you progress to the next stage.C25K is a great program but it doesn't always take into account things like asthma, weight, etc. When I tried it, I got stuck at week 3 for about 3 weeks before I was able to progress. The important thing is stick to it.
I just do not get this. Put the prices higher or pay your staff better, you know? I should not be expected to leave a fucking tip for poor service so businesses can get out of paying their employees properly. That goes against the very definition and purpose of tips.
False... more often than not, score ups are the superior cards to go with...The only time I would use a PL over a scorer is if the PL has a 250 stat advantage over the scorer...The numbers can be broken down, but someone already did that a while ago... it was potential pts vs actual pts (or something like that)
He was awarded the pigasus award 3 times for endorsing quackery. The only person to win it 2 years in a row, and the only person with 3 wins.He supports things such as renkei (energy therapy) and faith healing, and continued to win the award for continuing to believe in magic and miracles.He heavily promoted green coffee bean's as a wait loss "miracle". The company that made the beans got hit with a 3.5 million dollar fine for false medical claims.
I would say that institutions and structures matter a huge deal, and that changing the institutions that black people in America interface with would make big differences.So for instance, Pinker points to the modern nation state's monopoly on legitimate force as a major factor.  Changing that circumstance around people will change their behavior without changing their nature.  And making the use of police power less racist would I think result in great improvements in the economic conditions of black Americans, without changing their nature, just their circumstances.But just telling them to work harder doesn't change those institutions or structures, and is pointless.
I've never taken one under those circumstances. Only during "wtf my period is 9 days later than it has ever been in my life, and I have sex pretty consistently, sooo... shit?" kind of circumstances.

Its happened to me three times in 10 years of running. Luckily I was out in the sticks every time it happened but one time I was wearing a white under armour top, white shorts, black compression legging and white socks. I chose to use the shorts to wipe because I had a long way to run back and my feet wouldve been ruined running with no socks. It was a good choice.
What you gotta do is hold open the door 2/4th of way so the first fat person will have to open the door wider to get thru making them now the holder of the door then the group will follow suit. You make your way inside once you're not the door holder and you will still get a thank you.
I see a lot of people on here saying that he is more talented than ospina is. Can someone explain to me why they think that? In what way has he shown that he's more 'talented'?

I'm fairly new, just hit 30 on ACN and haven't got a job yet; is there a better way to manage or track dots? The tiny green numbers aren't good enough for me
I used to run on very little sleep, like an hour or two. I would supplement with red bulls and sugary drinks. Eventually I exhausted myself to the point of collapse, which was accelerated by having mono, a lymph-node infection and a sinus infection. Imagine being exhausted, but not being able to lay down because there is so much sinus pressure that you feel as if your head will explode. My lymph-nodes were swollen and I was delirious with exhaustion to the point of hallucinating. I was pissing blood and was jaundiced... Fun times.
I have actually. Amiibo got me into wanting to try more games as a whole ever since launch. Why buy characters for a game you've never played or never intend to play? (Fire Emblem aside, Sorry I just hate turn based RPGS) I think Amiibo has made me more open to trying much more things.
I think she was confused by the incredibly strange arguments Rand Paul was making. Did you see her eyes go "WTF?!?" when he started equating "the right to healthcare" with actual slavery.
This isn't fair.  Like at all.The Empire absolutely steamrolls the U.S.  RA3 takes place in the 1980s, and the factions all have tech far more advanced than anything IRL 1980s had.  No nuking Japan?  Give America 100 nukes and it wouldn't even come close.  WW2 America doesn't have ICBMs, so it would rely on B-29s to deliver the atom bombs.  These 100 B-29s will make it exactly three miles out into the open ocean before they get obliterated by Sea Wings or Rocket Angels or Jet Tengus or Striker VXs or ANYTHING.Even the tiny Tsunami Tank carries a rapid-fire 88 mm APDS gun, completely outclassing pretty much all the American tanks, while a King Oni could simply stomp its way across an entire American city unopposed.  Mecha/Jet Tengus alone can establish complete air-superiority.  Forget Shogun Battleships, just a mixture of Naginatas, Yaris, and Sea/Air Wings could do the trick.
It was so fast I wasn't entirely sure it was in.  The commentators on HNIC barely reacted and seemed unsure whether it was a goal and on top of that there was very little reaction from the crowd.Was kinda weird.
AGSSDHKSKHSDGHKGSHSKGSHKDGSKG Anger is winning over rational thought AHHHHHH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TRULY MAKES ME NOT THINK LOGICALLY IS HOLOCAUST DENIAL OF REAL FACTS I'M SORRY.That's... messed up. It's illegal in most countries.
I think there was real, very legitimate interest on our side - Titans just didn't take the deal. I think the Titans are the reason why Mariota isn't in Philly right now, not because we didn't pony up enough.At any rate my reaction was "Whew".
If you don't mind giving "just money", giving him paysafecards gives him the option to use those all at once to buy a gem pack, while offering you the option of buying (and thus gifting) them separately.
I doubt they checked people for dual citizenships. I have a friend from South Africa who became an American citizen last year but his family is originally from the Netherlands. So the rioters would just let him pass through?
I'm a patient phone owner. I've got my current phone (which is my first Android smartphone) for over 3 years now. I'm getting frustrated with it however and I'm already saving money for something new. the fact that I don't buy my phones from my operator helps with controlling the itch. I'm a student and I don't earn any money, so I can't afford the latest and greatest every half a year. 
Paladin I feel is an obvious choice, you can play around with stuff like they showed in class challenge with buffs on dragonkin sorcerer, you have consort, now corruptor is out, lots of pally options.  Priest is also looking pretty promising, I have so much stuff I want to try this is my FAVORITE time new meta is unsettled, going to see a lot of cool new stuff! but also a lot of face hunter to punish experimenters ;)
Sure seems this way. In general I myself wouldn't want kids unless I found a suitable partner that really made me feel safe having them. That's the part that I think will keep me from having any.
*80, and I had forgotten about the pen.... The 5% per 10% missing isn't that much (10 bonus damage per 10% at 200 power). Still, hou yi's buff only works on one God at a time, whereas xballer's lasts as long as he can sustain it and chains his aa's to other enemies
Meh my experience as a former Best Buy employee (might not be the same for everyone else) was that the advertised laptop might not be there, but they always had 2 other models (from other brands) with the same CPU, HDD etc. at the same price, always in stock. I'm no BBY shill by any means knowing the way they treat their employees, but my understanding was they lost $25 on every laptop under ~$500 dollars anyway (making their money back by selling you overpriced services, cables, accessories, etc.).
I really think the 400 cr is too low for firing a weapon at an unwanted target.  I like the idea of being friendly/allied with the faction means the security forces share the scan information, or if they are actively firing on the target then it is shared with everyone in the area.  That would fix this issue and also makes sense in the universe.
Haha - I thought that too.I am a big, angry looking foreigner so I guess the meek and mild local that tried to reserve their table with a tissue packet didn't confront me...Thanks for the tissues too...
Ok i know there is mo cure for it. That was more of a hyperbole than anything. I was just saying that signing a board wouldnt do anything for the cause

Mariota, cause fuck our last three first round picks.. lets make it 4The same la'el collins that's been taken out of almost all big boards?Our plan was BPA and i think we followed it pretty well, while also finding guys who can make immediate impact.   We tried trading back to no avail, and our warroom were unanimous with Collins, he's a horrible coverage safety which is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what we need. 
Hi there, thanks for keeping us in the loop.Thank you, also, for being proactive and invested in your daughters healthcare. That may seem odd, but not everyone is like that- unfortunately.Regarding your two questions: there isn't much more information that can be provided. -CBC is a sensitive test. There are factors that can skew results. In this particular instance, there's no way to know *what* could have caused altered results, if anything at all.-As far as maybe concerning, no one can (should) answer that here. 
Like /u/Drumada says, there are several times where he can only go on because someone bursts in with miracle evidence or the prosecution just allows it.Examples:[1-4](#s cross examining a parrot would never fly under any circumstances whatsoever).[3-3](#s Gumshoe saves the day with the exact evidence Phoenix needs after he stalls for a ton of time).I'm sure there are more, I just can't think of them right now.Edit: Thanks to /u/JesusMonroe for correcting me on the cases.
I just wanted to lie on the internet. Never went this deep before. Glad I was appropriately downvoted oddly enough. Shows the system working :') eidt: vape adventures AWAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
So the flowchart then becomes:Would you, or have you, eaten a rare steak or accepted a blood transfusion?Would you or have you had sexual intercourse outside of marriage or been remarried?Would you support laws enforcing the above on everyone in your country, regardless of whether they share your faith?If no to any of the above, shut up about gay marriage. Correct?
Oh Tampa. There's a reason you're the Bucs. What a mess. Start scouting freshmen on College now for the next Bucs QB. Downvote away pirate flag bros. 
_Can_ is the fun word here. Do I want to trust that the fucker who shot up a couple kids _can_ change, and his good behavior shows he's ready to be a valuable part of society again? No. No I do not.
If you have actual forensic/criminal activity which you haven't yet disclosed to a professional, which may be construed as immediately threatening the safety of yourself or others, psychologists and psychiatrists are legally mandated to take note and in some cases inform the authorities. If this is post-hoc after the fact counselling you want, there are a few good psychologists/psychiatrists who specialise in forensic case management. Whether you can see them as an off the street consultation is another matter. Your Psychology Clinic is a good bet, i have clients with long criminal histories currently ah,  sort of involved in stuff, who see them and have no problems.
You know, I've never had bad food poisoning from a Taco Bell, but one of the worst food poisoning episodes, not the worst mind you, was from a higher-end restaurant. The worst episode was from an IHop. it came out from BOTH ends that time.

Haha I told him to make a review on this same thread. I think I'm liking the way yours is put together more, honestly. His doesn't sound that good, even though it may be better then FT clones.
I think people don't like that quote because of the implication that their "best" is something actually worth putting up with their "worst" for, but the stereotype for people who use the quote itself is that this isn't the case.
it's not incorrect really, it's just what he thinks and you disagree. he isn't even saying there is anything wrong with it. it's a much more open minded statement than yours.
I just looked at the status website today, and it looks like they 'received 4 more phones today. They were appraised at $17-18, which is what I sent them in for, since they wouldn't turn on. They will probably send out the GCs for them at ~4am like they did last week.
I'm not a hateful person, nor do I fit into the "not weird" category, but for god's sake, put a little bit of effort into how you look, and people will treat you so much better. I get it, it's stupid, and vain, and shallow, and nobody cares in the grand scheme of things, but it just makes focusing in class and getting good grades so much easier.

Defense of Apartheid versus a racist communist party. White people benefited from racism?Did they benefit from the Barbary coast you overwrought fool.
Oh I get what you're saying. It do, if you wanna be anal about it, I am talking about indie sidescrollers. Happy? I wanna explain what Im trying to say, but srsly, I just have no time to explain myself to a hipster. 
It really isn't when you think about how much people are like you. You probably hang around people that are in peak physical condition so it seems like BMI is a broken system. We e in reality BMI could apply correctly to most people. Although it's much easier to tell if someone is obese or just muscular with pictures IMO. 
That's too bad, but at least you have some friends who watch anime! I have a few too, but our tastes don't *perfectly overlap*, if you know what I mean. They're not as into it as I am, which is probably better for me honestly, keeping me from getting too obsessed. It does make it a bit harder to talk about though.If you go to a gym, that also might have the same effect as working out with your friends. Too bad you have to pay.
I'm 20. I grew up in the ghetto. I know how it goes. People like him take jabs at other people over the most trivial things because they can't formulate any type of substantial argument, and when you call them out on their bullshit, they won't ever admit they're wrong.Either way though, there's no excuse for acting like a criminal. He knows what he's doing 
This whole article is beautiful.&gt; Roselyn Michelle Roberts, a 43-year-old grandmother, faced two charges of fourth-degree theft and burglary. The court heard that Roberts suffered from manic depression and earned around $60 a week babysitting her grandchild. The state’s attorney argued for a $50,000 bail. Judge Owens revised the figure to $100,000 citing two pending cases against her and a record of eight prior convictions.A few more people like Judge Owens there and Baltimore might stand a chance.&gt; Inmates appeared before Judge Flynn Owens from the Baltimore City Detention Center via videolink. They routinely requested via their public defenders for bail figures to be lowered. Often this was denied and in some cases bail figures put forward by the state’s attorney were increased by Judge Owens.
I feel like people who spew this type of rhetoric are people who've never been to the ghetto or lived there. I grew up there, went to shitty zoned schools, but worked my ass off in school and went to college. People in the same area/school had the same opportunities as me, they decided that the government will take care of them like it does their parents, so they drop out of high school. When they're working shit jobs with no future they decide to blame society for failing them. 
Do you drive while high or around children?  If not, then you are not on my radar.  Keep it in your home.  If I find it, you will go to jail.  Do you deserve to go to prison?  That is up to the courts.  You know as well as I do what the law states.  I just enforce it.
I feel like with this build his early-mid power is almost the same but his late becomes very very strong. The squishies die anyway but he can also kill tanks really fast which are the biggest problem and because of the 40% cdr the enemy won't be able to get to lucian because he can almost dash 24/7
Very valid point. I think most view it as helping a life, instead of choosing who to help. Who is not to say the child they would have adopted isn't fine and well now? I guess we'll never know. What we do know is EJ is a great person regardless.
[](#su-flair-rosequartz) I think the true purpose of this show is to see how many qualifiers we can get to precede the word "gem" and still understand what we're talking about.
My understanding was that the credit unions' insurance was a sort of self-provided insurance - from the group of credit unions itself - so that is more risky if you consider that one credit union failing likely means that others will be failing or in trouble as well.
&gt;"I don't really need 13 rounds."Famous last words...A single 9mm round weighs less than 0.42 ounces, so you're trying to save a total of less than 3 oz by cutting your capacity in half? Jesus, that's fucking retarded.
Because the server would not send the sandbox client the information about the traps.   CoC's server won't send trap information until it has decided that your attack is starting.
Unlike some of my brethren I'll acknowledge that Dunleavy is sneaky dirty so I get being frustrated, but "he's young" is hardly an excuse. Most people have learned not to act that way long before they turn 20. 
I still play Marth because nobody else is as interesting to play. Also, Marth has bad approach options. He has to sign contracts with his aerials(all of them are unsafe on shield), grabs are very bleh and he doesn't have followups, and dash attack is next to pointless. Honestly Mr.E is the only thing keeping me from switching mains.
Yes your comment exactly. They didn't have it worse they had it *different*. Even if they feel they did better compared to their own childhoods it really doesn't excuse anything...
I'm white, and it is now my goal in life to adopt an asian baby and name it a stereotypically black name.  Something with a "qua" at the end sounds fitting.

Since this is a recent thing, has he shown any other behavioural changes? Changes in sleeping or eating habits? Inability to control himself or regulate emotion? Any other signs that mental illness could be developing? Could *he* be lying about something and projecting his own dishonesty on to you? I know this may be hard to think about, but could he possibly be having an affair? I don't know how many posts on this sub has started out like this one and end with the person finding out their SO was cheating. I'm not saying that's definitely the case but it, unfortunately, is a possibility.If you want to continue this relationship, he needs to see someone about his mistrust. Relationship counseling also would help work through whatever issues he seems to be having with not trusting you. If it is related to mental illness and not a guilty conscience, he really needs to see a medical doctor to diagnose and manage whatever is happening. 
League leading rusher =/= no talent, pretty much the best backfield in the whole NFL with Mathews and sproles.Edit: not changing original comment but i now realize he was talking about the titans,  my bad
Yes, I consider the ability to use my phone after it gets stuck on a boot logo as successful. A slightly crippled jailbroken is more useful than one that runs stock firmware for me you twat.
I would love to win, I'm a collector but I only have toon link and link. I work 2 part time jobs and I still managed preorder my brother a ness amiibo. Would love to win to add to collection and play with my neice and brother
they were gonna make a clothing group and i asked to help in the building of their old homestore. I said it was abit small and some unhelpful "HR" banned me. I was unbanned and accidently caused a giantic forum raid on the group so i guess they closed down and tried to make another homestore but apparently now its a cafe, I tell them a suggestion to stop using free models and it's a ban. Yeah they're not going well with the supermarket thing either
While me being a nutritionist i have learned that the body does not want to store fat. Storing excess calories as fat actually takes another step making the body spend energy to turn the excess calories into fat. And a big reason as to why people gain the weight back is because they set goals and when they achieve the goals they go back to their old normal eating habits, forgetting about the diet. 
Laughed when I realized this makes Sierra a literal barrel racer, then even harder seeing them try to execute the strategy. It looked ridiculous, and Rodney wasn't even moving forward.
Mine grew a full inch in less than 3 weeks. I have photo proof of 3 weeks, but I'm pretty sure it was over 3 specific days. Oh, look, there are your ankles. Thank heavens for shorts and summertime.

I just loaded a saved survival game and can't place any blocks when the jetpack is on.  If it's off (standing or falling) it works.Hope this gets hot fixed.  Haven't tried with a new game but it would still suck if we lose our saved worlds.  I know its an alpha so, yea whatever, just a bummer....Edit: Continued testing shows it only occurs in 3rd person view
I've been in a sexless, loveless marriage for 12 years and I wish I could just die. I have ptsd from being raped as a teenager. I have suffered many breakdowns. Quit driving, quit working. I've become a complete shut in. I've just now starting driving again. I want to leave my husband, but I have no where to go. I'm outta state and my parents are both deceased.
I'm German but I love Heineken right out of the barrel. I haven't tried so much different beers. When you know some good I can get here in Germany, tell me!
Not a damn thing! I knitted her a throw and she uses it as a cover on her couch cushion so her dog can lay on it. I knitted her a set of dishcloths &amp; a hand towel in her favorite yellow with her favorite animal (owl) &amp; she keeps complaining that they're not very good potholders (no matter how many times I tell her they're not potholders). I told her she was getting no more knitting from me because she hurt my feelings and she said I was too sensitive, that Happy (her dog) loves the throw and I should be flattered....that her dog...loves the throw I lovingly knitted for her.
Well this means no patch for next week for sure, else the hot fix wouldn't been neccessary :/(btw bug still works in try mode but is fixed for the other modes)
No, they are free. There is the option to spend money to buy them if you don't want to farm up ip. It's the same exact way League's champions are. You can buy with ip or rp.
If I remember my patch notes correctly, the offset times were intentionally introduced when they made night darker once. The idea being if for whatever reason you don't like the current time of day on your continent, you can hop to one of the others. 
The guy's guard was already lowered, he didn't put up any resistance whatsoever. You do realize its ok for people to find the humor in their day to day lives without having an ulterior motive?
I use a G13. It's not only great for gaming, but using the macro's in situations like programming is also handy. The LCD display is also really nice for things like MSI Afterburner, so I can monitor my GPU Temps, Frame rate, GPU usage and whatnot without having it displayed on screen in a distracting manner.

It depends on techniques employed. Also, you should look into some of the current AI research. I would be surprised if we don't have a true self improving, superhuman intelligent AI in my lifetime. We don't need 'Human' like intelligence, just something that can solve problems. We're already very nearly there. Imagine something that could solve physics problems as well as Einstein. Only one genius typically emerges per generation of man. Imagine we made one intelligence as smart at problem solving as Einstein. Already, we have a mind that can access all the information on the 'net, and never sleeps, never rests, just chugs away, like a concept engine, thinking about physics. Now make 1000 of them, put them in a room and have them work together, 24/7. Now make one for every problem humanity needs a solution for. That's not the kind of intelligence you're going to have a conversation with, but it would literally change the world over night. Every night. 
I'm sure our generation had its share of trashy, disrespectful little fucks, but because we didn't have the ability to record anything, anywhere, anytime we can't really do a legit comparison.
Sheesh, I feel like I'm going to be drinking smoothies all day and then eating oreos/sweet chili heat doritos in between just to get my calories up.On paper having to eat thousands of calories sounds pretty awesome, but no one ever tells you that eating will become an absolute chore.
here's the story:I altered the greninja page and then some how inspect element became a thing on this sub.All the other posts of inspect element got more upvotes even though they were either bad or good.I am suprised an idea I had now made Inspect Element a thing even though I didn't want it to be the new spongebob.
Unless its craft beer then No way.  Drink German beers.  Seeing as they actually have a law on what ingredients go into beer.  I prefer my beer without fish bladder or insect based Dyes to get the colour right.  
real talk tho, DAE feel like ru is being more bitchy now when talking to da queens in the werqroom? I feel like she doesn't care about the queens at all. Someone who listened to a podcast once even commented here RU DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE QUEENS NAMES!I feel like I care more about them than Ru. I totally stalk Pearl's instagram everyday and am BFFs with Violet on twitter.I feel like I could be a better judge than ru tbh
What does scale test mean exactly? There's already buildings and features. Do you think they have that much more planned? This is the community map project right? Key word being "community"This map is in need of some serious help. We need to throw some serious ideas and concepts out there before it's too late and DICE settles on some recycled buildings and huts randomly scattered around the jungle and calls it done.I'll up vote any post that enriches the map.
That was intentional. Some problems have neat but arbitrary effects that would otherwise not be used. If in construction a problem feels like a good to choice to put in, even if the deck itself is unable to solve it, then go for it.

Not even fence posts the fences themselves.And then when you see them disappear and you shoot through it, I dont think the shot actually connects. I once shot a fence, it crumbled and revealed a tank behind it. No lions, nothing.Like does the shell really lose that much power by hitting what is essentially an iron stick?

How would you merge them? If they were all 26 dollars then the equation would be y=26xIf they were all half off it would be y=26x/2 or y=13x but the y's aren't equal.
I don't think most of these people making judgements have the experience to understand the difference between a pointed weapon and a weapon held at the side. The difference in immediate threat is huge, no human can react in the time it takes to pull a trigger, it's impossible. I'm as angry with unjustified police shootings and brutality as the next guy, but we must recognize there are times when a shooting is justified. A person pointing a weapon is one of those times regardless of intentions; no one can read that person's mind. I read you as saying a casually held weapon is a situation where calm and talking may be an option, but a leveled weapon is a situation requiring action. I don't think anyone familiar with guns would argue this with you. 
Job advertisements don't really mean much, especially since most companies have one advertisement (e.g. new grad developer) expecting to hire hundreds of employees.
Hi, Flint!We try to avoid hard numbers in our sub. Such things as population statistics aren't really present in the ASOIAF literature, and we try to avoid mechanics in favor of storytelling.  That being said, as the only player in House Flint, you are free to establish the leader of Flint's Finger. We ask that players be courteous and try to leave room for future players who could be interested in the role. The best way to do that is to keep things as vague as possible. Thanks!
That's actually not true... at the end there is the sign shown in the picture, right before 129 starts, but at the beginning it says "Cars may use shoulder 7am to 10am Mon-Fri."

When I first started, I honestly had no clue what I did; but I had an 4* anima farlon lead with bb 10 and a random team that auto battled through the Vampire + Douglas dungeon
Definitely this.  I got spoiled when I first started drinking coffee because my dad would import beans from Costa Rica, and I would drink that brew black.  Then I'd get a Starbucks coffee black and just be like "Blegh, this needs cream to actually taste good".  I've recently switched to tea, but I still enjoy good coffee.

It was a big glob of yucky "hollandaise sauce". It didn't taste that great. It wasn't runny at all, just a glob. I've had hollandaise sauce before which was so much more decadent and tasty.

Oooo! I grow radishes since they grow so quickly so I don't get disappointed with my garden early in the season, but now I have more than just a salad to eat them with! I love pickled anything. 
I did this. I was trying to focus on improving my anxiety issues and felt that I need to learn to be alone for a bit, so I told him that I wasn't ready for a relationship yet. He was understanding about it, but then later asked me on a date anyway. I said yes and I'm so glad I did!
I suppose with metal being ever more plentiful as it tends to be, less people are going into key and up trading. For example, I can't nowadays since I don't spend a cent, whereas I used to be able to work in keys.
Damn, that's quite a lot of sources.The funny thing is that this has inspired some of the most thought-out debate I've seen in a while on this subreddit. Sure, it illustrates the positive and negative viewpoints, but a discovery this radical may spark a new interest in astrophysics and more.
It can be really hard for many to open up to friends and family about being vegan, especially when in your teens. Always keep in mind that as you get older these social stigmas are not nearly as harsh, and the longer you go along with your lifestyle the more confident and knowledgeable you will be. So dealing with criticism and judgment becomes easier and easier, and most families eventually will come to understand you once you have shown a commitment and have remained healthy and positive. Avoid preaching to them until they accept it, or ever.That being said, I don't like the coming out comparison. Originally coming from a small town where pretty much every person fished lobster, I understand the social problems that come with being veg. (Although I was vegetarian at the time, not vegan.) But the experience of coming out as gay just has more gravity to it. I understand the analogy you are making but I would not put them in the same category.
May 1 is the same here. "Tag der Arbeit" in Germany. (Calling it labour day and then you don't even have to work... lovin' it)I've tried but it seems it's one of those that will try to make you cry as much as possible. ...and I'm not really into feels and crying.

Maybe its just me, but her combat style seems a bit sluggish and heavy-handed compared to how I imagined her fighting in the books. Especially since her main advantages as a swordsman are her speed and agility given her smaller build. Also, I'm a bit disappointed with the way they've implemented her blink ability as a replacement for her dodging normally. Especially given the fact that she was trained to fight like witchers, and is capable of executing all of the same maneuvers as Geralt.
It always strikes me as weird when companies don't actually release information on their official website, but instead uses only social media.  Call me old fashioned, but seeing the patch notes on their official website instead of a Facebook post feels much more professional.  
I'm not sure why you'd do that. Why would you be against him making money in any case?deleted comment was about how he was going to re-enable adblock if critikal was making money. 
For sure. They are basically the "face" of Warcraft. I really felt that towards the end of Cataclysm when Thrall was standing alongside all the dragon aspects. He looked so awkwardly out of place.
I know there was a recall on the 1st gen tacomas... I actually was able to easily put a hammer through the frame before I took it in, they gave me the KBB value.  Got another tacoma... we will see how it holds up in the salt belt. 
This area has always been relatively affordable but mostly populated by police and firemen which was pretty big deterrent to any would be nogoodniks moving in. Most of the civil servants in the area are hitting retirement age and moving to more hospitable climates couple that with gentrification in other parts of the city.Also, Principal Skinner would like to see you in his office. 
That was wonderful! You should continue drawing these stories as each milestone progresses of your daughter and family. Maybe gift it to her for her 18th birthday or something. 
But modders don't have to worry about what is balanced or overpowered - they just create the mod for other people who are interested to use. When Mojang adds something to Minecraft, *everybody* is stuck with it.
Neal Adams, as artist on Batman in the 70s made a concentrated effort, working with writer Denny O'Neil to do a more serious Batman. They introduced Ra's Al Ghul, and purposefully pushed Batman away from the POW BAM ZONK that the Adam West show popularized, wanting to tell stories more in line with the earliest Batman comics from 1939, which were darker (if not very refined.)Part of this was having people who grew up reading Batman for the first time working on the book as writer and artist, as prior to that point we had folks from a previous generation who hadn't experienced these characters as fans. As a consequence, the comics started to be aimed at an older audience, and the maturity level rose. Edit: Please see /u/GirlGargoyle post for the followup to how Dark Knight Returns changed Batman's perception.
I don't think it works like that. The ones who stayed were the ones who didn't have a problem to begin with. If you don't have a problem, you don't have to endure anything. But now the situation changed completely for the ones who stayed, so they should have a problem now. But it's solved by declaring that they're now motivated by proving themselves to the teacher, which is the exact opposite of what they did before.
Whoa there son, no hero ever _removes_ code from an Enterprise codebase. If they wanted _less_ code, they'd work in an ML or a Lisp. You only work in Java if you want to froth out out hundreds of lines per feature.
Yep, I've done all that. Put my stash into e-liquid-recipies, and checked out what others were making with those flavors. Also made my second order (the imgur link at the bottom of my post) based on what others have made in monthly recipe and clone threads. Guess I just wanted to reach out in another avenue :)

i agree that there's too much content. I have 5gb a month on my internet and it's free data from 12-5 AM. I have five hours in the middle of the night to watch or download content to watch later. I really had to cut down on everything i watched in the past and mainly stick to achievement hunter, as their long videos give me the msot bang for my buck, os to speak. 
I barely remember anything outside of school before 9th grade. My life is still mundane but damn there is nothing in my memory from those younger times.
You do have some pretty good points! I guess it just comes down to preference! I like the whole sloppy street fighter/lunatic gimmick and performing style. But that's just me!

I have ADHD and grade school was pretty rough for me performance wise and my 3rd grade teacher wrote on a report of my performance that it was a shame I couldn't be lobotomized to make my life easier.
This is the correct answer.  They probably won't be looking to get rid of any other cheap players either, but theoretically anyone else could get lumped into a package deal.
yes, even though i try to strategically place seeds to pop a new group up. it takes way too damn long for them to spawn, then run back into the fight. it's almost like you're useless for the 2 seconds it takes to re-spawn them and have them hitting the enemy again. on top of that, seeds take a ton of energy, so unless you're CP (which seems extra bad now, since you're 90% reliant on munions), you're very limited on how much seed spam you can do.
definitely gonna check these things out! Just got back from the grocery store with some low salt/butter popcorn and some random raw veggies. Definitely will check out the berries idea. Love me some smoothies anyway if they dont work so well as muchies lol! Thanks!
And these same people who tell us to check our privilege are... what? American? Have an education? That either they have the ability to obtain through parent finances, their own ability to have a job, or through government/scholarship assistance? It's just so... Projective. They don't even realize that they have the very same privilege as the people they "attack".

And while there's no way to quantify it, it seems like a whole bunch of potential live-ball turnovers have bounced right back to the Bulls. Not sure if that's luck or something else is going on (overeagerness to get out on the break?).

Actually, the definition of "eradicated" in this context does not mean that the zero people catch the disease:&gt; Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Example: measles, poliomyelitis.[source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm)So, without vaccinations, the disease can reestablish itself.
I was at a party with adults and there were some teachers there. I heard a lot of this sort of stuff. The one I remember is the football coach that talked about a specific player that he said would end up nowhere because he's your basic thug and has absolutely no respect for his coaches.... The guy ended up in the NFL a few years later and has 2 Super Bowl Rings....Can't say I blame the teacher because I actually agreed with him at the time. 
Youll need to provision to configure the interfaces ahead of time, otherwise it is not required. Op, only power off the switches to add stack power cables. If the device is not in use, building it on the fly while powered up works fine. Your configs are stored in flash somewhere im pretty sure. Regardless, config, prioritize and then stack and it'll come right up.
Because the MTA is run by a bunch of greedy dumbfucks.Edit: ok that's not entirely fair for me to say. I did buy my monthly LIRR ticket at one of the machine kiosks using my Watch. 
Some games are programmed to or have the option to limit background usage. In league of legends for example, you can get 300 fps while playing, but as soon as you alt tab out the fps will go down to about 17.
We are a small minority of the overall population (about 3-5%), so you have to make special efforts to find your own kind. The best place to meet LGBT people is in organizations or places that cater to LGBT people. Your school may have a Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) or LGBT student group. Check your school's student directory, ask a school counselor, or check the organization listing on the school web site. Go early to meetings and stay after so you will have a chance to meet people and make new friends. You can do the same in the larger community, once you find a LGBT newspaper or organization, it may lead you to other LGBT community resources, groups, or events. Does your community have a pride event? The organization that puts this on might have a website that links to others. Community theater is also often something that LGBT people are associated with.
Yeah, definitely want trying to imply that Nico is better! Boris is excellent. Nico is much younger though, and if he leaves Portland I think we can mold him 
I love AirBnb, primarily because it allows me to live like a local. Plus, you can actually get some pretty nice places for a decent price. You do have to book at least a few days in advance, but if you want the best chance of getting a booking last minute, look for the ones that are instant reservation.
What is on the test, and at what are the qualifications for passing? Who decides these qualifications? What is the protocol with registered voters, does everyone need to reregister to vote and then take the test? How is the test proctored? Can you retake the test if you fail? Are states allowed to make their own versions of the test, or is it completely administered by the federal government?If people don't have a computer, how do they access these online resources? And yes, a lot of people in our country do not have access to a computer with internet. Look, I know you have good intentions with your idea but quite frankly, it is completely ignorant to think that any good could come of it. It would discriminate against the poor immensely and I can pretty much guarantee you no one on either side of the aisle would EVER support something like this.

Well, I said they are gougers because I've never been charged cover at Oar House before. But if it is the "damn" part you are concerned with, and you actually thought I was condemning them to eternal suffering in the fiery pits of hell, then sorry for the hyperbole. 
I've been in that projection booth; I used to work at PSC, though not in the IMAX department.  It's the same booth, though it looks practically empty without the giant platters for spooling the big filmstrips.  You can also look into the booth between shows; there's a window to the outside of the dome (but still inside the building, roughly opposite the bathrooms).   It has blackout curtains that close the window off during the shows. 
They maximize supination so it targets short head more effectively than a normal curl.  In fact if I had to choose only 1 bicep exercise, concentration curls would be it.  But if you fatigue the forearm flexors AND do concentration curls you can really kill the short head.&gt;I'm not sure if you were trying to come across as kind of funny but when providing ideas maybe ditch the condescending shit. I was trying to be funny.  I'm in no position in life to be condescending to anyone.

First off, congratulations to both of you for recognizing how intense having a baby is and how much work has to go into it. Secondly, it is completely normal to desire a child. Around your age and we aren't planning on trying for quite a few more years yet but I still feel a little sad every time my period comes because of a serious case of recurring, What Ifs. Make your baby bucket list, start saving and make you the best person you can in the time you have before your whole world changes.
It happens to all of us... lol.  I remember a few years ago, a similar thing happened to me.I was still living at home, doing everything out of just my small bedroom.  I'd go to the auctions and always tease my parents when leaving that I spent $1000's or bought tons of huge items... Then, one day I actually did buy 6-7000 NOS radio tubes and my parents laughed it off.  Needless to say, they weren't laughing when I got home that night with every inch of space in my car packed full of radio tubes... Yup, I've got my own place now! 
The thread from earlier this morning, it was created at a pretty EU friendly time and full of people mad at NA for leeching EU talent. I checked it again a few hours later and suddenly it's full of people pointing out that T8 is still all NA.It was a pretty weird thread tbh...
I've always been told, if it's a long fight, or if the healer/s mp goes below half (especially for WHM's) then click on Ballad. If you've got a coupla mages, click on Foe's. If you've got more melee/ranged, Paeon is good in downtimes between phases as it means it refreshes everyone when you group up 
"For the NFL draft, I want to make sure I look like a guy who sells ice cream at Disneyland."I get that this is not about fashion, but really:  Who the fuck told you to go out in public in that get up?
Im pretty sure they know exactly what's going on, they just feel uncomfortable about it. Unfortunately for them however they can't really say they practice what they preach.
oh i kinda addressed this with the guy above you in the thread but i dont do it to get back at them... thats kinda a plus. i do it to have proof that I am a dependable and safe seller.  on craigslist, nerves are a deal killer
Honestly, I feel like the ECW fans set a precedent in awesome and original chanting that made or broke wrestlers that's now been taken up by the entitled dudebros of today's society who chant stuff to be obnoxious and put themselves over while claiming the ECW fans were worse than they are.That only goes for the worst case "we are awesome" types of chanters though, not all of them.
Not in the ones I mentioned.  You might also note that as recently as the 70s Law Enforcement and State Guardsmen had the authority to shoot looters on sight. So, yeah, it did happen in the past, but only sporadically.  There has been a radical change in this country since then and law enforcement is prosecuted for suppressing riots rather than the looters who perpetrate them.
"jackanape" I believe that was the slur your teacher heaped on that student in order to embarrass him. Terrible when a person hates their job so much that he/she inflicts emotional pain on others who have no agency. 
Think about it, people. This could actually happen... If we could get organized and have a MAJOR online campaign for Bernie - and I'm talking everywhere, major news networks, facebook/twitter/whatever - it might be enough to get him elected. This era is now basically defined by the Internet, and it could very well be the first time it influences an election in a significant way.
Reasonably large dog, although perfectly normal sized considering breed; standing on an elevated platform next to a short looking guy with a questionable beard.
You know how there are those charts where they take your age and say "Oh, you're only 93 jupiter days old!" Are there any planets where earth's age would only be a couple thousand years old? 
With Ramsay you could say his passion and desire to become a real Bolton drove him to do those things. He wants to impress his father, Roose so he is loyal and traditional in the Bolton way. In their family, he has earned the right to become a Bolton and heir. 
Just take a couple Sundays and look at some open houses around where you are looking.  It always helps to get a sense of the market and what various price points are for other homes.  Knowing what other homes are selling for makes you a better judge of your own property's value. 
No, I'm not kidding.  The garage is unattended, so there's nothing stopping thieves from working in isolation throughout the day.  It's at least 10 minutes of walking through some dangerous intersections for pedestrians to the market, and it will seem like longer than 10 minutes in the winter.  Plus it's now one of the most expensive garages downtown for hourly rates.
This chick who uses everyone and pretend to be stupid to get what she wants..uses people (guys and girls) with fake friendliness....want to slap her face off. 
Own both of Ike's games &amp; would love to have his Amiibo pictured next to his games. Would be also nice to put WFT in great and funny locals for pics.
I think that really depends on the GPA you have. If you have a 3.0 GPA then passing the exam will be more important. If you have a 4.0 GPA then that's a different story. It also depends on the school you go to. I don't go to a target school and passing the level 1 exam gives me a huge leg up on the students at my university. Passing the level 1 exam at my school is worth more than a 4.0 GPA. It's unfortunate, but at the same time it has its benefits
Regardless, it reduces their "two-factor" authentication to single-factor. I can access my account with only information I know. Two factor means any two of (something you are, something you have, something you know).
No , you're wrong, this stuff isn't happening, I saw so on Reddit, everyone has assured me this kind of stuff is bs mainstream media and is definitely not happening. Cause there's no black racism, just white people being judgemental.
EB Games is a successful company that was bought by GameStop. As part of the merger, many EB Games store locations were closed or converted to GameStop brand stores. However, some U.S. locations are still branded under EB Games. Also, the EB Games name is still used extensively overseas in countries like Australia where it is the largest national video game store. 
1 in 5 seniors will die within the first year after suffering a broken hip. Weight bearing activities will not only increase bone density but will also increase balance and coordination to reduce the risk of falls. This is no joke!
Yes, it feels wrong, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a reason why the hiker shouldn't have to pay.  After all, I get a bill when an ambulance has to take me to the hospital.  Why is a chopper rescue any different?
&gt;I think American/western culture kind of glorifies "mean" jokes -- that is, jokes at a person's expense. So many sitcoms have a punch line making a fool out of somebody or putting somebody down.Interesting, as I've read that all comedy by definition requires SOMEONE to suffer. This is why comedy show protagonists tend to be dicks or otherwise not very nice people, so you laugh when they inevitably get screwed over.
I didn't need clarification. I saw it instantly. I have quirks like this too. When I play League of Legends as an ADC, I will do laps of the tribush by clicking in every corner. Every game.
You are using so-called smart quotes instead of regular quotes.Delete the quote characters and type them yourself.Well, the good news is that you fixed your character encoding problem. The first screenshot shows UTF-8 displayed as ISO-8859-1.
That's Cool. Yeah I just finished the book. So my afternoon is going to the library to return this one and get the next one. I really like the series so far. The writing style and the depth of characters is great.
The CBS Sports Draft Trackers gives instant grades. A C- for Mariota. This is ridiculous. Let him play a snap before he gets a bad grade. Also he asked "Why?" Why? They need a QB. I recognize that Washington/STL has made trading dowm from 2 a major sexy opportunity, but the idea that Tennesee should pass on a QB as a no-brainer is excessive. 
I couldn't say I blamed him.  I would have probably have fallen apart too.  I think the relationship would have worked out great if they started it a few seasons back.  It would some more variety with couples on Voyager.
Might've enjoyed the experience? I know 100k is no joke, but maybe it bears repeating that the University isn't a degree factory. One might choose to go to a more expensive school for a whole variety of reasons, and future employment prospects and/or the ability to be pretentious with your new 'brand-name' degree aren't necessarily among them. (Regardless of what Reddit would have you believe, seeing as the Ivy Leagues typically get twisted to fit this narrative).But I don't know her or her situation so I really have no say in this conversation.   
Correlation doesn't prove causation (obligatory Reddit defensive statement), but [this image](http://www.motherjones.com/files/Lead_Crime_325.gif) is interesting.
I suppose those are entry level jobs as legal workers at companies, or consultancy positions in law firms. There's plenty of those but it's very hard to grow from there. Trying to make it as a lawyer is high risk high reward, and a lot more interesting.
You greatly overestimate how seriously faculty would take this. They likely complained, but I wouldn't be surprised if no one believed them and they were punished for pressing it...
The EC stack becomes more effective? I wouldn't think so you usually build up a tolerance to the caffeine but my best advice to you would be to try out what you think will help avoid the adrenal fatigue and adjust as time goes by 
You are not giving the money to the government to hold. You are giving money so the government can give that money to the current old people. Then when you are old, hopefully, there will be enough young people working and paying social security for the government to give their money to you.Edit: referring specifically to social security here.
Very bad mistake, as we have seen the most Egoist ADC's have had very poor results in general; Chaox, Rekkles, Forgiven and Doublelift. Keep steelback or prepare to lose 1st place at EU.Idk why Fnatic members or staff is stupid enough to take him back....
This episode was Sensational! Best episode because it introduced best girl xD I pretty much knew penny was a robot from the first encounter. I had my doubts until the next episode. Also I wasn't expecting Blake to be former white fang. 
Do you think there's even a chance that people will threaten you, kick you out, beat you up, disown you, potentially kill you for being vegan? Seriously? Are you joking right now?
I know!  WTF!  In my high school, we have to write 1000-1500 word essays every week.  That's what we're used to.  So you can imagine why my brother had trouble with a limit of 300.
I would suggest at least changing the price so that players can purchase the chroma packs with a $5 purchase rather than being forced to buy $10 and have a bunch of unwanted RP.
Your correction is accepted. My primary statement was that it exhibits, if not volition, than a surprisingly good simulacrum of volition, and fixes itself in whatever it determines to be an inert state relative to the Nearby Thing. On the Helicarrier, it was probably picking up on Thor's own frame of reference, as it still 'belonged' to Thor. Or he might have given it the explicit instruction to do so, or something. 
You're quite right- songs and genes flowing to and fro across the Irish Sea for 6+ millenia. Songs like the 'Wild Rover' about the struggle between sobriety and drink are close to a celtic (small c) heart. Another close example, is N. Irish trad 'Carrickfergus'."i'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober.A handsome rover from town to town.Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered.Come all you young men and lay me down."
I have a 12x12 craft case that I use to carry all my stuff around in. It's not the most casual thing to carry around, but I can keep each project in its own case for easy storage. 
Well that's still pretty cool! I love going to the movies but my family doesn't go very often anymore and my boyfriend isn't a fan of going. I hope you enjoy it:)
Pierce is my favorite American in the last century. My grandfather with whom I have a close relationship is very similar to Pierce in appearance, sound of voice, could pass for him in a recording. Listening to him feels like a family member
You asked for help about women *liking* you. It's a common mistake of young dudes to get hung up on a certain girl. If you are, that's a very good reason why a new girl wouldn't like you; you want someone else more than her.
Well, obviously, the midwife's office wasn't like *certain* they were going to go into labor. That isn't the whole basis of their business. And they definitely don't have an established policy for their other patients. No. Naaaah... that'd be like responsible and shit. Wouldn't want you to feel valued as their patient. /s I'm sorry those bitches made you miss out on your lemonade. 
I'd like to hang out with Will Smith. I think he'd be a super cool dude. I don't know anything about him, but I'd drink a couple beers with that guy. Just sit together, drink a few beers, maybe talk about stuff. Just cool, Will Smith stuff. 
If you are going for 353 make sure your physics and math are the right level. I know a few hopefully apprentices that are stuck trying to upgrade their marks while working as groundsmen.
Is it not a good paddle? Not sure what you mean. Edit: I'm thinking you're talking about the sticker on the blue paddle. That's my friend's haha. He bought it on the way at academy and I guess forgot to remove the sticker. 
I didn't mean to insinuate that Joel should be given up on at all, I agree with you that it's unfair to expect such so quickly. Just that thus far he hasn't been as good on Arsenal as he was playing with worse teams against top notch opposition.
I bought a kite just like that, but the wind snapped the sails off. I guess it was a cheaper version. Seeing this makes me wonder about the greatness I missed out on when mine broke. :(
Duuuude, I know you probably dont think it, but pop that Scooby Doo game in. That game is absolutely top notch. Some wonky controls, but ill be damned if that wasnt one of my favorite games.

I started thinking the Jags were gonna do something stupid and draft a WR. I'm glad they went with Fowler, I think it's a great pick. He's gonna be really good in a couple years.
Several bike manufacturers have had to make recalls in the past because if Suntour's shitty quality (assurance?).    Unless OP is a flyweight, stay well clear of them.
Weapons will get rebalanced but it won't fix anything. There will always be a top 5 weapons. Eventually Thorn and TLW will fall out of favor and people will move onto the next big thing. Then people will complain about that and reminisce about the days of Thorn and TLW being good.The cycle of nerfs and buffs is very predictable.
I have a question with superscripts, and the two links didn't seem to discuss it. Is it possible to have a superscripted expression in parenthesis? For example, if you want to have exp(x(x+2))\*y^2 in exponent form, it becomes e^(x(x+2))\*y^2, and I can't seem to be able to use backslash to ignore the inside parenthesis. Right now I'm using spaces to prevent that with e^x(x+2) *y^2, but it looks odd to me.Also, I really like the subscript option, I see it used all the times.
I think the fit is small. I tried a L on which is my stealth jacket size and it was at least a size too small. It probably has to do with the lining but such a size gap is surprising. 
Oh...wish I had some wine...but forget to get some at the store.  I rarely drink...but this is one of those evenings.  I am so wound up I need to chill  :)
People are so pissed at this pick in here. The fact is that if you don't have a franchise QB then your biggest need is a franchise QB. If they didn't feel that Mett was their guy then they needed to move on regardless.
Generally, if a girl posts about wanting friends, she will get a ton of messages from guys and it can be difficult to consistently delete the creepy ones or find the ones that are interesting enough to keep talking to. I can count on my hand the number of friends I have from online that I consistently talk to (considering the high amt at the start, it's a very small %). I'm not sure what type of friend your looking for, but people's time might be utilized differently or people honestly just forget and are bored. Also, I hate when people put in little effort into a convo (both irl and online). 
Shoutout to the NFL Network for bucking the trend of only comparing players if they are the same race. Compared Winston to Matty Ice, Mariota to Kaep and Fowler to Kerrigan. 
I had a friend like this in college. She weighed close to 400 lbs and her room was disgusting and smelling like rotten menstrual pads. She was so gross she didn't even have a roommate after the first few weeks of school. We could never figure if she got moved out due to the mess, if she was buried somewhere in the litter of the room, or if my buddy ate her or what... Anyway. There's not much helping someone like this. Anything you say is taken as very hurtful criticism and will just cause them to cling harder to their source of comfort which is food and filth. Your best bet is to try to be a supportive friend. If you really want her to clean up for sanitary reasons, get her out and somewhere else long enough that she'll notice the filth and smell when she comes back. It might help. Otherwise just telling her will get you nowhere. She does not care. She lives in it and likes it.
Dude I totally thought Watch Dogs was Sleeping Dogs and I was like 'I loved Sleeping Dogs why wouldn't anyone want a sequel?'Watch Dogs was so nothing that my brain thinks it never happened.
I can't see it right now but both circled are face off wins and the color on the first chart is home vs away faceoff wins while the second chart is win vs loss. Make sense?
Yeah that's right, it closes once you enter, but run back up to it and just hang around and kill stuff from up there.  Like I said, the knights don't run up there and thralls come up very slowly one at a time so you can pick stuff off real easy.  It only get's a little sketchy when the ogre spawns, because at that point, mobs start spawning right by those doors that you'll be hanging out at.  So either move to the underground spot for ogre or just watch your back for them spawning around you.  I tend to just hang around by the door the whole time and when ogre spawns I just rocket/snipe him really quickly before the other mobs spawn.  Cheers!

This might single out a few people, but I feel like these examples need to be shared.  I apologize to those effected by this.I know of a female programmer that was harassed by several people about how her boyfriend did the coding for her.  I've also heard of another female that applied and was asked questions about her relationship status instead of questions about the position.  Other females have left due to harassment of some kind.  I haven't seen it, but I've heard stories about the CEO also being involved in some of this.I know not every female there has to deal with it, especially those that have some form of relationship with other people in the office, but enough have that it seems like an issue that needs to be addressed.
And I'm the guy who bought both sets off effectiveduck and I have the same impressions. The thick ones seem much nicer. Haven't used them much yet, though.

Thank you. I really am trying to look at it that way, but I've always had this complex of sorts. My mom is a fitness trainer, my sisters are little twigs and I'm always hiding during family functions so the camera doesn't catch me. I'm dreading being the center of attention and not feeling comfortable with myself. I honestly think I might need to see a doctor. I suffer from ovarian cysts and now that I think about it I have been gaining and struggling to lose weight ever since my first cyst ruptured. Being a woman isn't  always fun :/
In Akame Ga Kill [I wish almost everybody didn't die. I think Mine, Leon, Lubb, and Tatsumi should have started alive because they all had something go live for. I'm okay with Bulat's and Sheele's death because it have the team something to really fight for. P.S. Leone's death wasn't needed and pisses me off.] (/spoiler)
I just can't come anywhere near understanding why a kid halfway done with college thinks he has any goddamn standing to criticize someone else's career. I can at least understand the STEM supremacy coming from people actually working in STEM even though it's incorrect and fuckin' annoying, but how far up your own ass do you have to be to be a *student* who just stridently declares the livelihoods of the vast majority of humanity to be bullshit.
A majority of the people in my house right now are over 15 y/o, and we genuinely enjoy *certain* cartoons, like Star Wars Clone Wars. But if my dad walks in to to see us watching it, he says "you guys are too old to be watching cartoons, turn this off now", and he says this every time. Man I really hope he doesn't look at my profile on Netflix with all the anime I watch
I am too and I think it's fucking barbaric. The medical benefits are pretty dubious, and there are risks involved with the procedure. The stress on the child is measurable.  Just because you don't consciously remember the pain today doesn't mean you should subject other tiny humans, fresh to this world, to unnecessary surgical procedures.
I've done this before. If you run your filter now it will probably ruin it. I would just drain the tank almost all the way and then fill it up really slowly. Put a plate or Tupperware lid on the bottom and pour the water on that instead of straight into the substrate. It should be a LOT clearer then and then it should be okay to run your filter.

Walmart had "Plumbing issues" in multiple states, including stores in California and Florida, at the same time.  That must be one big pipe to cause the same issue simultaneously at multiple stores 3000 miles away.
Semen does contain trace amounts of chlorine, IIRC.So it makes sense that some people would be more sensitive to the smell and some people's semen composition would have the chlorine component be dominant in the olfactory bouquet.

When you run a solo, you have to have everything be something that that character &amp; player can do. Second, it makes it had on you running NPCs because you have to fill in the gaps where other players may banter back and forthLastly, the player is on their own....no healing spells or resurrection type stuff. Try to make the threat something other than loosing hit points. 
Polite means that you can offer to treat, but if she says no, then accept that and move on. Polite doesn't mean offering to treat and then getting resentful if the other person doesn't take you up on it.It's seriously not a big deal. Focus on getting to know each other, rather than dwelling on who spent $2.00 on a slush.
Good points.  If these are fly-by-night operations couldn't they do something similar to what credit card companies do to merchants with less than ideal credit?  That is they hold the money for a set amount of time.  When I owned an ISP back in the late 90's I believe we had a hold of 2 months on our money.  I've heard some companies had a hold of 6 or more.

I support the PSA. Social democrats are not socialists and should therefore not espouse their beliefs or who they support here. That is for their subreddit, not ours. If they'd like to take us up in debate, there are subreddits for that but not this one.As for Bernie Sanders: he is an imperialist and a capitalist. No socialist should support him.
I'm from New Brunswick and a friend has a cottage on lake digdeguash about an hour away from you.  We`ve spent a lot of weekends there  and have had a pretty similar experience just once...  A few of the more tipsy people decided it was a good time to for a stroll right around sun down.  The few of us who stayed behind heard one of them yell something not too far off and then heard a scream that made my hair stand on end.  A few of us ran off in the direction of the scream only to find them all up the road a bit staggering back towards us.  guess it might just be that whole area.  
i largely agree with you, but I think you underestimate the synergy between plaza and minion and overestimate advisor minion. Plaza Minion lets you accrue coins without losing cards. Also, Plaza Minion lets you play your 1 of Swindler, even if you end up tossing the hand it is in. Also given the distinct lack of trashing on this board, it lets you do SOMETHING with the coppers in your deck, instead of chucking them to minion continuously. Conversely, what does advisor get you, you get to discard extra coppers/estates when you Minion? Why? 
I don't see how he didn't know what reverse image searching is. And after a brief stint in IT and hearing IT stories, I would not at all be surprised if a successful hedge fund manager were unfamiliar with reverse image search. And thought every search engine was "The Google".

Not trying to beat up your post but: Quincey is only 29.  Ericsson is 31.  Franzen barely played all year and could be close to retirement or buyout with how bad that injury was.  Sheahan Nyquist Tatar are not in their prime yet.  Sheahan doesn't even get a lot of ice time currently.  My point is more to the fact that we have never replaced Lids, while Dats and Zett are well past their prime.  They can still play the game exceptionally, but not at the level of a Seguin or Kane (on their best days).  I think there will be a lot less explosive activity in the coming years, and players will more likely just fade out and other players moved up.

Not only that but Warren for VP isn't a great idea, she's better causing a ruckus where she is. VP are essentially lame ducks with no punch. Besides, depending how this election goes, she could theoretical run in 2020 or 2024. She'd have MUCH more weight behind her then, regardless of who takes the White House in 2016. 
I run it on a mono bug team with sticky web so I can have 4 attacks. Protect is safer, but with Monotype you can run into a type that completely walls all your options so it is really nice to have that 4th move. Don't us 4 moves unless you have sticky web or something similar, though.

I agree, the price of everything won't raise by 1 dollar for every dollar increase in the minimum wage. But it doesn't have to. Think about all the different products people buy. If 100 products raise their prices by 1 cent for every dollar that the minimum wage goes up, that's effectively a 1 to 1 ratio.What if 1000 products raise their prices by 1 cent?
Oh my god you are just consistently a terrible person. If you choose to inflict suffering on an innocent animal and then suffer the consequences of your actions, I'm super fucking fine with that.

Lots of leaked info a few months back suggested MS was going to do this with full release of windows 10 mobile.I'm crossing my fingers. Seems obvious to do.

[](/rrdscared) What? No![](/sp)[](/rdcry) It's just... this is the kind of prank you only have one chance to pull off, you know? Once everyone knows that's it, opportunity lost.
I actually continued replaying VLR a couple of days ago on my vita. Still my favorite game of all time. I hope Punchline does some insane stuff twists.
Are you talking in terms of the US? Because if so you could not be any more wrong. This question is both touchy and has a ton of variables with where OP lives/ wants to carry the knife at, age, ect. For example, if you want to buy a knife here in WA, USA all you need to do is go to any REI or Big Sporting Goods store, show them your ID so they know you're of age and to run background checks quickly to know they aren't selling to a criminal, then hand over the money. Done. I know this because that is how I got mine. Now, before you do that you need to look up the carrying laws of course of your location (aforementioned) as well as anything like blade length and such.If you're not talking in terms of the US, please state that as i'm sure other places may have stricter/ looser rules when it comes to knifes and noting your location will help a lot.

I want to second the ego one for a beginner and also to match the hookah feel with the airflow/vapor production not to mention the plug and play ease of use. With the ego one all you need to pick up besides the kit is some juice and extra coils and you're good to go for a while
when all your open world games pretty much plays the same . I.E: Go to a high point to discover the map, do minigames , and then do story  repeat x100. yea people will fucking get board of that formula
Lawl. Koons is super pushy. I was the one who replied earlier to you further up. Didn't realize you were that close.Since you're already investigating dealers in that area, check out the dealer I ordered from. Ted Britt Fairfax. ASK FOR BERNIE!!! He was fucking awesome to me.
50yr old dad, 17yr old son. He carries me in the glorious mistake known as Cruciable (god what bullshit) and we are even in raids. Only advantage he has to me is 1) I have don't many friends who play Destiny, and fewer who care to raid more than once a week. And 2) RNG has been nicer to him and given him multiple Jellyhorns while I finally got one Hunger of Crota the other day. Had to buy my Ice Breaker, still haven't got dropped one.  Damned RNGeezus hates me, but thats ok. I hate him too!
How is that selfish or fucked up? If the issue is important to you, seems fair to prioritize it. Far better than people who vote for a candidate because the other wants to give equal rights to gay couples, etc...
Pick someone who is confident to be your shotcaller and follow what they say to do (if they're your best player, that's ideal). A bad call followed through by the whole team is better than a good call that only half the team follows. One person needs to be the decision-maker on what your team is going to do next (push mid tower vs baron after an ace, etc.).
I don't think planning for therapy to fail is a very healthy way to enter it, and I am sure that talking with a therapist first would better help him understand if the marriage is worth saving and if it's possible. I agree with most your advice and know it is well intentioned, but I think it is really dangerous to flippantly throw out advice for divorce mid-paragraph. If he wants to try therapy, I see no reason to poison the well.
No, synopses; -is pluralizes to -es, -us pluralizes to -i (see parenthesis/parentheses, cactus/cacti).Except for octopus. Octopus can validly become octopodes and, as such, should always be called octopodes.
&gt;If they become popular again, I'll be very happy. I was so good at playing with them. I won all my brother's power rangers pogs.Playing? Sir, you must hodl pogs. Never use them
That's a limitation of directx, and each of those installs quite possibly could be installing something different. It's not unusual for a big AAA game to get a distinct version sort-of-on-top-of DirectX, and the only way to know is to run the official installer.
I think you should wait until we've moved to /r/freefolk (if we end up doing that) and then once we've moved, maybe change the description for the subreddit to "Welcome to the true North! This is a community for the people who DO NOT KNEEL!! A place free of rules, where everyone is welcome!" Or something like that?And then you can message them, make it clear that we don't have any policy on piracy (and link to the other subreddits that are like that). And if they still say no to that: then ha. Fuck it. We do not kneel.I really love this subreddit just because the conversations are so much smaller (in a good way) and I'm not forced to use spoiler tags or use clickbait in titles. It's like a breath of huge fresh air, y'know?Either way: again, keep it up!
The two on the left are ran as one unit. The iMac in the middle of the other two iMacs is used as a secondary display for the one on the far left. I've got Teleport set up on the 5K iMac and the 13" MBP.

A computer-to-brain interface that can eventually, piece by piece, start replacing the biological brain with a computer hardware version, much like the Ship of Theseus:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_TheseusI'd like to hook such a device up to my brain, and gradually start becoming a cyborg- until my fragile, mortal, biological brain is phased out, and my consciousness is completely contained in a far more durable container.Then I'd like to continue existing for billions of years.
I don't know.  I live close to one and except for the components (1/4th of the store) and the very small electronics area (1/16th) it's a very boring place than it used to be.  Fry's stores are much better in my opinion though I still don't shop there anymore.
Wages won't rise unless there is a labor supply problem. Until there is a trend of American players leaving to play abroad, there won't be a problem with supply. Your comment reads as if you believe that increased salary improves players. That's not very likely. Frankly, the CBA pay rises have more to do with expanded opportunities within the US, and with the public relations issues surrounding labor disputes. 
I just took a 4 hour mandated defensive driving course for my county job.. They said to tap on your brakes if necessary to warn people behind you (who may be riding to close) that traffic is slowing up ahead and you are getting ready to slow.  I mean.. don't tap the brakes hard.. just tap them enough to flash the lights.
Here's what I find hilarious: even in FLL to advance off an award your bot must place in the top 40%, to advance off the bot you must have performed well in the other judging categories.Can someone please explain to me why FLL has far saner advancement criteria than FTC?
What they're doing isn't a sterile process. Besides that even in other surgeries the only people gowned up are those who are involved in the actual hands on process. Everyone else is in clean scrubs, and wearing masks and bonnets but aren't sterile. I only did intubations as an intern, by no means an expert in the process. Don't consider what I said as gospel. Just what I observed.

Nukes are the main ingredient that makes ICBMs threatening. According to "international media", Pakistan's potential political instability means that they have all sorts of "interests" in exerting overt and covert "influences" to keep a submissive government in power.Nobody cares about conventional long range missiles. Making orbit-capable rockets doesn't mean they have what it takes to deliver nuclear payload accurately and safely(without blowing up in atmosphere) at high reentry speeds.

It really works with any size image, the game auto downscales the image to fit.  For example, I had a 1080p image of lord GabeN and it auto fit onto the flag
I watched that game. Lmao when he did that. At first I was confused why he was even going toward the keeper for a goal out. Then he did what he did.. and the commentators were silenced in confusion.. until one finally tried to rationalize what he had just seen by saying that's the stupidest card he has ever witnessed. Made it all seem like Monty Python.
I have a hard time believing the eagles offered that much.  Anyone else think this was just a media driven narrative that wasn't ever going to happen?
If the machines in Poland are anything like the ones here, they're strictly relying on your bodyweight for the resistance.  I wish they could do more but doing so probably means they're just going to get thrashed and be useless all that much faster.
This is not the kind of thing that gets you a VAC ban, ever. If those files were supposed to remain unmodified they wouldn't be .txt files.

&gt; it's absolutely fine if the murderer is the state? Killing a murderer after they received due process and years of appeals is murder? It's a simple example of justice. An eye for an eye - you kill someone, you deserve to die yourself. &gt; On top of that, the aim of the criminal justice system should, ultimately, be to reduce crime rates. It has been proven, time and time again, that the death penalty does not deter people from crime.Execute a criminal and there is one less criminal and no chance of recidivism. Whereas you have millions of people in US jails, which hasn't deterred crime either. Meanwhile they continue to commit crimes and violence against other prisoners while in jail.I don't think the death penalty is necessary because it deters crime however. I just think it is the right outcome for the worst murderers. We can certainly address the underlying social issues that lead to crime, but I have no problem keeping the death penalty as well.
Dev response to a comment of mine a year ago:http://www.reddit.com/r/CivClicker/comments/233roo/mills_are_they_worth_it/cgtgx73Summary: Assuming 100% human population, food production is multiplied by (1 + mills/200), so every subsequent mill increases food production linearly, and this makes a smaller change to as a part of the total. Basically, buy them when they're cheap, but don't spend a long time saving up to buy them. If your running a zombie empire, mills are useless.

Soup, lots of soup. And make sure the vegetables are chopped into small pieces and cooked until soft. Chewing is going to be hell for a week, so food that you can simply swallow is the best.
Again I am aware that there was predatory lending, but to not inform yourself on a 600000 dollar decision, that seems like ignorance. Much of the problem was the banks giving out loans they know couldn't be payed back. The other portion was someone with an income of 4200 a month taking out a mortgage they could barely afford with a low interest rate, let alone after it spiked after 5 years. Don't place blame all on one party. Both were wrong.
Well they are wizards. You can't risk them showing up in 1000 years inside a lich's husk, their phylactery tucked safely away in another plane of existence, and cheating at card games.
They bring a system of RNG to the table to get what you want, instead of just outright buying the skin that you want. I personally have yet to have trouble with chests.
Create my own narrative? I'm going by the narrative in the techraptor article. The very one in this post. And, actually, I have read the official announcement, and it contains nothing that contradicts this article.Could the article be wrong? Sure. If it turns out that it is, I will adjust my opinion. Until that happens, though, this is still a bad thing and I will discuss it as such.
Grim patron spawned its own archetype. Emperor T is practically broken. Blackwing tech is a 3 mana 3/5 and Corruptor is a 5 mana 5/4 deal 3 damage if you play enough dragons. But yea, you're probably right.
Look for loafer cut socks. I buy [these](http://smile.amazon.com/H2H-Casual-No-Show-Anti-Slip-KMMS019/dp/B00MA673Z2/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430440259&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=loafer+socks) from Amazon. 5 pairs usually lasts me a year. The loafer cut sits low enough on your foot that they don't show even in boat shoes.

If it's a FWB situation, chances are you might not be his only "friend." The thing is with FWB is when you want some, or visa versa, you call them up. If, perhaps, this is his first FWB situation, then he might be shy asking for something so intimate. Therefore, call him up and maybe hint that you need a little something. 
It's not a revolution, they haven't organized toward a common goal. That's what the protestors we're trying to do, peacefully. Rioting is about causing damage at random.
Avocados go great with cheese for sandwiches.Excellent on top of an omelette or on the side, included in salads is my favourite or just simply put on rice crackers with black pepper for a healthy snack.
Fisrt of all I asume you read this thread about actual e-mount lenses and didn't find something you like : http://www.reddit.com/r/SonyAlpha/comments/33h947/sony_emount_lineup_as_of_april_2015/How do you do your "landscape" photography, my self I like to take multiple photos and multiple exposure to stitch them together and do some HDR stuff to add some DR, with this method the "quality" of the lens doesn't mater alot because I usually shot around f8-16 on a tripod.I have the A7R and I love using old lenses, so get a look at lens here : http://www.rugift.com/sony-nex-lenses.phpI personnaly have a older m39 version of this lens : http://www.rugift.com/photocameras/helios that have a very great IQ and can be use as a good  portrait lens also. 
Yeah pretty much every gas water heater is more cost effective than any electric, hybrid or otherwise. If gas isnt an option, however, hybrid will beat out any standard electric and will pay itself off over it's lifetime, as long as the installation requirements are met.
I don't agree with that. Control is a larger player count, no team revives and self reviving. Playing solo isn't an issue. Have you watched the gameplay from the stream of ToO? Basically the only way back into the game is through your team reviving you which requires heaps of communication around where the enemy is that they might not be able to see etc. TL;DR ToO - communication is essentials. Normal Crucible, it's not.
Actually, that may work out better for you.  They said they couldn't price match because the purchase hadn't been charged on mine (Visa). If it had they would have credited to me.Instead she said I could either price match AFTER it ships, wait and hope they correct it at the time of shipping or cancel and reorder.I was afraid the price may go back up and I'd lose the $50 so I cancelled and reordered.
Thanks! :) Sorry for the delay, went out to dinner. I just hopped back online, however I'm organizing boxes and will likely keep going offline due to using Pokebank. Let me know when you're available and I'll hop back online if I am not already :)
&gt;  revealed that Sweden was implementing a Feminist film grading system which, for as much as I can tell, is just seeing if a film passes the Bechdel Test and not much else.I agree that's badly applied.&gt; "this is a movie about a situation were mainly men were involved, and we are okay with this".A conundrum in a bunch of circles. Like where historical accuracy is a requirement. I mean do you include racist language that would have been common in history? Do you show black men as slaves?The only thing that I object to is when the "history" argument is applied to fantasy.
Edit: You can go fuck yourself. Moving such a thing upstairs is dangerous and could've broken or fucked-up your back. Have some friends, or at least acquaintances around to help.

I definitely like the designs, but they feel just a little plain to me. Feels like a random piece of clothing would really complete the N64 mascot feel they're going for. Boots for the lizard, some goggles for the bat, maybe a scarf or something. Still, I like them. They got the general feel just right. 
Precisely. And it's also easier to make statements like those you have, essentially poking, than it is to evaluate a different perspective. I have a midterm tomorrow, in lieu of responding to that enormous, semi-organized wall of text, I think I will study. Abdicating reddit for a while is probably a better use of my time than trying to calmly crusade against people who are wrong on the internet. Have a rad day though.

You'd be amazed the American beers you can find around Europe. Amsterdam gets Three Floyds pretty regularly. Last year Copenhagen Beer Celebration had Westbrook Mexican Cake, Parabola, Boneyard Hop Venom and Notorious, Surly Pentagram, Funky Buddha Passionfruit Berliner Weisse, *Double Barrel Hunahpu* and even *BAVDL*. Obviously that was a special occasion, but Western Europe and particularly Scandinavia are seeing really impressive American representation these days, thanks in large part to the relationships that exist between their breweries (especially Mikkeller) and ours.

A combination of AA/Smart Recovery, this site, counseling (I need A LOT).  I'm also blessed to have a married couple in my life who are closer to me than anyone I know and who will talk to me anytime I need them.  They are done with me if I start again, and I can't imagine my life without them.  We also recently lost a friend to alcohol-related suicide, and I was there to see their pain, and I can't do that to them, I just can't.  I also have a handful of people in recovery who are a phone call away.  Basically I plan on committing time to one of some of the above on a daily basis, and I plan on pledging to not drink each morning.  I'm also going to start exercising and exploring the old hobbies I had, like writing and playing my guitar.  I think most importantly, this episode taught me I want to live and be a better person, and this is the only way to do it.  
tie bombers with extra munitions greatly increases the amount of expendable firepower for it for only 2 points. whether or not they will be more viable in tournament play i have no idea but having a bomber with the potential for 4 assault missiles makes tie swarms seem extremely easy to deal with.

sunshine would be nice. we did it all winter up here in Canada some days were as cold as -40 with the windchill. the cold wasn't the worst part it was the wind, the last farm i did was 3 months long and it was right in the middle of a wind tunnel. we had some untorqued panels blow off in the wind a few times that shit would kill or cripple you if it hit you. i did a bit of work in the fall it wasnt so bad just the mud was unbearable mid shin at all times had to wear a rain suit.just curious but did you just sling panels? 
Been playing Destiny which has been my go to game for past couple months. One thing that sucks tho is House of Wolves Dlc comes out the same day as the Witcher 3. I'll be having my hands full all summer. My hype level is high for the witcher 3 and I have to agree, These 19 days are going to be long. I would recommend checking out the Metro Redux games or Bloodborne, good games to keep you until the Witcher.

As long as fruit and veggies is basically a garnish to venison bacon I think I'm ok. If you're in MN check out something called "Randy's candy" at Mannys downtown. Inch and a half inch thick bacon basted in a honey mix for 4 hours. 
Hmm not normal no. It's common to put a little surgicel in some high-risk extraction sites but it normally dissolves by itself.  Why don't you ask the dentist who put it in why it hasn't dissolved and why there is so much of it?

We as a society need to reexamine how we treat drug addiction.  To see it just as a moral failure and try to use incarceration as a way to prevent it hasn't worked.  I'd rather see people addicted but alive and functional than dead or jailed.

I cash in as soon as I have enough for a 5 buck card. Then around the 20th of each month I start to save up for the discounted 25 buck amazon card. Almost to 2200 Swagbucks.

yes, and that is why they can shoot well beyond 500. It wasn't a problem, it was by design because for a trauma gun it doesn't matter if CO2 is hot or cold, if it shoots 450 or 550. It's purpose to fuck you up without killing you.
So far, i usually got 'nearly' decked out with constant soul charging but considering the fast pace of games with the strides, pretty much you don't even need to worry for deck-out as long as you consistently dish out some damage with the stride.

Like /u/10-13 alluded to, look at one of those posters with hundreds of names of "young black men killed by the police," Google their stories and you'll see the vast majority are, to reasonable people, clear cut shootings.
See, I'm kind of weird, I just don't notice graphics much ever. So naturally it doesn't even occur to me to consider things like that, but I know they matter to other people. It's a good thing you pointed it out, I don't mind. I know I get blinders to how other people might think of things.
In accordance with the customary law of the Huanca people of Peru, this can only be settled with a jaguar duel. Both your parents and your teacher must choose a jaguar champion; the jaguars will fight to the death. The losing party must pay compensation in seashells and will then be sacrificed in the name of Pachamama.
Mr. PM, Sir, making it illegal to criticize one country in this world is NUTS. Additionally, what is up with the way you keep appointing judges? NOT COOL.

Haha me too!! Just woke up and it's day 5. Falling asleep is a bit of a struggle it takes me like 2 hours but I'm getting there! One thing that sucks though is I have found that I'm excluding myself from almost every social gathering (I get invited to do something basically daily), this is because most of my friends are habitual smokers and the best way to not smoke is not have it in the house nor be around it :/ Any one got some advice?
/u/ADirtyFuckingLiar is being very truthful. 96 will be Korean built, and the pup upgrade is often all that you'll need to get the guitar sounding great. 57's are awesome in my opinion
Welp.  There it is.  I'm relieved all the speculation for what we've known for a bit now is all over.I'm happy Lovie and Licht made the pick.  I was half-scared Lovie might go on stage and announce that God is angry at Jameis so they're picking Mariota instead.But to be a cynic, we've never had a franchise QB, so I'm not expecting much.  It just doesn't feel like we *should*  have a franchise QB (it's legitimately difficult for me to imagine), and Jameis seems like a fairly high bust candidate.  And it makes me sick that those are my thoughts I just don't really expect anything from the Bucs at this point.I'll be delighted if he turns into anything near the potential he has though.  And hopefully that's what happens.  :)
You're absolutely right.  Studies using implicit bias tests show that minorities do harbor racist feelings, though perhaps not to the same extent as whites.The problem is that our society was built on white=good and black=bad.  It is something that people internalize very early on, even as children.If you're interested in reading more, I suggest looking up the doll study.
&gt; She said she wasn't worried...&gt; came back then pitched a fit that they were soldIt doesn't add up, does it.  Did you quote her own words back to her?
Another throw away episode.  So much potential with the moms.  Evidently we had to include the other cast members in some inane tripe.  I'm really disappointed with whats happened to this show.
Think you mean [this one](http://shirtoid.com/6506/the-madness-of-mission-6/), and in case you didn't know, it's supposed to be a reference to Pac Man.

We hit him in the 2nd inning.  We haven't really made any contact since.deGrom isn't giving up much, but Span had a just foul home run, Zimmerman's sac fly was almost out, and this inning led off with a warning track out.  I wouldn't say they're not hitting him at all, and he's already at 82 pitches.
Mike's comment was horrible, and it doesn't get a free pass. That said, it wasn't quite at the level some of the things others have said (misogynistic or otherwise). Also, he's been shown as a stand-up guy since then (see: last week's episode) while Rodney, Dan, etc. have continued their streak of being awful.
that happened to my dad in law school. He simply couldn't stay awake during Tax Law, and the teahcher passed him on the proviso that he never practice tax law. He ended the semester with a D--, the teacher actually went in and wrote the second "-" in by hand, as the printing system only did single minuses. 25ish years later, he is still not a tax lawyer.
I mean, it's kind of weird. When I'm driving for delivery, I'm getting payed to do it and it's in a fairly small area with easy roads and few unexpected frustrations. It's not as boring as sitting around in the restaurant waiting for tables to bus, and I can listen to music or NPR so I actually really enjoy my job.In pretty much every other context though, driving just feels like a really annoying chore. Plus I don't like being forced to stay sober when I go out to have fun just because I have to drive home at the end of the night. I can't wait until cars can drive themselves. 
no just idiotic.  Do you report every single crime you see? Do you try to intervene and make an arrest every time you see or hear about something illegal taking place? The police are employees of the government that are specifically tasked with enforcing the law and should be expected to do this in every single case of the matter, even if it involves fellow police officers. Regular everyday citizens, to a certain extent, are not.
Tbh I'm not really sure what the difference is lol. I think Ruby Woo is a bit more drying and it has the retromatte finish. But it also seems like the RR color is a bit deeper.

I know Malcolm said someone (can't remember who) asked him who Madeline was, and if it was an ex-girlfriend.Honestly, it's pretty obvious that Enil Edam is Madeline backwards, especially if you're staring at the name all day.
So don't fucking buy it. What part of this don't you get? The situation solves itself if what you say is true. I don't think you're right though. I think people will actually enjoy these and good for them and good for Riot for putting em out.
I read the whole article and all seemed normal until he used the word invite instead of increase one's risk. This man just used the wrong word. Read the article and tell me if I am crazy.
People who call us a dumpster fire that year ignore how much Noel was improving. We'd have made the tournament and maybe even the Sweet 16 with him healthy.
People said the same thing about Bryan Danielson. People said the same thing about CM Punk. People said the same thing about Cactus Jack. Sometimes, cream just rises. 
Ecoboost mustang.  It's underrated.  With just a tune they are pushing low 12s 1/4 miles.  I feel when the RS and the market has more time to innovate, these cars will become beasts .  I'm just not a fan of mustangs.  If I had another chance to but a car again, id still go with a ST though.  Until rs comes our and releases a price, no other car is as all around good as the st IMO. 
I never said that being rich doesn't make problems easier or that having more resources at your disposal isn't useful. As I mentioned in my first sentence of paragraph 2. However I think you have literally provided me with the perfect example of my point. Money didn't make your life awesome as you stated with your dysfunctional family problems. Sure you can more comfortably aleviate those problems with money, but it doesn't mean that because you have that money you are happy or doing perfectly awesome with your life. This is my point and that alone. All the other bizzare stances of how money is helpful (like if your poor and have no money types of scenarios) are not relevent. I'm literally saying just because you have racks of cash doesn't mean your life is good.So now let me quote your demeanor in my conclusion&gt; Think about that. Let it sink in. Now you still think your point is valid??Hopefully your money can get you some closer reading skills.
For a while, I had similar occasional dreams about a friend/ex of mine who died—for the first couple of years after he passed the dreams were always sad and occasionally scary. But for the past year or so, whenever I dream about him (once every few months or so) it's usually been a nice dream where we just get to talk and be together and I usually wake up feeling both happy and sad. I like to think he's watching over me, and forgives me for not being the greatest friend the last few years of his life. =\
People laugh when I bought the Wave parts separator. But it's so goddamn handy.Or if you got one of those furoku grade models, I know the 00 series has one, they have a part separator in them. Same thing with the Mega Size models.
&gt; No one is shifting goalposts, you're just saying humans should never eat meat or use any products made from animalsWoooow, what a gigantic leap in logic. From my standpoint on we need to stop subsidizing factory farms to suddenly now nobody is allowed to use or eat meat at all? What the hell are you smoking and where can I get some?&gt;Wut?It's called a typo. Replace "is" with "if", it's really not that confusing if you actually think.
OP didn't ask anyone to judge the love of Subway. I, too, wish I could recreate my favorite Subway sandwich at home. Realistically, I don't want sandwiches often enough to use the veggies before they go bad, so I continue to succumb. 
That's very true. And I have seen people with thousands on their accounts get banned, those are the most satisfying for me. I just hope they keep updating these cheat detections. They're definitely on the right track!
Ya I changed my mind on that, after looking at the actual programs. If one is a Bachelor of Music, and the other is a Bachelor of **Science**, then your job prospects are actually way different. I would be willing to take the debt on for the Bachelor of Science, which is what UM offers. Go with UM if it's a B.S.
I tend towards going for best price:performance.  But, as someone who has his machine running 24/7 unless AMD can take some major strides in power consumption compared to their current offerings it just isn't an option.
The debates work in a way similar to what you did, but I would suggest adding more length. There are counter arguments and long speeches in each of them.
My dad had one of these, as well as the Dycam Model 1. I remember playing with the Dycam and never being able to get anything close to a decent picture out of It, just strange black and white blurs with super high contrast. Then one day he brought th Mavica home. Holy shit. It seemed so futuristic. I was awestruck. You could snap shots with this thing, pop the 3.5" into the drive, and BOOM, fucking pictures on the computer. I think that was my first glimpse of the idea that technology would revolutionize the world we live in, and that there was more to computers than video games. While that camera is laughable compared to modern standards, it will always hold a special place in my memory for the glimpse it gave of the bigger picture of the world to come.

For edges I use a fabric adhesive I found in the glue section of Jo-Ann's ([Aleene's Stop Fraying](http://www.amazon.com/Aleenes-15629-Stop-Fraying-4oz/dp/B00114RDVI)). I trail a little bit around the edges, and it dries clear fairly quickly. You don't need a lot, so it only takes up 1-2 squares per edge on your Aida. I've also used masking tape, but it usually leaves a residue on my fabric.

Honestly, CC and time warner have good service/speeds, it's just their price thats shitty. They really gouge for their expenses, especially if they layer data caps on top of that.
http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/scions-cycles-redux/That's my preferred list. I have an older one (just "Scion's Cycles") that included all 5 from a cycle. I really like scion because you can tutor out dragons, and it just so happens that the best dragons are also in symmetrical cycles. There are a lot of cycles in that list, and the other cards in them are worth looking at. I know someone linked the list of cycles through m10, which was one of my resources while building. Hope this helps!If you want to do gods instead of dragons, Karona is pretty good.
096 has been caught when he got out before. it's not an end of the world scenario when he gets out. plenty of people die, but they always recapture him. and making sure he stays in is as easy as controlling the evidence of him.682 will eventually evolve a way to get out. when he does they'll catch him, but never the same way twice. he's constantly evolving. he should technically evolve an immunity to acid given enough time. when he does, and he's evolved a way to stop any attempt to recapture him, that will be a end of the world scenario.

There was a math teacher AND an English teacher at my high school who were known to rearrange the seating charts to put girls who typically wore low-cut tops and skirts in the front rows.
Yes, because TV writers are infallible. Are you saying that the characters are exactly the same as Martin's or that the ending can't possibly be affected by the characters being different?
i would definitely go back and watch from the beginning. there was a huge controversy over one of the early episodes where the typical comments were things like:* WTF UNSUB* why would you do that? you were off to a good start, but i'm not watching anymore unless you undo what you did.* wow, i can't believe that happened. * WTF UNSUB* Zisteau just ruined his own series and he's only X episodes in.* WTF UNSUB
Barely... He didn't make that much of an impact he was literally safe every week. Kennedy, Ginger, and Jaidynn we doing higher then him when he went home. 
Highest drafted gator since 1945 when Paul Duhart went #2 overall.He ties Steve Spurrier, Gerard Warren, and Wes Chandler as the second highest drafted Gator ever
It's my understanding that the way Cacique does their sizing, it goes DDD, then F. In US sizing, DDD = UK E, so F being Cacique's next cup size is theoretically equivalent to the UK F. Thus, if you're confident about the fit of your Cacique size you would be a 38F in UK size too, allowing for differences in different models. You can look up the measurements of bras that interest you on Bratabase.
This has been discussed quite a bit over the last week and a half. There is one side that believes that since it is dialogue from Return of the Jedi, it doesn't mean anything in this context. It's what he says in RotJ, it's what he says in the trailer. I would argue, however, that there is plenty of dialogue in the Star Wars saga that they could use, and Mark Hamill is a super talented voice actor, the use of that particular dialogue has some meaning. I'd like to think that Luke is still in communication with Anakin's spirit. Only 231 days until we find out for sure.
Show Jorah is a better all around person than book jorah, initially because the actor was just that good, and then they started writing toward that character.
Yeah, but what KIND of misbehavior his mom wouldn't consider a "bannable" offense is what interested me - I have no idea of the answer to that question... so I asked.  If I don't know the answer to that question, asking seems reasonable to me.
This is pretty much how I've understood it as well -- when there first began a massive influx of American/UK women ordering from EM, there was no real warning around that the bras ran wicked tight, and that you should size up 1-2 bands from your UK size. Eventually word got out about the bands running small, and it was really common practice up until recently to suggest sizing up a band or two for women wanting to try Ewa for the first time. I have to say that I've purchased over half the bras she put out in 2014 (I feel guilty admitting that, lol. A good portion of them were re-homed!), and I find most of them to run TTS.
Funnily enough, I took it in primary school. My teacher was the mother of a few of my schoolmates. All she ever taught us, though, was numbers and days of the week.Btw, I'm in Australia.
They were so peaceful they didn't even need the wheel or written language, one finger across the throat was enough for them. The universal sign for peace my friend. 
I kind of wish they had a few submarines loaded with torpedos.  They're based in the Netherlands by the way so it would be the Dutch government that has to look the other way. 
I'm a sucker for blue diamond habanero barbeque almonds. I portion them out into 1oz servings and snack on those.Other nuts are great too. Such as macadamias.I keep cheese sticks in the fridge at work as well! 
You summed up my thoughts about the vets. I totally felt that with this "veteran" mentality that they just went out there and did what they were known for instead of really pushing themselves. Our team needs to be like 65% young dudes and 35% vets instead of like 80% vet and 20% young.
Goodell really is arrogant. His only purpose tonight is to stand there, smile and announce picks. There's only 10 minutes in between each pick, he can stand behind a curtain waiting. He has his own minions who can coach specific players to do whatever. Screw Goodell
I once had a professor in culinary school draw a cock and balls on the board when showing how to use cucumbers as a garnish.  The whole class quietly giggled but he was older and didn't pick up on it. Near the end of his drawing and explanation he cut the end off the cucumber/dick and half the class groaned and the other half laughed outright. The professor stopped and looked as the drawing for a second and then he laughed too. 
if you do that much stuff I'd just make simple one with your name on it how to reach you..Ideally something basic on the back so they think twice not to write on it.. You don't really need a business card though.. 
My guess is this type of deeper functionality will come with next year's Redstone release. Stringing together all of these smaller building blocks to make a larger working machine.
I recommend not making a post just like this. You should make a post  that says how you messed up. And what you are going to do next time to prevent it. And shit happens no need to be sorry! Keep fighting with us!
Great photo! Maybe this is a silly question but I've often noticed the majority of craters seem to be circular in shape. Why aren't craters sometimes elliptical given that at least some impacts must be at a glancing angle.
Ultimate frisbee is no in anyway shape or form enough of a workout for you lower body. You said you can run full sprint as fast as your buddy whom squats everyday. I think that is just great.With that said I have the perfect experiment for you. Do squats at a perfectly reasonable weight tomorrow morning.Then challenge your buddy to a sprint the very next morning. I guarantee you that you will have a great time.
Honestly, it comes down to trust. If you want to be in a relationship with her, you need to be able to trust that she can go to these parties and nothing will happen. If she wants to go to the parties anyway despite knowing how you feel about them, that probably tells you something about how she prioritizes the relationship.

Most bonuses and stock grants I've seen are a percentage of salary so they grow with each other until you get a promotion, when the percentages may change again.

More than 1% of people in north america believe that. Probably more than 5% of the world still believes that if you include extremely religious people of certain affiliations and poor people with no education. Chances are there are people you know/have met that believe that.But they wouldn't say ''revolves'' they would say spins.
Which is why I said there would be two was of donating. You are absolutely correct on your end. So I will have direct links to those charities. And if anyone donates toward me to get the whole twitch alerts notification I will be putting that money toward the charity as well. I will donate all the money on stream so everyone knows I am not a scam.

The patch has been out all of a few hours, 10 million people play this game and I'll bet you a majority of them don't read the patch notes, what do you expect? That Sniper never gets picked again? He'll still get played a ton in low level pubs where he already destroyed before the buffs in 6.83. 
Another, hopefully related question. Why is it that we cannot create a box, fully reflective on the inside, capable of bouncing back light indefinitely?Imagine a box lined with mirrors and a source of light on the inside, which is turned on for just a second and then shut down.
Well you could also add time pressure to a TBS game. Just cap the turn limit so that as you increase in blob size the game becomes more difficult to manage. Its both interesting game play and a real life factor that limited empires.
Thanks for the feedback. The highest resolution I could find in the nvidia settings drop down was 1920x1080 and the xrandr command gave me a "cannot find mode 2560x1080" response. No dice so far, but I definitely appreciate the help.
A more likely scenario for early interstellar travel is that it will be a one way trip. If you do plan on returning you could analyze your surroundings to determine your position relative to the solar system. 
Hornqvist was playing with a broken rib. He still played fucking awesome, though, because he's not human but rather a ball of pure hockey energy and determination. So basically 3/5 of the core JR named was injured. Sid and Flower did all they could.

Nope, even if it causes damage. In fact, sometimes damage is the *aim* of satire. Libel is false statements *that a reasonable person would perceive to be true* and cause damage. Satire is statements that no reasonable person would think are true."My neighbor fucks children and stomps on kittens, chortling."  No one thinks that's true."My neighbor fudges his taxes a little bit sometimes."  That's totally believable.
I was thinking that he knew about Dan's advantage, but then I was trying to figure out how he learned that info as he doesn't really chat with Tyler/Carolyn... and I doubt Dan would have told him. 
Very good point. I know when I've seen a story about some white guys committing a heinous crime, upon hearing they were very poor I immediately jumped down to blaming it on their economic level. If they were mentally unstable I saw that as a reflection of all people with mental disorders or issues. It's such an unconscious process, humans are built to thinking very differently about people who are different than them.
I tried to explain that to people but most people don't understand. I'm fortunate in a sense that I live alone because I make sure I keep no junk food in the house
Frankly, I feel that "unplugging" means exactly losing your delusions about society, especially the ideals imprinted on us by vested interests like Disney. If you still feel that way - that things "should be" some other way - then you haven't unplugged.
Some are.  Some of us struggle along.  Some guys are really good at it, too, although most choose to steer clear of emotional stuff even if they know how to handle it.I am not very talented at the social stuff, but I've improved over the years with practice and observation.  Every time I notice a particularly deft social interaction, I stop to work through the "math" myself to see why it worked so well and how the other person knew what to do.  You can do the same.  Knowing that there is room for improvement is step one.
She sounds like a toxic person, and her keeping from your bank account is illegal. If it's in your name, you just need to go to the bank with ID and withdraw the money and put it in an account she doesn't have access to.

No its racist to target property based upon the race of the owner regardless of whether you are targeting them for protection or looting. When I say protect them all you protect them as much as you do other properties. You clearly can't protect all property but if you let race be a deciding factor it is racist. 
I'm a big RoosterTeeth fan. The only other Twitch I follow is Grifballhub (although I don't actually play the game). I'm a big pokemon fan, and I've been meaning to get a 3ds so I can play all generation in hard copies ( meaning non-emulated, although I do use an emulator at the moment).
I just had this dicussion with my 15 yo daughter. Wanted to get her thoughts after reading some stories about TransG kids in different schools. She said she doesn't care at all. The bathrooms all have stalls, so who cares? The locker room is a different story, but she thought the person could use the 'handicapped' shower where there is a curtain, so no one would have to see a dingaling. I personally think that the major issue is women are brought up to be so modest, and it can be a challenge to realize when someone is a perv or legit Trans. True pervs (especially teen boys) would go to great lengths to see some teen TnA in the locker room. 
Alright, so I'm a very hard worker and can sit focused and get a lot of work done quickly, like looking at raw data. Can hold my own but not the most social person. Analyst?
I loved Pearl's redesign from the start, and I think Garnet and Amethyst's are alright so far. I think it just takes a bit of getting used to, but these are definitely redesigns meant to be seen after a fair amount of character development.(Their original designs were meant to telegraph their personalities and introduce people to the characters easily, it seems like. These new ones are just cute outfits that'll look nice long-term.)
It wouldn't be too hard for them to allow users to set their own, but stylish and/greasemonkey are special suited to do this. Arguably, RES is already pretty bloated and could be replaced with a simpler greasemonkey script.

When did we pass an amendment which held that government employees have a constitutional right to be incentivized to break the law? Because I must have missed it.Further I missed when government organizations were barred from firing anyone unless that person was successfully convicted of committing a felony. There is probable cause that these people broke the law, that's good enough to fire someone, there is no requirement to be able to defend yourself prior to your firing. The municipality can simply hold that there is nothing the person can say to defend themselves of the alleged breach of conduct and that their employment is terminated.

&gt; Baylor played Kansas State last yearThis actually fits my point very well.  That was just about the best matchup you could have asked for in that week and it still wasn't enough of a bump to put Baylor in.This is exactly why I'm a proponent of the Big12 title game. If all of the games had been moved back a week and Baylor played KState for a second time, that would have given them a bigger bump.It also would have helped their strength of schedule by adding another quality opponent, even if they had already played once. 
Oh shit I could totally see that happening. Let's see, she disappeared 'weeks' after the funeral. So they could say that she found out she was pregnant the day she left and freaked out and ran away.
The problem is that when your entire argument relies entirely on the skill level of sheep, SHEEP for gods sake. I mean seriously if sheep is the missing link that separates your team from victory or humiliating failure, then no you are not a good team.

Own that shit!    If you can stay "normal" for any amount of time, you might just find her that grooves on you!   Keep all that bullshit self effacing shit to yourself always and Own yourself! !
I've been slacking like crazy on anime this past month. I've been watching Gintama but haven't watched a single episode in almost three weeks. I started Durarara!! about a week ago yet haven't touched it since then.I don't know what my dealio is.
I downloaded a huge collection of anime vector wallpapers [like this](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/127/f/d/saber___fate_stay_night_minimal_wallpaper_by_micah_halter-d7hjim4.png). I just have them rotating every 30 minutes. Pretty minimalistic and don't think a non-anime watcher would think much about it.
This is just the plan to plan the planning of the plan to plan the plan to get the public involved in the plan to plan the plan for public planned involvement in 2016.No wonder it take so long to get a project completed! How about we cut out some of the planning to plan plans and actually DO something.

This part?&gt; Expanded Office add-in capabilities—With Excel for iPad support for add-ins, developers can reach over 100M additional Office users. Word and PowerPoint for iPad are coming soon.Sure seems like it. I bet there won't be universal support, it's already pretty limited. I only use it to pull up sheets in meetings, doing any editing on an ipad is torture. The interface is just bad for working with spreadsheets no matter the app.
I haven't gotten mine yet, but I've seen some unboxings so I know what's coming. The s/p shakers are cute and even though I won't end up using them (I use grinders) I'll still put them up somewhere. I'm sure I'll dig the CD. The shirt on the other hand, while I am a fan of KH, I never really wanted a shirt for it so I'm pretty meh about that. I love that treasure chest dangler, but I'm not the least bit excited or interested in the magazine or the skylander. Figures my first month on would be a little underwhelming.6/10EDIT: After finally receiving my arcade block yesterday, I'm dropping my rating to a 5/10 just for the shipping issues. Still love the shakers and the dangler, diggin the CD, still meh about the shirt and magazine, but at least the Skylander I got was some kind of partially robotic dragon (Drobot), so that turned out better than expected. Looking forward to May's block and hoping that since the 25th is a monday this time around, shipping won't get so screwed up.
&gt;Edit: A lot of you fine gentleman are probably wondering "app? pornhub has an app? This sounds difficult and complicated to install." yeah they do (or so I've heard). Go to the mobile site, click the three orange bars in the top left-hand corner and at the top of the drop down you will see a link for the download (not that I would know).&gt; &gt;Android users: go into your phone's settings, select "security (or equivalent)" and enable "Install apps from unknown sources." Go back and download the APK. Happy Fapping! If you want to rename the app use your launcher, or a file explorer and if you are rooted you can change the icon itself  (Nova Launcher is what i used). If you wanna change the icon you can use a file explorer with an archive viewer (FX is what i used), open the apk, and replace the file "Pornhub_2.4.2.apk/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png" with something else.&gt;&gt;iPhone: You will need to Jailbreak your phone if you want any non-appstore app (lel).&gt;
Don't look at it that way! Maybe your comic primarily attracts readers with integrity and a conscience. Would Bill Watterson be disappointed if nobody made those idiotic truck window decals of Calvin pissing?
Sorry, what I meant was, the platypuses alive today never evolved.  Their genetic counterparts split off from them and became new species, but the platypus alive today have been the same for millions of years.  The environment those particular platypus are in was perfect for them, and they thrived there without having to change.
You guys just going to start your own FC? I would be willing to transfer to Hyperian in a week or two, as I'll have to transfer both mine &amp; my husbands characters. I will more then likely be playing a healer class, and him a ninja or monk. Just keep me updated on what's going on, it would be cool to have some friends going into this new expansion. 
The article isn't great, but if you listen to David's story you'll find that is entirely the fault of the newspaper. David makes no personal claims about being "cured" (I saw him speak tonight) - that is just tabloid sensationalism. He has a much more subtle view of the whole situation (a view which doesn't include miracle "cures", or even the word "cure" at all), from what I can gather.
In my opinion, people that deny having biases are just hiding them, and reviewers that try to manually remove their own biases end up with reviews that are more boring and emotionless. I like his reviews, even though I know there's whole genres of games we'd never see eye-to-eye on. 
Did you have custom cushions made? My jet has a chaise lounge near the bar and while it LOOKED good, I found it unbearable to lay on for more than 16 hours at a time. I had to bring it down in Qatar (can you imagine?!) and got my chef to find someone to make some modifications and reupholster it in a nearby village. It's far from perfect, the peacock feather and cashmere stuffing they filled the cushion with will need replacing before summer, but it's much better now than whatever garbage they put in it at Boeing. I should have listened to my friend and gotten a Bombardier Global Express. 
I had a guy pay me $40 to write 2 lines of code because he didn't know how to do it. Mutator and an accessor in java.&gt;int getScore() { return score; }&gt;setScore(int s) { score = s; }However doesn't beat OPs guy of not knowing how to set a variable. To my guys defense he was majoring in Mathematics and not compSci
I agree. I had my tissues ready, cuddly warm blanket and my childhood teddy bear all ready to grieve and come to terms with this. Still a lot of time left to the episode though, who knows what shonda has planned. 
I... Really don't think coffee is on the same level as sex. Ask /r/deadbedrooms.I've already been a month without sex because of surgery. :( I feel castrated and depressed. I really want this to be over very soon. I miss being a sexual creature.I'm going to try switching pills and giving it some time. I just hate that this problem has taken everything from me and my partner.

I stopped spending money on Lol when they screwed me and my legacy skins  :(I was an addict, too. Every paycheck I'd make sure to put some rp on with the goal of having 1 skin per champ. Good skins, too. Never again Riot. Path of Exile gets most of my cosmetic money now.
Is that the date you preordered?If so then it makes perfect sense. It is saying the item is on hold for you until it releases from 4/3(your preorder date).
It does for a while, until the next blow. But that's life, I guess. It's not easy. Sometimes we are meant to learn the hard lessons. Sometimes we get a break. Mostly in my life, for the past ten years, I've been suffering terribly. So it has not gotten much better for me, but I'm still here... Hoping. Hanging on. 
It was a bit freaky when it happened, odd the 2nd time and 3rd time fun but at 20.00 for 50 rounds 2 round burst is not worth it lol. I will have to take it apart and see what is going on and worst case get a new fire control group for it. Thanks for the link.

Sadly most of his story is in Paragon Lost. Something I never herd of until about 3 months ago. After seeing it I finally "got" james, I still think he is an idiot... but he is also a Bro.
I mean even the football associations of both countries have the word FOOTBALL in them. It's nothing at all like "Major League Soccer". I duno what the guy above is smoking. 
While this is supporting evidence, the post doesn't say that the game mechanics make it impossible. Making legacy items out of items that have variable mod rolls modified is a GGG policy, not a technical limitation. GGG could easily write a script to go through each item and scale the rerolled mod appropriately. They just don't think that additional downtime and disappointed players would be worth it.
It's actually not, if you use blink strike on a regular basis. Just depends on your build. Personally I roll heavy INT, but I know a couple others who are equally fanatic about DISC and STR, respectively.
honestly the pictures do nothing. sure the shaders are nice but I want to see more of the actual BUILD, not just what your comp can handle in terms of looks.
Ask him what spring is in the gun, because 75 feet is pretty terrible for a field gun. You should take a look at the hop assembly, clean the barrel and hop unit, and check if there is actually a nub in the hop arm
Finishing Nichijou here too! (Well, I'm actually halfway there, but it won't take my much to finish it now that I have 4 days of free time). High five~
I'm not a teacher but I do remember there being a big issue in the 9th grade where a teacher called a black female student wearing a head wrap "Aunt Jemima" to her face.
Because China obeys *zero* international laws, which is commonly known and proven. If you haven't seen that yet you live in a bubble.I take serious issues with many countries, as many Western as not, but China.... Wow.... One of the countries with the least sense of honor of *any* nation on the planet.
My girl didn't hesitate to eat. I fed Monday with my sling, just to see if she would. (Got her Thursday)  I know Dubias are bad about burrowing so I removed legs and stuck it on its back. The mount of substrate she built up and rings the top of her burrow is layered thick with web. The texture is almost like cotton- the roach couldn't get away. Left it alone for about 30 minutes- roach was gone- three hours later the bolus was kicked beyond her wall. 
Interesting. I tend to think that everyone faces reincarnation in the long-run, but that there is an intermediate period in which they can pursue whichever afterlife they may be drawn to, whether it's haunting the Earth, entering the halls of their gods or their ancestors, or maybe even exploring oblivion.

I was in the second grade, the male teacher made constant sexual innuendos about us girls. This bred a really weird atmosphere amongst the kids.  I remember some of the male students looking over the stalls when we would use the bathroom. The teacher made me feel really ashamed when I told him about it. Looking back on it as an adult, I'm pretty he was grooming us.

I want to work for Marvel.This requires a popular indie comic.This requires good art.I lack such skills.Therefore, I must get an artist to work with.Good artist are usually busy and not willing to take a leap of faith with a no-name wannabe.Therefore, my purpose in life is to get enough renown on teh interwebz to be able to get a good artist, who then helps make a good (web?)comic, get popular enough for Marvel to notice, and hope they like.
Just finished listening. Very well made pilot episode. I'll definitely be listening to future episodes since it seems like I have similar taste in streetwear items. Keep up the good work!
I think I stopped just before the last patch, and have kept on an eye on reddit also my only assumption was about cheats, and that's a pretty solid assumption. The friend who still plays also keeps me informed. Last time I was talking to him and was thinking about logging in he was certain one of our bases was being raided by ESPers, and I trust his assessment. The problem with ESPers they're always a click away from some other BS cheat. So ya, no thanks, and GG I guess.
if you're even considering taking the fall i think it's not for you. these routes are just bolted for the mistakes and improbabilities of life in such that not everyone has to commit to life vs. death and the "hardest" sections of the climb. but trust that you **can die** on a runout slab.

He also wrote, directed, and starred in a movie called ***The Apostle*** which was quite good.  (The same's true of ***Angelo My Love*** and ***Assassination Tango***, but I haven't seen either of those.)
They don't. It is only the religious people that claim that science claim that it is the ultimate truth. Scientists never claims that.And science can't be the ultimate truth because they use models. And models are simplified versions of reality to make it easier to predict how a chemical or space craft will react. E.g. Newtons model and Einsteins model don't contradict each other. They complete each other. Newtons model is less accurate than Einsteins models but it is way easier to calculate and gets the job done for most space crafts. That is why it is used, Einsteins models would take supercomputers and too much time to calculate the space craft orbit. 
Yeah, how ridiculous was that? Lily can't connect with her actual children, but she somehow has enough maternal instinct to take pity on a pregnant woman?? HUH?

ActBlue is totally legit. Look them up on the FEC. They are by far the largest source of funds for progressive candidates. And if you go to Bernie's website to donate, you'll see that he's linking directly to ActBlue. Let's help him become the next president of the United States!
Finland has long standing ties to Russia and is linguistically and culturally tied to the nation. If they had've lost the winter war they'd be clumped in with Estonia as soviet spoils, and known as eastern europe. I'm not attempting to sidetrack you by any means. 
If someone's willing to learn a new language, cross an ocean, bust their ass, *and* take a smaller paycheck than you, then they deserve that job and you do not.
This is really hilarious.What are the two TTS voices being used from acapela-group?I think I figured one of them out as "WillBadGuy", but the other more derpy one I have no clue.Took me a while to realize these weren't real people reading them out.
Yeah, I found those about an hour ago.  Three, I think.  One of them just has a codex entry and some weird shit in it that one of your characters will comment on. I made the mistake of buying every weapon, upgrade, and armor blueprint the dwarf merchant had instead of just the Tier 2 stuff.  With all the chests around town, I should be able to make up for such a stupid mistake in short order by farming gold.  I know it's a dirty exploit, but I don't want to get somewhere with some sweet-ass loot and not be able to afford it because I had a brain fart. Also, I wasted an Inquisition point on Rare stocks, thinking that merchants would have better shit, but all I got was 10 each of a bunch of Tier 1 crafting items.  I was not a happy camper. 
Don't break the mirror. Have you ever heard about leaving the genie in the bottle? It's pretty much it, the mirror might be restraining it and you might release the thing by breaking it.
Opps, meant to say "entry into pc gaming" since it could max out a ton of games and will help them ease into pc gaming. Been spending too much time on pc part picker. But anyway, I think $600-800 is the sweet spot for price:performance when it comes to a gaming pc, especially since the OP wants to play Witcher 3. That's not to say you can't build a good pc for $450-550, hell a $300 used parts pc can hold it's own pretty well.
To be fair, there's a difference between perfectly safe, albeit possibly bland food kept in a freezer and meat stored outside in the open air for 2 years that's covered in old crusty mold and the remnants of insect activity.    However once I saw that the inside was perfectly fine.   I did share some with another neighbor who has kids and at least one of the kids liked it.   That kid will eat things even I am sqeamish about though.
No, you are simply wrong - if someone on my team grabs that point, and the other team is smart, that point will forever remain ours even when we don't want it any more, and thus the game is fucked.  Go back to gaystation.  I play on multiple xbox accounts, too.  We both have better things to do than argue on the internet, and it's my group, so I get to decide who I want and don't want on my team.  Also, 9/10 times I make this post, we win 19 out of 20 games
Two things: I've met plenty of non-self respecting humans, and also PLENTY that don't think before they open their mouths.So, usual percentage chance of "That happened", but it's certainly within the realm of reason. 
Totally depends on the circumstances of the situation. If a stranger grabs someone off the street and rapes them, yeah, that's an abnormal, psychopathic person. But with the definition of rape being what it is, the lines are much more grey. Plenty of "normal" people have committed rape, just like plenty of "normal" people have committed murder. It's not just psychos that are raping and killing people - it's "normal" people too, and that's what's scary.
many times I actually can't stay. I'm always friendly and helpful, but most gigs I have to duck out. With that being said, I usually don't play the stacked band shows much anymore. 
I can't upvote this enough. I feel if it should be a criminal offense if you falsify rape accusations. In fact, I think they should suffer the same consequences the accused were to face. That's justice.

So you blame the crimes of a select group of people on all Muslims? The Catholic church, and even the Salvation army all abused children in the hundreds, if not thousands. Yet I don't call for the deportation of all Catholics.
another thing, I've been nova. this is so not true, it's just wishful thinking. novas don't usually have up to standard gamesense and DEFINITELY do not have good aim. if they had either, they would be out of nova. Try to get better instead of saying "oh I have gamesense but bad aim" or "oh I have good aim and has gamsense" because the contrary evidence is your rank.I don't mean to be condescending but I used to think this way and it didn't get me anywhere.
Darts always stack, applying multiple armor repairs and extending the heal duration (not amount per second).Armor repair may seem useless, but wait until you get vaccinate (lv20). That gives 4% armor per heal, or 6% if you also use armament. You can repair more armor than you lose from trash zeds.
Can you help me find any kind of technical notes or anything about "fake" double escapements? I'm actually curious how a second escapement can be added as a decorative complication without adding any actual mechanical benefit - is it riding on a clutch or something?
All well and good to think that, but according to the law, someone "under the influence of alcohol" is incapable of giving consent. Sooo a drunk tryst can quickly become rape charges if your partner decides retroactively that you raped him or her -regardless of how drunk the people involved were.
Here's 25.2505-2T(a)(3):&gt;Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent marriage or divorce. A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined in §20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of the surviving spouse’s taxable gift, the surviving spouse is married to another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the last deceased spouse as that term is defined in §20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter.Maybe I misunderstood your question, but Spouse-1 dies, ya get their DSUE and get to use it until Spouse-2 kicks the bucket, at which point Spouse-1 DSUE is eliminated since now Spouse-2 is the last deceased spouse.
Holy shit, I just realised NIS America released the uncut Animax version of the Cardcaptor Sakura dub from seven years ago last year!And Crunchyroll can't friggin show it in the UK. Fuck.
&gt;How did you know they were German Roaches?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cockroachThey have a very distinctive look and size from asian and american roaches. They multiply like crazy, and when an actual infestation is in a home they are in every nook and cranny.
Just to share.I went to my grandmother's funeral 39 years ago and I can remember not understanding what all the fuss was about. We had been very close; she taught me to play cards when I was quite young and we would spend hours playing canasta, while she chain smoked cigarettes and drank cold coffee (not iced coffee but black coffee that was room temperature). At that time aspergers was not on anyone's radar and even autism was not a term used by the general public. For decades I wondered why my reaction was so different from everyone else's and now I know I was not a bad grandchild I was simply different from the rest of my family. Over the years I have experienced more losses and some have affected me more than others but none to the extent that NTs seem to be affected. You are not broken, nor are you alone. You are unique. 
If I remember correctly, they actually thought they would give him fake ears and paint whiskers on them. If I also remember correctly, I really enjoyed the beer I drank after reading those comments.
Well your internal organs can give out and die while you're still alive, is it possible that this could happen with large patches of skin? Not just on the surface like most dead skin, but down to the meat?

I lose a lot of time because I live in the dorm (people are pretty loud and I can't get a single.)Hence, I only get to sleep for 6 hrs or less. That why I am getting an apartment. The difference between a dorm and an apartment is only 12K per year, so I think I can pay it by part time jobs and savings. 
I always figured he was like Solid Snake, except he disguises himself as a truck rather than a cardboard box — which is a lot more practical for moving about when you're in disguise.
I don't even know what to do at this point! It was right before work so I didn't have time to ice it like I'm seeing all over the internet....I threw on cover up (that didn't help at all) and it's still burning 10 hours later.
I used to work at taco bell for about two years and the employees are always getting yelled at if they don't put the right amount which is two scoops or one. It's not always the employees fault. 
Well, actually not. For something to be a theory, it has to be testable or measurable. It must be an objective* phenomenon.That isn't to say that a scientific theory can't be proven incorrect, however it does mean that they have evidence to back up what they're saying. God, Dieties and most "mythic" elements of any religion are, but their own nature, a subjective phenomenon. As such they cannot possibly be measured. That's not to say that God or another religions primary diety isn't sitting in a literal Heaven, or whatever one might believe.The important part is His (or Her, or Its) existence cannot be measured in any way. So, it's inaccurate to say "a theory of God." Theories, by definition, are proven fact until proven otherwise. Rather it would be better to say "a hypothesis of God."
I do not know her at all and have no ties to her or anyone she knows.  He has an important job that requires site surveying. If I was snooping I would have gone through his phone without asking. I did not have any intention of snooping which is why I asked him instead. It was left open for me to see sorry not sorry.
And Thorn. It's so funny when we all spawn in. Here is what the enemy team is composed of: 3 TLW and 2 Thorns or: 2 Thorns, 2 TLW, 2 Red Death's. Am I the only one who doesn't use an exotic primary in the Crucible?
Everything you said is basically what I said. I said I continue to tip the way I do because they're not getting paid nearly minimum wage. I said that things should change and they should get paid a livable wage. I didn't accuse anything you said of having a socio-economic agenda. All I said is that they need to paid more and that I was tipping because they're not, although I think there should be change. 
I wasn't sure about this because I don't catalog a lot of alternate formats, so I went to my easy, go-to source of info for this type of thing: https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/007motio.html   It looks like motion picture refers to analog filmstrips versus videorecording (i.e. DVDs, VHS, etc., as outlined here: https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/007video.html). DVDs would be videorecording, not motion picture, though.  Edit: It's unclear whether 8mm film &amp; Super 8 films fit in one or the other, to be honest.
That's a load of wisdom. I just don't know of any keyboards that fit my particularly long list of requirements. I haven't found a cherry MX blue keyboard with a black outside and the vibrant green lighting yet. I need a few macro keys on it and that's it. Its almost impossible to find any like that though.
Michael Kelly had his contract terminated by "mutual consent" in January or February. I read that the management staff disliked his attitude and his behaviour on social media (wanking over Celtic). 
&gt; You think the top 10% of Asian men have an issue getting women?I'm sure top 10% of any men are slaying it. But fair comparisons can only be made within same weight classes. Who do you think have an easier time, top 10% Asian men, or top 10% white men? what about mid 50% Asian men vs mid 50% white men?You may have thrived, but there is still no denying the playing field was/is uneven.
I hate how politically correct things are these days. You can't even say black paint anymore. You have to say "Tyrone, would you please paint the fence"

That's another thing I don't understand. It seems like when I watch Glory, those guys are able to move super fast even though they don't really cross their legs and seem to mostly "slide". How the hell do they do that?
There are 93 seconds in this video, in that time frame, I wonder how many camera shutters you can here. Almost like he meant to miss the shots, on the other hand Italian made loafers aren't exactly Air Jordans.

I very, *very* rarely work more than 8.5 hrs in a given day (and refuse to work on weekends, unless we're in a situation where an SLA could be jeopardized), and I've received increases in compensation during every review that I've participated in. If you're boss is worth his salt, he'll care way more about the quality of the work you're doing, rather than the amount of hours you put in.That being said; if you deserve the raise, then you deserve the raise. Amounts are relative; your boss will probably need to work with a budget, which was probably set in Q4 of 2014 and approved by your company's board (if applicable). It's not unreasonable to expect a bump in your compensation every year, provided that you're doing good work.
You're missing the votes-"no"-on-surrender-trolling.  I'm not talking about the "never surrender - there's always a chance to win" argument.  I'm talking about the fuckwad troll who does everything you mentioned but won't let you surrender while he moves back and forth inside the base dropping a few dozen useless mines.
Read the manga, watch Brotherhood. The original just isn't that great after a while because they caught up to the manga and had to make up their own ending. 
Return him to the way he was? Sure: divine interventionHe is bringing baggage from a previous relationship into yours. This is a very selfish thing to do, and is often the beginning of the end for any type of relationship, be is professional or romanticIf you have baggage, deal with it before you start a new relationship
Oh, see, for games it's definitely a curve for me.In an FPS, sober, I'm pretty good depending on the game.2 beers in, I am God.  Slaughtering the entire enemy team and feeling good about it.4 beers in, I'm down a few places...still slaughtering many enemies...only now I'm taunting and telling them I'm drunk while I beat them down.6 beers in, I'm in the corner of the map dicking around and generally being zero assistance to the team.

Or alternitively , Drilling for oil will cost more than you can sell it for, and since alternatives exist there is now a price ceiling. (you can't sell fuel for a petrol powered car for more money than it costs to charge an equivalent electric car and remain competitive.)  
Really hope someone makes a reddit thread showing instructions on how to do this, or make a simple tool to do it easily or something that reaches front page..
&gt;if someone is making something HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE MONEY OUT OF ITSo if I'm growing weed, I should be able to sell that- oh wait, there are laws against that. How silly of me.
No they can't - no male tarantula will molt after getting emboli. The tibial hooks are only for the mating procedure itself to lift the female.(Although there are very rare reports of mature males, that molted again, even some who molted 2 times, but those are sick molting defects and they can't mate anymore afterwards as the emboli molt too, but then are defective) 
If not that, then what exactly is the state-of-the-art for popcorn popping *en masse*?  Perhaps something like [the last scene in "Real Genius,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rthHSISkM7A) I suppose. 
I think the two are the same, in that the result is your run being over. Either way, if you block yourself in you can just quit and start in at the same room. That would untrap you.
I miss irishflow... :-( She put out some of the hottest, classy, artistic pics on the net of gorgeous shoes and her AMAZING derrière! It's too bad it stopped being fun for her when people kept stealing her pics and claiming them as their own. She left reddit and went to tumblr but has since stopped posting altogether.

That's very true.  And I think that also reflects how Samaritan went to work for Greer without taking the time to understand him and it's other agents.  Harold took a lot of time with the machine to teach it about humanity.  Samaritan is far superior in certain aspects, but it doesn't possess that "wisdom" for lack of a better term.  It's incredibly intelligent and capable, and it is trying to play this game on the same level as a machine that has been doing it for years.
That idea displayed on the graph seems being noncontroversial. There are lot of douches out there trying to take your money, so if you get a bad vibe from some resource move on.I like Pickup Podcast and Tom Leykis Show as a podcast. PP focuses a lot on basic social skills and making positive changes in your social network. TL gives you a cold **dark** reality of the nature of dating.
It just means that you pre ordered it on April 3.  It's not a glitch per se, but it is misleading.  It was the same way with wave 2/3 and probably before that.
Moo. Who cares, there are a billion other manga sites out there. And unless RedHawk goes down, were fine. If they do get a DMCA of some sort, they can just move their servers to Russia. (I did that before.)

I am feeling that. Thankfully, I have an appointment with a psychologist next week. Even having that as a "checkpoint" to look forward to is a huge help. Not a cure, but a huge help.
I remember working out the easy way to add sets of consecutive numbers and feeling very smart until I read that (I think it was) Euler (who) figured it out when he was like 8. Wellllllllp.
Well I am not wealthy my parents might be.  My dad is a doctor but because I have siblings he could only pay for 13K a year.  Not nearly enough for what I am paying.  And I would not put the loan on my parents as I am the one who wants to be a doctor not my parents.

This:      i= str.find_first_of("*", i)finds the first position of an asterisk in the string starting at offset in the string of `i`. This:      string::nposis a special value that indicates that character(s) that find_first_of was searching for cannot be found.So this:      while (string::npos != (i= str.find_first_of("*", i)))says loop as long as an asterisk can be found.Note that to be portable (or even to work), this:      int i = 0;should really be:      std::string::size_type i = 0;
And the marriage part?Impressive stuff - you'll probably be getting the correct anyway, but just as a formality, please answer all parts of the initial question :)
Great movie. I was told by a friend that in the original writings of the script that when danny died derrick actually went back and joined the movement. Anyone else ever hear that of know of it being true?
that happened to me in 6th grade. mrs nestor said those exact same words to me. i laughed like it was some joke that i was in on, like me and her were buddies and that was our inside joke or something, it wasn't. another time she accused me of cutting my own hair in front of the class, and only stopped when i said that i must just have ugly hair.
No, the vet said just give her wet food. I found a kind that is not a solid lump of wet can-shaped food. It comes in plastic cups and is very liquidy with small chunks of meat. She seems to do okay with that. But I did buy a bag of Merrick kibble that has itty bitty pieces. My elder cat likes that, so Lana can also try that if she gets brave enough. Apparently, cats can learn to eat piece-by-piece and throw it to the back of their throats to just swallow.I feel so sad for her. I just hope this is a fix for her troubles. 20% of cats still require medication and frequent vet visits for life after full extraction. She's only two and a half.
The player probably dropped the .money at the ATM.  He is either just wealthy and gave away 100 dollars in game money or used a trainer to give himself unlimited cash.Spend it as fast as possible and store expensive cars in garages.  The devs usually wipe the money but leave the items.
Ok let me try again and explain to you.First he punches MCW  right in front of Giannis and then he tries to do the same thing on Giannis and punch him hence why Giannis got pissed off and retaliated like that.So do we agree that dunleavy started all this shit up or not ?
Probably 2-3 weeks before you can plant tomatoes outside in a bed. But if you use large pots, you probably could just cover them with something if it get too cold at night &amp; get an early start. you might want to get starts for toms or peppers. But seed is fine for greens, cukes, herbs, beans, squash, etc. Seeds are easy. Just make sure they are planted at the proper depth. 
sorry guys, i forggot i posted this, havent been on in a few days, cause i too found the crack fix shortly after and have been playing wwe ever since lmao. but thanks for the responses. :)
Thank you for the honest advice!We got married for many other reasons, this is the only part I'm worried about a baby changing! But counselling can never be a bad thing, IMO, and I'm sure DH would be up for it.
Don't follow these things closely, but it may be that Pearl fans have been a bit quiet recently (and, yes, maybe a bit disappointed by her last performance) while the Katya and Trixie fans have been out in full force, hoping that their trash talking will somehow influence the results of a program that was recorded months ago. I myself find ludicrous (yes, LUDICROUS) the claim that there should have been a double elimination a la Honey and Vivian. First, because there is no comparison between them in terms of which one was worse (it was Honey and Vivian). Second, neither Honey nor Vivian had shown they had the potential to go all the way to the end when Ru eliminated both of them. The same cannot be said of Pearl, who has won TWO challenges, and shows remarkable skills for someone who has been doing drag for one year. Will she win season 7? Most likely, no. But the relish with which people are trashing her now is … ridiculous. 
In one of my 7th grade classes my teacher pointed out the fresh period stain on a girls skirt as she went up to the board. She ran out of the classroom.Edit: doesn't really meet the criteria of the post, but it was messed up.
China invaded them back in '79, pulled out after a while. If they really wanted to, they could, but it would be messy.The Chinese aren't interested in the Vietnamese mainland though; so an invasion wouldn't be necessary. They want to islands off the coast, in the South China sea. There's oil and natural gas there, and it would give them control over some of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
I understand it can be done, but yoga is not my priority - I will progress slower, absolutely, as I will with everything because I have no focus, and I'm totally okay with that. If I did yoga 6x/wk without fail, it would mean skipping the time I have to clean my apartment or spend time with my boyfriend, or skipping my gym sessioms, and that wouldn't be conducive to overall life-balance.
Go to an alternative school. Every teacher says things that if you heard, youd probably find it a bit odd.For instance, An eenglish teacher once told a student do his dishes, and proceeding to call him her bitch. Not a big deal to us at all.
But does the stun go off before the monster attacks, just like the bomb explosion? If that is the case, the monster loses two attacks instead of one. Fairy's bar is full, bomb goes off, then stuns. Fairy would have gotten an attack but doesn't, is stunned, 0% atk bar. Bar fills to 100%, fairy loses turn, stun clears. That's two lost attacks instead of one.  I don't have a bomber, but does the unit get an attack immediately after the bomb goes off or is it immediately stunned?
I'm looking at them right now and they look exactly the same. Only thing I'm worried about is that the 23 on the back are different sizes. No idea if that has anything to do with the creasing on the back or anything.
I hate these kinds of channels whenever you type anything  on youtube related to bollywood its always these crappy suggestions "hot mms leak","hot scene kiss" and the comments are filled with horny teens writing pathetic crap or pretentious assholes talking about indian culture or telling its a publicity stunt
Not to use it, no. If you want to use the cloud sync service to get the photos on your mobile device and have them update on your desktop, it's $10/mo. 
I'll take the inverse of this question. What is a fetish you saw in porn and didn't realize you had?Sexually submissive. I am laid back and that's all I thought it was.No. When a guy gets assertive with me, I get majorly turned on and my brain shuts the hell down. I exist to please him and make him feel good. Almost any fetish he enjoys, I will automatically enjoy, because it turns him on. (no to scat and blood, thank you).It kinda scares me a bit. I'm worried I'll get into a situation that will go too far and I'll keep submitting. I'm not sure where my limits are, frankly, with the exception of the aforementioned scat / blood.
Lol all children are different. You can't just generalize whether hitting works or doesn't. In my situation is was my mom trying to keep 4 boys from tearing up the neighborhood, so I think she had to do what she had to do. And when I say hitting I'm not talking about abuse, just enough to get the point across. If anything, it was the fear of getting my ass kicked that kept me on my best behavior, which subsequently kept my parents from having to discipline me; so spanking your kids or whatever is more to show them that they can't get away with everything, and there's consequences to their actions, and I personally think it's formed me into a fine gentleman if I do say so myself. 
I think it just depends... like guys wearing their pants at their knees where you can see their boxers looks pretty silly ... but also I guess if it is a guy I'm attracted to it's a different story. 
It depends on a number of things:- how nice your bike is.- how good your lock is (not all U locks are equally good)- where you lock it (somewhere high-traffic is better)- how long it's locked there and what time of dayI have locked my $1400 bike up all over town with a Kryptonite u-lock and never had it stolen (7 years of heavy commuting).  I have had stuff stolen off of my bike though (lights, mirrors).  Always run the U lock through your wheel and your frame and the rack.  I think it also helps if your bike doesn't look flashy.
This is gonna be awesome.  I think people are overlooking the fact that you'll be able to do a bunch of stuff on your PC while playing Xbox games.  Best of both worlds IMO.
Can we talk about the character development this Dave has been through? As in the fact that he's actually being sincere about his feelings right now? The thing he has basically never did ever until he spent 3 years on a meteor cuddled up with an alien watching rom-coms?
All except Vulcan ult (Since it goes much farther than the ruler) and Hou Yi's Ricochet since they removed the charge up. Why? It's just what I'm use to/comfortable with and I want to be as efficient as possible when casting.
My understanding is that the mono-eye has superior long-range resolution capabilities at the cost of depth perception; in the context of the Zeon's original mobile suit development, this design choice made sense as mobile suits were primarily expected to be engaging Federation warships that provided huge passive sensor returns even at range. Federation fighters had such inferior manuverability compared to Zakus that the mobile suits' pilots could rely on their secondary sensors to guide them, so there was no impetus to upgrade.The Federation's mobile suits, on the other hand, were built from the ground up to engage other mobile suits. Here depth perception and predictive accuracy became dominant requirements, and in that context the compound sensor design is superior to the mono-eye.
At the request of /u/brettins I'm going to do these some more. The next one I'm doing, at his request, is graphene.Many of the sources came from Wikipedia, but I then read through most of these sources to verify that they actually contained the information I was looking for.
No doubt. But they are just dumb. With all the players we promised them they could have actually been someone. I'm really glad we still have cox and the salt will pass lol 
Twitch chat really helped out.  I'll be putting up the conclusion to the run in the coming days, although it'll be tough without the eyes and ears nearby to help me out.
I was right there last week, I remember the row of buildings on the left and the church on the right.  I took a boat tour of the canals.  Sadly, I could only spend an afternoon there.  
I can see you now. "Oh, guy I used to work with and sort of knew, I can't live without... that stuff you used to do! I miss your... stuff and I really liked your... Native American tattoos? Woe is me!"
All of the countries who are pushing for it and signed onto that effort certainly seem to think its Free Trade.  Yes, TPP is more intellectual property oriented than past efforts have been, but it is *still* an expansion of Free Trade.  That makes it worthy of abandonment and rejection.  
for the record, I've read Underwater Light, which I didn't realize was slash until it was too late to drop it... I mean, it was definitely really good, and the harry/draco pairing was fairly believable, it just wasnt my cup of tea.
Bring a lighter into the building. My department alone contains probably 100 gallons of some of the most flammable and explosive solvents you can get your hands on. The building gets evacuated if you so much as break a bottle.
Transistor did this and I actually really liked it. It sucked me in right away.I can definitely understand why some (most) people wouldn't like it though.
Thanks man!  I was curious to see how much editing latitude there was with current camera raw files.  I poked around all the ones you posted in bridge.  Looks like it's pretty good for a camera phone.Still much nosier than dedicated large sensor cameras, but none of those are integrated into existing phones (except maybe the CM1).  I'd say those ISO 50 shots you took are about as good noise wise as ISO 200 on an Olympus E-PL2.
This doesn't sound offense to me either way. If the facts are factual, that's it. People need to stop being butthurt by true numbers. No progress will be made until one side stops getting butthurt about the numbers and the other side stops getting butthurt when the numbers side wants to talk about the historical precedence for those numbers. 
Maybe you should tell that to the people who run the Iditarod they don't have control over their dogs. Dogs have this amazing ability to respond to commands. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the concept of training or how training works, but a well trained dog can be right next to you or 100 feet away, and when you give a command, the dog responds. 
Honestly I thought this was just something you see in movies or on TV I didn't realize it actually happens. You know what I mean you hear of 'chop shops' and that kind of thing. Sorry OP. :-(
The original comment was saying that the gif looked bad, /u/how_is_this_relevant (who shall be referred to as OP) was saying that he disagreed in a comedic fashion by implying that the original commentor had meant to type "glorious"; however, they accidentally mispelled it, writing "bad" instead.OP is an epic memer.
I was thinking about this, but I believe the major factor in hiring people for manager positions is experience. I don't have any. So I feel like I would be wasting my time if I were to apply to another retail place for the same position. 
I just treat it like arena's in wow. I got to 2.3k rating by not back pedalling ever, you just turn and run/walk at full speed, rather than slower by back-pedalling. No one in arena's backpedals in wow, not even the pro's.    In smite, I can turn my mouse pretty fast, and run at full speed then turn around again quite hastily if needed, which is fine for assassin junglers, who I mainly play. I can see where you're coming from when referring to hunters / adc's. Back-pedalling can be fine to shoot and step back. I guess that's just my play style though.   If I do ever need to play adc's I pick neith/ullr, who have escapes.And as for LoL, I mean using QWE is easier, as it lets me hit my binds faster.
No. I ordered them from subispeed.com Actually ordered them before I had the car because I heard they were on back order everywhere. Ended up getting them in a week so they sat on my floor for like a month and half before my car got delivered Haha. 
My time to shine, if late.From the ages of around 10 to, well, a few years ago (around 21), I have dreams of various men standing outside of my window, staring at me. They are never in the house, they are always outside my window, looking in. It's never the same man nor is it always a HUMAN man, sometimes it is a demon or a shadowy figure. Sometimes they attempt to break in, sometimes they attempt to run, sometimes they just stare no matter how much I yell or try to get them to go away. Depending on the man, I either am paralyzed in fear or run after them, ready to kick some fucking ass.Lately, I haven't had one of those dreams. Instead, I've been having a lot of dreams of ghosts or demons haunting my house but I can't see them, so I get mad and tell them to come out and fight me. Can't show fear, after all.

What do you mean? I'm going to take a swing in the dark and guess you're asking why people build Haunting Guise/Sorc Shoes or Abyssal/Sorc Shoes and that is because most ranged champs have 30 base MR so you can deal true damage.
That makes me happy. I'm super busy until Tuesday, after which I should be able to participate in most RPs. The more ops that take place after Monday the better.

Solid idea...makes sense.I have a feeling that 95% of what we've seen is in the first half of the movie.* Any word on movie length ?  I hope it's like 3 &amp; 1/2 hours.

That's how Danial Craig plays Bond; rough, aggressive, a brawler. His Bond is when an immovable violent object meets a powerful, monolithic force. Hardy would play it the same way, if not more rough and more aggressive. Now that I think about it, I agree with you. He's probably too thuggish for it.

I know. It really is about jobs. In more rural communities the jobs just aren't there the same - it's not cheap to truck stuff out of more remote locations.  Because of this, jobs are super centralized. The jobs where you can earn the most are in big cities, and population density is bonkers in these cities, so lots of people have to commute. This drives prices up like you wouldn't believe!
What type of BOA card is it? Cash Rewards? At 14.99, it's def wise to transfer the balance on there even with the 3% transaction fee. The amount of interest you'd be saving outweighs the fee and 14.99 as a go to rate is not bad. Probably the same APR you currently have for your purchases. I'm a CSR at the Bank, hope that helps.

Twitter, no joke. I follow SAA, JN, other rebels, IS sympathisers (until I break their circlejerk and they block me), YPG and mapmakers. Most of the twitter accounts also posted videos and pics regarding their operations, capture of places/people or in the case of IS or JN: executions.I actually find twitter more reliable and comprehensive than mainstream media with regards to Syria.
We *kinda* do. There is a very weak, overworked and pretty ineffective network of care for these patients. It's no fault of the workers (they are usually competent and caring). It's the government fault (in all levels, municipal, state and federal). There are veryf ew shelters and they usually have drug addictions and conflicts with law enforcement too. It's a mess. The real difficult part as a doctor is not treating those guys, it's when they are ready to be discharged from the hospital and you have no choice but to take them out of what they consider a 5-star hotel and throw them back into the hell hole they came from..

They discuss the subnets that they use in there too, so you can be sure not to use them (it looks like they're doing stuff in the CGN range (100.64.0.0/10), so pretty much any normal private subnet should do fine).

Halftime Four FactorsFactor | Bulls | Bucks------|-----|-----EFG% | 59.2% | 39.4%OREB% | 27.3% | 04.8%TO% (est.) | 14.1% | 20.2%FT Rate | 14.3 | 36.4Posted this in /r/nba and got asked to post it here too. I did these Four Factors breakdowns for some Duke games on /r/collegebasketball because I like to see what some of the stats say about the game, and whether it agrees with my eyes. Here, it basically confirms everything we're seeing: the Bulls are shooting really well and the Bucks aren't, the Bulls are doing a lot better on the offensive glass than the Bucks, and the Bulls aren't turning it over as much. But what I don't think gets captured is the percentage of opportunities that the Bulls are converting compared to the Bucks. The Bulls are outscoring the Bucks 15-1 off of turnovers, which exacerbates the disparity in turnover rate. They're 7-7 from the line to the Bucks' 7-12, neutralizing the Bucks' advantage in free throw rate. That's just my two cents.
Placed a pretty big order. I got 2 surprise me sample packs - I love surprises! Oh, and a custom lipgloss (even though that wasn't on sale... I was paying for shipping, so why not?!)
I was experimenting with the coefficient of drag, and entered the wrong thing. I fixed it, and that changed it from 700k joules to 33k. Factor of ten means multiplied or divided by 10. "Order of magnitude" means the same thing. For scientists doing rough calculations ("back of envelope" or napkin calculations), getting it to within an order of magnitude is the first step.If I'm going to the moon, how much energy will I need? Looked it up, and it says the Saturn V rocket produced 10^11 joules of energy. Doing rough calculations, it doesn't matter if it's 1x10^11 or 2x10^11 , the exponent is the important part.I used the dimensions from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Delivery  to do my calculations.
I play whenever I feel like playing. Never use a guide. It takes me around 3-6 weeks to finish a Jrpg, but I do play other games inbetween like Fifa or Dota.
I am the Baroness of Butts. The Duchess of Derierres. Guardian of the Glutes. I could litterally spend half an hour unapologetically explaining how wonderful butts are. Tina Blecher was created with me on mind. 
Hm the only other keyboard I plan on using the the macbook keyboard though, which I would argue is a totally different feel from ALL separate keyboards though, not just the HHKB. Each to their own though!
It's basically a bigger 9:30 Club (with bottle service? That might be for EDM shows, though). It's hard to get to unless you take a taxi/school bus shuttle from NoMa metro. Overall, it's not so bad, just in a weird location.
Accepting embassies early game can give you a solid gold boost when you most need it. Unless they are very close by or are very aggressive, always sell your embassy.
I read them to entertain a cruel sliver of hope somewhere that she'll prove me wrong, but the enormous validation the other way has let me step out and actually feel safe enough from her power to laugh. I see these as kind of funny - the nMental Gymnastics are astonishing. 
The Justice comity disagreed and don't believe a case has been made for it to be removed. Kenny MacAskill was pushing for it, but was slapped down and isn't even Justice Minister any more. I have just a little bit of faith.
Came here to say exactly this. Love my zune. Wish I had more. Girlfriends iPod won't update iTunes anymore,iTunes won't fully uninstall, and it drives her nuts. My dunes worked perfectly over 10 years straight now almost.
I have this dream about once a month, but I am in the woods just minding my own business and someone always says that they see a bear.  It's always a different kind of bear but it chases me and I run and run until I wake up panting for air.  I still don't know if I ever get caught or outrun the damn thing.
Off topic: but it seems somewhat naive to think that all copyright cases would involve a contract.  Someone could simply see something, without ever having bought it, in which case no copyright could ever be applied?
This is a great idea! I think I tried it once before with a notebook but it took way too long for me to finish novels. How long does it take for you to finish these books and notes?
So much this!  Evangelicals simply cannot have people enjoying something without a punishment.  As one religious dingbat I encountered put it, "You play, you pay."  
That would be freakin hilarious though. A gun that has .9 meteres dispersion at 100m. Literally can't hit the broad side of a barn at make distance. 
I'm no expert, but consider that you might actually be thirsty instead of hungry (I often misidentify thirst as hunger). If you're humidifier is set low, you could be losing more water through your lungs while sleeping than you're used to. 
I'm in the same situation as you. I'm the one that's mainly to blame though since my grades are pretty poor. Is your lack of job offers also partly because of grades?  (if you don't mind me asking)
Esports and Sports are two seperate things, and I hate sports, and I love Esports, but thats just a fact. If you look up "Sports" in the dictionary it says "an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment."This isnt Esports. That being said, Esports is WAY better imo and will last a long time :D
also, based on my results from extensive testing, retracting landing gear (yes, with your kerbal in EVA) raises your chances of survival greatly. You can survive basically any fall if you land on flat land.
Might be a good thing to add to the sidebar. Just some quick, dirty tips on buying better product. I usually buy cage free, vegetarian fed eggs. They are really not that much more expensive, and I'm not a huge milk/cheese eater, so paying an extra buck doesn't break the bank for me.
Now you're just getting into opinion territory, where I call your view bullshit. You can argue for the meaning of life, and I don't care to think about such things. If the meaning of life is reproduction, that's  a pointless existence. A better way to use our limited existence would be to create pleasure for ourselves and others, while minimising suffering. I'd rather live by this quote than your idea of perpetual reproduction: "An it harm none, do what ye will."
That's an interesting quote and link. Regardless I feel the true sage, Buddha, "philosopher", would view indifferent externals as just that, indifferent. If we don't work towards perfect communion and understanding with nature what are we working towards? More things? Are more things good? What difference do they make? Even the richest among us are unhappy either craving for more or desperately trying to hold onto what they have.Epictetus Discourses I 23"If I cherish my body, I make a slave of myself, if I cherish my property, I make a slave of myself" 
*Jay tumbles over backwards as the momentum of the rolling girl hits him, falling onto his back and having the violette faunus land on top of him. He takes a moment to regain his bearings after his the fall, but soon blinks up at her with curious teal irises.*"Uhh...hey Amethyst..." *The blunette says, quite cheerful for having just fallen over, but blushing as he takes in her position over him.*
women like to feel like a man is in charge. We like that safe, yet attractive security. If a man asks you out first, he's being dominant, which is quite attractive (at least to my standards). Girls are told by society that we need to be the submissive ones. Girls normally don't ask guys out, so we prefer to stay within the social norm. However, to encourage a guy to ask her out, a girl would flirt with him to let him know she's interested.
The Rock's most well known melody is more of an offshoot of the Nation's song, though. This video traces the evolution of the Nation music to the first version of "Do You Smell It" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KavLF-QzAcEDIT: Though now that I play them all again, I can't help but notice that slight melody from "Destiny" starting from Do You Smell It, so yeah that might be the case.
I've brought my own gear as well as bought it here. Have had good luck from some suggested  sellers in Hong Kong as well. They didn't check me at all coming through Hong Kong. I had a bag full of deca winny, var and needles. Still be careful. Peel the labels at least. If you need anything my wechat is :adloman  and I live in Guangzhou.

You can use them to fertilize other plants! The trash plants gives out tons of trash fruit with each harvest, so after a few rounds you can fertilize your whole garden with only trashies, without wasting any of your fruit/vegetables/fish/other plants.
He didn't invent the straight line method. Bottom line is, it works. I wouldn't recommend paying him to learn it, but the guy knows how to sell a product. You can't deny that, and if he can teach it, more power to him.
Some of the teachers at my school were pretty cruel. I remember my music teacher telling  me I wouldn't pass the theory test, so I said fuck her, passed it and quit promptly after. My 4th form science teacher told me and my parents at a teacher-parent interview that I wouldn't pass the course, even if I put more effort in. Like who the fuck says that to a 14 year old. Another moment to say fuck em and prove that you can do it. My 7th form stats teacher told me not to take the course cause I wouldn't pass (I'd admittedly scrapped the barrel in the lower level classes). Fuck that guy, I am now taking a stats based paper at uni and am kicking ass in it. Telling someone not to even try at something cause "they know you'll fail" is the shittest thing you can say to a kid. Fuck that school. 
Typically I wear cropped/waist-length jackets with maxi dresses instead of hip-length coats. You could throw a (blanket) scarf or something on top as well. I find that the extra fabric on maxi dresses tends to keep me pretty warm, though the slit might make it pretty chilly.How cold is it going to be and what is your mode of transportation? If you're driving, you can wear whatever you want or throw a blanket/leggings in the car. If you're taking public transportation/walking, no one is going to judge you for dressing sensibly. IMO there's no need to be the shivering girl for the sake of fashion.
I put in an order with him 2 weeks ago but he didnt respond after like 3 days so i just pulled my coin, but Im sure he would have eventually gotten to my order. Better that than just having him confirm the order then lollygagging holding up your coin.
EXACTLY what I was thinking, combined with what /u/forkoverthegoods said, hes a professional actor getting paid A LOT of money for it. Maybe he would do what this article states for a friend, but he can't expect to work for such little money, doing such grueling work when he has already made it for himself.
Lol just wow. Professor Chaos was easily their key fragger, honestly I hope Chaos and Flowsick get to join another team together, this NA shuffle is turning out to be really stupid from an outsiders perspective.
[This woman also punched a bear to save her dog.](http://juneauempire.com/local/2011-08-30/woman-punches-bear-save-her-dog)  She didn't talk shit, she didn't need to.  She punched a muthafukin bear.
It is the Askmen, what did you expect?A sub that has female mods who abuse their power, mods that shut down almost every thread that is posted, and one in which females are allowed to spew their nonsense while men are pussywhipped. It is one of my biggest fears that a day comes when this sub allows a woman to be a moderator, that is what has happened with Askmen. You cannot let a female be a moderator for a sub that is meant for men spaces, women will run it to the ground. This is a classical example of women abusing their power when they are given power. Women have no right to have any authority in men dominated spaces. I can't really say much nice things about the male mods on that sub either, they delete every thread on there when given the chance. Most of them are just as awful as the female ones, if not worse.The sub is full of some the most crooked power-abusing mods on reddit.

Fair enough. I also consider us apes. Sort of how "world" used to mean everything, and has been used to describe our planet only (or "other world" used to describe others) once we discovered how much more there is, and called it the universe. 
I bought a ps3 for this one, and it's my favorite game. It will be one of my first purchases as soon as I get a ps4. Beautiful and very well written story, great actors and music. Plus the game is gorgeous. Two years later and I'm still playing for hours online, you have to try multiplayer !

If you go to the link it should also show you an example of how to use it. I'll try to do my best without the screenshots. Chrome allows you to search supported sites directly using that site's own search engine right from your address bar. For example, if you type "amazon.com" and then press the tab key in your address bar, you will start searching Amazon's site. What I've made is one that will let you search Kiranico's MH4U section from your address bar. When you go to the page I linked it will ask you for some information in a [dialog like this](http://k.mhquestboard.com/kiranicomh4u/public/chrome-dialog.png). The only thing here you should change is the keyword, to something short and memorable, I use kn. This will let you type kn (tab) and the monster or item you want to see on Kiranico. When you hit enter you'll be brought to the appropriate page on Kiranico.com. [Here's what it looks like](http://k.mhquestboard.com/kiranicomh4u/public/chrome-omnibox.png).

Well, based upon my last relationship, had my ex and I married and later divorced, *she* would've legally owed *me* alimony.So *I'm* pretty okay with alimony, although I can't speak for everyone.
Wow that's very generous of you! I hope I win because Ike is my brother's best character and we failed in obtaining his amiibo when it was available :/
&gt;but by the 5th month i was there I noticed I had seen the sun about 4 times...this got really depressing fast...it would also rain a little bit seemingly every day...I was used to the cold but I wansn't used to the rain/lack of sun...Germany is quite a bit further north than New York though, so naturally there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter. On the bright side (literally) the days are longer in the summertime. 
&gt;I’m not very good at ending these types of posts. So…discuss.End it with something motivational, thus the reader will feel better and think what you said is true.
Dungeon Highway is fun. I'm almost sure that every character can be unlocked without paying a cent. Some just through playing it a bunch, others by just waiting it out (the game gives out gems all the time to try and get you back to playing it, which is nice.)Final Fantasy Record Keepers is interesting, though loading takes a while on older phones, it may or may not need an internet connection, and it technically does have a "stamina system", though it's generous enough that it won't effect you until you are just grinding. Also doable without spending anything.Symphony of Eternity by Kemco is a nice little traditional JRPG. It costs about $15 normally, but I would recommend getting it when it's on sale. Dragon Quest 1-5 and Final Fantasy 1-6 are also available, but from what I've heard, they really aren't designed well for a mobile device.
I mean I don't know about magnets.... I didn't drill a single hole into my box though, I fabricated a bracket out of some steel that I heated and bent to get the pre-drilled holes in the back to line up, and then screwed the bottom of the backer into my fabricated top to hold it steady the length of the box, which was of course screwed into the pre-drilled holes in the top of my box.  So I didn't affect the value of my box one penny as far as drilling into it or scratching it or anything, if anything it's keeping the high wear areas from wearing :)
Love this site and their customer service.  I returned my iStick 50w a week ago and he offered me a full return or exchange.  I offered to get an iStick 30w and a subtank + the difference.  Can't beat their prices, shipping and service.  
All proof and evidence points to the current government being ideological liars with their own agenda.  If Dr Karl didn't take this into account when spruiking a report *he hadn't read* then he deserves all the criticism that comes his way.
That sounds very plausible. I was actually very hyper and in a positive mood this morning, and for about the first half of the day. But then, like a lightswitch, I became an asshole. I sat in my garage (I was firing my car when it flipped) for about an hour just being angry. I even punched my toolbox. I mean, what the fuck? 
I watched an interview this morning with a pizza shop owner who said the rioters tried to set him on fire...um yeah assault rifles are needed i would think.
Go do Bar Smarts Wired.  It's cheap and, when you're done, you'll know more that 80% of "craft"  bartenders out there.   If you can't afford it, message me and I'll send you a code that will pay for it. 
The film guy barged in there with his own agenda.None of his business barging in there with all that self-importance and hijacking the situation for his own purpose. Just so that he has some film.
How would i maintain a cut with that length of hair? It's really inconsistent throughout the day and doesnt usually look the way it does in those first pictures. It's really difficult to style and changes shape alot so should i start using hairspray? Also the back looks pretty bad imo. Just me? Or should i go for a taper the next time i get a cut
ALL OF THESE makes you think the sayer is stupid? Why do you go on reddit? Are you a masochist? I understand that this shit gets redundant, but thinking less of someone because they repeat things they find funny is a little unreasonable. When some funny shit happens to you in your day to day life, you tell the story because you think other people would appreciate it. That's how the human brain works
&gt; Not a feministnot to be *that guy* here, but feminism is actually a legit field of research, it's just completely different from what that whole tumblr crowd makes it out to be.
Imagine if he BD Zach like holy shit. I hope for his game he doesn't as much as I want Zach gone. Surely can't be though right? Damn this kid is hard to read. 
It wasn't *terrible*, but it wasn't nearly as enjoyable. I played it through once. The other two I've played through several times each, and it's my go-to "I'm bored, let's go punch people in arenas" game, which I don't do on *any* other game. Origins is just kind of meh.
I buy things in cheap areas and sell in richer areas. i usually make like 10-20 dollars a transaction.. once again, im no pro. I do this like once a month to fund my fast food outing that i treat myself to once a month
Poverty increases crime.  It's cheaper to pay them then to arrest and incarcerate them.What do I know, though?  I'm just an actual fiscal conservative.
ELI5:The article assumes that the chemical machinery in cells 3 billion years ago was similar to the chemical machinery in cells today. This is not necessarily true, and therefore the conclusions of the article are highly questionable.
As soon as I saw the title, I immediately thought Eric Prydz and was delighted to see you thought so too haha. Absolutely magnificent show at the ASOT at Ultra; the energy, the lights, the LAZERZ, the crowd, all made for a special experience I'll never forget. Hands down best DJ/Performance I've ever seen.
It *is* incorrect, and I am open minded, but not towards backwards ideas. No certified psychologist, therapist, or psychiatrist will tell you that being gay is a mental illness, and it's not defined as one by the APA, ICD-10, or DSM-V.
&gt;I want to have a universal local bitcoin seller rating app with GIS implemented, like Yelp. I have no idea about anything at all beyond that, technically. Do it for me and give me a share of any profits. Thanks. It should also be decentralized with a Blockchain. Can someone draw up the patent?
:) I made the mistake of insinuating this one time. I then got a full on rant from his friend that i was saying mean things to him. All I did was light teasing (really hinting), and i assured her being gay is okay. She politely told me back that no, it isn't. I didn't know she felt that way. Damn.
Dammit Was hoping they'd make a mistake and pick white like so many people thought they would.  I honestly can't believe Leo is still available....
The parallels between Arlen/Jesus and Jardir/Muhammad are not unintentional, but neither should you try to read too much into them. They are their own characters in their own story.
Except they would have had to set that within the last 2 weeks, you are saying they forgot they set that within 2 weeks?Why would they have even set it in the first place?
For how 'Rare' that chance is from a vendor, there sure are a lot of them. Aka, they aren't really that rare from vendors, and if there were otherways to get them they wouldn't be worth that much.
I just joined this group today but this was the first post I read and I'm so motivated by it.  Thanks for taking the time to write it and congratulations on your Masters program!  Very cool and well deserved.  Best to you..
i agree a shotgun should be powerful but does it really need that many shells? these guys can't even aim but all they need to do is hit you once or twice and they don't even have to ever reload. not to mention you can just craft any shells you lost killing fresh spawns so what is the point in conserving ammo.this game has gone from a mediocre survival game to a mediocre sandbox shooter. or at least that is how it feels when you die to the same gun, different people, different spawn locations, an all under 10 minutes. somebody please justify that becuz i certainly can not. if this game is going to base it's gun mechanics on their real life counterparts than the other guns need to be buffed as well. and so does the bow to match the power of the shotgun. becuz currently there is just no better gun in the game. why else is everyone using it solely?
If youre using MO, it comes with a built in BSA unpacker which you can use, just unpack it to the same folder as the mod and then hide the bsa using MOs hide function.If youre using other tools, unpack it to a seperate location and then backup the bsa, delete it from your data folder and then moved the unpacked files into the data folder instead. I use the BSAunpacker from the nexus for this but I know there are other tools around for it too.Because youre not actually deleting or changing any files, just unpacking them, it shouldnt impact your game at all :)
This is the kind of guy who was in my first grade class. When recess came around I would be trying to put together a X-Wing while following the instructions, and hes sitting across from me building a fucking Deathstar from memory.Guys like that always know how to get the girls. 
I hadn't thought about Stubborn Denial and I think people bring up a very strong point with that. Being behind on both mana and board presence, I think it's important to play something, probably Anafenza to use mana efficiently.Opp is down on cards, so we can afford to make trades if offered. I probably wouldn't trade Anafenza for Heir of the Wilds, though. Definitely Boon Saytr. Trying to go for a kill spell and then getting Stubborn Denial-ed is such a huge blowout, leaving us way behind.So I'd play Anafenza, but I could see an argument for Fleecemane

I personally know my entire league in person, but they don't know each other more than opponents. We range from Seattle to OKC so it is hard for everyone to know eachother personally. I personally set up a facebook page for everyone to chat and propose trade ideas, and as a place to post my weekly LM note other than the league home on ESPN.My set up usually goes... quick review on trades, good and bad acquisitions, a little LM banter/humor. Then I review each match up , preview next weeks match ups, and close with more humor.Outside the note, I run an excel spreadsheet to show weekly numbers as a way to do statistical analysis.
All of these for different reasons:    Luca    Millstone     At the Bottom    Good to know if....    Fork and Knife    The No Seatbelt Song    Logan to....    And...Degausser    
Since it's a sphere and rolling perfectly, you can use ω = v/r and I = 2/5MR^2 to turn 1/2iω^2 into 1/5mv^2Makes it easier to solve when you can express rotational energy in terms of linear velocity.

I feel like if they keep similar patterns we will see 1 of each physical toy ( excluding Anakin / Vader) and their older selves will be power disc costume variants.
&gt;This isn't a racial issue. It's a multi-generational poverty issue.Considering that its mainly the black population living in poverty thats pretty much the same thing.
This is playing with my emotions too much. Imagine a front line of Ibe/Marko, Sterling, Depay, Origi with Coutinho feeding them the ball. If Depay comes, he gets the 7 shirt without a doubt. 
Many women do split, especially here in Europe. I myself always split. There are so many good reasons to. Besides the whole equality thing, I just want to order whatever the fuck I want and however much I want without having to worry, "Oh shit, what should I order? I don't want to leech off his money, but it's not like I can have just a glass of water while he's having a full dinner... and how much should I order? No, this is definitely too much, ok fuck it I'll just eat at home afterwards..."

Not to alarm you, but I wish I had been more prepared for the loss in order to mourn properly...my belly button has not yet (8 months pp) returned to it's former state. It's just kinda...baggy. And sad. The rest of me is back to normal though so it's a small (but unexpected) price to pay. RIP belly button.
Kids are like clay. They can and will grow up to be amazing if they are molded by the right hands, and not squashed to bits by those who don't believe in them.Your son is an amazing person who will grow up to do good things, and I'm happy that you believe in him.
My grandfather was a great guy, who was also kind of crotchety.He died on December 30th. For as long as I knew him, his birthday was December 31st. We all wished he lived one day longer to see his next birthday, or at least die on his birthday like Shakespeare (because that's poetic).When we were cleaning out his stuff we found his birth certificate. Low and behold he was born on December 30th. He hated parties so much that he always lied about when his birthday was, so that he only had to celebrate one. My mom even thought his birthday was December 31st. He lied to his own children. But at least he died on his birthday like Shakespeare.edit: fixed a word.. because December 30th doesn't kill
I hate the way Melee plays. All the characters feel way too heavy and fast for my taste. I grew up playing it and I love it, but I'd rather play PM or Sm4sh.

I felt like all of BRM was kind of underwhelming compared to Nax, the theme, the emotes (humour) and many (not all) cards...I also wish they would have just skipped the hidden laboratory all together as that was a shit dungeon in general, especally lore-wise.  (from WoW)
I took a class where we focus strictly on these power struggles.  You have a class of avatar students that are voiced by actors.  Their goal is to break you down until you get in a verbal argument with a student.  I've seen fellow classmates leave those sessions in tears. Its awesome.
here's the most important thing to ask yourself, "Do I care whether my beliefs are true"? If the answer is no then believe what you want, you've already given up reality for a fantasy, but if you DO care then you're going to have to take steps to confirm or discredit the claims of the belief you're investigating. Theists will claim that you just need faith to believe. There's just one little problem, faith can justify anything. Muslims use it to confirm their god just like the Jews, Hindu's and all the rest. So how do you find out which is the truth? you investigate the evidence and if you're convinced then so be it. But like most of us here that have already gone through this process, you'll probably be an atheist by the end of it. 
This will sound horrible. But try doing one without HQM. I love HQM, but not every pack needs it, not even skyblock. Try something different. If you have any interest in 1.8 http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/63384-mobtalker2  looks interesting.
I'm sure there is, but they might need to use different materials. I'd have to ask them.Edit: I think the point though is to have it repeat. They're called "Pocket Universes."
Dirty Heads, Jon Bellion, and Logic.I've wanted to see all these guys since the first song I heard by them. I just got into Jon Bellion about a month ago and know most of his songs by heart.
"Nothing right now little boy, you two can head out if you'd like." *Her eyes glance over the two inspectors.* *'Interesting duo...I wonder how those will work together.'* "Don't cause Ms. Ito any trouble now!" *She gives another scolding to the new Inspector regarding his manners.*               [/u/RoseRealse] 
I often use SIL's rapid words questionnaire. There is also a fairly good vocabulary questionnaire in "Describing Unwritten Languages" that focuses on basic words with example sentences.When I'm just starting, though, I like to translate words that are often parts of semantic "systems", for lack of a better word: kinship terms; motion verbs; spatial reference; pronouns and demonstratives, etc. 
You could always fake a cough&amp;sore throat &amp; hit up the doctor.When I was still in high school I did that once or twice a year, usually in the winter and spring when people are sick often. One time they gave me a damn big bottle of codeine/promethazine, &amp; I was a very happy kid, but they pretty much always gave me codeine when I went. 
Was actually just looking at that! It's 4.5 LBS though... Also only 1 HDMI out.  You have any experience with the USB to HDMI?Definitely an option though.
i agree totally,especially with older machines that are not protected as well ..and then theres the guy behind me that has to blow off his entire table after every tool change-i swear he moves more air than metal
I think I have the race bug then, because that grand señora desert race where you win the redwood gauntlet and stuff isn't going away. Other than that everything is completed. I wish I had Internet to check my social club.

For your first question, as far as I know He will be an amazing compassionate and charismatic leader that will lead the Jews to rebuild the Temple and come back to Jerusalem. As for the second, I have no clue. I was agnostic/atheist for a few months prior to finding my spark in Judaism.

It just seems so far stretched, I have school so i cant spend that much time in just playing pugs. If im gonna quit school i want to be sure its the right thing to do.
you seem to have some sciency numbers there. I have seen the weather and the humidity index. check southern states around late July. you are clearly not a weather person and are going on theory... and your own understanding. 
Please read the prompt and my response. I in no way said anything about being poor or not having enough money. I said having copious amount of cash money does not necessarily make you happy. That is it.
Well in BL there are corps right, these corps for the most part can act independently and when Elo isn't around they all form little cliques.Anyways, in BL there is a squad of people called "Drop Squad" and the "leader" is a person who would be banned really quickly from Brave Comms. So this dude who leads drop squad says stupid shit from time to time and people get their feathers ruffled, in this case he actually pissed off an entire corporation. The people in this corp generally refuse to associate with the leader of drop squad and it's difficult to get them to cooperate as a result. That's the gist of it basically, run of the mill stuff so far as BRAVE is concerned.
Both are great laptops that are quite durable and well built and will last you a long time.What are you using the machines for? What is the most you are willing to spend? Do you prefer something lightweight?
Que poco nos conocen, cuanta mas presión mas unión y mas fuerza. Se creen que en los pueblos y en las autonomías con todo el trabajo de miles de personas y con la ilusión puesta en el 24M nos van a vender lo que no existe y oye si alguien se lo cree que sepan que no son de Podemos, no tienen nuestro ADN, no lo tendrán y ni falta que hace.
"We work hard at keeping costs down," says the dude whose bank is very obviously more interested in keeping profits up... Weren't they the ones who also fired a bunch of Canadians so they could get cheaper foreign workers in? Fuck them.

While I've seen it written before, I'd have to say that it is my experience if one considers desires that exist beyond parochial, daily desires.   Not sure if that makes sense.   Not sure if this is a common experience.  
I constantly have nightmares about animal agriculture. I see thousands of chicks passing through a machine to be slaughtered and I see lines of hanging decapitated cows' heads with their mouths still moving. The scary part is it isn't even made up, it's real. It's hell on Earth and happening right under our noses. I am vegan and trying to do what I can to stop it.
The insectoid is a [Vratix](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Vratix). The other is a [Gotal](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Gotal/Canon).(non canon) - The Vratix are the species who invented [bacta](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bacta/Canon).The image is captioned on a [Tumblr archive](http://zenothian-archives.tumblr.com/tagged/gotal) as "A Gotal surveys the Bacta inventory of a Vratix." 
yeah I wish it was as simple as that :( but it's the best way to get better imp since you're playing against people who know what they're doing and you aren't restricted to final destination stages
I wanted to ask real quick, how many of you guys skip OPs and EDs of episodes? And why? I never do. Even if I'm watching the show all at once. For me it's part of the experience, it'd be crazy for me to skip any of it, so that's why I'm baffled that people have to make comments to stick after the ED for after credit scenes. Just watch the whole thing, IMO. Especially if it's a show I like (like Eva) hearing the OP and ED every time increases my hype and excitement to watch the next episode. That's just me though.
I grew up in a white neighborhood. Not one single white person there got murdered. Sure that's an anecdotal account but the leading cause of death for white males is NOT murder.
One argument is that all the machinery for two-person marriage is already in place. There are laws to handle marriage, divorce, probate, child custody, taxes, etc. These laws have become more or less neutral w/r/t sex, so extending to same-sex marriage is relatively easy. Extending to three or more spouses would require extensive revision of the laws. I'm not sure you consider that a *legal* argument, but it's the first one that comes to mind.
I love their Frat Boy blush and the Nude Dude palette is a pretty decent everyday neutral palette! I also really love their highlighters. The Cindy-Loumanizer is probably one of the more unique highlighters that I have (I have a fairly extensive selection of highlighters.......). 
You're right. I don't know you. And you don't know me either, but I'll tell you what, I once kept up a web of lies for three months just cause i was getting pussy. There is no easy way to go through with the process, but at some point, a liar should learn to feel remorseful for an opportunity he passed up. The only thing one can do is give opportunity.
You wrote---&gt; "They found chemical weapons. But we (The US), sold them to him..."Which is false. The U.S. sells computers and steel tubes to countries all the time and if those countries use them to make weapons it doesn't mean the U.S. sold them Weapons of Mass Destruction. 
And if by pretty great you mean pretty shitty...then yes. Source: I'm sitting on the toilet wearing a Bubba Gump shrimp tshirt regretting my life decisions that lead me to eat there.

Agree with /u/dropbear8mybaby It's so frustrating after using the systems Hong Kong, Tokyo and New York have and then seeing the pile of crap we have.  And their ones are decades old.
I considered going to Comicon last summer to meet Ian Somerhalder. Then I realized that if I ever actually met him, I'd likely start crying and either pee on him like an excited puppy, or hump his leg like...an excited puppy. I did not go to Comicon. 
I love this. I love TG. But why couldn't Steven also have a koukaku for his shield, like on his arm like Pearl/Tsukiyama?*Garnet as a rinkaku is the most badass thing ever and Lion Cub is the cutest alias ever.*
Agreed with Uptown. Luckily Dallas is starting the trolleys again in May and it runs right by my building, so I can go to Uptown for free. I'm not opposed to driving. Thank you for the info!
My grandfather passed a few years back after which we discovered he'd had a son with another woman (not my grandmother). My grandma knew before they even got married, but they never told any of the kids that they had a half-brother the whole time.
I'm just utterly confused by all of this.  I was prepared to grieve, I came here to grieve... I can't even laugh at the things I'm supposed to laugh at because I feel like I should be grieving right now!
I love Charlotte nn Charlie! One of my favorite boy names on girls is actually Teddy (the name Charlie reminded me of Teddy because of characters on a disney show - sigh), which I didn't mention in my original post. It could be a nickname for Thea, Thora, Dorothy, Theresa, Theda, Edith, or pretty much most names with a "th" or "ed".
A few years ago my ex and I were moving and couldn't take our cat where we were going. None of our friends were able to take him in. I tried taking him to a shelter o said I had him about a week and they said technically it was considered mine and couldn't take it. I ended up dropping him off at an abandoned house. This morning on my way to work I saw a cat running across the street and reminded me of what I did. It gives me that sinking feeling in my chest that I did that to a cat that was mine. I remember crying right after I dropped him off. I will never forgive myself for that. Somehow admitting it doesn't lift any weight of my shoulders.

Yeah it's a relatively new rule, and it's a pretty shitty solution to the runaway rookie contracts.  I actually didn't know about it until I heard somebody talking about it on the radio today, to dispel the rumor that a trade might happen after Mariota was drafted.  
Every great team has a small rough patch. Especially considering our injuries and defense, things like this are bound to happen. No need to worry though, if we finish May with an above .500 record which is very likely to happen then this team is going places.
Can't wait for the left to understand the process is a lie, primaries are manipulated from the start, and nothing they do matters if the people on TV don't want it to.
Check out YouTube channels like cgr and avgn. They have a lot of retro gaming videos based on oldschool machines. There is also an excellent series called history of videogames that go year by year
I wouldn't say invested, that's far too dedicated off a word, and in terms of skill I'm in no way incompetent, I'm just not competent per se in the orthodox meaning of guitar competency. I'm a 6 years, 22, but it's a 22 where I also went to school so that takes up a lot of time as well. 
Thank you for the advice.   His birthday is Saturday and we have been planning a party, but I'm like 85% sure he's going to skip out on it.  Maybe Sunday I'll stop over and chat with him.  He needs to get on medication because this is just destroying his life.  
If you have a level 50 character (because silver doublons and linens) and if you also don't want to invest time into chest farm then bags. You can make gold on somewhere else and actually have fun. If you like shiny golds and have enough time to spend on them, then keys/chests. Some people actually like to chest farm though, because it's relaxing and feels like semi afk while watching something else, I personally don't like it.
Offer to pay, that is polite. If she declines strongly, split the bill or go "but the next one is on me, okay?" and smile your best smile. The fact that she's a "feminist" shouldn't change anything. Being a feminist doesn't mean you wanna pay for everything? I think there's bigger things to worry about lol.

Naturally Auto Rifles need a push. Hand Cannons aren't really the problem - its just that the Exotic ones are all too good, even compared to the power spike from Legendary to Exotic for the other weapon types. Hard to say what can be done to fix that without causing the pitchforks to come out.
Bernie Sanders is a conspiratard. The idea that a few wealthy oligarchs control the government is just bunk nonsense. Everyone lobbies for their interest on both sides and then the decisions are made via the democratic process. We elect our leaders because we trust them to act on our behalf. Bernie Sanders just wants to stir drama over nonissues to get attention for his campaign. Bernie is an old kook who wants to punish America's large corporations for no crime other than being successful. If large corporations are not successful what does Sanders think will happen to the economy? He needs to retire and make way for Hillary, she's obviously the better choice to grow America's economy and spread our influence abroad by allowing easier access to foreign markets.  The TPP is the best way of achieving that and Hillary knows it. Bernie needs to stop with these crackpot arguments. 
You're saying people shouldn't be held responsible for their actions because they're black.  You're either dehumanizing or infantilizing them based on their race.  That's racist.
I apologize, I'd read several articles on the topic and just assumed the one I sent you covered it.

scripthooks basically hook into the memory of the game to alter them, it usually has to be updated every new patch anyway. It's probably something that R* is not intentionally trying to do.
I understand your reasoning, but honestly I'll be happy having whoever is republican to win the presidency *precisely because* they will make things substantially worse.Why would i want a party to win who will make things worse? Because it's clearly obvious that things are not bad enough for people to get it through their heads that they need to change. The worse things get the more pressure there is to fix things, and if Bernie and people like him are not voted in and actually fix things, clearly things need to get worse before people will finally get off their fucking asses and act.Bernie for prez.

The biggest one I can think of is identity theft. They need to make it a Capital fucking offense with no chance of anything less than life with no possibility of parole, if not the death penalty. It massively fucks up peoples lives, costs billions every year, and makes the cost of doing business with credit higher. Fuck these lazy, opportunistic bastards: stick a needle in their arm.
If the market crashes tomorrow, it may not sufficiently recover in 5 years. 10 years is a bit more comfortable.How much would you want to invest in an index (44k?), and how much other assets do they have in total?

Apparently Mettenberger wants out. How about trading them Schaub and a 3rd/4th or something for him? Get Joe to tutor him, have a big QB 7 years younger to smooth the transition between Flacco and whoever our next long-term QB is?
Hey! I tried using a different mouse, and these were the results: http://i.imgur.com/BxQA8MT.pngObviously much better, so it does seem to be a mouse problem. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the mouse... and it didn't fix anything. I have no clue what the issue is at this point, I had ideas, but now I'm at a complete loss.
In Italy people avoid combining striped clothing. Only one piece can be striped. Generally speaking, coordinating the colors is of crucial importance in Italy; people are almost obsessed by it and spend a lot of time getting dressed for work. It can get really crazy, but fun!
Are you gonna watch AoU? I'm so excited that it'll finally be out in the US so I won't have to worry about spoiling my friends when I talk about it. Here, it's been out for about a week or so.
a thing i always do is go on lfg and look for gorgon chest cp like 5-10 minuits before weekly reset because heaps of people are looking for someone they can share chest with because they need 2 people so one can leave and visa versa, works everytime
We'll find out later I'm sure. I'll be shocked if two firsts and a third weren't offered at least, and that should've been enough for your front office.

Never on the ringroad itself.Never near a blind crest. Preferably always at a designated parking place. On pretty much every road there will be some place where you can park a car for some time without interrupting traffic. On gravel roads they are often around bridges. On bigger tarmac roads there will be signs for available stopping, like [this](http://www.vegagerdin.is/sthbthjon.nsf/2d1e761d5db9cd840025702a00731850/dc1833dfa9aa1b6700257243002f6dca/Body/0.28B8?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif) or [this](http://www.vegagerdin.is/photosrv/photosrv.nsf/vgPage/B9937F87E6E5B7400025724B00371BD4/$FILE/thumb_E02.63_Aningarstadur.gif) or similar.

We Have so many needs....Mett is still a question mark, but ...fuck. I am in no way shitting on MM. He seems like a stand up guy, so was Locker. I hope i am so wrong. I hope I am wrong.. But this just seems like a gamble when we could have made our team better with more picks. I do not want a question mark at QB when our team is this bad.
Exactly, but what is enterntaining to us within the community isn't what's entertaining to most casual viewers. And in the GDQ they outnumber us and their pockets far outnumber ours. GDQs are taylored to them without being horrible for the fans, but it's not FOR the fans.
1. Bill [is not "all-seeing"](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/cpynrre) he has--to quote that link--"blind spots". The first place Bill looks is the kitchen, another room that lacks the EoP/Bill image.2. I did not say Bill was evil or the villain, for all we know he wants to stop the author from doing something he specifically doesn't want to happen that will interfere with his plans. He could even be like a character from the book Good Omens named Crawley, who despite being a demon doesn't want the world to end because he enjoys it and humanity's existence (because humans are entertaining or something).
As a special ed sub, that's infuriating. In my district they're hand picked so we don't end up with any people over their heads or rude assholes like that. 
That would be amazing if they hinted at Azazel being a demonized angel. Would explain the fact that he's the only yellow eyed demon ever and can apparently possess angels (tess).
I used to not get athiesm at all. All the athiests I knew were total nihilists and just thought everything was pointless, and I was so confused by it. I asked people what it was all for, if there was no purpose or destiny to anything. I straight up didn't know. *shrug*I love my family, but sometimes I shake my head at the things I was raised not to question.
I think PTR left. Watching his stream today he said they tried to replace him with Skadoodle once they returned from lan, and he no longer had the desire to move forward with the team emotionally after knowing they nearly cut him.
I mainly play as knife stalker and id recommend adrenalin pump over the emp bandolier outside of squad-play. It helps when trying to get the jump on people, it helps running in enemy crowds getting kill-streaks while outrunning people that noticed you and try to follow you in the crowd and it also helps when you need to loose someone whos chasing you. If you are running around with the EMP bandolier you better use the xbow and normal knife for EMP+xbow combos
There's definitely a chance! Your mindset can change drastically once you're in the heat of the moment. But not having an erection is fine. Just do other stuff until you do. Good luck! 
I quite like Anor Londo since the Silver Knights are worth about 1k each and they aren't too hard to take down once you learn how to parry or backstab them.The painted world is also pretty good with the phalanx, especially if you have AOE (easily available thanks to pyromancy). There are other places as well. http://darksouls.wikidot.com/soul-farming Here is a helpful guide if you don't mind some minor spoilers.
I doubt there's very many people who EDC a GR2.  If you don't get much of a response here, you'll probably have better luck in r/goruck (also, I'd help by only have a GR0).  Edit...DEERRRRPPPPP just checked out r/goruck.  My bad! 
You cant use Lebron, or KG's skill set as an example for what a superstar is. Carmelo took the nuggets to the playoffs every year he was there and the knicks the first 3 years he was here. Obviously he can't do it alone and needs a pretty specific supporting cast. But the fact that he lifts a team so much with just himself is pretty damn good.
Each rider has a bit of a specialty or preference in how they attack but their power levels should be generally the same. There are more than I'm going to list, but they are usually one-ofs or small time, anyways I would rank the main ones like this:    1. Alejandra  2. Johnny  3. Danny  4. Robbie    [Alejandra is the one that tore out Mephisto's heart](http://i.imgur.com/smrQT4A.jpg) and she has tapped into the most diverse abilities of the different riders (at least when she was a ghost rider)  Johnny prefers the hellfire attacks a lot. He especially is gifted at the hellfire nova blasts that most others don't do.  Danny prefers the penance stare, he's the first to use it actually, and using his chains a lot.  Robbie so far hasn't displayed any penance stare, and although he has a diverse skillset it's all pretty low level.
I used to see something similar to this when I was a kid, I would see...like dots all over my vision. I could change it too, I could think about a different shape or color and sometimes it would change. It doesn't happen anymore, I wonder why.
All I'm saying is Chip better win now. He made all these moves, I EXPECT nothing less then a deep playoff trip. Not saying he was wrong in anything he did, but I don't agree with it. HE. BETTER. FUCKING. WIN.
&gt; Who are you and why are you such a know it all asshole?(I'm gathering this from other comments on this thread, not this one alone)....you do realize my argument is based upon the fact we "can't" know...correct?That's literally my whole point. We can't know because of our limited experience in space. We have only explored planets within our solar system. You honestly want to sit there and tell me you have the knowledge and experience to determine how life has evolved on planets which we can only see as points of light in the night sky?If being an asshole is calling out people who make false predictions then so be it. Call me goatsee, there are no shits for me to give.
Get something online. People won't book you if they can't hear you first. Or at least rarely. If you're touring solo, do a mix of music venues and 3 set pub nights. You may not get people paying that much attention but pub's have a guaranteed wage, which helps put gas in your ride. Also start booking as soon as possible places fill up months in advance.
I just learned the term for people like you is "sea lion."  Regardless, because this shit is so mindblowingly easy to find, here's [the lawyer who blamed an 11 year old for her rape](http://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Lawyer-likens-gang-rape-victim-to-a-spider-luring-4071735.php).  Here's the [police department that told a victim her rape was probably just a drunken mistake](http://m.missoulian.com/news/local/missoula-agrees-to-reform-police-response-to-sexual-assaults/article_b27157ea-bd6b-11e2-a337-0019bb2963f4.html?mobile_touch=true).  There's the [PA woman who was accused of contributing to her own rape](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/24/justice/woman-blamed-for-her-rape/) even though she was unconscious.  It's really not hard: Google it. 
How so? (unless that requires spoilers, then don't tell me) Right now I think Edea is my strongest and the only move I really use is Judgement. Since Tiz has Performer, I can give her BP so she can attack more often. I get a lot of 9999 hits with her.
Then maybe she is the one in the right and the people who would treat you like a nerd because of it are the ones who are wrong? Think about it. More people need to act like it is 2015.
Hmm...I don't do this stuff often enough to know the right way but if I put it on my Google Drive and give you a link to the file, that would work right? (Mac guy)
You can't afaik. Every time I've gotten a firearm at  Wal-Mart I was background checked. Also do remember that those evil semi-automatics are used in a tiny percentage of gun crimes. 
I know many people who got their citizenship in boot camp. Unfortunately I myself did not. But it is definitely doable, they got snatched up now and then for citizenship classes and swore the citizenship oath prior to graduation. Ignore gunny, he's old.
Juatduck, take it easy bud, you're gotta use your head now, think about the law.Allright? What happens if you accidently hit a child with an umbrella? In the eyes of the law that is child abuse.What happens then? In the eyes of the law, you have to give your properties to the parents of that child.I'm sorry, little kid, he doesn't know the law that well.
I definitely understand where you are coming from and I'm not being critical of a selfless attitude. I'm merely recognizing reality and the fact that those who are ambitious and capable will tower over those who are not.
Shield is probably my absolute favorite active that's come out since well ever.  I hate Adc's and assassins with a burning passion, life steal and crits suck.  But I find that Shield is a great equalizer, as someone who likes Guan and Ares, it does wonders.
Maybe I wasn't very clear, but vending machines for cigarettes used to be the money maker, and most tobacco shops (no real cigars) could just have some vending machines in front of their shops and let the business roll. NOT ANY MORE.When the rule was changed and they implemented "[taspo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taspo)" system, all smokers who wanted to buy cigarettes from vending machines had to register and obtain an IC tipped card. This discouraged most smokers to use vending machines and most started using convenience stores to buy cigarettes, and many individual tobacco shops got hit.If your future shop is one with special cigars and pipes, then, the situation must be very different. Either way, I'm not really sure if it can be easy enough for non-Japanese to get a permission of tobacco/cigar selling in Japan.  http://www.mof.go.jp/tab_salt/tobacco/  (in Japanese, I can't find English pages for these explanations.)  
Have  you talked to your doctor about all of this?  Have you been tested to see if you are fertile?  Many CF men are sterile.  Also, if your wife is a carrier for CF, your chances of having a child with CF are higher.  I myself adopted.  I haven't heard of being off Kalydeco before trying to get pregnant.  I would think it would be more of an issue if your wife was taking it.  Maybe contact the company that manufactures Kalydeco and see what info they have regarding it.  All the best!

Apart from the first sentence (which goes into no detail) this does not address any of what I am asking.  The rest is simply a comment on the subject of churches and charity.
This happened to me on a cruise to the Bahamas that ended at Disney World and it was unbearable. I even put on sunscreen and waited 30 min before going into the sun. I could barely walk because the pain was all encompassing and my dad kept calling me a crybaby because I was a grown ass adult crying at Disney World. My skin was blistering, peeling, and raw. Despite painkillers and aloe, I also couldn't sleep for days. Ruined the entire trip. 
not through this give away.  I am however doing another give away on /r/pcmasterrace in 5 minutes.  There will be requirements, but they will be free requirements.
&gt;As of Wednesday, the store has posted a sign in the window that reads: "To ensure that your child has a safe and enjoyable experience in our store, please do not leave them unattended."[Here's a picture of the front of the store I took a few minutes ago.](http://imgur.com/9h1XiKX) Can you spot the sign?

That's not the apps fault. Those phones are terrible for everything. Even Swagbucks will barely run on them. That's why I traded mine off with the Verizon deal.

Yeah it seems Sanders is picking up momentum, and quickly. And running democrat is a pretty bold strategy which is sure to make him known among far more people. It would be amazing if Stein becomes his running mate though.
Wow... just... wow.He let's you borrow his nice Ukulele, you break up with **him** (which is totally fine), but then you dare say that you get to keep *his* property as his **PAYMENT TO YOU** for hooking up with your friend... *when he was single*?I'm fucking beside myself in disbelief. I don't even know if I can be nice while saying this.Give him his god damn property back! It's not yours. What's the matter with you? How the fuck do you have any right to be mad at him for sleeping with somebody after YOU broke up with HIM. Not only that, but you feel he owes you in the form of PAYMENT for doing something he was *clearly* in the right to do.Grow the fuck up and give him his god damn property back. He is better off without you.
The emails from the new site all came within ~5 minutes. It does seem like they 'mass dump' the emails all at once.From the old site, in my experience, they send out emails at midnight CST telling you they got them, and then at 4am they send out the gift cards.
Yes, I clicked the link dude. I'm not trying to cause a problem I was not even remotely justifying what this guy did, you're looking for shit if thats what you thought. This is literally identical to something I've seen on the news very recently, probably not a week, I'm bad at keeping track of my days. No I didn't look at the date this was stated to happen, I more or less skimmed over the article. And yea, there was body cam footage of the case I saw, it was played about 5 times when it was highlighted on the news. *edit: you're right there is no body camera footage of this particular case, the case I confused it with did happen a week ago though. I was confused because they were extremely similar at a glance. I didn't pick up that the last one happened in Florida though, could've helped a lot had I remembered that.
I find that you can flesh out those details before you even eat a full meal with a person. If they suggest going to Olive Garden or like...Applebee's on a date, I'm gonna stop taking them seriously for a hot sec at the least, if not the rest of lifetime. That might make me sound pompous, but I don't care. No compromise for this guy.

I'm in a public place. There is, unfortunately, no porn. As a matter of fact, I don't think there's any T &amp; A at all. what the hell is wrong with me?
I did the exact same thing on PS3. Played it once for about an hour, never picked it up again on PS4 on a whim and tried it again, so glad I did. Fantastic game, play it!
Ooohh yes. When I was seven I got a cut on my eye with a folder. It was just the white part of my eye (I apologise for my shitty terminology), and it got better within a few days, but I can still remember that pain. Awful. 
With the 400 pt stat advantage Nico has over Kotori, it will be extremely difficult for Kotori to outscore Nico in any song... If the stat difference was closer to 250 than go with the scorer, the potential of getting the higher score than is in the scorers favorEdit: this is also under the assumption that the majority of the time you don't need PLs to FC a song

OP should not do this if they value their life. I know some crazy "feminists" with this viewpoint. They're why you can't post anything on Tumblr without getting hatemail anymore. I know someone who posted something innocent about their boyfriend and got a series of hatemail going "how do you know they're male YOU'RE ERASING TRANS PEOPLE" and various similar things.
Except for the part where I never once heard the term "black riots" while watching CNN or any other news network. Shit, I never even heard "black protestor". All they said was protestor or rioter and they all mad a very clear distinction between the two.
The man who designed the software to do it leaked it in the early 2000s because he was pissed about its proposed domestic use. It blew over. He didn't release any classified documents to prove his claims though. 
New laws need to be put into place to make Police "friendly" again and PEACE OFFICERS instead of statute/commerical law enforcers.  First step is to have cameras on every cop. Any time the cop's camera malfunctions during a questionable offense the court case against the defendant needs to be thrown out.  Hawthorn effect needs to be turned right back onto them.  I think everyone will play nicely then.  
I was just roommates with a girl who was a ranger in Torres del Paine. She said winter was the best time to go, it's cold but the weather is actually more stable (less wind). Though you might find it difficult to get up to the French valley. Also she said to watch out for pumas, she said they're a much bigger problem then the park lets on. 
No specific area in mind, although I'm shipping from Canada so you'll have to take that into account. I'd be charging you something like $8/case plus shipping, and you'd sell them at whatever price you want.What exactly do you need a picture of? An example case?

&gt;The existing 5by5 server will continue to host the existing minesmash world, but it will be part of a mult-world server Why a multiworld server? Activity on Minesmash has already been relatively low-ish for the past month or two. This move is likely to further divide the community in half, as various people choose which of the two versions of the current world they want to play on. Checking /r/5by5craft, it looks like that group has been inactive for a year. Seems unlikely that it's going to be bringing in many new peopleto fill in the gap.So if either way it's going to probably mean a drop in population...what's the benefit of making it a multi-world server, other than to even further dilute the available players over a larger area?If you're going to do this, wouldn't it make more sense to simply revive 5by5 with a single new fresh world? 
A few thoughts off the top of my head:- The left side of your heart, which is much more muscular, pumps blood to the body. The comparatively weak right side of the heart only has to push blood to the lungs to be re-oxygenated. If you reversed flow, the right side wouldn't be strong enough to move all of the blood around the body.- There are lots of valves in the circulatory system that prevent back-flow of blood (this is necessary for heart contractions to direct blood the right way and to allow blood to be pumped up-hill), so it might not flow at all even if your heart muscles were up to the job. 
RepulsiveFTFY If I were in your class my response would of gotten me suspended, I was the type of high school student who voiced their opinions often and without permission.
and they drive a Cayenne? /u/pato1908 explain yourself! You can obviously afford something nice since its a 2015... I'd suggest a 4C, but I know the interior quality can throw a lot of people off.
Context is I installed zsh and wanted it as default shell. Ultra noob as I was, I started it and uninstalled bash from within. It started to behave strangely (no shit) so I rebooted... Into a blank promptless screen. It was just a virtual machine so I installed a new distro (didn't know about snapshots). I'm sure I could have salvaged it but that was way over my skill and I itched to test a new distro.Did I learn something? Always look things up before doing them. When in doubt, hands off! It's like with mushroom hunting really. You take a risk, you potentially lose function in your kidneys for life. And no snapshots!
There is a portal to stormshield in stormwind. Its in stormwind keep in a room to the right of the king, where the old battlemasters used to be. Walking through the dark portal also gets you to draenor, and there are portals to the blasted lands all over.
Have a mechanic check it out, that will be your your best indication to the quality of the car. Only thing I'd worry about with used wrx's is that some people buy them new and drive the hell out of them, then sell them for near purchasing price  when they get around 50-70k.

Yeah ahaha, I do think Dave is gay but I'm wondering about Davekat too by Karkat's reaction. It seems like they aren't together, huh? Also Dave kept calling Karkat bro. That doesn't sound very boyfriend-y to me. Sad day, I liked that ship, but oh well they can be good friends to each other. They seem to balance each other out. Dave was way too unemotional and Karkat was just the opposite.
You're comparing a 5'x8' bathroom (that I assume you regularly shower in) to a gun safe though. I'm not familiar with that product myself, but I wouldn't completely write it off given the particular experience you had...
It's stupid that he said women shouldn't...I'm a guy and won't walk alone to my car after work (I'm a server).I already know one dude who got jumped in the six months my restaurant has been open (not a bad area, just inside the city).It's more of a general statement of diminishing your chances of something like that from happening.
I'm straight and have a gf but I had a dream once where I was about to have sex with a man, literally an inch away from pounding his tight bunghole, but I hesitated because I  knew if I didn't use a condom I could catch something and give it to my girlfriend. I woke up before I could do anything.I've had this same dream before with women, but a few of those times I go along with it and in some cases the woman transforms into another woman during the sex. Pretty weird!Edit: was my comment even relevant to yours? Lol
Flameblast is the gg race build right now. Flameblast, flame trap, and then arc, from what I've been able to gather. It's easy to gear for spells because of the ability to get '+1 to X gems' wands with an easy vendor recipe. That alone will carry you for a long time.
I just yelled in excitement super loud. I know Raiders were excited about Leo, but Cooper makes a fuck lot of more sense. The defense is fine, the O-line is fine, you guys needed playmakers, and Cooper was the biggest one in this draft.I fucking love this pick for the Raiders.
Uh...how are you comparing unlimited talk &amp; text to 100 minutes talk? 100 minutes is used fairly quickly if you make calls frequently. Also T-Mobile post-paid plans are contract free so that would be what most people would compare to Fi. You have to compare plans with similar features for the comparison to make sense in the scope of the general population. Pre-paid plans typically target a specific audience. I guess you don't understand subsidies then. You pay a lower price initially, but the rest of the cost is built into the plan cost so you're still paying for it, just over time. Difference is you continue paying that built-in cost every month well after the device would have been paid off if you don't upgrade at your scheduled upgrade date. Fi offers for you to pay off the device over 24 months interest free. So in reality Fi's plan is advantageous.
It is mostly related to Heathenry, but I've known Druiths (the term I use for people mixing Druidry and Heathenry together) to have read the book and liked it.
South Howard, man.Althought, to be fair, I used to go to The Lodge and see Josh Freeman there all the time.  So maybe it's not a good idea for Jameis.
"I'm pretty sure I don't exist"This is one of the recurring ones for me. It's not really unsettling or nerving, but I catch myself saying this both out loud and in my head when tripping from time to time.
This is the problem with criminals.If they can see the obvious damage they do they won't do it - it's just that they have trouble seeing the damage, say, stealing motorcycle from a 37 year old man does. The loss, the inconvenience, the time wasted, the money lost etc. It's harder to for them to see.

If you are good enough for people to hire you, I would consider advertising yourself as a personal chef. That might lower start-up costs as you would use a client's kitchen and equipment. Plus, initial costs of groceries would be paid back by the client as well.
Damn, that sucks. It's an amazing video. I share the link to it as often as I can find a halfway decent reason to do so. Looks like I'll need to scout around for a few more halfway decent reasons...
I'm not op, but I used to work as a projectionist at a theater that had one house with a film projector.  We didn't use it very often, it was really only for when a movie came out early on film.  I imagine there are a decent amount of theaters that still do that on occasion.
If your argument is contingent on intangible and immeasurable concepts, then we are just arguing "well, I think....." I'm not doing that. I'm not wasting my time with everyone that wants to discuss morality. How moral is it to stunt the contributions people are willing to make to society because you disincentivize them with fees/taxes. How moral is it to prevent mutually consenting people from interacting simply because they agree to lower amounts than the government thinks they should? How moral is it reward slackers and otherwise untalented people at the expense of more talented/motivated people simply because they earn more? How moral is it to..... Its not worth my time because you can't give me an objective answer

&gt; I just would like to point out that you can use lethal force only when you're in danger of death or severe bodily harm. It's not a simple "Guy was doing this so I can shoot him."Actually, you're allowed to use deadly force to defend against robbery.&gt;He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery; - See more at: http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/ONE/C/35/35.15#sthash.GxpCv3LE.dpufN.Y. PEN. LAW § 35.15Also, I will reiterate - do not draw on cops, no matter how wrong they may be. At best, you just shot a cop and now you have to defend yourself in court. At worst, you got yourself shot and the cop is a hero.
Last week, someone said to me, "Fish are not animals."I told a different person about this idiotic comment, and that person said, "But fish aren't animals."Facepalm.
And to think, just four short hours ago you said: "an open source project requiring open source developers to indemnify a major corporation for their legal expenses. Again, this is factually false. That is NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING. Just because you say it is, does not make it so." Here's something for you to take back to Australia with you, Rob. Most American lawyers pretty quickly learn not to make assertions that they cannot back up with facts. Have you ever read section 7.1.5?? Before you start labeling anyone a troll or liar and making defamatory accusations, maybe you should take a good long look in the mirror and have a chat with your company's lawyer!

Not a teacher but found out a teacher that was the sister of my neighbors (who were a nightmare) husband talking shit about me. Never had her as a teacher but 5 of my friends told me about this she would say that I was an unruly kid, shot marshmallows all over her brothers house would bother them all the time. Flooded there back yard and was just not a good person period. I ended up going up to her saying hey Ms. T I'm John. So I heard you were talking shit about me to the rest of the students now I have 5 other students that will collaborate this story and I'm good friends with the superintendent as he was my middle school principal. So if you wish to keep your fucking job, I don't want to hear that my name came out of your mouth ever again. She was crying and told me okay and went back into her office.

You forget that the Legion has a howitzer at the Fort.If the Legion wins at Hoover Dam and overwhelms the Boomers, there's no reason not to assume that the Lucky 38 would be demolished in a bombardment from the guns the Legion would possess. House's patience would mean nothing at that point.

People can also use the Internet to try to impose their sanctimonious bullshit on others without subjecting themselves to moral scrutiny. Most of the guys passing themselves off as outraged would do it at the drop of a hat if they had a chance with the right married woman. They'd  forget all about what they said here. Posers. Also, a correction - I didn't say I was superior. I don't believe that. Ali I did was answer OP and make an off-hand comment about married women. Then the fake outrage machine started. The trolls are those who fake outrage while wishing me ill simply for telling the truth about something the vast majority of married men have done. Don't believe me on that - look up infidelity rates yourself. I've examined the moral implications closely. If people are going to debate me on that, at least make an argument. Labels, name-calling, and wishing people dead doesn't cut it.

Cambiemos el discurso ya, estoy harto de juego de tronos y del Cholo Simeone. Propuestas, propuestas y propuestas, para todos, no sólo para los más desfavorecidos. No todo el mundo esta desahuciado o pasa hambre. Más hincapié en la respuesta al desempleo, pues eso sí interesa a todos.Desarrollemos punto a punto el documento Torres-Navarro, que parece olvidado.
I've heard good things about it! But the thought of eating that much coconut oil and butter makes me nervous. d:It's on my list of things to try, probably on a day off.
Thanks for the update Cyber. Some good news for us all is that I know of at least one Dev waiting for this before releasing their game on gearvr.  So hopefully crystal rift will be out soon. Although I'm not sure if this release fixes the Unity 5 issues they need fixing before release.

No. Clingy is sending multiple messages a day with no reply.Asking a guy with a single text to stop wasting your time, because otherwise youll make other plans, is completely allowed.If he somehow feels smothered by a request to adhere to normal protocals for human interaction, well thats a fucking big red flag there as to how selfish he acts.
Laurel never loved a woman...You mean the woman *her sister* used to love. And I think you also meant to say the man she *once* loved, in regards to Laurel's feelings for Oliver, not the man once she loved. I think that's why your comment came off confusing.
It's a shame the girl seemingly just got a slap on the wrist and was let go. Pussy pass in action. Would've been funny to hear about an Aussie chick get lethally injected. Prior to her execution on her Instagram (or Snapchat or wtf people use these days)::'( bout to get lethally injected luv u all!!!!111!1!!
I'm not perverted enough to have any idea what you are talking about.  If I had that app, which I don't, I would enjoy the privacy, which I don't need because I have a loving girlfriend who is also a redditor. 
there is quite a bit of evidence against creationism. while it may be hard to find out how the world was created, you could definitely say that it wasn't made in the way the bible said it was. even if i did believe in god, i would still hate the fucker anyway
Moutinho and Toulalan both grew to 86 for me for a short time with Monaco. They stayed steady at 85 for at least 2-3 seasons before I sold them; those 2 were so consistent for me...rarely had &lt;8.0 games and possibly never picked up an injury. Benzema, who I bought at 87, is currently sitting at a 91. Performs every game. 
No, that's actually called temperature protection and basically all chips have it. Temperature control means that the mod can sense the temperature of the coil, and limit it to below a set temperature. It gives a better vape, and prevents dry hits. 
Much good advice in other replies, but adding some. Unless you plan to run past enemies it is a good idea to prepare your char with many many low level medium dmg spells. Those soul arrows, dark orbs and lightning spears (depending on build) should be set up on numerous slots and with extra casts. As you grow more powerful increase the power of them. Get faith 40 quickly and talk to Licia for the best priest/paladin hood. Get 20 int and 20 faith and talk to the hexer at the start of Copse for the best mage/hexer hood and best hex staff. Extra sunlight spears and crystal soul spears win the day. Generally infuse catalysts and bring several catalysts for each school of magic. As a pure caster you can carry two catalysts easily since you don't carry weapons. Some levels are long so carrying a backup boosted catalyst is smart. 
Join the 0 fucks crowd. We're tired of the bs too. So now we just play for fun. Terrible BR? No problem.Terrible teams? Also no problem because look at how many fucks I give? 0. Losing? Thats fine too. In fact I'll just plink away at other tanks like everyone else instead of you know... playing the objective.Playing the objective is for losers. We're not here to be losers. We're here to win. So we're going to shoot tanks.
i donated pretty much right before my initial TRT workup.i had low ferritin but all other iron was normal. would you guess the low ferritin was from donating?
The attitude that we shouldn't expect horny college boys to be able to control themselves is exactly what people mean when they talk about "rape culture."
I just recently started a job as a rod man for construction surveying, and from what I've heard, my employer has gone through about 6 or 7 people prior to myself, even with the job starting at $16 hourly and full benefits.  I get the idea that most of the people hired prior to myself either couldn't deal with working on a bridge project due to heights or they couldn't deal with the long hours and early days, which has caused them to go through so many people to try and find someone.
I actually went and purchased an iPod Classic recently (~1 year ago).My rationale at this time was that I had a vast music library which I collected over the years (being a Millennial, it meant that all my CDs got transferred over to MP3s, along with other "alternative" methods) that I didn't want to get go. Also, I wanted to download a fucktonne of podcasts as a back-catalog that I can listen to whenever I want.This was going well, up until I was able to get an iPhone with had LTE on it. Now that meant that I almost exclusively listen to Spotify for all of my songs. I still don't pay for premium, but if I want to listen to a song that I want when not at a computer, I'll just look it up on Youtube. My iPod, which I bought completely new, is currently sitting in my desk drawer, literally gathering dust. 
i read all your posts. You understand how narratives work and you're completely right. Unfortunately most people wouldn't know narrative themes if they bit them on the ass. The tones, story lines, goals, and behaviors of both shows/sets of characters are so different. Seeing Matt Murdock just walk up and chill out with Coulson simply wouldn't make any sense right now. 
But she's not an egg donor, these are embryos they created for in-vitro fertilization with the intent to raise them together.  She would have none of the protections regular egg donors have, and she can't just sign a paper saying she wants nothing to do with *already created* embryos any more than a man can.  
thats a nice idea because it will let u skip the first low levels that u can actualy 1 shot. and on hight levels heavenly strike its actualy garbage it does 2 to 5% dmg  :/ 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZeWPScnolo - Watch this, you'll thank me if you haven't already seen it...it's fun to watch a second time, too :)Edited: There's a song at about 5.20 in that video, he explains the song before that.  The song is excellent!
Hey L3gionHd,Oh I here you on the chanting. I really hear you. Relentless isn't it? Just won't shut up and starts getting loud at the worst times? it never really stops when you're awake.I love you. Remember that you deserve love, and that You are amazing :-) What is it that's happened?Joshy
Animal Farm - George Orwell&gt;The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.
i am actually quite interested in what you are telling me and you dont have to make me feel better my friend :)also i dont want to convince you that my opinion is the right one. just what i see here around
I don't know, I have no use for any of them really as you can see. I'm just gonna hold on to them in hopes they become like a collectors item like some sigs
I haven't had any recurring dreams since I was a kid.    One that I remember was that the old, disused BBQ we had in our backyard would somehow catch fire and end up burning the entire house down while I was sleeping. I made my Dad check it all the time to make sure it was 'dead'.
I would want Villager.In box or out of box, doesn't really matter to me. Packaging: doesn't even need it, so any is coolio. First, Im not a collector. Sorry for choosing the 'rarest' one, but... Well, here's my story. When I heard about amiibos, I decided not to collect them all, just get my mains. Dedede, Ness, and Villager. Ouch. Well, I go to best buy, where I preordered smash, and I think to myself, 'eh, no rush to get him.  Villager's gonna be super common. Nobody wants him.' I apparently couldn't have been any more wrong. So TL;DR, im really bad at guessing.I'm not a collector, I'd just be playing with him. :) Anyways, even if I don't win, thank you for doing this, OP! This sub is always so nice. :D
Man, I always forget about Ian's death. I think I wanna block it out of my memory cause shit doesn't make sense. Ali pushed him and killed him. So why did A move the body? Why make it look like a suicide? It seems completely pointless for A to pin Ali's death on Ian, because it'll never come back to A (because he knows it never happened) and it's something A could use to torture the girls with. 
Water Bending, because Water makes up a significant portion of pretty much all living things, a lot of the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. I would, with enough practice and meditation, be able to control anyone's mind, for example, and a lot more beyond that.
 Having positive physical experiences with a parent actually sets a child up to be comfortable giving and receiving physical affection, and is stored as a positive subconscious feeling about physical love in relationships.  In fact, many people who have difficulty expressing physical affection to their partners relate this to their family not being very physically affectionate.
One note, generally any tornado in Oklahoma county will be south of downtown OKC or north of Edmond. By no means a fact but Edmond hasn't had significant damage from a tornado in 25+ years. Good rule of thumb anyways. 
*Doctor Sons VII Awakens from his desk, a sheet of Necronomicon information stuck to his face* Eh... What's going on here...? *He stumbles sleepily out into the hallway to get a view of things*
Thank you for the advice. I was actually informed today by the management I talked to that the issue was now in the hands of HR because of similar complaints. The suggestion put to me was to keep quiet so as not to put ammunition in the the other party's hands.
Amiibo:RosalinaIn/out of box: in if possible, but if not oob is cool :)Packaging: doesn't matterReason: by the time I started collecting, she was impossible to find, and I think she's one of the best looking amiibo and would like to add her to my growing collection!
Yeah, I went to my bank today to speak to someone directly. I wound up having to call a card services number and talking to them they said that no transaction had ever come up from Manadarake, like they hadn't processed the transaction. I don't know if thats because Manadarake was asking for a credit card and I was using my debit card, though I don't really see that being an issue. Either way, I was able to pay for the cover I should get a shipping email here in the next few days.
Um. Bands + artists, favorite atm off the top of my skull: Nine Inch Nails (always), Bright Eyes, Earl Sweatshirt, Brand New, Sia.Really depends on the mood.I really hope that the OP wasn't bullshitting about his list. That was EPIC.
Idc how that game ends because i didnt bet on it but 85% for C9 is so fucking retarded LOL. Like they just changed 2 player and LG got ptr as well. So on what basis are 85% of the people betting on C9
Not sure about seasonal allergies, but my husbands runny nose and snoring went way down when he cut out gluten. Do you do low-carb wraps or pasta on keto? If not, you may be accidentally going gluten free and seeing benefits from that.
I taught English at a school in Tokyo.  My colleague always complained about this one student of his, usually calling her a major pain in the ass.One day I substituted for him.  The first time I turned around to write on the board I was kancho'd.
I know somebody (not Mormon). That was robbed in Ecuador.  They were 22 at the time.  In a separate incident, my daughter had a couple of Peruvian friends from college.  They came from a wealthy family and had body guards.  My daughter decided to venture out a little later than them because she was tired.  She was robbed at gunpoint.  I WARNED her.  
Though those are issues, pretty sure they can put them up fast because of the construction methods they use. Compare regulations to 1920s America, still took them much longer back then. 
i wish every house was like this - you walk in and the owner has their music taste displayed clearly on the wall. in cases like this you would just be able to walk back out again and trash that person from your facebook, phone contacts etc.
I have literally watched every game of Leonard Williams career. He is going to be a MONSTER for us. I am so excited I'm buying his jersey as soon as it's on sale. It is my sincere belief he is the best player in the draft.Edit: Welp...
Ya I hug all my friends pretty good now, except the ones that continually gave me an awkward "really bro?" look after.I can't really disagree with the classification of "coupled" vs "single," but everything here is basically what I was thinking for years while "coupled" in my last relationship:    -  laying in bed, feeling really alone, wanting to even just snuggle/spoon.  -  wondering how long it's been since anyone touched me.I've moved on pretty good from everything, but touch is the one thing that still gets me.  I can't help but laugh at myself about in the moment *(and feel awkwardly uncomfortable about after)* about how happy it makes me to get a solid hug that was initiated by the other person *(and not the awkward, obligatory, end-of-date, i'm-hugging-you-out-of-politeness-to-avoid-greater-contact hug).*  I feel like it's weird . . . 
&gt;Without the how it is very likely that we have rather mundane explanationThe two seem pretty unrelated to me... Layman here for sure, but like... just because you don't know how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work. Practically, I understand where you're coming from, but one doesn't say much about the other technically.
There's not much difference between a Keynesian liberal and a social democrat. He also supports universal health care and tuitionless higher education, which are both social democratic positions.
I was at work last summer, between my junior and senior year of college, and had a customer tell me to go to trade school. He asked what I was studying and I told him music and he responded with "What a useless major, you're better off going to trade school and working towards a real career where you'll actually make money." Fuck him. I'm going to grad school in the fall. 
That's one of those scenes where my TV will be on in the background while I'm getting ready to go out or something, and then the heist sequence starts and even if I'm late for an appointment it's like "Shit, guess I've gotta sit down and watch the next fifteen minutes of this movie."
Nobody is expecting a cargo ship to perform the same as a real carrier (or "super carrier"), but it would be significantly more accessible for players to get. Finding and purchasing a real carrier will likely be difficult and have lots of restrictions (especially if it's a military ship). A cargo ship? Not so much.I'd be all for having it be able to deploy/drop/uncrate its cargo. Keep in mind that the Hull E has no facilities to resupply, repair, launch or even board stored ships, so the process of getting people in the ships and the ships out of crates would likely be slow, awkward, and not efficient. The ships are transported exposed and the Hull itself is not well armed or armored. But it could work.
I taunt after most kills. In 64 it was called "Fighter Stance", and you got bonus points for doing it at the end of a match in the Story Mode. Because of that, I've always thought of it as just the thing to do after a kill.Sometimes I use it randomly in the middle of a match for intentional disrespect though, but that's different.
I managed to get every day this weekend off except for Friday because I'm shooting a short film on Saturday and Sunday.And I work box office on Friday, so it won't even be that bad.My co-workers hate me right now.

TBH Cali makes a mockery of "medicinal marijuana" - any Joe Blo can fake a cough and get some bud. But it makes it look bad for the real sick people out there who actually need cannabis. Chemo patients, glaucoma sufferers etc.If people (adults only ofc) just want to get high, they should just be able to buy some weed like you would buy a carton of grog with your ID at the bottleO (er, bongO?).Agree with you on the rest though.
DEAR GOD WILLIAMS OR PICKS OUT THE ASS YES PLEASEedit: didn't expect Scherff if we were taking BPA.  I thought we could have gotten him if we traded down.  Oh well, I trust Scott.
Rekkles hopped the team once from Fnatic to Alliance when it looked like fnatic was breaking up. Basically every time before he stayed on fnatic. Even during his time playing for the Wolves it was clear he would go back to Fnatic so what do you mean by team hopper? If the team you are on breaks up and you want to be on the very best team and it looks like the best team (and elements looked great going into the split) wants to pick you up, is it bad to switch? Rekkles looked like an extremely ambitious guy and really which of the changing moves he did do you disagree so heavily on? How could he have known how bad elements would go this split and that fnatic somehow would be great?
&gt; It appears to be having some trouble with the links at the bottom of the sidebarThe list is broken because 4,7, and 8 are not valid URLs. Fix those URLs and I bet it'll work fine.
Police brutality and abuse is very much an issue that needs to be addressing.  But how does it help anything in defending those that are damaging and looting from local businesses?  That just makes those that can help address the issue less willing to help out.  The more people riot and loot the more justification it gives for the police to obtain more military gear and that use more force.  Its really self defeating really especially when a good portion of the rioting and looting is done by those coming in for fun because they know they can get away with it.

I can remember the exact time all those coma theories came into existence in a massive wave, and it was just after the 'Ash is in a coma' Pokemon theory. Pretty soon everyone was shoehorning shit in to whatever they could. The Rugrats one is particularly bad and still gets circulated around a lot.Also 'we didn't see X die, therefore X is alive,' which is even worse when it actually comes true.
Please say it ain't so - I had dozens and dozens of playlists that I didn't have the foresight to save elsewhere. I imagine this would be pretty devastating for many...
From the first time I read Scripture my understanding has always been that the very first verse says:&gt; In the beginning God created the heavens and the earthand the water, void, and chaos are part of "the heavens and the earth."
And Batman is a guy who wears his underwear on the outside while chasing a clown.You can make any idea sound silly. You can also make any idea sound serious.
I would like Animal crossing a new leaf if you would &lt;3Everyone i talk to says to play it but i havent gotten around to buying it. Getting it for free would just be icing on my cake :D
Every time I check in on this subreddit I get more and more depressed, it's just so much bitching and moaning about how being short such a terrible fucking curse that there's no way to overcome.At 5'2" I'm shorter than just about all of the short guys on here, yet somehow I don't seem to run in to most of the problems they constantly complain about.  I wonder if that has anything to do with not giving a fuck about my height.  When you make everything about your height, your height is all people see because you constantly point it out, when you act like a decent fucking human being, that's what people see.
To be fair, if we are talking about John Waters, then yes, there are only a few bars where wealthy old white people drink, I guess.  A decent proportion of the rest of the bar crowd is Hopkins and UM  students.    And to be honest, in the working class areas which are less gentrified, especially farther out towards the county, there is a pretty decent racial mix in many of the popular drinking establishments. 
I think the other player was a hacker or at least there was a hacker in your session. Some destroying the game by killing all players simultaneously, others throw cash around and drop other items of all kind.
You do understand that God permits divorce under certain circumstances, correct? He has not unanimously forbade it. He hates it, true, but it is not forbidden universally. The fact that divorce is legal does not invalidate the Christian ideal of the sanctity of marriage. 
&gt;but after it was lowered off of the lift and I drove it around the parking lot I noticed it rode a little harder than before.Your struts are junk.Sometimes when they are bad enough having them fully extended (like from being on a lift) will do them in for good.  They were broken anyway (would have done this on their own soon) and the garage is in no way responsible for this.It's maintenance time.  This is a safety issue.  And if these are original (I'm guessing they are) they are well overdue to be changed.
When I was maybe 5 or 6, my much older sister would use these poop-looking chocolates to make it seem like she was eating poop from the cat box, and try to get me to pull one out and eat it.  Either I never fell for it, or blocked the memory.  Mostly sure it's the former. =/
Yup, just 2015 sets. I hadn't used CCBS before the reboot, it was hard for me at first to figure out how to use the system well, especially for bigger builds.
How many pushups can you do? The idea that you can do ten full pullups but can't bench more than 60 pounds doesn't make any sense to me.Also, if you can "almost" do 10 full pullups in a row, you haven't even close to reached a plateau. The idea that switching to weights is going to make you progress faster is false. I'd save your money.
The Vaccinator isn't no means a horrible weapon, but in a more competitive setting, the slower rate of healing really hurts. The Vaccinator helps with damage the player is taking while you are healing them, but it's going to take way longer to heal up any players that took damage while you weren't healing them. Plus, you'll be going into most mid fights at a major health because you can't distribute overhealed at the same rate another medic can.It's great at keeping the player you are currently healing alive and a good Vaccinator medic can be frustrating to deal with, but it is inferior in team healing and that ends up being more important in competitive.
There's tons of red wing black birds by the lake right now.I did have a pair of downy woodpeckers come to my feeder and a pair of cardinals, no blue jays.

This one is more of an intro and I'm still wrapping my head around the whole topic, but it's great to think about. http://www.core77.com/posts/12752/a-periodic-table-of-form-the-secret-language-of-surface-and-meaning-in-product-design-by-gray-holland-12752
How? Are you using an enhance active? The scenario you just described would be a total of ~3 million for the entire team, not per Kali. A max plussed Kali would do about 700k by herself. Even if you're talking about ultimate Kali, a max plussed Kali will be doing 1m damage, no where close to 2m. To get 2m per Kali on a 5x activation with no enhance (pre uvo), a +99 atk Kali would need 4 light TPAs and 12 total combos, which isn't possible without skyfalls.
Oh man this was great the Onion reviews are always so good. I thought it was pretty great he specifically mentioned Marvel's gigantic roster and then referred to all the DC heroes as just Batman and Superman. 
A guys instincts and a girls instincts on sex are very different especially at young age. A 15 year old boy would fuck anything with a pulse and a vag. Is this the same for a 15 year old girl? We are also raised and pre determined what are sexual roles are in society.
Very true! Thank god they are removing a lot of these level crossings, hope that Clayton Rd is on the list.EDIT: Page 6 of the report actually recommends that the money spent on the Metro could be better spent on removing level crossings... I guess Labor are doing both so that's good!
Of course its practical. All it takes is some straightening up. If you manage 2 semesters of 4.0, that basically evens you out to about 3.12, if the whole unit count is even, with 4 semesters to go.You have 6 more tries at it. If you even average a 3.5 for the next 6 semesters, you'll end up with like a 3.2.The underlying problems are your study habits and understanding *why* you got a bad GPA, and take steps to fix it.
&gt;And is the little tiny blue thing in the middle that's left over the German speaking provinces?That's Brussels.&gt;And why is Luxembourg there, other than being a neighbor?      Family of course. There's a Belgian Luxembourg &amp; an independent one for a reason.
They need a guy who can break by a CB and break their coverage, Crabtree, no offense, isn't going to give you that. That's why I like this pick, kinda. I'm not ready to say anything about Cooper transitioning to the NFL game yet

Yeah it's a blast I love it. I have it tuned through 5 star. Ran for the last two weeks with the 93 tune and it's an absolute terror on the streets for what it is, especially with my cutout. Went back to 87 performance tune when I got sick of the $100 fillups and my inability to be economical but it's still pretty responsive
I highly recommend you do a quick search for the few posts by men complaining about their wives' bodies post-pregnancy and notice 2 things: 1, that they are *very* few and far between. Do you really think so little of your husband that he didn't prepare for this when he married you? 2, these men get absolutely scathing responses from pretty much everyone. There is no support for guys who complain about the body change their wives endure for birthing the child they sired.
&gt;I'm actually surprised that I wasn't downvoted to fuck for not supporting that body positivity and HAES bullshit.Reddit hates fat people - You're safe
Join the club. I actually got the R and one of the Ms from the first shot. Turns out I'm actually now super immune to that stuff, but it damn near killed me as a kid.Edit: I still promote vaccination because I'm physiologically anomalous.
I almost completely agree with you - except for 3) where of course I advocate for a safe utopian society but I don't necessarily think it's possible and certainly not where we are today. Do you think it's possible to completely eradicate the lowest part of the bell curve? Where every human born into our society has zero tendencies towards violence etc?
Did you get to see the video? It seems like he has a full on infection on his back. As for the colour on it, it either seems that has a full on tattoo there, or he just likes to drink silver water.
You're completely missing the point. Those examples are used to stress what begging for sexual favors is like, especially sexual favors that that individual would not like some to them. And many straight men like their prostate stimulated. 
Yep.that comment alone shows you have rational thoughts alright..Careful with those comments,liberals dont like it when you make fun of gays like that.

I'm still going to buy them. They are actually worth RP to me. They should introduce golden/diamond skins for our champions as mastery rewards, like in SMITE. But that won't happen, obviously.
Here you go: ^\(\^.\^)I have to admit, this one was difficult to make. The trick is to backslash-escape the left cheek-parenthesis and the eye-carets. Since there are no spaces, there is no need to wrap the entire thing in parentheses for superscripting it, and I don't think it would be possible - you would have to superscript the individual components separately.

It reminds me of the quotation from Stephen Colbert - "The more you know, the sadder you get." I will read all of these different topics for school and just barely touch on them, and I want to learn more about them, but it just isn't feasible, and I realize that there is so much out there that is waiting for me to discover and learn about, and it will most likely never happen. And that makes me sad. 
Every time a president visits the University of Texas and does the "hook 'em horns" sign with their hand, the conspiracists cite it as an example that they worship Satan.
Or, more importantly, not letting the 3DS die in sleep mode if it was accessing the SD card at the time.  (Forgot about that option, btw.  Currently backing up Omega Ruby.)
Yes, indeed the lyrics are there. For example, here's the page for [I Appear Missing](http://imgur.com/W2iDgT0) that I immediately made into a wallpaper.
I don't think this is the case. As far as I know, only J'zargo levels up with the player. I have read that transforming a follower into an animal with the Wabbajack resets their level to that of the player, but I have never bothered to verify this myself.I do think that followers are set to a level when you first meet them. Take for example Borgakh the Steel Heart, a female Orc that can be your follower, who lives in [Mor Khazgur.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mor_Khazgur)Her level is set to the player's level, up to a maximum of level 30. Her armor is always Heavy Armor, but depends on the player's level. If you meet her at level 30 or higher, she'll be wearing Orcish Armor. At lower levels it will be steel if I remember correctly.So if you have a favorite follower in mind it might be best to look up their maximum level and wait until you hit that before you meet them. That way they'll be at maximum strength.
It's not easy to reference these things when reading the ebook. On of my biggest pet peeve is being unable to check maps a d other references, and a regular look st the cover. Hell I've read entire series and forgotten the name of the author because I don't see it every time I open the book.
I can't speak on anything specific, but just know that (in the US) OTC supplements are basically unregulated, rarely contain what's on the label, and don't even work when they *do*. [Here, have a source!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQI3dlQP5gI)
Didn't say it won't take advantage of them, but that in parallel the input voltage means the board will be locked to 60w mode. YiHi programmed the board to only run in 120w mode when presented with series input voltage. Both series and parallel would give you the same battery life at the same power level, but series open up the full capabilities of the board, so there's no reason to use it in parallel. 
I thought a lot of the Danganronpa 2 characters looked off.  Something about then seemed...sinister I guess.  In the end, I understand the art direction better.   
i tend to disagree with the law, however. I don't know exactly where to draw the line, but having one drink shouldn't mean you are off the hook as a girl. And when both members are drunk, I don't think you should be able to lay blame on the guy either. 
Exactly, *спасибо за то, что &lt;clause&gt;*, but you can also shorten it to *спасибо, что &lt;clause&gt;*. The former is slightly more formal. (However, speakers of the younger generation tend to use bare *что* less frequently, saying things like *слышала, то что он женился*, so I'd expect the shorter construction to fall out of use, too.)
Thanks very much - that link had a great deal note info than I was able to find last night, so that's promising. Thanks also for forwarding that question along.The more I read about this the more excited I am, assuming it delivers on the premise. If I'm reading it right, the application is limited to Evernote currently, but almost as a proof of concept; the ultimate aim is to have easily extensible encryption across the board on a native level. Which would be basically my dream.
Honestly, I haven't seen much of the mainstream media calling what happened a "black riot". However, I have heard a lot of this from reddit, more than anywhere else. Specifically, /r/videos .
Yeah minorities can't be criticized for racism by white people. This is why whites can't criticize Japan for their racist genocide and rape spree through Asia in the 1930's. Whites can't come in and help stop the genocide in Rwanda because it's two black ethnicities involved, and blacks can't be racist. 
Well, it made sense in the context of the time, but it no longer does. It's still an entirely valid criticism of a supposedly perfect and unchanging "word of God," just for a different reason than some people assume on its face.
Deism believes in a non-personal deity who does not interact with humans or creation in general. They generally believe that a higher power created everything and set everything in motion, but doesn't after that hasn't really done anything
You have it pretty good luckily. You make a lot more money and have much cheaper rent than Midwestern people who straddle the poverty line. I had the same issues with not wanting to shop for groceries because fast food required less interaction and was instant gratification. In actuality, purchasing groceries requires the same amount of interpersonal interaction, except you have to walk by people in aisles and pretend like you weren't aware of their existence more often... which is much easier than paying for fast food/groceries in the first place. Invest time in yourself to make actual food and save lots of money that way. Hey, at least you aren't burning it all on drugs.
Well.. Then Manpower, Addeco, Centric, and Tech4Hire are either lying not don't know their shit. There are always companies hiring that do not care about Norwegian skills. Especially in IT.Could it be that what they mean is that your particular skill-set is competing with a lot of Norwegians? A degree in in IT isn't really saying much of course, but more specifically? What have you done in the past? How can you be an asset for a company?This is something the recruiters look at. They don't want to help *you*, they want to help the company hiring a guy. For you to be that guy you have to help the recruiter by telling them all about you.

/u/__U_WOT_M8__ is the person I'm hoping for.  He's seems really smart, it's like he's a genius or something.  Plus all his ratings for anime are spot on.
Bigger doesn't always mean better either, it also has to do with the cut, clarity, and color, and usually bigger diamonds are less likely to have a good color/clarity. And if they do, will cost an arm and a leg. The thing I see lately is halo rings, where there are a lot of small diamonds around a bigger diamond to give the illusion of a huge diamond, in which case the carat may not be as big as one single diamond. There are just so many trade offs when it comes to diamonds and rings, IMO, and really depends on the couple. Mine is a three stone and sometimes I wish I had more stones to make it look bigger but I know I never actually would be able to do it. Maybe instead of upgrading the ring you can add another ring as an anniversary band or something, that way she can keep the original engagement ring. Some are even angled to frame or "enhance" the ring, and then she can also solder them together to make essentially one ring. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but in a year he can reapply for the draft and be drafted again. It's what happened with Bo Jackson. But let's be honest it's not happening. He's a Titan.

I've already explained it to you. It's just not what I enjoy. I don't like the, for a lack of a better term "flippy shit"  And they're backstage movie-eque style of storytelling is probably the biggest turn off for me, it makes it kinda hard to get into.  I do sometimes catch the end of it on the taima streams and check out the videos on Youtube and there certainly is some in-ring stuff I enjoy. When I put aside the other stuff, there is some solid in-ring action there. For example the casket match with Fenix and Mil Muertes was a match I really enjoyed
&gt; But this needs to stop being the sole focus of the discussion. There also needs go be a focus on men not attacking women in the first place.what makes you think that his office is taking no steps to address the Josue in other ways? I'm sure they're in discussions with police about catching perpetrators and making the streets safer.Just because he gives a piece of basic advice to citizens, doesn't mean he's doing nothing else
My professor when I studied there told me that (not sure if it's true) the octagonal shape was so in case of revolt, it was harder to ambush the police/army coming around the corners. Or something like that. Either way, made for a beautiful look but really annoying crosswalks.
The added range with the lvl 4 talent actually gives it some decent range, but yeah I agree for the most part. Its not the most ideal, but it can work in some ways. Lots of fun though!
How does energy density makeup of the universe coming out of the Friedman-Roberston Walker metric relate to "crazy" technology? Dark matter and energy are absolutely established, just not discovered on a particle level. I feel like its an entirely different situation than "neutrinos moving faster than c", which lasted about 3-4 months and only had ONE experiment reporting the result.
Yeah but imagine being the stylist standing there for 10 hours a day. You constantly have people there to talk to who don't want to talk to you. I assume it would be pretty boring if no one would have a conversation with you all day.
I pre-ordered two game, Far Cry 4 because it was ten euro cheaper and I definitely got my money's worth and Bloodborne so it did that thing where it downloads before the game releases.I love the pre-release download thing.It's just the best.
Don't be too upset about that. If she did it to you then chances are shes gonna do it to the next guy (who I guess is also her ex). Probably dodged a bullet.
I would suggest 4. Even if you didn't like it, the Premium edition is quite cheap, and all the gripes people had with it on launch day have been repaired. Hardline is a bit... Eh. Even with only 2 months to play BF4 before Hardline came out, it was a blast to play.
Only issue is not with her...but when you do terminal legendary quests on her it doesn't count for some reason. Anyone else experiencing this? When I kill a boss it acts like nothing happened. Sucks when leveling up. 
Hilarious. And every time i watch one of these self-defence/streetfighting martial art classes I get even more convinced about how brilliant the show Enter the Dojo is. 
I've never played Borderlands. I've seen a small amount of gameplay, but it just doesn't seem like I would enjoy it.You say that if I've never played Borderlands, I have to. Care to take a shot a convincing me?This isn't an aggressive challenge. I just don't know much about the game.
To be honest, the TV show's ending was just as dark, with [](/s "Homura separated from Madoka forever in a world where only she could remember her.")I kinda like the idea of [](/s "devil Homura"), but would've preferred to see an End of Eva-style "alternate ending" movie to the approach Rebellion took, "overwriting" the old ending's value as an ending with new, unnecessary plot.

lol I was a psych major so my basic technique is this:most people who are assholes (see:trolls) do it because they hurt deep inside and they've learned to believe--usually via their parents/caregivers/family--that putting others down will elevate themselves.  Obviously, this is fundamentally untrue.  We're social creatures and we enjoy giving.  Also, People hate to face themselves.  So I use the presumption that they're not simply a sociopath having fun (hard to say the likelihood), use basic psychoanalysis and just tell 'em the truth about themselves.  They usually battle a few rounds before I shut them down...sometimes it's longer but I like to think maybe I can break through to just one and help them!

I did HH then Dead Money. I still haven't played OWB or LR. But JE Sawyer, one of the developers, said on his formspring that he thought it should be HH-&gt;DM-&gt;OWB-&gt;LR.

Good point about it being in writing. I think ordinarily the business owner could get away with throwing the employee under the bus, but it's going to be difficult to explain the call sheet.

Full quote from the Woj article:&gt;When Rondo realized his run with the Celtics was over this year, he planned to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer, league sources told Yahoo Sports. He expected a maximum contract. Once Dallas made the trade, he was open to re-signing with the Mavericks – only there are no max contract offers for Rondo on the market.Not that there's anyway to defend Rondo at this point, but the full quote suggests he wasn't always going to leave Dallas. Only if things didn't work out - which because of him - they didn't.

I don't have any specific examples, but I do have some ideas. You could use tabs, but I don't think they would apply here. I would just make it so each page slides in from the right after the user presses an FAB to submit the page. If they want to go back, they could swipe to the right (sliding the page from the left). You could put a progress bar at the bottom of the page, or it would be really cool to have the progress bar [around the FAB](http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_3/material_ext_publish/0B0NGgBg38lWWbTlSaHdQZEMtalk/components-progressactivity-typesofindicators-061101_Circular_Aspirational_xhdpi_002.webm), and have the FAB stay constant while the paper pages slide underneath it. Don't use the back arrow in the navigation bar to go back, because the expected action for that is to exit the form.

[Sora no Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) - Much more than simply K-On in the military, but the similarities are there. It has the whole tightknit group of girls dynamic, but it's set in a military platoon in a post-apocalyptic world and gets quite heavy at times and has some very memorable scenes. I really can't decide which show I like more between the two. They both have lovable characters, but there's definitely more substance to this show. The worldbuilding is incredible, its themes of finding oneself and finding meaning in the world were very thought provoking and left a really good impression of this show as something much more than another SoL.Also, it's not a show about music though there is significance to Kanata and her trumpet playing.
It is a joke. And the worst part is the intentional mixture of academics and athletics. We're a school that has sports teams not the other way around.Look, I was in the band so I marched on Kyle for four years. I was in the basketball band so I attended every men's and women's basketball game for three years. That was before Gillispie and only the 9–19 first year under Gary Blair. I was on the volleyball band the one season we had one so I attended every one of their home games even though I didn't understand more than the minimum and just cheered when our team did because I assumed we must have done something well. I went to as  many baseball games as I could and tried to get to some softball and soccer as well...I enjoy Aggie athletics.But that is an awful, awful seal and we shouldn't combine the two. I did not get a diploma from the athletics department.
Gotta keep going up ccs to compete with the correctly made 1000cc bikes from other manufactures.No but really though, L Twins are great at producing midrange torque, but the massive size of the pistons is a disadvantage in revs, so they output less horsepower due to lower redline. So you have to make up for it by making more overall torque, thus the increase in capacity. Also, the engines got more and more oversquare to further shorten the piston travel length to shift the torque in the upper range. And they will never go I4 to keep their characteristic sound. 
your line saying "only telling the teacher which group was labeled as smart or dumb" unequivocally points to the Pygmalion study since in the Jane Elliot study the teacher was the "researcher" so why would she need to tell herself?

Like you said, statistics and probability and linear algebra for the background. A lot of the common classifiers are already packaged/implemented (in R, python) so you never really have to "know" what they do in extreme detail.Some basic/common examples (look these up in Google):- Logistic Regression- Classification Trees, Random Forests- Support Vector MachinesAll of these rely on knowledge of basic stats and probability and some linear algebra only.More complex ones will involve optimization techniques.

I have the Benefit Erase Paste cuz home girl got some serious blue circles. It was creasing on me like a mother. Then I watched "how to cover your dark circles" from makeup up geek. If you're using the NARS concealer to cover instead highlight try applying it under your foundation. I find that if I do that with the erase paste, then cover over it with whatever is left on my brush from foundation it doesn't crease. I then go over with a highlighter and set it with setting powder.
I'm genuinely of the mindset that crime can't be eliminated, yeah. I never really thought about Criminology dealing with the rights of offenders, though. The vast majority of what I've read of this book deals just with various theories that try to explain why criminals behave the way that they do, so I do now see that my initial posting was laughably uninformed.I appreciate you giving me more to research and reflect on. I may still not actually pursue this as a potential career path, but I at least have a newfound understanding and respect for just how intricate the legal system truly is.
Previous company implemented a 90 day retention on Sent, Trash, and IIRC Inbox when we moved from Lotus to Exchange. Everyone knew this and had a reasonable amount of time to move anything in the wrong place. Quite a few used their Inbox as a base for their folders if they had any.
Human action is changeable by changes in circumstances, and follows some patterns (including ones that flow from age).I agree that changing people's circumstances can change their behavior.  I was referring to the originally posited idea that black people should simply be exhorted to work harder, with no change in circumstance.  I see that as pointless.But changing structures to there are more reasons to be ambitious?  That can definitely have a positive impact.
Before I moved, I used to live on the same street as a hoarder.  He'd owned a house in another neighborhood that used for hoarding and was eventually condemned by the city. I don't know what the inside of his house looked like, but his car was filled to the absolute brim with tattered old paperbacks and his yard was a mess.  After I moved, I continued to see him regularly going through the dumpsters behind the grocery store near my new place. So, maybe he would just use the dumpster as a temporary storage facility. 
Hahaha that's an awesome story for the camp fire. I've now tagged you as Carlito. Edit: unless it's scarred you, in which case no campfire stories. But I'm keeping you tagged as Carlito. 
I would have to see a screenshot of it that fast to believe it (showing no titles, in serp armor, gems in armor, eternal defiance with gems/frost, no dahuta earing(s)). 
my thought exactly!but the "real" problem isn't even the fence I'm trying to finish it's their fence that they built themselves. It's weird and too high off the ground and the dog goes underneath!

I worked for USPS for one day (on the sorting floor of a local post office) Can confirm.  Every box goes into a big cart on wheels that are stacked ten or so wide to a row and 2 rows....soo... picture 20 or so big carts in a GIANT rectangle....Now picture someone throwing them five to twenty feet to make it into the proper cart for placement at the respective routes carrier "office"  It literally looked like making three pointers or half court baskets into an over sized net.
It is indeed 5 man crew. They picked fairly short folks, especially the guy behind the turret to the right of the passenger, barely any room for knees.The turret upgrade was done in late 1943 due to the damages suffered by Soviet army at the battle of Kursk. The older 76 turret could be efficient at the distance of 500-600 meters, while the Nazi's  were shooting and hitting Soviet tanks at the distance of about 1500 meters. So, that's about a kilometer advantage. 
Jeg vil lige se om jeg har forstået det korrekt, her.. Jeg har nemlig selv gået på teknisk skole i forskellige omgange. En elektrikeruddannelse varer.. Fire år, cirka? Og du står ved grundforløbseksamen, grundforløbet som varer 20 uger - som regel. EUX.. Lægger den et år til? Hvornår starter din elevtid?Og jeg kender godt miljøet på teknisk skole - det er heller ikke altid et, jeg har følt mig hjemme i. Folk er nu som regel alligevel altid gode nok, omend bare nogle gange bare fra en lidt anden omgangskreds en en selv. 
We had the in office procedure done about a week ago. He cried so so hard - it was heart breaking. But as soon as it was over he was fine. No pain for the remainder of the day even. I think the process is similar aside from the anesthesia. Babies are just so so resilient. Be strong for your little one!
[](/s "Berserk.") It's a prequel to its manga so in a way you're supposed to know how things end up, so it isn't even really a spoiler. Also I haven't read the manga and I can say it's still enjoyable on its own. 
Look into some community centers. There's one in Conway with a pool and one in College Park. I'm sure there are others too. Going to be a lot cheaper than the Y. That being said, if that's not really an issue, the Downtown Y has a huge group of swimmers, as does the Winter Park Y.
This isn't a good fit for a long term relationship.  It is better to end things when you are just 4 months into the relationship than it will be if you remain hoping that she will somehow become motivated.You are both very young and realistically...she doesn't sound like she is "the one" for you.You really need to have some of those basic things like long term goals be compatible for a lasting relationship.Source, I have been in a relationship for 40 years, married for 30 years to my best friend from high school 
I think the best way to support the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinians of all colors, is to kill the Hamas cancer that is poisoning their minds.Non-violent resistance and throwing the radical strains of islam into the garbage bin of history are the way forward for the Arabs.

I think it's pretty standard to warm gels up to help them work a little better. My dipbrow is starting to get a bit dry and I stick it in my bra every morning to warm it up! 
I think there a lot of problems with DE's approach toward the game. I do criticize when I feel it is needed. I agreed with your points. Just because someone does not agree with you it does not make them a DE fanboy with no sense. The points you made aren't even that unpopular. 
Some women have a particular taste for semen or dick or ass.  Some women can acquire a taste for semen or dick or ass.Some men have sweeter semen than others, though diet also plays a big role in this.So there's a combination of factors at play here just in terms of your bodies.  Then you throw in accounting for how openly and honestly the two of you talk about sex and sexuality, and you can see that there's variables within variables.
I actually like the idea of an unknown nefarious entity. Besides I hate when they do the scoobee dew reveal where it was the creepy janitor or the evil chandrian or something the whole time. That would be weak
You think God is speaking to youThrough bumper stickers.You walk through parking lotsWith palms together.You touch your family crossEvery time the light flickers.You get on your knees after rainbowsNo matter what the current weather.--Some say you're a paranoid freakSome say obsessive compulsive disorder.Some laugh at you behind your backAnd some judge you to your face.Either way you have the meansTo be a compulsive hoarder.Every trinket, every tissue is a tickIn your current crazy race.--You're buried beneath your obsessions, Compulsions and collections.You have no idea how bad it's gottenUntil you fall and are stuck.Your mind is screaming to GodAnd asking for connections.In reality, dearest God couldn'tGive a flying fuck.--
Pretty late, but I randomly heard this song on a channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0cGlvC3ohY (Recettear - Closed Shop / Good Morning, Recette) and it reminded me of Harvest Moon lol.
&gt;and the end of the story I dont feel bad, its almost like the human life has no meaning, i could pull the trigger and have absolutely no issue with the outcome of it.I think you do really need to get your mind right about this perspective before you start carrying. You need to really ask yourself what you're thinking and why you would carry. I recently took a 1.5 day class, introductory level. For me, the most striking moment in the whole class was when the instructor really drove home the point that if it ever came down to the moment, it would leave you changed forever. He closed that part of the class by asking "Do you think George Zimmerman is the same as he was a few years ago?" There was a lot of silence.
FYI even the PC version has aim assist and it's on by default. Don't know how it works or if it even helps when playing with a mouse. But I feel like it makes your bullets magnetic to the target when you're close. I've hit shots that didn't seem like they should have hit while I had aim assist on.

I'm so sorry. I'm on my 2nd month of clomid and have been on metformin for 8 months. My first round of clomid did basically nothing. I'm trying to be hopeful this time, but it's difficult. It helped me feel less shitty when my doctor called to tell me it was useless to track my temp. I knew I didn't ovulate. I just hadn't been officially told. I hope something works for you soon.

So when me and my brother were a few years old our mom would have us bathe together. I was about the age where I had discovered the built in squirt gun that God had given me. I looked over at my brother innocently playing with a toy boat or something and saw that his mouth was wide open when he made the boat noises. I sneakily walked over to his side of the tub and let him have it. But hey, they used to gargle urine to clean their teeth in the old days, so I guess I was actually performing a service to him. Yeah, mom wasn't amused when she found out why he was crying.  
What if... Valve were to hire the Black Mesa team to do HL3? They've proven they can kick some serious ass. Take key personnel from Valve to guide things along, then bam, HL3. Valve themselves don't have the drive to do it, but given everything Black Mesa was, I would be totally satisfied with them in the reigns.

And if you are black and are really well spoken, good at school, a hard worker, etc, you aren't seen as an individual who is really intelligent and hard working, but as an exception to the rule they apply to most black people.

Reddit is ridiculous, they get so upset about "global warming can't be real since it is snowing now" but you are literally saying "psych isn't a bad major because I got a job" and you are getting upvotes. How about some facts?On one end of the spectrum you have the physical sciences, business, and even education, these have relatively low unemployment for recent grads.On the other side is the arts, architecture, social sciences and psychology. These have relatively high unemployment when compared with other majors.Does it make one major better than the other? No.Does it mean that as a psychology student you will get a job or vice versa for a business major? Obviously not.But it is a trend and it is the truth.[Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/23/these-are-the-best-college-majors-if-you-actually-want-a-job-after-graduation/)
&gt;You know, with the way the Republican Party has purged all dissenting opinions and sought "purity" with increasing fervor,this is so astonishingly at odds with reality it disturbs me that someone could actually believe it.  Let's just compare the 2008 democratic and republican primaries, shall we?  For the republicans, you have Mccain, the maverick, Ron Paul, the libertarian, Romney, the republican from central casting, Huckabee, the social con, and Rudy Guliani, the socially liberal new yorker.  Then on the democratic side, you have 5 center left senate democrats, three of whom were from the northeast, an and Dennis Kucinich.  The single biggest policy argument in the whole election was the individual mandate, which obama ran against and then decided to pass into law anyway.  It is not the republicans that are insisting on ideological purity.
You are highly invested in telling me that it is not DANGEROUS.I have studied BRAIN DAMAGE. The change of condition brings in untold additional risks which are not accounted for and endanger the participants.AS an illustration- take an artist's mobile- many things hang in balance on the strings. If you remove one of the objects- the mobile DOES NOT WORK.It is the same with human beings and their systems.
This question really depends on where you live. In the US? Look up the laws of your state/ city/ county. Outside? Look up the laws of your country.

Yet recently released stats show that England is the joint most represented foreign nation in MLS alongside Argentina.The language barrier (namely English people not wanting to learn a second one) is the biggest factor in England not exporting talent.
They don't like us talking about them. They are aware of everything I've posted about our talks today on our sub. I took their initial response to mean they would no longer be deleting/banning our mention. I was mistaken. They will be deleting our mention, just not banning for it. I told them our goal is open conversation, not piracy. But apparently our open conversation is somehow promoting piracy. They'll delete us no matter what our name is, I'm sure of that. 
I live in a town called Oak Ridge in eastern Tennessee, and there used to be this little hole in the wall type of restaurant called "Magic Wok", but was commonly referred to as "Mrs. Betty's". The shop was owned by and elderly woman named Betty from thailand, and her husband, Jim. That's it. Just the two of them owned this place. And let me tell you, their sweet and sour chicken was like nothing I'd ever tasted in my life. It was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. But it got shut down this year and the building was demolished because they didn't meet health requirements.
for a good reason. they don't have a right to do this. it's illegal. it'd be one thing if they just didn't service the people that didn't pay them, but it's a whole different game to say "we won't serve this area because there are colored people here and colored people don't pay". don't be an idiot.

I think the first Mew song I heard was "Introducing Palace Players". I didn't enjoy it at all. For some reason I was still interested. I downloaded No More Stories... listened and still didn't really like it. I continued listening to it just because it found it to be interesting and different even though I didn't consider it good or enjoyable.Over time it grew on me. And since then Mew has become my favorite band and I love all of their music.My experience with Mew has taught me to give music I don't like at first multiple listens. It also makes me wonder what other artists I don't particularly enjoy now would grow on me if I were to listen to them more. 
I'm pretty sure the fact that you're following blogs that reblog those kinds of posts says a lot more about your own sexual preferences than anything else. 
The guy has the word "obtuse" in his name, he's probably trolling.  The funny thing is that he's being upvoted anyways because he's taken a contrary position on what most consider a pretty good deal just because it's the Harper government.

im for the idea that if I am going to buy something in game, I get to have access to it for as long as I have an account. no point in funneling money into temporary aesthetics. just put a year next to the icon and leave it be. make it legendary when the team is out of the lcs
If you plan to PvP later on, I'd suggest not upgrading anything until all these balance changes are over. Saving stones would be the smartest thing to do for now.For PvE, if you can get your hands on a Liberto (리베르토) weapon, that would give you the most damage output at this point in time. Just remember they are still changing stuff around and it could affect PvE soon as well.
The camera adds pounds for sure. I ran into Shaq at Lulu's cafe downtown when he was playing for Miami. He looked pretty fit for someone over 7 feet tall. On tv he looks like an offensive lineman.
I have a sneaking suspicion that these people are the same ones who at my office say things like "I'M NOT HERE TO BE QUESTIONED!" (when I HAVE to ask questions to figure out what they need/fix their accounts)
Exactly right. Some people believe that the world would be better if religion disappeared, but I think it would only be replaced with other misguided self-righteous beliefs like these.

I wish I could make a joke about ducks, but congrats man! How deep do you normally play until you take the money of the table and buy-in for a 100BB stack? I'm normally scared to lose too much to the larger stacks (scared money so worse decision making, more of my bankroll at risk per hand), so whenever I get over 2-4 buy-ins, I take the extra money off the table. Then again, you can't win this big either :)
If they complain about your character you aren't playing people who care. Find better players or tell them that complaining won't help you get better against sheik.

It's not a counter point... Because there is no point, you literally did not make a point. The person was not officially ruled as a murder victim. If the person is ruled a victim of a crime then the consequences will follow. Until then there is no "point" you don't know what happened, I don't know what happened, even the officer might not know what happened. Why is it so hard to wait for the medical examiner to rule on the case and then make a "point". Right now all you're doing is assuming something happened, I'm not defending anyone trust me I'll be the first one to say let's kick the bad cops out but you have no basis if there is no evidence to back up the claim you made.

Wikipedia has a great page called ["Bamboo ceiling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling) about how Asian-Americans are the model minority mentioned in the article and how it hurts them. I think this "bamboo ceiling" is the reason that Asians are not to Whites what Whites are to Blacks.
Pretty solid lines if business/school laptops good news it since its a really common model you should be able to get a (Prime) battery for 20-30 bucks and an easy return if it turns out to not be your problem.

Although his first major role was in *L.I.E.,* his breakthrough performance came via *There Will Be Blood.* He played the conniving adversary of Daniel Day Lewis incredibly well, *maybe so well* that producers/directors/casting agents keep him in mind when they come across a character that gets pummeled on screen?

Yeah I don't know if I would do it either to be honest, but I know you guys aren't exactly the richest team in the league and Semins contract is horrendous, might be the worst in the league (7 till 2029 right?).

Nah, the luck is truth. I've already gotten as almost as many Ascended drops on my new account, which is less than three months old, as I have on my first account which I've been playing on and off since beta (nearly 3 years). So yeah, I can see the proof in the drops. 
The only thing that threw me out of the story is the fact that the person scanning the ticket is not going to be one of the flight attendants on the plane.Also the fact that you can't open an emergency exit while the plane is pressurized. Other than that, I love it!!

You should really try running euphoria, the 20% haste helps immensely, especially in low gear. Yes, boomkin is a turret caster, but if you plan ahead it isn't that bad. You can save a starsurge charge to fill another gcd while moving and refresh dots mainly when moving

Every episode will go by and I will be anticipating something bigger and bigger. Eventually on episode 162 I will be let down overall but I realize a deeper meaning in the show, it's telling me to take life slow and enjoy it rather than waste time watching paint dry. I would then go and rate the show 8/10 for showing me a entire new philosophy.
I was greatly disappointed in this mechanic turning out the way it did, like so many others I wanted some consequence for our rampant violence as hunters to turn us into beasts and have it somehow tie to PvP. PvP is limited as it is. Including a covenant where the chasing of beast players, then a covenant where the beast players feast on hunters, would have made the game more interesting, give Bloodborne more replayability which is arguably one of it's weakest facets compared to the Souls franchise.Those are my thoughts on this issue.
Mine does, but we all avoid doing them whenever possible. For some reason they make us do extra paperwork after doing an RNP approach, so I'll pick the VOR or NDB over the RNP unless I really need the lower minimums (if they are lower in the first place) to get in.
The Big Island is a lot bigger and the bigger mountains create a bigger rain shadow effect, so the leeward side is a lot dryer. In addition a big chunk of the island is pretty far up in elevation where not much grows. Also,  chunks of the island are covered in geologically recent lava flows which burn down anything that was growing there. 
Are you aware that the Jewish Documentation Centre founded by Simon Wiesenthal was set up mainly with funds provided by Mossad with approval from the UNWCC (The part of the UN that deals with War Crimes)?This is an ELI5 - I kept it simple and broad for a reasonIf you have something worthwhile to add feel free. Otherwise go back to /r/circlejerk
What are you using them for?They're nice if you need something that doesn't take up much space and just need it for web browsing, watching videos, etc.
Even if the rich control politics, why does that imply that voting is worthless? I can acknowledge that the Democratic party is run by big money and still vote for them because I agree with their stance on abortion rights. 
I've seen lots of links to this site posted to FB lately.  While some of the topics are interesting, the site itself strikes me as simple click bait, at best.  Even the photos aren't original to the site, but are culled from various local Flickr accounts.  One of my fellow photographer's images were used and he was completely unaware of it.  At least, they do have the decency to credit the photographers and provide links back to the photos.
I'm in bed, then I hear a commotion outside. Ususally I'll be inexplicably living with others who I hear leave the house. I get up and follow them outside, to where it's dark, but we look up into the sky and see HUGE PLANETS and GALAXIES and all sorts of gorgeous things, but way up close, enough that we can see them at night. It's still quite scary though. Sort of like... [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBDZtt0vWD8), or something.
I strongly recommend the Canon 100-400 Mark II. It's got the right amount of flexibility and reach for nature photography. You can't go wrong renting from LensRentals. 
I have never had such a problem, even when half of the time I actually read comics. Teachers usually prefer that students who finish fast or whatever do silent stuff instead of talking with their mates (which is what would otherwise happen). 
The Haunting Of? It's not really ghosts, it's about a psychic who helps people understand a ghost experience they had, and talks to their deceased relatives and such. 
It seemed to me he was mocking milk in tea, which is commonplace in England. I was providing a second example with the iced coffee which is similar to iced tea and how iced coffee often has cream in it.
All of the Rotom Forms (other than standard rotom) have the same stats.  The difference comes in typing and their special move.  I don't see why our Gameboy possessing amigo should be any different.The reason Rotom-Wash reigns supreme is because of it has the best typing of the lot (only being weak to grass) and it has the best special move (Overheat and Leaf Storm maybe strong but they cripple the user after one use, air slash is mediocre, and Blizzard is ridiculously inaccurate.  Hydro Pump, however has a tonne of power and decent accuracy)
I don't see the benefit.One of the great things about the time it takes to train into new things is how it really teaches you how to use what you have, which benefits everyone.Being able to lose a pimp fit marauder in 1/10th the time means those people won't learn to lose a normal fit battleship more efficiently.
&gt; People using legacy hardware won't be able to run bleeding edge software after a certain window closes. They never were able to.Unless your GPU was made by Intel or AMD. In which case, you will be able to use new features for the lifetime of your device, as long as the hardware supports it.
&gt; The eight misdemeanor charges Bullock face are his first as an adult, with rioting carrying a maximum of life in prison.What the fuck!? What the why the what The Fuck! :o&gt; The Guardian, however, says that his parents believe that four to eight years is a more likely sentence. Okay, just what the fuck again.Not that I like the senseless destruction, but I have to agree with most of you here: if you are not protesting for change, if you are just on of the fucking "silent majority", then I don't really care about your property damages. So years of incarceration because you expressed your anger about a vicious cycle? Damn, that's just cold and silent oppression.
Man.  Sorry that clowns screw with you that much.  :(Its beautifuly written though, and we follow you evovlving into that.  Im quite sure that with practice, you could get song writting pretty good.
Not to be a downer but if her tongue hanging out like that is coming from a lot of panting it could be indicative of health problems.  Unless you just brought her in from playing, in which case it would be normal.

I wouldn't care because I don't get angry on the Internet with strangers over tipping. Look at your life and priorities. To me it seems quite sad that you're so angry about this. Try and grow up please. 
It's actually kinda nice seeing guys stay at home with their families, not that the bells and whistles at the draft wouldn't be cool, but it's probably a much more relaxed evening.
haha aight bro. Truce.I think ultimately were all on this sub because we want the same thing. Generally more respect for Asian males and for more Asian men to embrace masculinity.I have no doubt Asian men face varying degrees of discrimination in different facets of life. But from my perspective growing up I saw my Asian bros at every level (high school, undergrad, med school) socially years behind our white counterparts because so many of us (myself included) were raised in such a feminine manner.I still see so many Asian guys my age (30s) who are still beta and I just want to grab them, slap them around, throw a barbell onto their backs, dress them with some style and teach them not to settle down for the first boomerang vag that shows them the least bit of attention. 
Where do i start! The design of the strap was a no-goer to begin with. Always too tight or completely loose, never just right,  but then again even a dummy would have thought to make it elasticated! And then there's the upper fabric.  Just too flimsy to keep your foot planted onto the sole. At best these can be worn as slippers, but then they'll be inferior to other slippers
I feel you, as long as its not a bottleneck and the only path to something I'm ok with them. kinda like the hill in operation mortar was done. That part of the map was underplayed. it should have had a flag inside.
I interned with a Kindergarten teacher for a few months a while back. One day at recess, I heard one of the other teachers talking about how tired she was of "this retarded little shit's antics", while referring to a developmentally challenged kid who was being chased around and bullied by the other students. Being a decent person, I shot her a dirty look and chased the bullies off before pulling the kid to the side to make sure he was ok and tell him it's not his fault. I also complimented his spongebob shirt, which totally brightened him up. I got him talking about Spongebob and another kid ended up overhearing and going off to play with him and talk about spongebob together.
Lifecoach has worst nazi mods on twitch. I got timeouted for a legit question about gameplay. Thats why I am not watching him anymore - if he has idiot mods, i don't care about him.
I recently got my first job, and I am 18. So far I have only done 2 shifts and I my feet are killing me by the time each of my breaks rolls around! I work 8 1/2 hours and get 2 10 minute breaks, and a 30 minute lunch. What can I do in order to get accustomed to working? I really need some ideas, thank you Reddit
This is awesome!  Congratulations on your keto success, and you're upcoming nuptials!  Make sure to post some pictures.  Especially one of your reaction to the bride, you'll get so many upvotes.I'm getting married in three months and I'm going hard in the paint for the same reason you did!
I bought a 2000 and used it for a while, the extra battery life was nice but I ended up going back to the 1000, mainly because it felt far better to hold and use for a long period of time. Build quality is also a lot more solid and I like the OLED screen more than the LCD screen.I liked both the 1000 and 2000, but I went back to the first purely out of personal preference.
I drink it the same way.  Shake it up with cold water and drink it right away.  I've never waited because a slimy consistency would really put me off of it.
I still wouldn't  buy an iStick50. Eleaf has still not officially admitted to anything.  These need to be recalled from the manufacturer.  If this vape store is still selling them, then is hasn't been handled
Warspite is one of my favourite ships, and I was really excited to get it. I was willing to overlook a lot of flaws but a 16.3km range for the main guns on a tier VI BB is just not acceptable. Especially considering that historically, the modernised Queen Elizabeth class battleships (which includes Warspite of course) had the elevation of their main armament increased to 30 degrees for a max range of 29.5km. On top of that, there is Warspite's feat during the Battle of  Calabria where she hit Giulio Cesare at roughly 24km.I am sure most of you are already aware of this info but I just wanted to vent my disappointment I guess...
Would it be acceptable or frowned upon if I only kept an assault frigate/interceptor, a probing ship, and a battlecruiser in the null sec station? I imagine that's all I would really need to do what I plan on.
How is it beautiful? It's not even right. According to the "axis", the red and blue aren't even in the right spot. Not that the axis makes sense in the first place.

Thank you so much for this comment! This is exactly what I'm going through right now! It's nice to know that I'm not just trying to fool myself, or, at the very least, that I'm not alone in my attractions! XD
Came here to read posts from black people complaining about how "hard" they have it.  Was not disappointed.  Lol.There is no such thing as "white priviledge".  If youre having a hard time, its probably because youre acting like a thug.  Black people who act like normal human beings do just fine.  But then the homeboys call them "Uncle Tom" and other dumb shit, for not being "black" enough.  Dumb logic, but what more can you expect from a hoodrat?  Later, fellas.  Off to go riot and stuff.  Just kidding.  I have to work in the morning.
Massive tax rates? Note no figures quoted here.We stopped violence in Ireland and UK by giving IRA members a democratic alternative instead of criminalising them. Same with ANC. Immigration has had a net benefit to our economy. What resources would we be talking about being stretched? Immigrants come in paying tax and creating jobs, so we build houses and schools, no?Many things are expensive and not necessary. Not an excuse to not have something.Not convinced it's a deterrent *at all*. It's the 21st Century, and we're facing challenges that nukes are no good for. In these circumstances, it's "expensive and not necessary."
I was wagging my tail before it was coolRemember air bud? of course you do you poser. He and I were friends on friendster before you were born.Facebook? more like wannabebook.Hey you like my owner? He is a lumbersexual.
Haha, that sounds like a much funnier scenario (from an outside perspective). Anyone that heads toward a bounty should anticipate a hostile response, though...
Stores do prepare for the influx of burners. If you can, try to get there early in the morning as the stock people might not be able to keep up throughout the day. Go for a big name like Walmart or Trader Joes and you should be set, especially on Friday. 
Post pics of how you have it wired up it will help.  Are you using a cherry style switch it has 3 prongs I would check you have it wired correctly.  It has a normal open and Normal closed so if you have it wired wrong it would be in a constant open and only close when pressed you would just have to switch it.     But to be able to be sure on anything else would need to see what kind of buttons you have it wired too and how.   See this wiring diagram http://www.koenigs.dk/mame/eng/microswitch.PNG  
A dramatic and stylish interpretation for #13. It would be interesting to have the Rani or Romana or the Doctor's daughter come back. Or a non-Doctor non-Missy female time traveller. And I like Missy as the Master regenerated. But I am undecided about a female Doctor though, cause it can change a formula that works, if poorly done.In the meantime, here is a YouTube fan film with a female Doctor. It's called The Ginger Chronicles, E01: A Dame to Kill.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw5d3E8velc
You were not arrested. If you stub your little toe and I need to call an ambulance for you, I still need your id and all the info "for the report." It's just a report that this happened on this date and time. It's both because we care about you, and because it needs to be documented so the department can't be found negligent for inaction. I hope you are getting the help you need and feel better :)
I'd rather have it be called a legal Union or legal matrimony and they just give them the same rights, it removes a lot of the religious debate if you just done call it a marriage and say you're recognizing them as loving each other and they depend on each other, therefore should receive benefits as others who love and depend on each other do
It is a bit distressing to me that how you describe liberals is exactly how I describe the far right.  What a terrifying thought that one or both of us could be so mislead.  So it goes... self serving politicians and authority figures casting us against each other.  Dan Halen/Master Shake 2016!
[Check here to see what your state's rules are.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/347kp9/you_want_sanders_but_will_you_be_able_to_vote_for/) I just moved to NC and am unaffiliated but luckily I can vote in the primary.
I really like the Daretti deck. I even liked it straight out of the box, but I've made some alterations to it that make the value snowball engine so good that *even Tibalt is really good in the deck*. The other day I had out Tibalt, Daretti and Ugin, with the Chain Veil. It was as disgustingly fun as it sounds :D
&gt;but i would be questioning management if this is actually happeningAgree 100%. Sounds like somebody misinterpreted something (hence the "not specified" stuff) or is seriously exaggerating / trying to one up ("ah man I can't water my lawns every other day", "oh yeah, i can't even shower certain mornings!")
He will probably bench him all the time to prove to the world that he doesn't care for a players status or history. He might also just show his balls again to get his point across.
Leonard Williams, lifelong Raiders fan and #1 guy on everybodys board is probably confused as hell right now. Washington could trade down or just grab the next Richard Seymour...

Ah idk how to help you then because that's how I write 100% of my jokes. Maybe look for weird words? I remember Mitch Hedburg's joke "I have a king size bed, I don't know any kings but if one slept over he would be comfortable". If you are having a mental block maybe try to look for adjectives to things like that? Like "dry sex",...idk I can't think of another adjective noun pair. Also, /r/jokedaily is great. 
Yep.  Sadly, the whole "in-group vs. out-group/us vs. them/minority vs. majority" thing is basic human psychology.  It has happened everywhere to everyone since the beginning of civilization.
Riot specifically stated that the first batch will be money only to test the waters. There is a mighty good chance of a chroma or two being worked into the mastery system, or even other rewards for events or something special now that they're an option in general.Of course that doesn't mean there wont be more that'll be available for purchase, of course..Rp, or ip.

I wouldn't have even considered going on a date with someone during exams. I'd probably also deactivate, because it's tempting to check OKC as a study break.
&gt; It is obvious that almost all the players on here are familiar with actives and are not ashamed about it, but nonetheless I find the discretion and restraint exercised on this sub to be commendable.You won't find any first time trip reports or 'look at my first gram' posts here, we've all been there and done that - er, most of us.

Senderick Marks is an elite dt though.  The jags have too many interior guys and not enough outside guys.  Well, now they've solved that problem somewhat at least.
If they're selling Office Pro Plus, that's volume license only, so it's not legit. If they're selling one pirated thing, chances are the rest of what they're selling is pirated as well. If you don't receive a certificate of authenticity with your purchase from them, it's probably safe to assume your product is not legit and will be deactivated.
can you please refrain from giving idiotic advice. this is a serious problem with the game. it isn't my fault you play with blinders on. the shotgun is a cancer plaguing survival and i am not the only one who feels this way. 
Extremely flawed.  Small, meticulously-drawn but shitty circles score *very* high.  Large, much more accurate ones do not.  I don't know what this is measuring, but accuracy isn't it.
The episode is going to jump 9 months ahead and we're going to end the episode with the camera panning to Meredith in a hospital bed with a baby. Or maybe we see a chair from the back and pan to Meredith's face and you hear a gush of water and she yells it's time. Camera pans out to show her baby bumpEdit: eh, somewhat got it
Voting: No, I think you're right that non-citizens can't vote.    Donating:     &gt;An immigrant may make a contribution if he or she has a "green card" indicating his or her lawful admittance for permanent residence in the United States.    But my understanding is that Canadian citizens *do not need* a green card to enter or reside in the US.  Is that correct?  If so you should contact the FEC and ask them directly.
She was implying that he may have some sort of mental disability. Maybe he did, maybe someone he knew well did, either way he was pissed enough to just leave. The teacher probably realized 1) Exactly what she had just said to the student 2) that she could probably be fired or sued or some shit like that
What I reccomend is accessing your consoles settings and go to the part where you can edit the Mac address , then use the max address of your phone or computer there. Usually these sorts of things are tied to a devices Mac address which when you log in / accept like at a hotel it allows your Mac address to use the network So just go to settings--&gt; network setrings--&gt; advanced settings and take a look at your laptops Mac address to know what to use ! 
&gt; Stuff more serious than breaking a car window. To be fair, it _was_ a cop's car window. That's the criminal equivalent of killing a dozen thugs, maybe more./s
I saw him just last year, like a couple of days after he was kicked out of STP. He played some STP classics, a few of his own songs, left the stage, came back for an encore, played more STP then laid on the ground for about 5 minutes while the band jammed behind him. It was a pretty awesome show.
Most of the time they are fantastic. I just wish I had those collars from Up! So I could have them tell me what's going through their crazy little brains
Have friends who are in long-term poly amorous relationships, although I agree it isn't for anyone (I'm pretty sure I would be too jealous).  I made an assumption this was a situation where wife &amp; gf weren't aware of each other....which would be much more complicated.
Psychology is one of the divisions of the [National Academy of Sciences.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences) I'm not really sure how it can qualify *more* as the "S" in STEM. 
I was on a field trip with my school, as a student not a teacher, and I overheard two English teachers, both girls, talking about a classmate of mine. They said her feet were so big they looked like clown shoes, then giggled like they were in mean girls. It was hilarious.
I can't wait to see Shazier be let loose. I could deal without Mike Adams though, actually met him when I was going to OSU and dude was a giant asshole. 
You can only cheese one FeB at a time. FeB 5 can only keep the rank from 4. 6 relies on your rank from 5, which you didn't play... You just used your rank from 4 to buy stuff as 5 was starting. 
Alright then, compare it to a child who habitually nosepicks in class, that's a bad habit if ever there was one. A teacher still shouldn't shame them about it, especially in front of the class. It's just not professional. They should tell the student not to do it, and if they persist, pull them aside after class, or maybe contact their parents about it. I just don't believe shaming is the answer when it comes to teaching.
It's a personal preference. My small town has some pretty amazing municipal water, but nothing beats a good old well — in my opinion. I can't find any bottled stuff that doesn't taste like plastic and chemicals.
Yeah, I walk dogs at the local Humane Society, I work at a weekly soup kitchen, and I donate food and clothing to the local homeless shelters.  I'd highly recommend all of the above.
You get people annoyed at others bringing up gear in the context of celebrities because the majority of the time, the physique in question is obtainable naturally (just maybe not in the same time frame). Bringing up gear gives people an easy way to tell themselves "nah it's impossible I can't do it" and frankly hearing people whine and sell themselves short and give up before they even started at the mere mention of having to work hard gets irritating.
How about "killing shots will detonate your target and chain explosions with enemies in a close proximity"? Meaning killing a target will cause enemies around that enemy to have their own individual explosions.
Ugh deluxe dining plan. Went with the shitlady and her parents, I don't think I've ever eaten so much dessert in my life. Not that I'm a food snob, I just legit don't have a sweet tooth. Every lunch and dinner I'd get a $5 hunk of cake or something that I'd have to take a few bites of to be polite, since we'd already paid for it. 
IMO the problem is Valve have to find a way to automate the patch updates into that part of the clients library. Judging from the YouTube videos in client - I'd say each spell description on every hero was written up and put together individually by hand. To update every hero's 4 spells and aghs for every patch is just an absurd amount of work. I'm hoping they will find a way to implement a way for the patch notes to update the library in source 2. I also think we're not quite able to rely on pre-recorded videos to showcase each and every spell and they need to scrap that as a feature.
When I worked at a restaurant in college, they were pretty stringent about meat and health standards, mostly because they had had a few deaths, one of which wasn't really anyone's fault.
It's good for the money. That's not to say that it's a bad guitar, but it has it's limitations. Go play it and see for yourself. If it sounds good, and it's affordable, go for it. A guitar doesn't make a sound unless you decide to plug it in and play it.
yeah, i read that it's ps plus only, so that kind of sucks. ill get the demo and see. sounds kind of like gta online as far as earning stuff as you go.
I agree.  Same with cyber.  On the other hand...4 failed PT tests?  The test isn't that hard.  I'm usually on the other side of this argument, and I'm usually preaching about how we put too much emphasis on the PT test...but 4 failures?  For situps?
 First off - amazing give away.My number: 898My song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoJSDi6o0mA364 Days by Murder City DevilsMy favorite "christmas" song just due to the narrative of the song. I'd guess not a ton of people know this song...but I could be wrong.Luck to who ever wins!
Max does a purchase quota where there is a goal amount of shirts that have to be sold in order for them to be shipped out. https://www.bonfirefunds.com/support-the-collective-join-the-collective-3 It's not active right now though. 
For those frustrated at the amount of time between picks even when a team turns there's in quickly: This is a TV show just as much as it is an NFL draft. There's time to fill. I don't like it either, but when you remember that this is a show, it quells the frustration. 
&gt;Not to mention the Dragon Balls actually had an intricate roll to play in the whole thing. Vegeta goes to Earth hunting them then they go to Namek hunting them. Buu and Cell were just like oh hey we are here. The Dragon Balls don't really matter outside of undoing everything both of them did.This. Just the multiple sides vying for the dragon balls on Namek was so great. I love it when they're more involved with the storyline as well. 
Although you've phrased it as a joke, the logical fallacy here is really just an [appeal to tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) or as we would call it on reddit, a post worthy of /r/lewronggeneration.Claiming that something is "better" or "more natural" just because it's older doesn't make sense.

It's not rambling, or incoherent, or irrational. I valuate the company at $1. And I would delete it off the face of the internet. It's an anomaly how this site lost money annually and even performed on a public stock market. It's even more of anomaly that the public allowed the bastardization of the "#" number sign to be used in modern lexicon. It took 8 years for it to stick so my guess is we were force fed this one. By the way... "awarded no point" - I am not seeking your approval. At any level. I am merely speaking the truth about that so-called company. 
brass eyelets are sweet! There's 9 pair here, I kind of wish there were one or 2 more but still. I was also thinking these would look better as cap toe but they came out looking good.
Its a inconsequential "low bar measure" It doesn't need to pass any such test, just like a movie that doesn't pass the "/u/bardofsound dog test" (does the film contain someone patting a dog three times?) No. ("the film can't even pass the dog test") The test reduces far more complex issues to a way to simple metric and so loses all value. 
This. Hopefully this codex means my SoB will rise stronger than ever! Buut...they are SoB so I doubt it. But o can hope...like I have been the past 7 or so years
People also used to think the sun orbited the earth. Popular consensus doesn't make it correct.I also didn't claim it didn't impair driving. I was saying everything I read has said there's no true evidence that difinitively says it does or doesn't affect driving skill. Most sources say it's due to everyone reacting differently to the chemical. One person can be fine, another won't.
Ugh... still, it's not like Cooper is a terrible pick.EDIT: Initial *slight* disappointment has worn off and I'm definitely feeling this pick more. AC/DC baby!
I've always liked Lucian, but I didn't like either of his skins, so I'm definitely gonna buy his chromas. I don't like any of the other chromas enough to justify buying them though.
I tried but the valet always looks at me funny and asks me to leave when i tell them to put a static band on... then again he probably was just used to parking cars at the restaurant he was in front of... nah that can't be it.
It is execution if you are being arrested for a crime you have not yet been convicted of by a jury. A cop just suspects you're guilty and causes your death. Was that friend of your family's death an accident? Maybe. But I would feel a whole lot better about that circumstance if I knew there was an independent body of individuals that looked into it and said, "Yep, everything looks above board here. There was no falsified documents, no misleading statements." etc, etc. How many times have we found out later that police misspoke or outright lied on their reports (I mean, we often say eyewitness testimony is unreliable and then somehow we buy into police testimony as gospel for some reason)? I really worry that police departments are only accountable to themselves. As they say, "absolute power corrupts absolutely."
School was too small for a yearbook haha, but this is a picture of her from back in the day. Hope the link works, I haven't uploaded anything before.http://imgur.com/hBPRSbu.jpg
&gt; Except that there's very few things in this world that are 100% always true and always will be.People like you need to suffer greatly for this belief. The vast majority of "things" absolutely are 100% always true. Everything you had for lunch was metabolized and it will not alter with time. You can dress up your memories all you like, but if you ate your glyphosate tab this morning the little fucker will be in your GI cancering up your precious colon. The chemical will be bonding to the walls of your intestines, bio-accumulating in your thyroid, blocking your serotonin reuptake or whatever shit thing it is that chemical does, and it will not stop doing it no matter how many Monsanto-funded studies decrying its' danger are released.
Personally, I'd like to see anyone that is confirmed to be cheating on a multiplayer Steam game get their *entire Steam account* banned. Everything. All of their games.
1. At this time during 1992 Bill Clinton was just as (relatively) unknown2. Two days ago he visited Iowa on the same day that Hillary did, and was received significantly better, as he was able to appeal to blue collar workers and veterans on his visit. Today he was at the Vietnam War memorial in D.C, shaking hands and talking with Veterans and Vietnamese-Americans. Also, he is VERY well known in political circles. Webb was considered as running mate for Obama in 2008.3. I'm still researching this, but the articles I'm reading seem to suggest that he was growing disillusioned with how far left the Democrats were going in preparation for 2012. Also, he didn't retire, he just didn't run for re-election, a common practice among politicians. 
Once the Surface Mini idea was scrapped, my instant thought was maybe they were just going to add a dialer to it and turn it into a phone. Now with Continuum in full swing, we may very well get a phone/tablet/laptop capable device soon enough
I laughed when I saw that. Wouldn't that be worse than any arty out there?with .9 you'd likely be better off just staying in spawn and firing randomly.
**You gotta choose the Winnipeg Jets.**We are a young, up and coming team that plays the exact kind of hockey you are looking for. We are known league wide for it and we literally have the BEST fans.[Exhibit A: *Winnipeg fans cheering for their team for 2 straight minutes during the commercial break when the team was about to be swept*](http://www.reddit.com/tb/33pzdq)Exhibit B: [*Byfuglien Doin' Thangs*](https://gfycat.com/KlutzyShockedHectorsdolphin)[And more thangs](http://gfycat.com/OptimalCreepyDrongo)
No.  Against OLCC regulations.  There are efforts in the capitol to change this that are ongoing.  Call your favorite state Representative and beg them. It probably will happen soon. Cannabis too. Cigarettes are however legal to have delivered. 
Gait belt = belt used by PT's around patients for something to hold on to when walking during rehab.AD = shorthand for Assistive device in this instance aka a walker-------Or "PT's break your hip, your heart and give a RW for the walk of shame" (RW = Rolling Walker)"*BLANK* Miles down?

Not only that but I love how Hunt conveniently joins and leaves the military at will. Edit: Did Kepner somehow go through Officer Basic Course and her advance school and I missed it or something?? 
Without a landline, they will also need to sign up with their electricity provider to ensure they have uninterupted power or invest in a UPS. While I realise that in time there won't be copper anymore things are still new and it isn't affordable at the moment.  These are people on low cost housing. Their monthly bill goes up to $70 per month and they are forced to subscribe to a service they don't need/use.
I think the whole your money going to a business man is more for big label artists like himself, and in that case pretty much everyone is falling in love, talking about, and listening to these artist anyway. 
The other person would have said the same thing if they were not allowed to buy something for sale in the store. If the person can't be reasonable about something they agreed to, the store is better off without them as a "customer" anyway. 
My comments aren't regarding BYOD. You can't preload Store apps on company images. That means every time you reimage a computer, the next user has to go through the steps of downloading and setting up the Store apps. Microsoft is always "fixing the problem", but the problem is that they always take years to do it. And by then they realize the ideas they had weren't effective and scrap the entire thing.Edit: I should mention that there isn't any "using one that is pre-configured" either. All store apps are local to the user account, not the computer. If New Student uses Alumni's Surface tablet, the apps that Alumni used on their account will not be on New Student's account. Only the pre-packaged apps or side loaded LOB apps will show up. 
My only problem is when someone gets downvoted and there's no counter-comment, or if they're just freaking saying their opinion.I pretty much never downvote unless it's legit a troll comment or the spread of false information because I believe if someone is honestly "asking a stupid question" or saying their opinion (like "I think NME will do good.") they can just get upvoted or sit at "one karma".Downvoting them just makes no sense because they're just communicating.
Yeah I'm not a teacher, but fuck youWhile doing the mile run in personal fitness class our teacher said "Seth, come on you fat fuck! At least jog!" He was also the women's volleyball coach and was later fired for saying something to the effect of "shove the volleyballs up your cunts".
If you can afford a bit more, they have 7GB option for $55, same unlimited calls &amp; texts as the $45 one. Not sure though, if the same discount for the first month applies. I haven't had any issues with rounding up sub-MB usage to the nearest MB as /u/GetUpMorningMVFC has suggested, and I have a bunch of small connections (mainly SSH) open nearly constantly, plus the usual plethora of push notifications (TextSecure mainly). Most of my usage comes from music streaming, but I've yet to use more than 4GB in a month.
I read a *lot* of M/M romance these days, and most of my favorite authors, such as Heidi Cullinan, Amy Lane, Eli Easton, and Ryan Loveless are women. That said, there are some great guys writing in the genre too, Damon Suede, Brad Bonney, and B.G. Thomas come quickly to mind for starters.

Sorry I cut off the gates suddenly, I needed to add the other person in the last group. (I assume you were trying to get in? Someone was as one of the sellers was leaving.) Ready for you now. :)
Love it. People say it's force drama and cheesy comedy but hell I love it. It's in my Top5 of the season so far after episode 4 cliffhanger I cannot wait til Saturday 
I know rape is terrible and it's a fairly controversial topic but...this is a video game. If a kid learns to rape someone from seeing this in the game, literally find those kids parents and shit on their face while also calling them "dumb shits". Plus, it's GTA V and if you've played it,you may have  already seen some occurrences of rape in the game. Just please don't make this a whole ordeal because rape in a video game is widely different from real-life rape.
Unless a better candidate pops up, probably. I'd pick Hillary over any GOP candidate. I've been holding a grudge since '08 SO NOW'S MY CHANCE. But being serious, I really want to hear more about her economic agenda and want her detailed stance on fiscal policy.
As an incredible underdog, he needs to win Iowa and/or New Hampshire to keep his campaign going. If he has poor showings in the first 4 primaries, he'll be done well before Super Tuesday.
They had evidence in hand... kind of hard to ignore that.... If it were only hearsay, perhaps... but having a note in X teachers handwriting saying "hey check out the ass on suzie today!" is a bit different.   specifically if you can get multiple people to collaborate the story with evidence, in all but the most backward good ol boy system the teacher would be kind of screwed.
Aw, I love Solas and I love his romance. If you think about it no Bioware romance really adds anything to the game aside from the romance itself. There is a whole massive world of difference between friend Solas and romance Solas. Yeah, maybe the different is just a few cutscenes, but isn't that the meat of all the romances? The really fun part is what you make up in your head in between the cutscenes :) I just find the whole character of Solas romantic in a poetic sense, regardless of whether the player character engages in a relationship with him or not. I certainly think his is the best romance in Inquisition, just like I think Zevran is the best romance in Origins, and it's fine if you disagree but I wouldn't discourage someone from romancing a certain character for the first time and discovering for themselves. 
I think he deserved more first place votes than Mirotic. I would have had it Wiggins, Payton, Mirotic, Noel. Idk. Kinda like when last year ppl were saying "MCW is the rookie of the year, but Trey Burke will be a better player". That remains to be seen, but I believe Payton will be a much better player than Mirotic.
I'd suggest that you call advising at your faculty and check with them. Are you able to take summer courses to complete enough credits for promotion before September? I don't know if this helps but I'm transferring out of Science for Geography (Environment and Sustainability) and I know that for Arts, they'd promote you "technically"  (ie update your file on the system) once you've finished enough credits after the first term, midway in the academic year. 
I got mentioned on an SMH article about Thy Art Is Murder without knowing haha, they used my FB comment. Not huge in the scheme of things but I sure was flattered!
Except at the point people have beads *and* magi's your team is also moving as a unit and can pop beads, and set up residual damage so that you can finish a target with or without your ult. I hope this isn't going to end up going in some pointless circle.
Also incorrect. Nothing ever stops evolving, their body shape may be similar but things like their DNA becoming more efficient at encoding it, genetic drift of non-expressed alleles, and the structure of soft tissues continues to change.
If by that you mean like 63% in a mode where people aren't trying so they eat an inordinate number of skill shots, then you would be correct. A vast majority of the time the tanks will far outscale the range in ARAM, it just no longer takes much skill to do so

Am I the only one who used Android keyboard and got so fucking frustrated that the correct word is always located directly under the little cursor pin?  If it's a short word you can't select it because you only grab the pin.so. frustrating.
Giants fans... Kevin white is probably gonna be available at number 9. Of the teams ahead of us, the Skins, Jets, and Falcons are almost definitely not taking a receiver. Chicago is the only team who might take White.
Maybe work on your aim and use the tactics/play styles you used to.Play a few deathmatches or a few comp games to get back in your rhythm and try to do what you did before. Maybe you just need to relearn everything and rank up from the bottom again? I don't know your situation better than you, but that is what people I know did. 
That would be cool to put together. I just felt like known brands might all have something exclusive about them that others don't. Hard to explain in text but you know what I mean?
Have you tried Little List? I used the baby registry part of the site and really liked it. I don't know about the rest of the site, but it's worth a look

Why are you guys talking about this like it's theoretical? Microsoft explicitly said they're doing this and there are code samples in the video. Watch the video from 1:15 onward.
Yep - love it.  I use it for work process notes.  The paper is a lot more absorbent than Rhodia but I think actually prefer it because of that - Rhodia can be a bit too slick and smear-prone.

Why are the Raiders unhappy with an elite WR talent to pair with their up and coming QB? I know Leonard is a fan favorite, loves Oakland and is a great talent, but Cooper is amazing and has the potential to be a great duo with Carr.
Thanks for the great feedback! As I said, Zamplebox is a great idea, but something is VERY wrong behind their doors. This makes total sense! Not only were there shortcomings with the service and promptness, but the juice felt so low end I was kind of offended. They did refund me 50% and sent me a free Atlantis tank, but I cancelled as they gave me the worst first impression possible!

I kinda feel like it's an act. Maybe it's not. Maybe it's a tiring act to some. I personally hold the view that it's kind of a running joke and that it's neither funny nor annoying
I don't think you have enough experience at enterprise scale. In the 90s at AOL they had on the order of 1000 FTP servers. Do you know what the alarm threshold was for an alert at the NOC?  30% unavailable. Because it was cheap hardware with rotational disks and each data center had a full time person who's job was to reboot the server, replace the drive, reconnect the motherboard, etc. If a machine stops sending data the first action of the monitoring software should be to replace if not alarm. That's what the phrase don't hug your server means. 
You have to type the keyword, then tab, which will put it into kiranico's search mode. It should look [something like this](http://k.mhquestboard.com/kiranicomh4u/public/chrome-omnibox.png) after you hit tab.
Yeah idk, everyone at my school hates and looks down on flip cup. Everytime it's suggested people call the person a pussy or something lol... I'm pretty indifferent about it.
I see these dipshits get into bmx accidents all the time for one of two reasons, sometimes both: 1. No brakes and 2. Texting while riding. One kid was riding his skateboard, staring at both me and his phone (I ride a racing bike), flew head over heels into a curb, got up and just kept texting.
Cause he has NO eye for talent, he's completely destroying our roster. Also, I hate the offense he runs, it's all a gimmick. Either we get a TD or we go 3 and out, but mostly just go 3 and out and take 30 seconds off the clockEDIT: He came, he destroyed, he went back to college. Mark my words, he'll be so hated in Philadelphia in 2 years he'll have a bounty on his head
Lord Sebastian Coe, Sir Robin Wales, Jo Pavey and Brendan Foster. Wedding = House of Commons CryptDamn, too late by the looks of it. Got the great north run logo, from there it wasn't too hard.
&gt;It was a fun flick that my friends and I enjoyed. Take my master and honourbale Christopher Nolan's word ["My films are always held to a weirdly high standard for those issues that isn’t applied to everybody else’s films—which I’m fine with."](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/10/christopher-nolan-uncut-on-interstellar-ben-affleck-s-batman-and-the-future-of-mankind.html). Same thing with Will Smith, for certain actors/actresses and directors people have do have weird high-standard.
You can replace Kiora's Follower with [[Aphetto Alchemist]]. The combo then works with an artifact (Gilded Lotus, Mana Vault, Simic Signet, [[Seat of the Synod]], etc.) or creature (Birds of Paradise, Bloom Tender, etc) that generates mana. 
You left out the pertinent part: &gt;Rotten Tomatoes awards the Certified Fresh accolade to theatrical releases reviewed by 40 or more critics (including 5 Top Critics) with a steady score of 75% or higher on the Tomatometer. **A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%.**
Everything you say makes sense! I see where you're coming from. Thanks for your input :) And you're right, I've never seen porn on our history before so I think he may have just forgotten haha. Normally he's pretty keen on not revealing his porn proclivities to me. 
But they *can* turn out this way. Even with no history of mental illness in the family. Kids are a lottery, and this is another example of what you can end up with.
Just to be clear, from what you are saying there aren't two card *types*, there is 1 card type with 2 cards built from each one.other than that, the other post here sums up what you can do about it nicely.
CongratsI remember being so excited by that trailer they put out for Brink. And then it seemed thoroughly mediocre on release. Would you recommend it as anything other than an easy Plat? 
Everyone here is suggesting being very direct, which is good advice I think. Maybe talk a bit first though? Marching up to a guy with no conversation and asking for his number will work with some guys, but it may also elicit and awkward/nervous laugh and that doesn't feel very good.

This was my first ever metalcore album i ever listened to, I was 10 or 11 at the time it was released and i listened to it non-stop till i discovered theyre older stuff right before Sempiternal dropped and then i was hooked. Like most people say, Suicide Season is the best album though.
Some teams we built today on IRC of those leads https://www.padherder.com/user/Eiam8821/teams/Asked shiny to do card analysis on them this time around since there isn't a lot of discussion.If you take their JP names and search google you can see some teams on YouTube as well.There is one guy on this sub that runs Ilm for descends and seems to be doing well
I agree with this, my mmr and rank look like shit. but it has not to do with my skill. You cannot carry in this game, and i get grouped with rank 40-50 people almost every game. So i lose sooo much when there is nothing i can do about it. So yes i am looking for skilled people to group with and make a  team.  add epictankz#2810
Some people like that whole "pocket dump / EDC" thing. There are times I question of people ACTUALLY carry all that crap, or if it's just for pictures. But really, that's about as far as it goes when I stumble upon a picture someone posts. Other than that, I don't really concern myself too much with what other people do.
A good rule of thumb to go over as well is most people's skype profile's contain personal information. Please go over your skype profile and private/remove any personal information you dont want to be public before joining something like this.

Just out of co-incidence - you have the same set of Rankings as me. I own a Clipper too, I'm allied with the empire  and I have ~the same amount of credits. I assume therefore, that you are one of the good guys (like me)
That strikes me as a non-sequitur. Let's assume that film makers are producing what their audiences want and that only a tiny majority care about the forms of male-centricness that the Bechdel test flags in film. So what? What changes? How does that affect anything that I've said or the Bechdel test's illustration of this imbalance?The premise that film is meeting popular demand seems irrelevant to the observation that gendered representations in film are unbalanced.
Mianite is the god of order, and he believes that by killing his siblings that there will be no more religious based wars but it doesn't work. So he just has an interesting perspective on things....
What a weird question, not really sure what you are expecting. Homeless people think I'm an MD and walk up to me like they got an appointment while I'm eating lunch. To nurses and doctors you're just the guy who moves people around for them, but if you give respect and have a good attitude you get it back in return. 
They can have this idea for free.It's called the "wankey poo monster". It sits, shivering, disturbed by the presence of children. Parents hate it because it's name encompasses all they did but dare not think &amp; by which paranoia they are controlled.
&gt;I'm considering approaching some of the bigger accounts and just saying, hey go ahead and use my music if you want but tag me please.I think that's completely reasonable, Ian. You are the soundtrack for their vine, so that's the least they can do for you. 
Do you prefer jasmine to basmati?  I have both but used basmati.  I had never made rice before, so I'm curious to hear what your thoughts on rice varieties are.
Hah! That's why I was asking! I always imagine stories to the music I'm listening to. I'm creative and I daydream 60% of every day, so I'm pretty good at it. When I workout it's all crazy hardcore action and over-the-top drama going on in my brain. It's so fun!

Strictly wet food to start. I have her on wet food that is small pieces in mostly liquid. She was eating well at the vet, so if she stops eating here we will have to have her get injections to make her eat. I also got a cat water fountain, which should help some.
It's not so much "different philosophies." As /u/treetrouble pointed out, Penn Station is owned by Amtrak. Amtrak is in a nearly impossible situation controlled by Congress. I think they just don't have the financial freedom to invest and renovate. 
Yep, that's the thing with chaos. It was god damn time EU scene experience it first hand. Just like NA with LMQ last year.Because, seriously, when that shit happen for you for the first time at world when you play a chineese team, that's not really the good moment to learn how to deal with it.
The US has to be the most two faced country on the planet. On one side they send warships literally to the other side of the planet to seize Iranian ships. Then they send warships to prevent Iran doing the same to a third party. Mind you outside Iran's own coast. I wonder if the US would be happy about China escorting their commercial ships with destroyers and carriers along the US coast.
So you like "on-disc" DLC then? You are entitled to your own opinion, but on-disc DLC benefits you, the consumer, in no way. With Day 1 DLC it's possible that it wasn't ready when the game went gold, so it's delivered in the form of a day 1 download. This way, the DLC is still technically Day 1 DLC, but it wasn't content that was cut from the base game to serve as a pre-order incentive.But on-disc DLC is exactly that. It's on the disc, so it was ready when the rest of the game went gold. For the lack of a better term, that's holding content hostage.
Civ got old fast. This sounds more like you simply have a preference for Civ. Which is fine, but civ isn't free of fake depth and plenty of less popular games are not killed by their complexity. Dominions3/4 has perhaps the most complexity of any game and yet it still has tons of vocal long term fans who even use mods to make the game MORE complex.
Yes it would, this is the quick and easy solution.  There are online calculators to help you pick the resistor values(for an input, higher is better, 10k or 100k ohms should work).  Shoot for 5v at the input when the signal is 14v.   The brake signal will be noisy so you'll probably want to use some software to debounce it.  There are some good articles on Adafruit and Arduino.CC about how to do this. 
It should slowly transition from one color to another. If i remember correctly spectral spectrum is red to yellow on red team and blue to white on blu team
Because I have guns lying around waiting to be used, and as a business/ home owner and under castle law. Come fuck with my property or family I have every right to kill you..
Yeah my heart rate was 121 up until they announced it and I think all the build up made it a huge let down when we didn't get him.I was one of the people saying I don't think they should trade the farm for him but man I want a QB I can believe in
I guarantee thousands of people drive stoned everyday, if it was such a danger to society why don't we see dui death rates from weed like we do with alcohol?? Accidents from being high on weed are either never reported because we don't even have statistics for them, or maybe, just maybe, smoking weed isn't the same and drinking and driving. Which do you think is the more logical conclusion? That there's some global conspiracy to ignore high DUI statistics or weed smoking drivers aren't as dangerous as you think...Driving while stupid is even more dangerous yet you do it everyday :p
&gt; Is it not strange that we want Democracy everywhere except the workplace?You have to understand ... we have a republic.  Many of us are opposed to the idea of a direct democracy.  We have a representative one.And no ... we do not like government in the workplace.  Merging the state and industry is a disastrous idea.
I work occasionally with teachers in the inner city, some of the things they say are atrocious. Middle School referring to a student "Little hoodrats will never learn this kind of stuff"3rd grade "I guess she'll have to learn how to start working boys for money because she's not getting math"High School "He's a fucking idiot who will never do anything or be anything except for a newspaper headline"I swear **some** people get into it just for achance to re live their failed school experience and boss people around. I will say that teachers are also some of the most amazing inspiring people I've ever met and visiting schools is often the highlight of my month. 
Looks like it's seen some pretty heavy use!...As an aside, I found out as a child after tearing one apart (for science!) that the figures in there are really rather small. I was amazed at just how much the bouncy-material magnifies it. I've still got that tiny Vaporeon... somewhere...
here's the video : https://youtu.be/LhNdbipWPFYpretty nasty stuff, I'm amazed that he can recover from that with proper care.   I was positive that it was just a matter of time before he would die.   But I guess others have survived worse.
"Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike."  "...It hurts, ...It hurts..."  "It's not right... not right... not right..."  You cannot grasp the true form of Fazbear.  
Good advice - yeah, same thing happened, more or less, on our family.  Cut out the crazy abusive people.They are of course entitled to their narrow little lives.  Annie sounds like a strong person, but one who needs the support of her SO (as we all do).Oh, and btw, if you're dealing with Bible-believing Christians or the equivalent "all sins are equal in the eyes of the Lord," hence the equating of infidelity and anything else.  This can be a doctrine that underpins tolerance and forgiveness if you read it one way - but usually, it's used just as you saw it used (to equate all "sins" with each other).
Er no. 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, which hasn't been calculated yet. It could be about life but like I said, I don't know.  42 however is not the answer to life or the ultimate answer to every question.  Do you even hitchhike?
I think coffee addiction is absolutely horrible. My extensive experience with it was it made me kind of crazy, angry, and unable to experience deep and happy psychedelic places. You're not happy when you're addicted to coffee in particular; tea is a little different. But because it's so accepted in society, few people even realize it. I'm infinitely more clear-headed now that I just smoke a little weed and get my energy from a healthy diet and avoid stimulants altogether.
I have a bone to pic with you.This is clearly the creator's tumblr blog so that means that having a different source would be moot as it'd still be the same image.If you click the link then you can find the artist's DeviantArt in the sidebar.[Here ya go, ya lazy fuck.](http://isquaredart.deviantart.com/art/Fight-Club-Satsuki-529436532)If tumblr is blocked for you for some reason then disregard most of what I said.
I can see some pros and cons. The downside is it kinda separates you from the rest of your families, both symbolically and in terms of how clear it is you're related. I guess it depends how your relatives feel about it and how you feel about them.
&gt; I find the filename a little bit strange (2014.10.17.0000.0000)I wish I could tell you how much more you have to download, but I don't remember the file sizes when I updated my PS4 copy. If it makes you feel any better, I think the current patch version is 2015.04.21.0000.0000 or something like that. Definitely 2015.04.x though.
Most of the time you can find the intro graphic/cinema files and rename them and the game will boot immediately to the main menu.  A neat little trick I've picked up.
My mom just turned 69 earlier this month and she's lost about 20 pounds on keto. She's been on and off for about 9 months and still has some pain in her knee but I hope that now that she's re-dedicated herself to the diet it will help her lose more and get rid of the inflammation/pain in her knee.
A month ago, a womans unborn baby was cut out of her and died. People wanted her attacker arrested for murder because she killed a baby. The police said no murder charges because unborn babies are not people. People like it when their definitions work to their advantage, but cant stand it when it benefits others.
so you're saying if I collect it for the first day at 7:45 est, then 16 minutes later I could collect it again just past 8:00 est cause it resets at that time? No certain time required in between? Just resets at 8:00 EST everyday?
It never came up eh?  Why would it?  I'd be hurt if my family member keep something like that from me too.  Nothing wrong with it but it is abnormal, you should have talked about it with them.
It kinda feels like... nothing. You hear about the shit that happens to other races and think "Seriously? Is that even a thing" and yet you know that it totally is a thing. On the other hand, people (honestly, it's *usually* people who are white themselves) will say all kinds of things that they would *never* say to someone of another race, and justify it as "it's impossible to be racist against white people". 
&gt; Then why are the states not allowed to define it as "A man and a woman?"Have you read any of the legal arguments made by gay marriage proponents?

That was me. Unfortunately I bit the bullet last week and ordered for full price after /u/pointerbrand mentioned the next sale would be for repeat customers. Kicking myself now, oh well. A great price now for anyone who's still interested.
Aw, your right. I really liked the mechanics and the story. So I can't say I disliked it. The ending did feel really flat though.Hey, anyone who's played the game, is there an alternate ending that Mark missed?
Whats funny is most routers are at 1GBPS so even if you got a big family hard hitting the line I can't see any benefit to this since your bottle neck is the router. 
Then hold your weapon in the ready position, not pointed at the person. This is a very basic rule of gun safety and use.Your weapon should not be pointed at anything you don't intend to destroy. This should apply to police as well, but it doesn't seem to. Any competent gun user or military veteran will tell you the same; your weapon doesn't come up if you aren't about to fire.
The conductors won't measuring the paper, if that's what you're wondering. As long as the QR codes aren't distorted (which they won't be as you printed it unscaled), then you'll be fine. 
glass work is indeed fascinating! Watching it be done is quite fascinating as well. I had a friend who made pipes and pendants and each one was so unique in its own way. They were so beautiful. And now, i kind of want a glass eye! lol. 
You could Nut if she interests you. Awoken Venus might be an interesting option. Durga might be fun, as you seem to have a lot of good dark subs. For farming, you could try a dark fagan team. YOu have Hino Kagu/Ronia/Dragon Shogun, which are some of his best subs.
Nice fucking work! I grew up where they filmed the first Mad Max (our house was just near Anakie Rd), so I loved the effort that went into matching the footage to the audio. 
The name Kattegat probably wasn't around at the time the series is set. It is a Dutch name likely from the time of the Hanze/Hansa trading league, a bunch of centuries later.
Can you please drop this on every TBM wearing those anti-porn porn-kills-love tees?? Please?? They are fucking up my facebook and Instagram feed. Thanks.
I said it before, but when my disaster is getting Amari Cooper, I'm not too bummed. I'm surprised for sure, but I have faith AC/DC will make some magic happen this year.
Little MacDoesn't Matter (On the box)Doesn't Matter (On the packaging)I REALLY need Little Mac! He'll ALMOST complete Wave 2 for me. I need him and Pit to finish it off. But I want Little Mac more. I plan an using him in Smash Bros Wii U. :)
"*Incorrect. It was not stopped. It was only merely slow down*"*"Anyway, Yuri, why are you no looking over player suggestions on forums? You are suppose to work on battle rating.... ohoho, who I kid with anyway?"*
I've always thought the combination of business law and family law could handle all relevant complications.  I've never been sure as to why it wouldn't work.
You got $100 and $13 for Valet/C1? I got 3x$25 and 1x$0 for the 4 Zingers. All were in excellent, mint condition without any issues, scratches, dent, corrosion, etc.
About a year ago, they were briefly best buds, Mitch was on Harmontown a few times, and they were supposedly working on a project together. I guess it never panned out, but I really like them as a duo. 
*Path is blessed above all other worlds, they said.  For the God of Path is Gloriously Bright.**Xenocide*, Orson Scott CardSometimes I think he wrote the entire Ender series just to end with that line.
You forgot Demetrious Underwood, and I havent forgotten about any of those. Hell after last year you could add Kalil to that mix. I still truly believe none would be as bad as Ponder.

Revan? I'm curious, what feat, of any sort, does Revan have that's competitive with Darth Sidious - or even close to his level? Revan was put down hard by the Sith Emperor, who's been canonically stated many times to be weaker than Palpatine. 
I was thinking about this today.  We were the original generation that was playing hand-held games in black-and-white, just like our parents/grandparents were watching TV in black-and-white while we have all this fancy color HD now
Wow...so someone downvotes my apology too. A mirocoft product in an apple sub. Don't know which camp is guilty on that downvote.Anyways the product looks genuinely interesting though after reading the article and watching the intro video. I do a lot of c# and asp.net coding to pay the bills, but on the home front its all apple. I'll have to give this a whirl.
The only problem is that commercial buildings cause noise pollution. Which is dumb. In my experience, if commercial areas are noisy, it's only because of traffic. 
Woldstar is another website that host videos.A lot of street fights on it, and are what it's known for. As it became popular the people filming began to shout out the name of the site as they filmed since they were going to post it on the site.http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/worldstarhiphop
I sanded my Lodge smooth late last year. I seasoned it with Crisco 3 times. I cook in it multiple times a week and it has yet to get darker than this. I've cooked bacon, fried chicken, cooked steak and this is what it looks like today. Did I not do enough layers of Crisco? It's pretty non-stick as it is, so should I not worry about it?
Ursprünglich gab es die Bäume schon, aber im Krieg und in der Nachkriegszeit wurden die alle als Feuerholz genutzt. [So sah der Tiergarten 1945 aus](http://www.istvanocztos.com/uploads/3/3/4/5/334511/1138881_orig.jpg) – bei dem wurde die gewonnene Freifläche als Acker genutzt.
I've thought about that too.  I think that's the route I'll end up going.  I actually am vegan because I have a hard time processing dairy from cows, and when I was younger all I would drink was goat milk.
heheheActually Steamworks isn't that great. Try Spa Excess. So much more laid back and classy. There's a bar with cheap beer, a lounge/TV room (normal TV, not porn), billiards (iirc), a gym, and a rooftop patio/garden. Not to mention they actually card people coming in... Sure, there's plenty of sex if you want, but last time I just went to socialize. Met a bunch of awesome people and went barhopping afterwards.
Take an honest look at the US and European countries that employ socialism, and you tell me which is doing better overall. Yes, you're right they aren't perfect, but one is clearly doing better than the other when allowed to do so more unfettered by government intervention. &gt; The division we see in today's society has been brought to you by the rigid mind that cannot comprehend new ideasNot sure if you pay any attention to history or not but Socialism isn't a new idea. It is the principle of taking from the wealthy, or more accurately taking from anyone who has. This has been around since the time of Monarchies, hardly a new concept. You cannot seriously and honestly look at what is happening in Ukraine, and say that all the "fear mongering" about the Russians that existed during the Cold War (as if it actually ever ended) was completely unfounded and based on nothing more than blind opposition. 
Its pretty adequate for sure, but when you take into account there is not any modding, wont be, and all the dlc will be spendy... it could be a bit better.Of course, as with everything, more is always better (*to a point unlike GT/Forza where cars feel too similar.*) That said, the list is *highly* pleasing.  McLaren F1?  P1?  Sauber c9?  Modern dtm? A few Aston's?  A few RUF's?  More LMP's than any other sim?Yeah, the car list is quite pleasing :)
I don't know. I prefer the way Chicago does it. It is illegal to ride on the sidewalk. That makes sense to me. I am a cyclist, and I just don't see using the sidewalk in most of the city. Places like E. Marginal Way being like the only exception - where there's no pedestrians, and the roads are literally highways. And then you have to be SUPER careful and slow way down at intersections.  - I mean. I don't even ride on the sidewalks on roads like Canyon Drive in Kent, or James Street. In the lane all the way. There are so few highways where riding on the street is just too dangerous. 
You're free to stop replying at any time if it bothers you that much having your racism pointed out. That's the difference between you and someone who actually experience racism - they have to deal with it in everything they do every day. You can walk away from a conversation that makes you uncomfortable.
Actually I don't think most of the people who proclaim themselves the defenders of social justice understand social justice. I on the other hand believe in equality for everyone regardless of race and gender.
Well hell, there's already tons of bro love between Ducks and Vols fans...might as well get this to the professional level too.Oh, and initiation rituals? Just broken hearts, and crushed dreams.
We have ones that do that too, but you tend to have 10-15 of these at big jobs, and we do a lot of dry fire fighting. we can get a lot of them at short notice.they need to go anywhere, and they do that really well. 
I can agree that they were overplayed, that's fair. I wouldn't say a waste of time though. I still enjoy almost all of the album, even if they aren't all heavy hitters. 
If Markstrom sucks two years from now, hopefully our goalie prospects will be better positioned to help us, if that's too soon for them, I imagine Lindenning will find a stopgap until Demko etc are ready.Markstrom is still a good goaltender, Melanson is a good coach, it's still very possible Markstrom becomes a legit NHL goalie.
Wood is essentially a semiconductor. At a really high voltage it conducts, but it normally doesn't. I ran into that when making a Van Der graaff generator. The wood is a conductor as far as the generator was concerned. 
Really depends how curved it is. Go with the smaller stickers to be safe. The bigger ones will definitely have creases when you try time wrap it round and uneven surface. 
Get a maid right off the bat and split that 4 ways. You will save yourselves a lot of headache since, being new to living on your own, and having 4 roommates you don't need the added friction.You'll still come out way ahead.Also, might consider having each person be in charge of one night's dinner and making extra for leftovers. This way you all depend less on takeout or waste food.
I find it odd, but maybe it's cultural? It's not uncommon for children to still breastfeed into toddler hood in some places. I know studies have shown that extending breastfeeding is beneficial for the child's growth and overall development but to each their own. I am not an expert by any means! 
There are so many other options given the circumstances that could've led to a better ending. I swear that ending was designed to leave literally everybody disappointed.
&gt;Look this really isn't complicated. I want a hover board, that knows where I want to go before I do, and has a built in ASIC miner. Why is this so hard? Seriously we already have Skateboards, GPS, self driving cars, Hovercraft, and ASIC miners. Why won't someone code this for me? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRzqI3BJ2A&gt;Hell I'll even split the profit 60/4060/40 = 1.5. I want more than 1.5% profit.
&gt; I do not know her at all and have no ties to her or anyone she knows.Then what business is it of yours?&gt; If I was snooping I would have gone through his phone without asking. I did not have any intention of snooping which is why I asked him instead. It was left open for me to see sorry not sorry.*sigh* My point is that if he isn't entitled to any privacy and has to tell you everything, then why do you think snooping is wrong?Wouldn't it be way more efficient for you simply to monitor all of his communications than talk to him about it if you feel you're entitled to know everything that is going on?EDIT: That's not to say that I think he should dodge a direct question, but I think a certain degree of trust is necessary for a healthy relationship. You certainly don't have the right to pry into everything he does in the name of openness. So there's a lot in this relationship I'd be concerned about, were I you.
That the problem of evil refutes theism is controversial (though to say that is has persuasive power seems fine)To say that rejecting the existence of god (or at least a benevolent god) solves the problem of evil seems true - there is no obvious reason to expect the world to be all-good if there is no master plan.Though it would be interesting to see if someone can come up with one.
I love this pick. Carr finally has someone to throw to. Cooper is legit, he is such a good route runner and has great hands. You don't find WRs like him very often. 
I'm An Australian who gets matched up with people who don't even speak English half the time, let alone other Australians so i can have decent ping. I pretty much stopped playing online until they fix this.

I wouldn't call it a filler. We learned a new thing about gems, a kinda important thing - rushed regeneration can lead to disaster. I wonder if it can lead to corruption.I imagine that during the war a lot of gems tried to regenerate as fast as possible, so they could get moving and back to the fight before someone shattered them. Their gems are very vulnerable when they don't have a body to get them out of the way of a giant axe. Maybe too many rushed regenerations on a short period of time caused them to become corrupt, or if not corrupt, unstable and easily corruptible by whatever actually made them corrupt.I found the episode kinda important, even if to only make me speculate.
This is a better answer than I could've given. I didn't count calories at all, just enjoyed the freedom of eating everything in sight and making sure I got tons of protein. If I had to throw out a guess it would be 3500/day, and some weeks with massive binges could've been more like 4500. It should be noted that I only cared about raw mass gains (which translated into strength gains), muscle definition was not on my radar in any capacity. 
What do you mean?EDIT: Nevermind, I misread. But, to answer your question, he's trying to make it look as close to the real game as possible while being spacious enough for however many players are on. 
I'd be surprised if the gaia guardians aren't protected against insanely high attack damage weapons, then mods like Orespawn and Wildycraft would make them a joke.
I would have to agree about C7.  With the discount codes that they posted in the Perk sub I got 10 ZTE Sources for about 10 bux each last month.  They ended up being some pretty nice phones for the price.
Nope, still doesn't work. The boss from the left still wins, because he achieved the ultimate goal first: reaching the top of the mountain. It doesn't even look like he needed those bottom two losers at all (but the second highest guy on the left is still doing better than the entire right team on his own). Whereas, on the right side of the mountain, the other boss is actually being held back by his incompetent help. He should have ponied up and hired better quality climbers, and maybe working as a competent team they could have beat the boss on the left. 
What I don't understand is how apparently people don't get that if something is omnipotent it is all powerful. Being all powerful means that it has the power to do anything. Thus, it can't be restricted.Even if an omnipotent being were restricted by a set of laws it would have the power by its own definition to change those laws. It's a moot point because the definition says it all and it's a fictional item that we're arguing over. If there were an omnipotent being that we could interact with then by all means argue about it's abilities, but this is a poor understanding of a definition of a word.
Caught on a 4" watermelon senko.  Bought an Abu Garcia Black Max/Cabela's proguide combo yesterday for $50.00.  No backlashes or bird nests.  I would say today was a successful day.
It is true that Mt. A can have good relations with its neighbors without the UN, but the scale of the UN stretches far beyond Mt. A's back yard. As a member nation, Mt. A would be able to talk to the myriad other members of the UN in a professional manner. To address your second point, under no circumstances would Augustans need to fight under the UN banner against their will. If a universal resolution is passed declaring war and Mt. A does not support it, then Mt. A can leave the UN.
I love to see results like that for every crucible game! I think it would be cool to see what weapons were used most commonly and who was your Nemesis too.  I think Halo 3 had that IIRC
Australia- around $5000 per year for 6 years with a 10% discount for whatever is paid upfront. But that was before a lot of the degrees changed from undergraduate to postgraduate with course restructuring so I don't know the current cost.
MS is a heterogenic disease currently divided into four forms: Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), where transient exacerbations are followed by remission; secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which develops in RRMS patients and is marked by worsening of symptoms without remission; primary progressive MS (PPMS), where symptoms gradually worsen without a previous relapsing-remitting stage; and progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS), where symptoms gradually worsen and patients experience acute exacerbations without remission (Goldenberg, 2012; Ortiz et al., 2014). However, due to the vague disease course of PRMS, it is being suggested that this classification be discontinued (Lublin et al., 2014).I am not sure if RRMS always progresses to SPMS or if it is possible to have RRMS without it ever developing into SPMS.  Either way "RRMS" itself is considered "non-progressive" because there is not a worsening of symptoms, at least until it develops into SPMS.
The reason I have an AS is because I couldn't handle the math portion of my program. I retook Pre Calculus 3 times and still didn't understand it. CS, at least when I went through it, was heavily focused on programming. I was never interested in programming, but, it was the only tech program at my school at the time.IN my experience, on the support side of things, advanced math is rarely required. I'm sure those that build the networks need to worry about understanding hex and proper subnetting, but, I don't. While I have to make sure the device is on the proper subnet, I don't build the networks so I don't need to know how to do it.I would love to get into server support, but, I currently work for a very large, multi national, corporation and all the servers are in another state. There is a LOT of department segregation in my company and moving up through the ranks of the IT department is very hard to do if you can't drop everything to relocate when a position opens up.
&gt; So you are against the RFRA laws like the one in Indiana that allows businesses to refuse to serve Gay weddings if their religious beliefs don't allow Gay weddings? Wasn't that amended?
Depends...If I can't stand him - no way! If a creep is not good enough for me he is not good enough for her. If I still love him - no....unless they are really in love then I will have to deal with it. I
Yeah she is pretty terrible. Seen her in the indies and she's just as bad there. She's dating Mad Man Pondo so I don't think she'll be improving anytime soon.
Very interesting, I'd not even considered this as an obstacle. Surely with our increasing population we will need to be building more generation capacity in coming years.
Not surprised Del Rio passed on Leonard Williams.  Williams doesn't explode off the line, he's going to be a solid 3-4 DE that eats up blocks but he's not going to be a Pro bowler.  Cooper is the best pick here.
I think it would be a bit too convenient to find 5-10 able bodied trained knights hanging out in a Sept - perhaps he could find a rag tag group that he whips into shape, with maybe only a few of them being practiced knights?

You're totally wrong. You don't think intelligence has anything to do with inherited gene mutations? Of course it does, that is how intelligent animals evolved. What fallacy is it to think that if you stand where cars are likely to crash you are in more danger than if you went about your day normally? That is perfectly logical.His comment was simplified of course, there is no one "trait" of intelligence, but based on the truth.
I don't think it's coming to PS3. You'll need a PS4 or Vita (or maybe a PC, not confirmed yet, but fairly likely to come out shortly after) if you want 2nd Encore.
Cartels would **NEVER** allow that. Why? Because it would fuck with their money. The last thing a cartel boss wants is even MORE security and surveillance on the border.
Yeah it's a sacrifice for a bit of damage for a bit of AC.  I would personally not use TWF because I like to keep my bonus action available for other tasks.
That I grew up without a father and I never really got to know him.  It's hard to have regrets when you are 5, but I now wonder all the time how different my life would have been.  I also regret not being able to tell him I loved him one last time.  I am glad that his death helped pass the stringent drunk driving laws we now have so that other children (and people) didn't have to grow up the same way I did.
Cooper's going to be a very good WR as long as he stays healthy.  So I don't think he's a bad pick.  I don't think he has the ceiling to be among the best WRs in the league though and that's usually what you would expect at #4.  
He's at least got the leg up on Maher for not backing any pseudoscience or woo, but I can see how a lot of the public might not like his confrontational attitude on some subjects.
[Here you go, itx 970 which is just as powerful as it's full sized version](http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-GeForce-Overclocked-GDDR5-GV-N970IXOC-4GD/dp/B00OQUMGM0)Also take a look at the Fractal Node 304 or Ncase M1. Both are tiny, the node is about 100$(Readily available), the M1 i think 200 with special order. 
Centaur aghs is straight up broken in teamfights. Alch and octarine core as expected overhyped and not even that strong on practice.Lotus orb is most fun and high skill-cap thing that was added and it's enjoying as hell, definitely my favorite addition.Also ld ratting power is over the board and should be hotfixed with centaur in .64a. You just go maelstorm, moon thingy and aghs and your opponent can't finish game anymore.
I very explicitly did **not** mean Jetty, a horrendous pile of legacy and crappy IO code that has practically been weaponized :)I name Tomcat and Netty as the former, despite also being ancient (in terms of Java-land), is a wonderful, fully J2EE/servlet capable webapp server, and the latter is what everyone should use for practically every single other type of IO project/service (barring the times that something terrific already exists, such as HTTPD/Nginx for plain HTTP[S]).
omg I KNOW RIGHT? I thought it was so insulting! She seriously said that I "obviously have no kids or hate them". OMG what if I couldn't have children? Ouch. What if I didn't want children? My choice. What if this has nothing to do with the situation? YUPPPPP
I'm trying to say that the reviewer may have had legitimate concerns but didn't word the comment well.  I'm not saying it's a good or helpful review comment, but it might still have some underlying reason which is agreeable.I don't think we should jump on someone as being excessively sexist from one comment posted on twitter taken out of context.

That's interesting! I have the same problem. Like, I feel I'm that lab monkey who was prevented from having contact his whole life. I was wondering about Krav Maga since I'm not down with crossfit. I'm not in great shape. Not horrible either. How intense is it? I only have time right now to work out 3x a week. But I really need to improve my physique and some kind of hobby. 
A Gallon of gasoline - 2.50A cigarette lighter - 1.25A 40oz of steel reserve - 2.303 Mcdonalds cheeseburgers - 3.15Watching an abandoned building burn down at dinner - pricelessalso you still have 80 cents left, so do with that what you will.
Really not sure, I was reading up on MacRumors because I'm debating between a GS60 and 15" rMBP. Intel said it would be 20-40% faster and have 48EU vs. 40EU. Speculation is that it will match the 750M - which would be enough for me to fuck around in TF2 at 60fps, I guess.
Do you think Braxton Miller will be drafted as a QB in the **2016** draft?  I don't think he can play in the league, but will be a good "athlete".Where is the 2015 draft thread?
Step 1: read a lot about financial independence. It'll all become pretty intuitive after a while. The learning curve is pretty short.Step 2: think about how much you would need per year to spend in retirement. Multiply that by 25. This is how much you want to save during your working years.Step 3: Make a budget that allows you to save that much. Here's a spreadsheet to help you - just fill it out. Note the multiple tabs. Also, set your rate of return on investments to something like 4% to account for inflation in your calculations.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AB979IpnPJErlLhiOktwnt2U-Uwgn189sGotW0Ls9vc/edit?usp=sharing
Very true. Also, everyone in our brigade who wants BA has got it, the others - about half our members - have chosen not to for various reasons which is entirely up to them. CFA is stressing the importance of BA more these days but has traditionally not been a priority for rural brigades. 
I like that it's effectively, "here's my voting record, categorized for your convenience". Is this common? I don't recall seeing this as a common way of describing a platform. Generally, I sense that candidates prefer to "talk their way through things" ...
That's why I gave a few question options, because obviously not every one can capture each type. In general, I've noticed that most Perceivers think more about their long term plans or hobbies they want to pick up etc than actually getting it done. However it's true that Se-dom is more about the action (it's a good indicator of their type). ESTP and ESFP seem to work sporadically in bursts of intense energy. They don't seem to plan but more just react, just go with the present moment. I do find those two a little confusing to type at face value, because they can come across as Te at first, but when you observe them, the Se is a give-away.
I think Laylee having a ranged attack based on sound (was it called a sonar burst in the IGN article?) will be pretty cool and bring you back into Kazooie with eggs.
Oh wow! The balls on him, that is super fucking hot, to mention that you were shaking so badly in front of him...wow. There is no doubt he has been steadily using all of your videos and pictures for personal pleasure. Just have to answer me this, did he put his hands on your ass that day? Anyways I will stop, you answered more than enough of my prying questions. Actually one more, Theoretically speaking, if there was no consequences of your family falling apart or taking advantage of you further, would you let him know about the fantasy or give him more videos however you can?
Look into the Poker III. Is a 60% mechanical keyboard so it's small and has a program layer built in. This means that you can store the macros on the keyboard and activate then through the pn button. This will allow you to activate an f10 macro with fn+pn+f10. Fn and pn are right next to each other so it isn't a problem. The poker II can do the same thing but it's since been discontinued and will be hard to find. I believe you can do the same thing with some Ducky boards as well, bit maybe sure to double check. 
Wrong on all accounts, though Touch of Evil and The Seventh Seal were both my initial favorites of Welles and Bergman when I first started watching their works.EDIT: I will also add that my favorite Welles film isn't Citizen Kane either.

How many Asians do you see in the mainstream media?I think if we're being completely honest all cultures have their own issues which end up manifesting in stereotypes.
Are there any ways to force a re-customize on a character?My 2nd character looks way different than when I hit finish after the transfer over.I would restart and make another but shes already above 20 and has three apartments, cars, weapons, etc...edit: For PC
The effort bar is low and you do not have to personally take them to court: File a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Office.  They will investigate the facts and render a decision.  This is a reasonable and inexpensive way to get an official government  stance on the issue that also gives the charter rights offender an order/opportunity  to stop the charter violating practise/behaviour. (the ostensible goal is rehabilitation, not punishment ) If the offender ignores the order, THAT is when the shit starts to hit the fan, and you can just grab some popcorn and watch from the sidelines.  Source: have done this.
I mean, it's sort of prickish to not give her another shot, but she even says it doesn't matter *why* she lost them, just that she did. Its a business, you don't reward people for failure.
See my sister took the SAT, worked her ass off studying for it a year and a half in advance, and she got a 2080. All I have to back myself up is the Question of the Day app and a class I'm taking at school. I feel really unprepared. 
I like to think that every year he thinks it will finally be the year he doesn't get booed, then he boldly steps onto the stage with a smile on his face. Only to have his dream promptly shat on by all the drunk fans. 
Holy shit y'all, I just discovered this sub and it's my new favorite! I actually lol-ed at these comment-gems. When I'm hungover (or plain lazy), I like to dramatically collapse onto the floor super-inconveniently right in my guy's way. I'll make weird squawking noises and loudly proclaim "baby bird is hungry" until he goes pick up whatever junk food I'm craving. I'm totally a grown up!
Oh sure everyone uses it. But nobody likes it. Most engineers treat pro tools the way you treat the mandatory vaccine shot before travelling. Obviously you have to do it, but it's not pleasant.Can't remember the last time I heard someone actually say something positive about PT
I don't understand why Google can't seem to make their services run efficiently on their own operating system. My old iPhone 4s had horrendous battery life by the time I got rid of it, barely hitting 2.5 hours SOT, but it did better in standby than my Turbo. That we have to root just to fix problems in Google's own apps is ridiculous.
ESPN's football "analysts" act like they're splitting the atom. Trent Dilfer said "you cannot lose games in the NFL and still win" and damn near spiked his clip-on mic.
I'd recommend banana cream and strawberry regular instead of ripe or even both. Stand alone strawberry is hella good. Ripe for mixing. And honeydew man. Best one ever
Minority or majority =\= everyone. Your claims mean nothing because you don't get to tell someone what they think about their phone is wrong. Maybe that was their main reason for buying a Nexus, and yours was to flash roms. It's not "very incorrect." Everyone has their own view, *sir*
I can agree some but looking at Baltimore and trying to light the pizza guy on fire or burning down the pharmacy, I would think you'd go after the courthouses, city hall and police stations not the community itself and the places you depend on for medicine to survive? The majority of this is people being assholes because they can get away with it right now.
&gt; Many atheist fall back on evolution as there evidenceNo they don't, or at least shouldn't. Evolution says absolutely nothing about the existence or otherwise of God/s.&gt;There is as much evidence that god exists as there is evidence that god doesn't existThere is no such thing as evidence that something doesn't exist. The complete lack of evidence just makes it likely that one doesn't exist, especially one that gives a fuck about us.Edit - BTW, unless you believe in a god you are an atheist.
I would go with Freddy or Odoamne, Sven, Febiven, Forg1ven/Vander or Rekkles/Yellowstar.If you want to play to win lane take botlane1 if you want to be less ADC centric go with botlane2. Note that individually i think Forg1ven and Yellowstar are the best at their roles - however their playstyle is to different.
I am suggesting that God grants us free will. I understand that my proposal that God is not omniscient will seem like I am putting limits on God to some people. However, this is just my understanding of the paradox, and I do not feel that this makes God any less powerful. But, I've said it before, I could be wrong.
Do you actually understand the issue? There are no copper lines run into the building, this is by design since it's an outmoded technology that has no use beyond landline phones, and since those can be replaced by VoIP, there is no financial justification for running in archiac cabling into a building.It's not greed, it's forward progress and actually quite surprising forethought. The generations following them into this building are going to want internet, and if they don't are capable of using cell phones. Yes it sucks there's no copper landline available for them, but there are plenty of solutions available, but rather than attempt to try something new, they just complain and demand to be catered too.Maybe we shouldn't be using all this fancy new medical technology to keep them alive if they hate progress so much, kinda solves two problems at once.
Thanks! Kinda have to keep it inexpensive for now but if my fan base increases, then a microphone and dedicated camera are the first purchases to make.
MW2 was the most fun I have ever had in a cod game. Maybe the most fun I've ever had in a video game ever.  It was so fucking fun. Go watch a Sandy Ravage video of him shitting on people in MW2 and try to tell me that isn't fun as hell. 
I do this every semester. Makes life alot easier when you are having problems in class, profs are more helpful when they know you care about what they do, not just your GPA.

*Pulling the book back that he'd originally been still holding over the edge of the balcony, to some, it may have looked as if the young man may have tossed the books over the ledge on purpose. Seeing one of the textbooks hit someone in the face, he rushed down from the second floor to see if she was alright.**On his way down, he caught the leer of a rather pissed librarian, and gave her a small wave as he pressed his lips together nervously. Approaching the young student, he set the only book he had left down and extended a hand to her.* "Oum, I-I'm so sorry. Um…a-are you alright?" *He says in a quick, but quiet tone, his eyes averted from everyone and everything as the embarrassment of what he'd just done continuously spread throughout his body.*
This is an interesting case actually.The blood vessels in the sclera (white) respond to a drop in the intraocular pressure; as the medium is allowed to expand, the blood vessels follow suit and cause the redness.So those blood vessels aren't expanding as a result of the THC, but as a result of the expansion in the surrounding tissues.
Did they both open the wrong Necronomicon?        http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SAbMlNNYFO0/TufIWsqTbJI/AAAAAAAABnk/VgzNSbto_rw/s1600/evil-dead-3-why-the-long-face.jpg??
Myrcella will not become the queen of Dorne, but of Westeros as King Tommen's wife. Princess Arianne is likely the next ruler of Dorne. Best guess is that is Danaerys Targaryen or another similar looking character readers may know about. 
When we were expecting our first child, my mother-in-law told me a story about my partner when he was a toddler. She was pushing him in a grocery cart in a busy grocery store in the summer. He pulled her tube top *all* the way down and cried out "boobies" and latched on in front of everybody - other breast still just out there! She said that was the last time she wore a tube top ever. I told my partner on the spot that we would be doing baby sign language for "milk" at the bare minimum and baby would not know the word "boobies".
Sure Rome was the greatest power in the world at their height, if they wanted something bad enough they could have found away to get it. But that's not to say they never tried to capture places like Scotland. They made many attempts, even establishing many defensive lines. But all attempts past Harridans Wall failed and Rome was always pushed back to that line. Maybe if they thought Scotland had something of great value to offer they would have put more resources towards its conquest, but as is a big reason Rome never held Scotland is because the people there did not want Rome hanging around. This is similar to Romes relations with the Germans. Ireland is a different matter, there is next to no evidence to suggest that Rome ever seriously want Ireland or had any kind of military involvement there. 
I see this mistake so many times on the internet, it's pretty ridiculous. If so many people are fans of the guy, then how come they can't spell his damn name correctly.
If I'm a Bucks fan I look at that ejection as a good indicator. Realistically nobody thought you were making it past round one so his ejection isn't important in the big picture. But that kid wanted to win, showed passion, and unfortunately got the foul. That move to me showed more heart than malice IMO
Dude awesome! Is that a filter over it? Is it possible to remove it? Or is that just how trace works? If that's the best you can do then I'll take it. Thanks!
Shocking that someone that prides themselves on advertising that they actively take joy in the suffering of people that aren't like them would be equally disgusting both outside and in.
Fun.   We're going to be starting on calls at my job soon.   I'm in health care IT. Going to bed early because I'm sleepy and feeling down.   I'm started taking blood pressure meds yesterday,  they're helping but they're also sapping my energy,  which the doc said was possible.   I think they're causing mood swings too. 
Yes, for the small percentage of times that has happened. Because most crops are never propagated from used seed there's no opportunity for cross-pollination. Though it is an issue for those few that do self propagate, and it sucks for them, but it isn't specific to GMOs. Just becomes good management practices at that point,and is a reality of nature with no conceivable workaround, so... 
I'm honoured that your first post on this account was to call me a racist for suggesting that the person convicted of Hae Min Lee's murder most likely did it!I guess I'm in the company of noted racist [Ira Glass](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2v8y8y/ira_glass_thinks_adnan_killed_hae/) on this one, amongst many, many other racists.
Thanks! I keep them indoors. I have a spare room with my fishing gear and I set the motors up in the there. I have a 10' in-process wood boat being built and I'll bring some of the motors with that to shows. My wood boat will run the Mark 20, Mark 25, and my 1957 Evinrude Fastwin rhats not pictured. I have a 14' 1957 Speed Queen that will run the Mark 30 and Merc 500. Different motors for different loads and shows. 
And it is Golden Week here in Japan. I get about a week off - spent the first day pretty much sleeping, the second playing Game of Thrones with folks from work... The rest of it is just Unplanned.I'll probably spend some of my conscious hours working on my Spencerian, which is still a horrorshow, and maybe see what kinks I need to work out of other scripts. Should be fun.
&gt;sub-standard beingsThis is possibly the most hilariously stupid way to describe anyone I've ever heard.  I just imagine like . . . I dunno, "regular" people are Fords and Chevys and VWs, but those *sub-standard beings* are all Yugos or something.
Regardless of my affinity or lack-thereof towards Bush, at that rate, no President should receive any credit because they have experts help them make decisions.
Wait, wait, wwaaiitt....There is no **way** that this guy is for real. If not, he is fucking hilarious. If he is, ...Edit: [He's an ac-tor, apparently.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrrxOzl68PY)
I haven't followed this story step by step, but what indication, if any, has there been that he had anything to do with the murder? A lot of this has seemed like irresponsible reporting with a lot of dangerous speculation.
She's 67? I thought i heard someone on tv say she was in her early 70s. Anyway, age aside, he'd balance out the New York liberal label that'll get thrown around either candidate. Besides, the VP is a terrible place to waste talented people like Booker, Warren, and Franken.
You left out the pertinent part: &gt;Rotten Tomatoes awards the Certified Fresh accolade to theatrical releases reviewed by 40 or more critics (including 5 Top Critics) with a steady score of 75% or higher on the Tomatometer. **A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%.**
I wanna say the gory ways of dispatching zombies. Slash, club, shoot, curb stomp, beat to death with baseball bats, blow up, incinerate, drop off buildings, electrocute, break necks, explode, throwing knives at them...If there ever is a German version of Dying Light, you'll be like "Well yes, hello there, I'm Herr Kranich, and I think it's good that we are having this discussion. Now how about instead of running around screaming and hurting each other we sit down in a circle and a draw a smiling sun?"I'll admit that getting the "Hush Hush Now - Quiet a Screamer" achievement made even me go "gulp".
hiko said he loved C9 when he played for them, except when they offered them a raise after they were doing less than good to keep them happy. also some things in the player agreement when he wanted to leave the team really upset him. he wont go into specifics though. 
The smallest Meetups are normally about 8ish people and the larger ones have seen around 20 give or take.But there are always good people, it not what you picture a reddit meetup being like. 
I would want someone who views raping children as okay to feel unwelcome. I would want a police officer who feels it's okay to brutally beat people for fun to feel unwelcome.Alienation is a useful tool. We shouldn't shy from it. Without it, we're just stupid hippies.
He came back from his ridiculous cosplayer gimmick when the Mizdow thing got over. He's like Cody Rhodes that way: they can both make ridiculous ideas entertaining.This though? I don't think so. It's incoherent, the theme music is boring, (which is worse than even being bad: at  least Cesaro's siren is memorable) his finishing move is lame, and that ~~Stunt Double~~ shirt makes no sense if he's going to keep doing imitations.A guy on /wooo/ said it would be a neat idea if he was basically Taskmaster, which is what they're trying to do, but they're gonna fumble it if they don't fix some of this.

Found my old Sonic watch from 1995. Unfortunately, the band is a little messed up so I can't wear it. I thought a watchface would be the next best thing!Side note, I hope smartwatches have a 20+ year battery some day.
No, I watched a lot of tape on Cooper, he is the real deal if he put the work in. Great feet, great explosion off the line. A actual team player, does block when necessary. What is not to like, he has the size, strength, and ability to be an all pro in any system. 
&gt; $4K worth of property which is funny considering that rule was made in 1867 and never updated.It doesn't have to be real property, it also includes personal wealth and it is not tied to any province either.Interesting, section 33 places the responsibility of determine eligibility to the Senate with the Senate. That means it is the Senate and not the PMO who should be calling the shots on who is eligible and who is not.
I mean... He earned that joke. But he's a very solid player who is an absolute beast on the PK with Pageau (every Montreal fan can attest to that). He has crazy advanced stats too. We definitely want him resigned. Hell, he even scored on a breakaway these playoffs and it was spectacular. 
"Hmm I see. Well is there anything here I can help you with? Perhaps a tour or something?" *He was trying to find an excuse to stay close to the hooded man. to keep an eye on him*
&gt; stormfront incursionI know this isn't related to the discussion at hand, but I see this accusation a lot, and don't know if it's actually true or just people trying to smear by shouting stormfront. Any idea?
&gt; Someone who isn't vaccinated visits from somewhere other than the U.S.So you're positing this:1. unvaccinated2. from outside the US3. exposed to rubella within the incubation period4. somehow manages to make it through customs while asymptomatic5. and mingle with anti-vaxxers (a very small population in the US)Not only that, but all this occurs and such a significant outbreak occurs that it *re-establishes*.That's just dumb. It's even somewhat of an anti-vaxxer idea itself... it dismisses the idea of herd immunity as incapable of suppressing re-establishment.
My soul may be Purple but my blood runs Redder then the rising sun, redder then the roaring flames that dance across the battlefield, redder then the eyes of a demon in the black and blue, so knowing this will you still take me into battle with you oh Crusader? so that we may battle until the fields run red with our blood? 
men aren't bears. if people stop making statements saying women are *inviting* rape by walking alone at night more and more men are going to realise that rape isn't justified like they think it is, that no woman (or man) is ever asking for it, and that it's fucking not okay.women don't have access to protective equipment. so essentially the only way to keep safe is to what? quit your job? just stay inside all day? what's the practical solution for women here? this is nothing like hiking in the woods without proper supplies. this is trying to go about your daily life in a world where you're not able to buy supplies to defend yourself and where people keep saying you're asking for someone to rape you if you have the gall to live like a normal person
When playing Vault of Glass with my usual crew, everyone HAS to wear chatterwhite, and when we get to the Gorgon's labyrinth, we have to listen to The Pink Panther soundtrack until we're in the clear.
&gt; My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI. It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into itI agree with that. It's not a terribly accurate test when looking at instances... but I think it does measure a broad cultural inclination.&gt; From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.I'm less interested in how it's misused and more interested in what it says about our culture. (which I think it does have something to say).
Then you've heard a bad exhaust. I can say from experience the H22 at full chat is a proper car noise. Keep a modest muffler on a full exhaust system and all that comes through is cams gears and unicorns.
Yes, some games (e.g. Black Ops 2, using TAC - Treyarch Anti Cheat) did ban you when you cheated, TAC got you and VAC didn't.You didn't get an account ban tho. (you were simply disabled from playing the game)
I actually don't think this is a laughing matter. I asked her about the username because it demonstrates that her self-esteem is very low; possibly because of the emotional abuse of her boyfriend. I was honest about it-should I have tippy toed around it so as to not offend you? I really couldn't care less what you think. As far as I'm concerned, there's good grounds for emotional abuse here in this thread and I pulled together various bits of evidence to prove my point. 
they have to be for the playoffs - can only use 2 jerseysalso I can't really remember the last time we *didn't* use the "alternate" as the aways... so are they really still the alternate at this point?
In middle school, I had a teacher tell me "I'm yelling in your face because you deserve it" as she walked me to the office.  I don't remember what I was in trouble for, but my mother was not happy.
Sigh... the weapons thing, *again*? Is it all at least readily accessible if someone or something attacks?Is everyone really this paranoid?I know how to drive stick shift. I can fight zombies. I can hold a shovel and dig a ditch. I can sit on a wall and look out for things, or paint a pretty landscape. I can sing, and I also have a guitar. The strings aren't the best, but it still sounds pretty good. I am really good at climbing trees and towers. I was into parkour and stuff. I can handle a rifle well enough. I can't swim so well. I can use a knife. I can hunt. I can boil and make basic leather if you've got the chemicals, that was an old hobby of mine, pre-apocalypse, so... yeah I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here for skills.Do you have anyone that can pick me up? I'll pay you back with service of...however long that takes, I guess.
If you know my deck, it's easy to break down with a few sideboard cards and conservative play. If you don't know it, it'll probably win. My best chance of putting up a good result in a upcomming MOCS is by taking everyone 100% by surprise.
I will do a search! Considering today there was a post about a guy being turned off by a woman's butthair, I feel like something like physical scarring/sagging will be even worse! But I will feel better to know that most men don't feel that way about their wives postpartum.
I had a dream last night that Tim Duncan retired. For some reason Manu was doing the commentating of the event. This all happened in a pre-game ceremony. Interpret and discuss this as you so choose 
&gt; Do you really want your truck back after its been stolen?No, but I wouldn't want them to take it in the first place. That's the purpose of anti-theft...to help prevent theft. Now something like Lojack I could care less for (who cares after they're gone?) but other devices/measures that deter/stop the casual car thief are worthwhile.
My stack is a mix of silver and gold bullion. Majority of the gold are mixed year sovereigns, my silver is mainly brittanias, maples and Philharmonics with a small qty of crocs, polar bears, Ellie's, Noah's arks and sharks. It would be great to get silver bars but the 20% vat on bars makes it uneconomical compared to silver coins....
Ya just like the rest of music.. its all poetry: from country, jazz, classical, blues, metal, rock, folk, heck even rap. Each genre reflects a certain time and place. I personally don't think hip hop has the depth and individualism one would need to make that leap above all other genres to consider it by itself.  I wouldn't mind seeing a music history class that would embark on why artists chose the path they did be it folk, blues, rock, hip-hop, or even heavy metal they all play a part in our constantly changing culture. 
Op amps are integrated circuits that amplify the analog audio signal.  It is doubtful that replacing op amps in a PC motherboard would result in any noticeable improvement, assuming it even uses replaceable parts.Edit.  I see that this mboard actually has replaceable op amps.  You could try, but I tend to think this is marketing hype.  They should have used a quality part in the first place.  In my experience, you need really good equipment and good sources to notice any difference in op amps.
Just because we have no substantial regulation doesn't mean there hasn't been strenuous actions taken to take them (by take I mean to add restrictions that are really not "smart" or "sensible"). Biden was tasked with gun control for the Obama Administration and failed. A lot of states fell to pressure from the Obama Administration (NY Safe Act, Colorado mag bans, Bloomberg's lobbying, Feinstein's advocation for another AWB, ect...)- 41P - 7N6 Ban (Attempted to ban M855 ammo as well) - Obama's Executive Orders on Firearms Are just a few of the changes - some not directly tied to the president, but it's no surprise the current administration and democratic group is not advocating for a libertarian view on firearms. 
FE8: Lute? I do use her sometimes, but I usually don't want to bother training her up. Her Mag growth is nuclear though; and I have a soft spot for mages on ponies.FE9: Meh, Devdan? His bases are usable and BEXP/Bands/Knight Ward exist, but I can't be bothered to add a mediocre Halberdier to my team at that point.FE10: Marcia--she's my favorite Pegasus Knight and she's really good in FE9, but trying to make her work longterm in FE10 isn't worth it (though I did it on my first run).FE13: Basilio/Flavia--**That.

I find that if you can let out your true feelings out about people helps keep you sane, not that you would usually say it to their face. I work in a old folks home, and the shit that comes out of my mouth around coworkers about some of the residents are down right fucked up. Some of the nurses I work with have said much worse. I believe teachers and those who work in health care have some of the darkest sense of humour, but it's what we do to keep ourselves sane.
On Wikipedia, typically the introductory paragraph is the TL;DR of the article as a whole. The article goes over how the impact will depend on how benevolent/malevolent the aliens are, the method of communication, etc.It also goes over how there will be other impacts such as theological, political, legal, technological, and ecological.You should read the whole thing if you're interested. It's not that long.
What's with Sports commercials using Portugal. The Man songs? All Your Light, and last year So American on that NFL Shop we started out as a Vikings family but then ended up as a vikings SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY family. 
You would think dunleavy up and punched Giannis straight in the throat from how the people in this thread are describing it. None of you have played competitive contact sports nor do you watch the big boys in paint play all game if you think that throat hit was that unusual. 
The collapse of industry, the shrinking of the port, and white flight have been tough on Baltimore. The last remnant of heavy industry in the city's environs was Sparrows Point steelworks which finally shut in 2012 after being sold to a private equity fund.
Azeem, the essence of electoral politics is choosing the candidate who best meets what you feel is right.  Recognizing that no candidate is likely to meet all your criteria.
judging a team completely off how strong the players are in theory isnt exactly the most reliable way to judge a team.this, just like elements last roster both have potential to win eu lcs and have a fair run at worlds but being able to reach that potential is the real difficulty
There is too much bad blood between them. There is some hope for reconciliation after the coalition bombed 'Khurasan group' (aka JN), when IS supporters sympathised with JN, but that moment has passed and they are now back to calling each other Sahwat (from IS to JN) or Khawarij (from JN to IS)
yes, i think part of the reason that it is so difficult to be open with others about quitting is that people tend to simply roll their eyes if you suggest that porn is harmful. i definitely feel comforted after reading these comments and things that people have written in other threads.
Okay? The picture you linked looks more like the shower room in my high school locker room, and it was build in the 1950's. It's also looks like some YMCA and cheap gyms shower rooms that I've seen. If you're paying $30+ per month for a gym membership, the men's room will probably have shower stalls and probably have curtains or doors on the stalls. 
I use focus and recompose at f1.4-f2 it works perfectly for me, I shoot in a very reportage fashion, so it is fast. I've never noticed quality loss based on diffraction, you really have to pixel peep to see it, Im not really into spec based photography. I know that 5d is technically superior, but I think its not reflected in the quality of images you get out of it, its just a camera after all.
I did it twice. As long as you trust the people surrounding you, and the setting is calm its awesome :)The first trip felt like I've awoken from a dream, and completely forgot about reality. The second wasnt as strong. pretty much "only" visuals, but it felt like it lasted like 12 hours or something.
Omg I was really good friends with this kid when I was in high school. He's a year below me but all of this is completely sarcastic and not meant to be taken seriously at all. He's awesome in real life

I am between life coach and gaara... lifecoach sticks to his bread and butter and really masters a few decks, gaara plays everything, and has 9 deck rotations always switching every few game-  I always have 9 decks built I feel are best for meta/most fun for me to play, and I'd say I've got 2 mastered, and about 5/6 I play well, then 3 I need to work on, or learn to play (for me this is handlock, oil rogue, patron warrior) but this is an interesting question, I think gaaras approach is best, but it is hard to have that much time to play decks to get good at all of them/know their match-ups and how they perform in the meta
Does the sound turn off on the stream for anybody else when it goes to commercial? I'd be cool with it if it turned back on when the commercials were over, but it doesn't.
HP+ are dead damn silent. I've got them on my DD right now and they don't make a friggin' peep.Hawk Blues squeak like a mofugger. HT-10s are 100% undriveable on the street, but holy gods do they make some noise!
This game is a non-persistent MMO for the online side of things. People need to man up and accept that. The game will be active until the next one drops not only because of single player mods, but because online has progression and RPG elements.
Really hoping next patch gives him real buffs, as they were saying that there was more planned. He seriously got buffed in none of the reasonable ways I'd been harping about.
Your religion is what your parents called themselves (and you) while you were growing up. There's no other criteria. Every christian has different views, many are contradictory (even within themselves).
"Bob Sapp is a freak of nature. He has beat Ernesto Hoost, four time K-1 grand prix champion, one of the greatest kickboxers of all time, at his own game . . . twice. He has beaten Olympic medalists, in Min Soo Kim. His sheer strength is unmatched in combat sports. In over a decade of experience &amp; nearly 60 fights, he has never gone to decision. Bob Sapp comes to kill or be killed."
I guess my problem with the "discussion" was that it glossed over/didn't even mention a lot of the potential pitfalls of paid modding... How can you have a meaningful discussion while completely ignoring legitimate concerns about paid modding. By only addressing the concerns about paid modding that support one side of the argument, you are left with meaningless half truths. 
Ah, thank you. Then I'm guessing Curvy Kate wouldn't work good for me because I'm narrow and projected as well. Would Elomi or Goddess be similar to Curvy Kate? When you referred to them as wide, did you mean wide wires? Anything with wide wires is uncomfortable on me. If I were to try Panache or Freya, would I potentially have to get a different size? That's what I'm really wondering is if they are consistent with a Cacique 38F or not.
I don't think consensus has to be reached for a dude who constantly quits games to be generally regarded of as a dude that constantly quits games. At a certain point, public opinion becomes an objective, observable trend.
In my opinion, the BEST position is the one which allows you to write comfortably for whatever amount of time you need to write.  Adjusting your hand, wrist, arm, etc. to some position you're uncomfortable using is the wrong way to write.To hell with "convention" or aesthetics - be a slave only to your own needs.

I'll be honest, having had to teach 13/14 year old girls is the one of the most difficult things ever and you have to have patience and clear discipline to not go crazy.That said, maybe it's the hormone enhanced beef or milk or something, but I'd swear some of them look much older.
I love how people come up with these things. That's one of the awesome parts of having a mathematical mind: you think of unusual things like this, and it's absolutely brilliant. And, they had a good reason to eat lots of chicken nuggets! Maybe we can apply some physics to McDonald's... :)
Before other free thinking middle of the road people get swept onto the Reddit Wave of Derp I think we should pause for a second and recall the "eye witnesses" from the Mike Brown shooting.
This is completely off topic but I am interested to know how you two (you and your gf) became romantically involved.Is it something similar to Orange is the New Black trans girl? (Basically he(she) tells his wife he identifies as female and the wife supports him(her) more or less)Are you attracted to men and women?Genuinely currious. Hope I don't offend.
No. It isn't. Jesus Christ you people just do not fucking get it. Once companies in an industry get an idea they **will not stop trying iterations of it** until it works for them. Its not over until valve gets it's mod integration. What happened to "forgive but never forget". Don't let them forget.
No, this is what I actually think, being a Cantonese-speaking person, the CCP is a threat to my "ethnic" group and my heritage. Imperial Britain is not.I would like to see a reference where the British killed hundreds of thousands during their occupation of HK. Still, that's lower than the death count of the CCP and the Japanese army.The CCP is a huge BS factory that leans on the "150-year humiliation" to distract from actual problems they are responsible for.I guess you like the PRC for "standing up" against white people?
Ya I believe all girls have some sort of flashback explaining why they are there and increasing their backstory so you feel like you know them more, but I'm pretty sure Amane's is by far the longest taking up most of her route.
Without ads then people could rely on a donation model which is the less intrusive and more ethical means of acquiring money from people who use websites. If every person like you that sits around espousing the virtue of giving developers money for their hard-work actually sent them some cash then they would probably earn quite a bit more. But I bet you aren't doing that, are you? LOL.
JonTron is about the only YouTuber I really follow nowadays.As for podcasts, I'm really into [SleepyCast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5i73-Udg4665ybe6BxlzYA). It's the first and only podcast I've gotten into. Keep meaning to find more and yet I keep forgetting.

Thanks! The whole "garbage bag thing" was some hair-brained scheme I concocted when I made the decision that the shingle scraps I had laying around were garbage. I included that pic to remind everyone (including myself): To 'un-fuck' your project while you still can. 
Some more SGA, the increased revive speed is enough to allow you to sprint through your team mate's ghost and revive them without stopping. It seems like so very few people notice and it really can make all the difference.
I put my headphones into the audio jack of the stereo and it sounds fine there. I guess I'll just have to live with it as long as the CDJs aren't causing the problem.
Yeah, I would have stabbed him back with a quickness. Not hard enough to draw blood, but enough to get the point across. That's how I was raised...Then, you know, if the dad acts like a typical breeder about it, just claim, "Oh, I thought we were playing..."
Have you ever watched a draft before? This year is flying compared to normal years. Teams normally take the entire 10 minutes, then the 3-4 minutes delay in between each. This is fantastic. 
No, the pens unused so you cannot even see the plunger. I had a sample of that specific type, its 30% intermediate acting &amp; 70% fast acting. Its real cloudy and not clear like normal long &amp; short acting insulin's.
Yeah it is Ive built plenty of things but once I did the rifle I just wanna build more! And do cool things to them lol. It sucks being a broke highschool student 😂
And since the True Patronus can resurrect, AK fueled by the power of indifference is now a really useful unblockable, unstoppable one-hit-knockout that works on anything with a brain (unless I'm missing something). Just AK, stun, then resurrect. Because does it really matter whether this enemy combatant retains use of their computational substrate / meatpuppet in the next couple of decaseconds, given that you're about to stun them regardless?

IPL would really probably help you out tremendously, especially for blotchiness and sun spots. I quickly looked up what it *wasn't* for, and it's not intended for [wrinkles or loose skin](http://www.drhasen.com/non-surgical/ipl.cfm). You seem to be good on that front.I'm on RealSelf a lot (I'm obsessed with learning about aesthetic procedures) and so I searched for IPL really quickly. One woman left a [review](http://www.realself.com/review/lihue-ipl-works-board-certified-plastic-surgeon) that says, "I want to write this review to show what can happen when IPL is done right. I had my first IPL treatment in September 2013 with Dr. Bao Phan. After reading horror stories and the pictures that went with them, I avoided going anywhere where the laser wasn't operated by an MD."Bottom line: see a certified professional if you do decide to do it.
About where your beliefs come from. They come from the things you are emotionally invested in, that's pretty fucking obvious. I merely suggest you become involved in something constructive instead of meekly bickering hoping it changes something. Do you not realize that this level of communication is itself violent and destructive, and hence nothing of value can come of it? We can only argue, my point of view is seen as an invasive species and you instinctively destroy it, as if it were infecting your mind. Or You find other people to side with you and it becomes a common effort to destroy the mirrors that remind you of your ugliness.

IMHO I don't think it should be more than 1 or 2 just because of the recent precedent set by the Celtics game.They suspended Kelly for intentionally pulling K Love and injuring him and they had to have deemed it intentional for a suspension so I don't think this is 4 to 5 times worse than that.Especially since it followed a non called cheap shot and he isn't a repeat offender.I definitely think he should be suspended and needs to learn his lesson but 3-5 seems quite harsh.

A bit of feedback on your project: I like the idea. I checked out the tumblr and it's nice to see the writeups, I'd suggest copying them into a reddit comment on each post so folks from here can still get the information. More importantly, I'd like to see them fleshed out a little bit. The detail is nice but you don't really address what the soundtracks *sound* like, and I know I'm more likely to click on a long video if you sell me on it first.Good work, though. I'll be keeping an eye on this.
We can't make them end it, every time they'd push, we'd win a fight. Problem was that we couldn't push into their base because the techies had everything mined. We really needed a bkb on our carries for that but they didn't see the value in one.

The problem is when you wind up having to watch this over and over, several times a day, for no reason other than a company advertising to you thinks you already bought, for which you don't make the purchasing decision.
For some reason while glancing over this I read that as "suicide note he left for his wife."Like, he ate these plums and felt so guilty about it that he wrote this poem as an apology, stuck it on the refrigerator with a magnet and then offed himself.

Scientology followers are batshit insane. They stalk and harass you for life, and try to set up ways for you to get injured by proxy, like cutting breaks or pouring water on your sidewalk if it's freezing temperature. 
During my current and last semester of high school, my English teacher when asking my friend from Nigeria to turn off the light jokingly says " I asked you cause you're black, and you know slavery and stuff." There was a solid few minutes of silence due to the shock of what our teacher had just  said, followed by the entire classroom echoing with awkward laughter. 
What about a thread that updates automatically?  That's basically a chat room.. anyway IDK how good it is for other teams, but the sbnation.com team sites have gameday threads and (at least for Dallas) they're pretty active.  
I have officially been to 4 different salons this year because I am so tired of the awkward conversations. I constantly have to worry if the next one will fuck my hair up. It is absolutely awful, I go to one and we awkwardly look at each other in the mirror while he/she asks me 1 question about how I met my husband and then it's over. 
&gt; They also do match analysis of high level players, and that's your best chance to get inside a melee master's head.I know in one of Mango's analyses he says explicitly that he doesn't say everything he's thinking because he can't give it all away (and it would take too long).
AND WITH THE 5TH PICK OF THE NFL DRAFT THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS SELECT BRETT FUCKING HUNDLEY NOW EAT A SLOPPY JOE BUT INSTEAD OF GROUND BEEF ITS DIARRHEA 
Is the aim of the policy simply to save lives, or to save lives *within Australian waters*?Because if it's the latter, it could be argued the policy is proving very effective; all 4800 drownings were not Australia's responsibility, or within Australia's power to save. 
Yeah, we have a msp looking into it right now. I think buying a couple of routers for each end of the pipe and applying the shaping on those should do the trick. Thanks!

No it doesnt reset but say you log in at 5:32pm, it might register as 2:32pm, then the next day you can collect it starting at 2:32pm. That *might* to be the case.
I felt that there where so many WR in this draft, but only one all-around best athlete... Cooper will be a reliable, consistent performer. ...but Williams would have been a beast.
I get that the friend was trying to help, and I'll admit that "enraged" was a strong word on my behalf, but yes, the friend calling it a personal space issue would have led to an annoyed eyebrow raise on my behalf.I'm sorry that you see this as a caveman/cavewoman thing, and I'm afraid that I still can't quite wrap my head around that. I don't advocate starting fights with strangers, but I do advocate dealing with situations like these in a way that doesn't leave room for interpretation that might lead a person like that to feel welcome to stick around and hang out at that table.  I agree with you that OP is a very smart person, and as I said before, I think she stood up for herself and handled this very, very well. 
Wtf since when do people here think Williams is 10x better than Cooper. Both will be stars at the next level, one just plays for offense and one plays for defense 
My mothers side came here in the late 1800's and settled in Surrey Centre. Built the first church, and a large amount of ALR belonged to them up until recently.

The thing that bothers me about it is the message "Your free trail is over" when there was nothing in the original Textra app about it being a free trail. 
Because real women don't want to be topless because their "gender identity" tells them so right? It couldn't be because women's bodies are regarded as inherently sexual by society and thus a topless woman is either considered an obscene taboo or considered as being sexually provocative.

I hate how they act that Rollins stole the win from Reigns at Mania like Reigns was about to win kayfabe. No, Reigns just took like his 4th or 5th F5. He stole the title from Lesnar. Little stuff like this bothers me. 
It is speculation,  but I also used to work with abused kids and teenagers. So it's definitely my opinion, but I've also seen this acting out behavior dozens of times. 
This is my stance. I'm not upset that all my favorites are getting voted out; I'm upset that the show now consists of people who range from mildly annoying to full-out awful. With each passing week, the ratio of people I like and am interested in to people I don't decreases, and each passing week is progressively less fun to watch. That's all it is.
Similar request:I'm on a lowly 8GB phone. Sync, by far, uses the largest cache of all my apps. But, I don't really use the sync functionality. So, I just manually clear the cache every week, but if it could be disabled, that would be neat. And, yes, I get the irony of disabling sync, lol. 
That's significantly different from what you got. And if this is some sort of official promotion, you deserve the prize. I'd definitely contact official channels about it.
it kinda feels like they actually DEcreased the drop rate.. yesterday i actually saw some portals linked in map chat after VW (like one every other VW), but today, nothing...

So which quarterback are Browns going to pick at either one of their picks? From what I heard Manziel absolutely tanked last year (Hopefully he works on all his personal problems and starts to feel better). And who should the 49ers pick in the first round? We lost some good players this year.

Considering how big they are, the return on rebuilding CVS might be worth the liability. Whatever they do, it's almost assured that all the family businesses that provided niche services (small grocers, hair salons, dry cleaning, restaurants) will pull out because they can't afford to take the risk, draining the community of jobs and services that might never fully return.

As well as the shape of the plane, the entire body of the f15 is designed to generate lift, allowing for a huge body and smaller wings, hence why an Israeli one flew without a wing and landed. Something like the Typhoon however, which has a very small body and large delta wings would most probably fall out of the sky like a brick.
All constant functions f(x) = k have the same output k by definition.

You don't prepare for it, really.  I had no prior experience whatsoever, while half of my classmates are made up of former dental assistants or hygienists.  I'm probably in the top 25% of clinical skills/tests so far, when I have no artistic ability that I know of otherwise.  Everyone is all over the map skill-wise.  Everyone gets it eventually.  School is practically 40 hours a week in the classroom and 20-30 hours of outside study, so you live and breath dentistry/medicine.  I love it.
I was there when it was P2P, when IMC said said GE would revolutionize mmos with multiple character control.I was there when pre-2010 gamer blogs say it was a alternate choice than FF11 due to MCC and character design and sound track.I was there when it became F2P which included a lot of paywalls.I was there when they reduced the paywalls and replaced with P2W items.I was there when they placed lyndon boxes for exclusive premium characters.All these features were in all GE servers, if you've been following GE blog regarding the latest contents. The only GE server that I have no say is the private server.I loved the ideas of Hakkyu kim the father of RO/GE/ToS and the designs of Maggi, ToS art director and GE character designer, however its just wishful thinking that IMC would not make a P2W game based on over the years of following GE.
I'd agree with you if the area was stable and could take such an event in its stride. Alas, the Middle East is an absolute clusterfuck, if SA fell, something worse would appear and take its place. I imagine ISIS-esque extremists. Either that, or civil-war. At this point, a falling SA is nothing but bad news. They are cunts, but the region is better off with them there for the moment. 
Serious question - If you need to park next to a bike lane, how do you go about it on a busy street such as SE Hawthorne or N Williams?Pulling along side a vehicle and then parallel parking seems next to impossible during rush hour.
After reading the article, it didn't seem to me he was being a snarky Hollywood bunghole, unlike what the title seemed to suggest. Oh, media. You got me again with your adorable clickbait ways.Seriously though, RDJ is on point, and I don't think he'll catch a lot of flak because of his remarks here.  Soderbergh still makes indies (or indie style) films, but they are well made and thematically coherent, so I guess he wasn't spitting on indie filmmakers per se, just the unprofessionally inclined and unnecessarily messy productions, imo.

Maybe something related to his lore, like:&gt; "The same dark magic that shattered the Graven King's invasion of the Satrapy into a million shards of possibilities obscures the fate of Nerif and his allies in battle."Obscure fate as in some spells work against them and some don't, and they may live or die by the end.
i would switch wingbacks to complete wingbacks and add look for overlap, have them run wide with ball and get further forward.  attacking mentality is why your conceding so many goals your players stand upfield from opposition players it's really dumb i would switch to control.  but opposition instructions play a part here if you wanna play it like the pros man mark strikers and close down wide players or you can say fk it like i did and close everyone down, tackle hard, man mark strikers and set hassle opponents and close down more on team instructions.short passing and high tempo you wanna move the ball around a lot?  but the game doesn't super duper work like that you need to have the plays one-twos ppm so train your dudes on that.treqs never really worked for me i would switch the ap to something else maybe have him as the dlp-d switch the dlp to a anchorman or hb and switch the treq to an ap and your strikers can play whatever your strikers are best at.
Whenever I tell people my favorite superhero is Superman, I usually get scoffed at. They usually tell me he is unrelatable, and prefer Batman because he is human and they can relate better. I always respond that I can relate better to Superman/Clark. I grew up in a small rural community. I can relate better to someone who grew up in that similar environment and is trying to find his way in the world. Obviously, I don't have Superman's powers but I can relate to feeling like an outsider and striving to make the world a better place with what power I do have.I have more difficulty relating to the loss that Batman feels. My parents are not deceased, and I don't feel that loss or the need for vengeance. Don't get me wrong I like Batman stories too, but I feel sorry for him. He seems lonely and is mistrustful many times. That is not a person I want to be, and hope most don't.
I agree, these people know **much** more than we do about this case, the IP especially. The Innocence Project has access to absolutely everything about the case, and if they seem to think he's innocent it should be enough to at least instill a shred of doubt in your mind.Unless, of course, you're one to believe that this is all a massive conspiracy to get a murderer out of prison.I don't know where I sit, it is a lot easier to say Adnan is guilty than to say he's innocent. I just don't know, and I don't think I'll ever settle on an answer by myself.
I would probably end up bringing a laptop with some games on it, getting a written approval to install 22 printers means 22 documents would be needing approval, which might take a while.
These kids left Birmingham three days ago. We think they're staying in Atlanta with the girl's birth father, who's a fugitive. If you see these kids please call the police. Their names are Johnathan Ketcham and Hannah Gibson. 
Seeing as the L7 used HE, HESH, APCR and HEAT, when they are implemented, they should get GREAT ammo as the stock round. I swear to god if Gaijooby decides to fuck up the L7s, I'm permanently done with WT.
Inb4 golden chromas for mastery... coughsmitecough, lol...Would be amazing though, walking around as a zhonya'd champion and then BAM, you use a real zhonya's. 
No problem! Definitely try to relax... Look on the bright side (of right now, not down the line, because that is the brightest side...babies!), the BD is a lot easier of a job than some of the other things we do on a daily basis! :)
Why do people always make jokes about the Lone Wanderer drinking from the toilets? They're almost always paired with a sink, and in 3 you literally get four times as much radiation drinking from the former as opposed to the latter.
I'm married with small kids so I'm boring. Not much to offer on the "things to do" list, but I know there is quite a lot.  Great food, and everyone here is great. Check out Pacific Ave downtown.  There's a pretty sweet bookstore there too. What I can say is, Welcome!
Ahhhhh, they're probably my top. I jump around from quite a few alternating my most played, but Billy Talent is normally up there. Against Me, Rise Against, Blink-182, Sum-41 are the others, I do listen to loads, but the above are the most common and likely to not be a phase. 
I don't know if/how you will be killed doing this, but can you enlighten me as to how you made this map?  I want to make similar maps but it seems that google maps is beyond my technical know-how.
You're the third person to misread "political" as "police", although I agree about there being problems there...Speaking of "there", I don't know where "here" is to you - I'm in the UK and various people are elsewhere in the world. Probably very few reading this are on Mars though. 
And you don't have to count their deck every game. Just throw it in like once every 3 matches. If everyone did that the cheat would not be worth  running. 
This is eerily similar to the wolves-Kevin love situation. Player gets drafted by incompetent front office. New one comes in but might be few years too late. I could see Demarcus getting traded for sure this summer. 
I just played through Director's Cut and had zero issues whatsoever, aside from an achievement that may or may not have failed to pop.  It was one where you have to use no firearms, explosives, or praxis points for a very long sequence, so I may have failed it and not noticed.

&gt;. . . the Jews didn't have the law written on their hearts. Looking at the wording of the Greek in the Septuagint, it seems to match up with Proverbs 6:20-23,&gt;My son, keep your father’s commandment,and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.&gt;Bind them continually on your heart.Tie them around your neck.&gt;When you walk, it will lead you.When you sleep, it will watch over you.When you awake, it will talk with you.&gt;For the commandment is a lamp,and the law is light. . .
Some shifter fantasy like the Raksura series by Martha Wells Or a animal bond series like Pern/A Companion to Wolves.A culture different than any found on earth (no nuclear families) think Raksura or Rowena Cory Daniells Outcast Chronicles. Finally, gay protagonist book i havent read. ive read most of the well known series.
Remember when the Seahawks' coach Pete Carroll hinted at a first round surprise? Well, it's just history notes for each pick in the NFL draft. Don't expect any trades involving Seattle.EDIT:Why are you downvoting me for telling you guys news about what's happening?EDIT:Sorry about the flair, jerks
I should win because I used to play wii fit and seeing her make me feel all nostalgic and I would give the Ike away to my friend as a surprise gift because I already have one.
Really though? Carr had no weapons last year and the Raiders were the worst offense in the league. If they'd taken Fowler they'd have improved their D sure - but at what cost to Carr's development?I think really, there was no way they "lose" on this pick whether they'd taken Cooper or Williams. Williams gives them youth to pair with Mack, Cooper gives them youth to pair with Carr.
Don't feed your cat when you get out of bed - she's associating you getting up with getting what she wants (the food). I taught my cats when they were kittens that me getting up in the morning will not get them food faster. Instead, I shower or get ready for work first and then feed them before I leave the house. One of my cats tried that meowing shit on my boyfriend and I since we shut our door and not let them in at night. She learned fast after not getting what she was demanding though :)
And on top of that the players go into the hall with no team affiliations. It's not going to be Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, it'll be Brett Favre, quarter back played for the Falcons Packers Jets and Vikings. 
I enjoy the new American Td's and new maps, they bring a whole new field of opportunities to tank game play and the new tanks for all nations allow for some diverse battles
I got a gram of his honey oil a few days ago. I was going to dab last night, open my fridge, its gone. Nowhere to be found, I looked for 7h and dug through the garbage. Rip cheap sample gram T_T Hes a good vendor, stealth and shipping speed.
The Oakland Raiders are slowly becoming one of the smartest drafting teams. I can't believe how right they are here. Williams is better overall player but giving Carr a player like Cooper just makes too much sense. Great pick. (Now let Williams keep sliding to #9!!!)
Oh, certainly.  And it's not the first time I've heard that particular objection, plus you summed it up well.  I just disagree with the objection itself, of course.
I've never understood why people are so adamant that Ghostery is spyware.  Their search rank is optional, so is the/your issue because of the conflict of interest or because it's closed-source?Edit: actually, is Ghostery closed-source? I mean, I know it's not open-source, but is the code readable yet proprietary, akin to TrueCrypt's license?
I have to disagree on that one, I don't think most people are hearing it that way. The "invitation" comment, yeah, that's in terrible taste and is totally ridiculous. But on this point I think you're off-base.
If I'm not mistaken, this appears to be in AU. I'm not sure if there laws are similar to those of the US, but if they are, then bicycles are considered vehicles, and drivers of motorized vehicles (i.e. cars &amp; trucks) are legally required to share the road with them. According to this video, the small space between the curb of the side walk, and the white lane on the street is a designated space for bycicles. If as most other countries, if they normally drive on the left hand side of the street as opposed to the right side, that would explain why she was on the vehicles left side and not the right.
While that's a commendable sentiment, the reality is that hoarders are usually very set in their ways, and the time and resources it would take to even have a chance at turning their life around would be more than most people have to spare.
I have dreamed this for probably 30 years plus now. There is a thrift shop located in a specific place about a twenty minute drive from where I am now, but around the corner from a place I lived in briefly as a kid. There was never a thrift store there, but in my dream world it's a permanent establishment. And it's always about ten minutes to closing time and I'm searching for vintage dresses. I sometimes find dresses my mom used to wear, but they are too small for me.
Why do I find this so sad? It's an inanimate object, yet the thought of it out there, doing its job, serving humans, makes it seem like a greater loss.I once saw a cartoon of Curiosity (?) wanting to come home and I teared up!With thoughts like this, maybe I don't belong on a science subreddit!
Some people don't want to aim for accuracy nowadays. Honestly if this was a movie about Innuits in the 1600's Tundra there would have to be an Aborginal man in there. 
Did I say 'on live servers I am surrounded by avenger2142 that only gets kills because he crutches on the HA'? No. Stop being so sensitive. I'm talking about the bulk of HA you run into. 
I can't say I agree with the pick, but it's definitely the second one I would have made. I think we'll be able to look back on this and smile though at some point, although you have to feel terrible for Williams. 
&gt;"Al evento asistieron un estimado de 150 personas, en su mayoría estudiantes universitarios, les hablaron por 45 minutos, les ofrecieron visas, le ofrecieron todo un paquete de beneficios en las universidades de los EE.UU., a cambio de registrarse en un link de la página web de la embajada", resaltó Cabello.kek, como si fuera tan fácil...
OK, I think we can all agree that there's all kinds of sick and twisted out there; I don't think there's any advantage to be gained in arguing over which is worse than the other.
Yeah, I figured you didn't mean it in the way it came across to me :)  the words just jolted me a bit!  But the thoughts behind them, I can certainly agree with.
It is something I've noticed, the Danish aren't the only ones on that boat though. Anything that comes out of Denmark is by default superior and cannot be criticized on /r/europe. Obviously I do not interact with the Danes on a regular basis in real life, so I tried to refrain judging the entire country but seeing how you're confirming this, I guess it's just sad....
Sorry, I should have said that all major scholars. (This is one of those quirks of the language where someone who has an associates degree level of understanding of the deen and someone who has a PhD are both considered "scholars" on the same level)The [Amman Declaration](http://www.ammanmessage.com) held that all Sunni and Shia who follow their madhab correctly are Muslim.
Yeah I had two interviews. The first one was with a manager over the phone lasting approx 45min. The second was a video interview (I had to download some sort of software the firm uses - scopia? Or something) with the same manager and a partner also around 45min. I received a verbal offer a couple weeks later over the phone from HR. 
and then you'd use MSPaint, and fill in the bottom part of the screen... and then erase out the rooms and corridors of your evil lair.and then they made evil genius. :D
As mentioned, that would be the Total Extreme Wrestling series.TEW 2010 is on Steam and has been as low as $10 recently. TEW 2013 is on the dev's site for $35.2010 is a bit more user-friendly in terms of accessibility of information, but it has a game-crippling flaw which causes long-term game worlds to break down (of course if you get in that far, you've already got your money's worth). 2013 is less friendly, but fixes that flaw.They're more fantasy bookers than management games. To get the most out of them you really have to work within the game's odd logic and use a lot of imagination. Great for diary writers, not so good for players looking for a strategic sports management game.The same dev's MMA series is better, IMO. I like wrestling much more than MMA, but prefer his MMA games.

I actually agree with you. I don't think whatsoever that there is active radicalization within these communities. I do think however that the lone wolves that emerge from such communities are much more likely to embrace Daesh than the lone wolves of other ethnoreligious groups. 
&gt;What tax work did they screw up?4 weeks and counting to produce a tax slip for a taxable transaction (RRSP contribution of stock) with endless back and forth with support to no resolution. &gt;fees2 weeks of service in 2013 and was charged &gt;$150 in fees on Dec 24 of 2014 with an outright refusal to consider a rebate for the 2013 fees (saying it was an 'executive decision'). They charge annual fees for US accounts and RRSP accounts. 'low cost' they are not.The amount of infuriating bullshit i've endured over the last 6 months with this company is outrageous.
You guys have Derek Carr, an up and coming qb, he needs a playmaker to throw to. Amari Cooper will be legit. Did you watch any college football this year?
It really depends on where you go.  My hometown had two hobby shops and the atmosphere couldn't have been more different in them.  There was a dark and musty one that attracted all of the basement-dwellers and then a more well lit one that had a more "normal" crowd.  Still plenty of social awkward people, it's a shop for geeks after all, but a much more inviting atmosphere all the same.
They are specifically made for that fat 70s rock sound drummers got from their toms. I have them on my kit and they sound amazing, especially if you tune them up nice and high and you get a nice 60s jazz tone to your kit 
As someone who is not a pretentious fuck when it comes to that type of thing, I can safely assure you that the vast majority of people who say "chemicals" are fully aware that everything is chemicals. They say chemicals because "harmful chemicals" gets redundant after a few times' saying it, and "carcinogens" is not always accurate.

More like wanker malfunction.    I'm by no means skinny myself (not suggesting you are fat, but others in the thread have suggested it), but do you wear them correctly? Chamois undies aren't meant to be worn like loose fit boxers. Get 'em all up in there! :D
I suddenly feel really old for a couple of reasons. * My nephew is 5 already, where the fuck did the time fly?!?!* It's been 21 years since Senna and Ratzenberger died. I can still remember watching that race on TV. 
Yeah, I'm 5'-7". As a young man, I always thought it looked kind of comical attached to my (then) 145 pound body. I wish I would have taken a chance and tried porn. I could have Eiffel towered Victoria Paris, with Tom Byron (80's porn stars)! ;)
Nope, it's not you. Even my fiancee, who was only paying a little attention, commented on it. I always watch the NXT enhancement talent carefully because you never know who will show up. Blue Pants and Murphy both started as jobbers. This girl was a little disappointing.
Your outfit in the second one looks nice but I think it would look better with tighter pants? Idk maybe it's just me but a loose top and loose jeans seem to clash.

Oh my goodness, I am married to an ENTJ and he struggles constantly with this. He will sand a piece of carpentry work until it is almost ruined. It took him 2 months to perfect his business logo/business cards. I don't think this person is feeling sorry for themselves. They are obviously an ENTJ just like my husband and the drive is a part of who they are. It is a real struggle to enjoy what the rest of us see are successes but all ENTJ's can think about are how to make it better. 
I think sanctioned killing is bad. War is death. War is evil, killing is killing no matter if its under a flag or in a back alley.Many conspiracy guys like Alex Jones (people you'd call right wing or extreme conservative) in contrast praise the militaryObama doesn't act alone, he doesn't write laws, he hardly reads them. It's a group of people, in this case an oligarchy that exercises much of the power of government. Occasionally the people get a say.......I hope it's just an exercise, or that its a preparation for intel of an ISIS invasion to defend our nation better.If I believe 90% its just an exercise an 10% something nefarious, I'm still going to talk about it. The point is to talk about it and share information, to debate like you're doing here, thank you.
The set's odds do not change. They are still 51/52. The only two possibilities are that you picked the right card, or that the card is somewhere in the other set. If you did not pick the correct card the first time (and we know what the odds of that happening are), it will, with absolute certainty, be the other remaining card. Therefore, the odds of the other card being the right one are still the 51/52 from the first choice.
Yep, I just traded in my 360 S for the deal and got a $50 gift card on top, once I purchased it.  Also used my $5 credit and if you buy an xbox one, you can get xbox live 12 months for $40.
Excellent! If you have time and like the book (or even if you don't like the book) could you leave a review on Amazon for it? Either way, thanks and good luck!
[](/twiponder) Well, I would not say that it is fine in the first one. Yes, it is supposed to sound embarrassing, but not painful for the audience, and I think it is. But then again, maybe it is just me. I think the second one is alright. Decent. But I can not hear the first one without feeling uncomfortable.
I wouldn't stress too much over it.  People will only judge you based on your score everywhere you go, and you will judge your self-worth based on that.

For me there really is no one thing that makes an Anime good. I had fantastic times with fascinating, story driven shows just as much as with "mindless" fanservice comedys. Considering that, it's probably easier to say what I dislike:1. Painfully forseable plots2. Characters acting completly braindead when it's not their specific character trait3. Bad sound design... and to be honest, even those things by themselves don't necessarily ruin an Anime for me.
Actually, I haven't been paying extra from them. It was a free upgrade from 100/10. I also have no data caps, never had one in my life. CC on the other hand, I know they do much more shady things to their customers.
Checking in with your local trans* communities is generally fairly helpful, the some of the more organized ones do tend to to keep track of what doctors/psychs people are using and who is helpful and what not.
Close, I cook specific pasta because it seams to make my favorite sauces taste better. Vodka cream sauce tastes so much better on filled pasta then spaghetti.

&gt;Or maybe just take it upon yourself to be a more thorough reader when this subject comes up. It seems important to you to have "actually seen it happen"Oh trust me I do read a lot of this kind of material when it comes up. &gt;Luckily those comments tend be frequent when discussing topics like this, so it shouldn't take you that long.Well see, that's the point I'm challenging here. I don't actually think that comments like this are common at all, so I think that it would in fact take me a very long time to find one. But if you think it would only take a short amount of time, please feel free to find one and prove me wrong. If they are really as common as you say it shouldn't be that much of a burden, right?

A friend of mine takes his out when we play in open games at Splatterpark. He refuses to even shoulder it and shoots from the hip John Rambo style. It definitely turns heads when he's charging like a mad man, one arming it as if it were an M60 in an '80s action film.
tbh I doubt he looks at it much. When you have that many subreddits, your inbox and modmail are going to be orange all the time. He probably just marks all read out of habit and moves on.

Wonder if it has anything to do with that Sable brush ban in the US last year. Perhaps they have finally run out of stock in the US and therefore need to make new ones. I dunno if it's still illegal to import sable into the US.

Imagine that you're an intelligent and successful Mexican American business owner. You're conservative, you don't like taxes, you want to be free of government regulations. Cruz is Cuban American. They see themselves at the top of the Hispanic hierarchy. They think that Mexicans are just above Puerto Ricans at the bottom. Cruz, the religious right's "messiah", comes before you and lies, blatant unfathomable easily disproven lies. I'd be just a bit offended.

You need a cohesive group of smart people.  Mainly because they have seen it and written about it and studied it.  They minimize risk and don't work people to death.The typical middle manager person that ascended into software...just because...doesn't really care about the software process, they just want stuff done so they don't get yelled at by the CEO.Academics just have a way about them that I appreciate.  They typically think out the process in rational ways as opposed to just getting stuff done.

I don't really have an opinion on it other than it is a temporary solution and the larger problem is a societal one. It is my firm belief that people should always be treated as innocent until proven guilty. This includes the false assumption that all men are sexual deviants and that trans people should be treated unfairly because there might be someone lying about being trans. Similar laws based in the US and here is the result: http://mediamatters.org/research/2014/03/20/15-experts-debunk-right-wing-transgender-bathro/198533TLDR: There is no increase in bathroom related crimes and there is no known cases where someone used the bathroom claiming to be trans to commit a crime. This is probably the same for change rooms.
Congrats! Going to school is a pretty great experience. I left when I was 17 and started at my local CC 3 months later. Really got me out of my what do I do now funk and learned social skills.
If you wouldn't do it yourself is more to accentuate 'if you wouldn't do this why are you trying to force me to?'. It's even more inconsiderate and awful than begging someone to do something you yourself would do. 
[](/ajbook) The Polish dub has "znaczki", which means just "marks". That term is also accepted by anyone in the fandom while discussing cutie marks, whether they prefer the dubbed version or not. [](/sp)[](/ajugh-r) However, the CMCs call themselves "Znaczkowa liga", which, as you might guess, means "League of Marks". I'd call that a teensy weensy bit less cringy than the German version. Still bad though.

This is pretty clear:The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion TakenThe less you take, the more likely that your copying will be excused as a fair use. However, even if you take a small portion of a work, your copying will not be a fair use if the portion taken is the “heart” of the work. In other words, you are more likely to run into problems if you take the most memorable aspect of a work. For example, it would probably not be a fair use to copy the opening guitar riff and the words “I can’t get no satisfaction” from the song “Satisfaction.”This rule — less is more — is not necessarily true in parody cases. **A parodist is permitted to borrow quite a bit, even the heart of the original work, in order to conjure up the original work.** That’s because, as the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “the heart is also what most readily conjures up the [original] for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim.” (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510 U.S. 569 (1994).)

This used to be easy pre- Art of War, you can just blob and get lots of papal influence. But now its too random and frankly it doesn't make much sense. Obviously if I had Rome under my control and every other Catholic nation is so much weaker, I should have the say on who becomes the next pope.
I went to Chile on my mission. My heart hurts so bad right now for these sisters. :( I was very dumb when I was down there--going to dangerous areas, entering shady looking houses and the like--it's just not fair that this happened to them. Probably walking four together for more safety. I'm glad the carabineros have them (the perpetrators) in custody, because no South American prison is going to be kind to those guys.And the fact that I'm glad about that sickens me. But doesn't change the fact. I'm not a good person :/
* Learn to listen well.  * Work hard and offer to do the things others don't like to do.* Keep learning.* Deliver excellent patient care.* Respect others work and rolesThose things, not a certification or title, make you respectable.  The only people who respect a certification are those who are not familiar with how little you actually do.
I feel like a large portion of people in this thread are taking what Nick said out of context, which is exactly what "SJW" do to TB all the time... Do people not see the hypocrisy? I guess this issue is just as polarizing as gamergate, but still I always thought people on this sub were a little but more reasonable.
You are very kind and thoughtful. Thank you, xv323.And you're right - she taught humility, mixed with love, patience and values that last a lifetime.
I hope we lock him up for 4 years. He had 28 goals. Kid can play. 4 mill a year. I assume he's only gonna get better. I love the goose. A lot of you guys seem pretty down on him I don't get it. 
No kidding.  Those on ramps aren't that long. You need to be allowed in or you have to slow or some other scary shit to get in.   Guy's not going to get where he going any sooner by blocking you.
I'm going to start ICF soon, the most lifting I do is at my stocking job lifting water/boxes of juice. Do I start at just the bar for main lifts and then add onto that or start at whatever feels comfortable?
**LEVEL 3 FAILED :(**The dependencies can't be shared with other constructors.BTW notice how with every level it's starting to look more like a normal method:    class App {        function foo() { return new Foo(new BarImpl('foo'), new BarImpl('bar')); }     }
PODEMOS necesitará también de la propaganda y apoyará a los medios de desinformación masiva. Intentará hacerlo sólo con los que le apoyen, como todos, pero la Ley intenta que se haga imparcialmente, de forma que los que se sientan perjudicados lo denunciarán. Al final habrá que pactar con unos y otros. Exactamente lo mismo que ocurre ahora ¿Cambio?
Do circumcised  guys wash their penis when they pee?  I don't think so.  Trust that men with intact penises  know how to care for them (as much as circumcised  guys do). Genital mutilation  is barbaric and immoral.  You should  be ashamed of yourself. 
It's recoil mitigation. In all seriousness, I'm surprised it could even wrap its fat nasty hand around the grip. On another note, someone teach this stupid-ass blob what trigger discipline is before she kills someone.
No...it's real and proven, like it actually has a mass and stuff that scientists found. I don't have my notebook on me right now but I can bring in my Science Inquiry notebook that explains why. It's a course where we look at mysteries from a scientific point of view and usually just end up revealing a bunch of stuff as fake. Most of the astrology stuff is real but not completely understood yet. Dark Matter falls in that category.
If you like Teddyloid, his music has a very, very heavy French electronic music influence. So you've got guys like Madeon, Martin Solveig, with the most popular being Daft Punk and even David Guetta making similar sounding music. Though, just avoid Guetta's radio stuff and just listen to his album exclusive tracks.
I totally agree with this, but in a different way... [MAJOR AFTER STORY SPOILERS](/s "After Nagisa dies giving birth is when Tomoya experiences the most growth... and learned to live with Ushio. So... why did Ushio die, and then somehow it went back to the scene where Nagisa dies just to make her live? And even if he remembered everything that happened, there's no explanation in the show why his conciousness went back in time to that moment. It doesn't make sense, and it totally wipes out his experience in episode 18 with Ushio. I hate that ending so much. Probably my least favorite as well.")
I don't know. There's still a lot of people in China and then Indian and then Africa who are still hoping to buy there first car some day. Just look at the evolution of the cigarette industry which is now more globally profitable then ever while slowly dying in the developed world.  Obviously, technology will change drastically over the next 100 years, but seems like fossil fuels still have a lot of runway. Certainly enough time to still make money.

That's pretty cowardly.  It isn't like she didn't know what he was doing from the beginning.  Everyone knew what he was doing.  It's just now that he was in front of congress and all the other stuff that she does something.  But hey, if it makes you money and not too many people are complaining it must be good, right?
Some clinics allow benzo scripts and others don't.  Just call the few local clinics in your area if you have that option and ask then what their policy is on prescription benzos.  If they allow them, go check em out.  If they don't allow them anywhere, you're going to have to make the decision which one is better... being on methadone or being on benzos.
Yes. Everytime I update the script you need to redownload the script to get the latest version. I'm not sure if xmod has updated yet for the newest clash udpate. Try checking cydia to see if their app has an update available.
Me! I had already set up my phone and added stuff before I heard about rooting. I am not scared of resetting my phone since most of my stuff is backed up, I just don't really know what I'm doing and don't want to mess up my phone :(SOS 
I will give you the "how did she start up" thing, because that's a legitimate question. But I can't give you the gray boy thing. All she'd have to do is kill him (which is possible) and then claim his shard before he resets. He's not unkillable. He just resets. So all she has to do is kill him and claim it quick. As for how she got her other powers at first? Could be a death touch. But I feel we should have heard more about her death touch if she can kill a completely healthy cape with just a touch. Like where is her striker rating?? Why isn't it mentioned outright? I won't say it's impossible. I stopped saying it was impossible awhile ago. I still don't buy death touch for a full health cape. 
His lawyer said in his closing argument that Hernadez WAS at the muder scene, when a good part of the case was trying to discredit the fact that he was. His attorney was even trying to discredit a footwear expert who's testimony put Hernandez there.  Why would you go through the trouble to prove he's not there only to drop a bomb in the closing statement and say he was?  
No, there was one back in the day that would research you and post paragraphs worth of personal info. Admins ended up banning him/her. The stuff the poster above had can be found using one of those reddit detective sites.
I'm not "against" her in any way. Just underwhelmed with her performance on the show. She isn't great at performance challenges, and the area where you'd THINK she'd be delivering (the runway) isn't anything special either. She still hasn't come close to topping her 2nd or 3rd week looks, and we're at top 6, which is making people get bored with her.
This is a very common problem. Too many people focus on the first shipment. It is not the first shipment you will be screwed but the last. It is your job to realize when the last shipment left the dock.
i feel like another mechanic that really turns off new players in the same way is stun.  temporarily losing control of your character for a then-unknown reason can feel really bad in the early game. even more stunning in normal is a consequence of increasing monster damage values, which is something i think GGG should be very aware of.
Well there's a revealing phrasing- I can see how this might confuse you given your inventing a fantasy life to impress strangers with, but I don't need to tell myself anything. Is that why you make all this stuff up, to try and feel good about yourself?
Because it's the one year anniversary of when I found out I was pregnant with baby iconocast, and I therefore get to shit on everyone's ideas about their own fertility.  YOU'RE WELCOME.
*Kyohi scowls, trying to hide her distaste for the monster's ear-bleeding cry. She quickly switches to her arm blade and runs towards the Grimm that pounced on Valerie, slashing downwards with her blade to attack it's neck.*
It's equally dumb if it's with a stranger. Who knows what the person has, who they've been with, or what they'll do in the morning.That chick who is all over a guy may be looking for a baby daddy, after all. It's not just women who have to worry about being taken advantage of. 
This just came across my Facebook wall. I'm not surprised, Bernie's strength is in engaging conversation and answering questions. I hope to see him doing it a lot more often. I'd also like to see him on The Daily Show a few times before Jon leaves. And hell, why not with Stephen Colbert when he comes back? 
You, sir, have good taste.Although, the Nana x Nobuo ship leaves me a little bitter because [](/s "of how quickly it sank. That was the fucking Titanic of anime relationships right there.")
The office is closed right now,  I'm going to call them tomorrow..  After the initial panic of my gum profusely bleeding it's seems to be ok, however I think I'm going to change dentist and get someone to look at the extractions it and make sure heres nothing else up there. 
No, never worked in asset management... I've just worked in generic GL/AR/revenue stuff in my two years thus far.Oh well, I'll just finish the exam by the end of this year and then see where it takes me from there. But I would like to hear stories of people breaking in from private to public. Some people mention that smaller firms might be more willing to take someone like myself on. 
Now see, here's the thing... when I was in about 4th grade in the  seventies, I came home and sat next to my Dad who was a cop, and said, "Hey how was your day, bastard?"  Because I heard it being said around school and didn't know better.    My Dad caught me with a charlie horse to my thigh and said, "Don't you ever say that to me again."  I never did, and the only thing I suffered were hurt feelings for the night and a bruise to remind me to be respectful and not take the playground shit back into the house.  Good guy Dad!  :D   Point being that shit needs to start at home.  If not, then this attitude needs to be nipped in grade school.  The Seventies were a most excellent decade to be brought up in.
I ordered mine in the 15th and then is shipped on the 17th... still no sign of it yet. i emailed him 8 days ago about the order and he did not respond so I pm him and asked for updates. He told me that he is no mail man and does not give out constant updates...
He supported the AMBER alert system, but voted against it because there were sentencing provisions tacked on the bill, which he felt were unconstitutional.
Do you love Dachshunds as much as you like living in Alaska? Cold place for those pups! So you like Game of Thrones and books, have you read the books? I suck at Dark Souls, Counter Strike, Day Z, Banished, and Monster hunter; you'd kick my ass! Have you upgraded to the latest iOS on your iPhone?? You should! I also like discussing fitness, nutrition, dogs, hardware, and phones.

I apologize again. I didn't mean to disparage what Criminologists do, merely wonder if there was much tangible change to reflect their work. That said, the only crime data that I'm presently aware of is the FBI Uniform Crime Report. Would that have been gathered by FBI Criminologists? I thought it was just a running tally that every office was required to keep for bookkeeping purposes.
What an excellent day. [This](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/yay2.gif) is for you!Congratulations on the sushi, the state of your uterus, the symbiote's beating heart, the mortgage approval, and the prospect of a bigger house!
&gt;Worst part is I laughed :(Don't feel too bad.  At least you're acknowledging it now.  I was also a dick to the weird kids in school because I didn't want to get picked on.  
Really it just depends on the amount of good and positive Bernie memes that are made. The more positive ones we flood the net with, the more likely one of those goes viral and starts to inform people. More people were mocking Paul. More people were praising Obama. Most Obama memes are about him just being a boss. 
This could be what your dad wanted to tell you when he was alive, but never got a chance to.  The people you love can't read your mind, you have to talk to them.
Yes. Most cakes are fine to bake beforehand. Generally, if you are going to add frosting, ganache, fruit, or anything else moist, you want to wait as long as possible on those and do assembly as close to when you serve it as possible. After you bake the cake, turn it out on a rack and let it cool COMPLETELY. Then wrap tightly in a couple layers of plastic wrap. I live in an arid climate, so I generally leave cakes on the counter unless it's a very moist recipe. If you are in a more humid or hot place, you probably want to put it in the fridge. The things you have to worry about are the cake drying out, or the opposite of getting moldy (again usually only an issue with high moisture content).

Your reply here fits very well to my reply to your original comment, so I will just add that the matchmaking advocates are starting a discussion that could have an unforeseen negative impact on the end-game content.  I am not talking about you specifically here, so don't take anything personal.  I fail to see how matchmaking will not be a first step in a series of steps that lead to raids that everybody can finish easily.  I want content that will be so challenging that you will need a good, dedicated team to finish it.  Complainers calling Bungie 'arrogant' and 'self-entitled' over this issue is what irks me.
I want to say it's been going on the past couple of weeks. Might have started longer, but I took a break from browsing Reddit other than one or two posts up until recently. 
I actually just looked at him as I had completely forgotten what shirt I was wearing and was trying to figure out how I knew him. I then figured it out and laughed and said "your boys gotta shut up, stop trying to fight everyone and just play baseball."

People don't understand this stuff at all, nothing you stated was opinion that was all fact.Unknown Memory is a better debut album than illmatic is technically fact, but opinion would be "I like Unknown Memory better than I like Illmatic"It's kind of depressing that people don't understand that opinion by definition cannot be right or wrong. I think people get confused because there are facts that aren't or can't be proven. Like God is real isn't an opinion, but we can't prove it either way. 
Geoff Johns is filling a similar role on DC Entertainment ' s end. Zack was hired to direct and produce a few films, but he works for his production company, not DCs. 
Mr. Twellman, what is the rush? It is a process. MLS is getting there. It is getting closer, and it will catch up eventually. Meanwhile, please, calm down, and enjoy...
OP, another option that you might want to consider are the Rocketbladez Tour irons. I hit both the Tours and the Bio Cell+ the same. They are also probably cheaper. Mileage may vary though. 
I completely agree with you on your argument about the global market. Spot on. But you are the one misusing statistics. /u/bkrn is correctly defining means and medians and their use. Average=mean, not median. 
Normally, I'm that guy who gets offended when Staples Center shows our Stanley Cup banners on the Jumbotron when Pia gets to "...Banner yet wave!," but I'm guessing you're the guy who goes stomping on the team logo in the locker room.  I think for the Isles, showing respect for the team banners shows no disrespect for the American Flag since sports in America has generally been about civic pride, and that's the sentiment many ITT are trying to express.
I know, and he grew up a Raider fan. Could have been 2 drafts in a row Raiders ran away with the best player. Not that Cooper can't potentially provide more impact going forward but the Raiders would have a young scary Front 7 with Williams. 
Since you're adjusting it correctly, I'm at a loss as to what would cause the symptoms you're describing. Maybe time to ask someone with a higher skill level at torch repair. I go through these guys for rebuilds: http://www.regulatortorchrepair.com Thelast basketcase I sent them was a completely trashed and abused Victor straight cutting torch and the total bill was $55 - came back  in 2 weeks good as new. It's about the fourth or fifth reg/torch rebuild I've sent them in as many years, and so far they've treated me square on every time.
Downvote?  What?  It wasn't an insult -- she's been traveling all over the place working her ass off trying to feed all us hungry children.  She deserves a nap for all her efforts, no?
I agree that Henderson is more effective further forward, but I think Coutinho really thrives in a forward, central position.  With our lack of penetration I don't think we can afford to lessen Coutinho's offensive influence to get more from Henderson.  In your set up I think I'd swap Henderson and Coutinho.I also really like the idea of Lucas and Can alongside each other.  Solid.
I like DG for their hyper paranoid, angry, 'losing your mind' type lyrics and how they mix it with super esoteric ideas. Plus the style is exceedingly novel and innovative. Ride has almost 5 different types of vocals he uses. This is almost closer to aesop rock or stylistically but actually seems like it fits in with an older time period and the lyrics aren't super deep like Aesop's. The lyrics remind me of RATM. I'm not here to say it's bad. I think there is potential. It just would be cooler if it were more emotive and had a different style. 
Well I'm not a teacher but I've got this one:When I was in high school my AP Biology (advanced placement, college level course) told me that I was going to hell because I was an atheist. This came about in a discussion about evolution and the merits it lacks. It was fun. 
Had both at the brewery last month and if you didn't know ahead of time that the yeast was the only change in the two you'd guess they were two totally different beers.  I like both of them but Ponce is definitely my favorite, what an awesome beer.
You know, half the time I catch myself upvoting people because they've been downvoted into oblivion by a bunch of self righteous cunts. - Remember when voting, It's not about if you agree or disagree with them. That's not what the upvote/downvote system is there for. It's to regulate things that are off topic. If someone talks in a hardware review thread about a purple monkey - that would be the appropriate time to downvote.
Well at least it's consistent. But even so $9 million still sounds quite high for a referendum. I might have search google and see if I can't find a breakdown of costs.

I worked with kids who had emotional/behavioral diagnoses. It was very, VERY draining emotionally and physically. We were to teach them life skills and how to interact successfully in society. We would vent to each other all the time and say the most fucked up things but it was just that, venting. When we were with those same kids, we were professional and conducted ourselves with unconditional positive regard towards those little shits. To be honest though, we almost exclusively blamed the parents. Some people just suck major ass at being parents. So talking is one thing, how they conducted themselves is something else entirely. 
Get to the biggest city I can get to (prob Nashville) and create a human pyramid of about 100 people.  When time unfreezes, the media frenzy will be hilarious.
Do victims have a right to retribution? I have always felt that the justice system should be purely rehabilitative in function. I don't get the justification for retributive justice.
I think this goes along my feelings that the problem is not the test itself, but how people try to use.Useful for commentary in film trends, but doesn't really say anything of the individual film.
Cetian's answer is pretty much spot on, but I wanted to add one other factor that led to anarchism to be such a virulent force in Spain -- and that is the traditional decentralized nature of the Spanish nation. Spain was never able to create the level of cultural and political centralization seen in France and England. In Spain, areas had a long tradition of more autonomy from the capital and had distinct cultures in each area. Indeed, if you look at the areas where anarchism was most popular it was in the areas with distinct cultures, namely Basque, Catalonian and Aragonese.  
You seem like a normal guy, don't go FHP unless you would write your own grandma a ticket, or really like working traffic crashes all day long. If you have any questions about the FWC, feel free to PM me. 
Agreed. There was I guy that use to train at my gym regularly that would always pull off some weird behind the back arm lock from guard (think you're on top and have your arm twisted behind you). We just called it the "James special" because he was the only one that did it, and he did it well. 
If it's "a gross cycle that black people can't simply "fix for themselves," let me step in. The Universe is impartial, it plays no favorites. The only two guarantees that we get are birth and death.However, that is not to say we are not loved, Life presents us all with every opportunity to grow, but these opportunities must be seized when presented. This is our choice. We are shaped and defined by the choices we make and ignorance is no excuse, and still Life gives, it's just fewer and farther the older we become.  So if someone has a brick hanging around their neck, it's 'cause they put it there every morning when they wake up and say "poor me."  Remember, chances are taken not given.       
Thanks for doing a giveaway.Love all the new craft, especially the american TDs.Absolutely hate the way they handled the calliope, both in cost and in mechanics. I was really excited for it, but now I'm afraid it's going to be nerfed into the absolute ground.
I wouldn't want dude making anything for me if he can't even tell what vegetables he's cooking. He probably doesn't even know how the food should taste then... Some girl will be very disappointed... Unless he's hung like a horse I guess. 
Not sure what that has to do with anything. I work a job, but that doesn't mean I plan on staying where I am. I'm simply offering advice based on what I hear other people say, books I've read, and things that I do that are working for me.

All the "need" in the world! The main thing that motivated me to play the last MMO I played was once I seen the dancing in it! It was the best dancing Ever in a MMO and I would hope Star Citizen is = or grater then it. I fact I kinda think it has to be to live up to CR Level. ;)BTW the game was ArcheAge and danging was a toggle you turned what stile of dancing you wanted on and then you could Dance Walk Dance jump all in the stile of dancing you there toggled in to. It was awesome for making videos and having fun or when drunk.There are many but one Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksTUEz-gf8M
I should mention that on the roof of the FIB building it says T1 on one side and the other has a like cut through the middle but can still tell its T1. The roof of the IAA building is labled T2 incase you didn't guess
&gt;Instead, many churches strike me as doing charity as a form of advertising.This seems true.  I had not considered it.  Is it prevalent in your community?  Does it seem like churches are competing against each other to seem the most benevolent?
I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :(
Thanks. I love to point out false predictions.You probably just pulled that from a cheap youtube search in 5 seconds. I have seen the video before.A lot of those may be taken out of context. He's discussing things that could happen not necessarily believing THIS is the thing that can happen. @2:59 Stage some terror attack, end of 2009 was the underwear bomber false flag, and others since like boston bombing; yeah these involve no one dying so thats a good thing.Someone should make a new video; there's probably tons of Alex Jones content since 2011 on things he's said you can show haven't happenedI'm GLAD he was wrong. But what if he's just wrong about the timeline? Notice he's not saying the dates of many of these things.
What's even sadder is how much of a hypocrite you are when I click on your profile and see that you've spent an entire page of comments just repeating the same stuff, because you're obviously a very angry loser yourself. At first I figured you were a troll, but no, you're just stupid. Whatever.
I  have the same fear as you. I'm terrified of going by my windows at night because I always feel like there is going to be someone out there watching me. I'm okay around them when there's light outside but that's it. It also doesn't help that I sometimes get nightmares about people being outside the window and trying to get me and once I heard a couple knocks on the window itself.
If you were walking backstage to pull out your phone and use your bank app to remind yourself there are millions and millions of dollars there you would keep walking out there with a smile on your face too.  
Does that only work with eclipse? I really like the idea of having a package nonnullable by default and using optional but java really needs common annotations understood by the big 3 (eclipse/intellij/netbeans).
The worst decisions Big Brother ever made was BB 14 and BB 13. BB13 should have been all newbies, and BB14 should have been All Stars 2. The fact we will never see Dan compete in an All Star season sucks. I would have loved to see Rachel, Brendon, Jeff, Jordan, Dan, Dani, and Britney compete against each other. But none of them will probably ever return.

I don't. Well, I did and I posted them on this subreddit (probably been  10 months) back when it happened. I wish that I did because, now that the creep factor has worn down with time, that shit is hilarious.

"Classic" type system, like it is implemented in Java, for example, sucks. No need that crap in ruby. What ruby needs it's contracts support in standard library, this will solve type issues completely.
Do you mean HQ?  The ones with the yellow dust at the top of their icon?When used in crafting, they give you a headstart at high-quality (that's HQ) results.HQ items give more of their effect and have lower cooldown timers.HQ gear gives higher stat bonuses.
I feel a little bit reassured you think I'll outgrow getting angry over arguments. As for the being more empathetic and stall myself things? I think I can do that if I just have that on my mind when or **while** (if I'm not too angry) I think another incident or something is about to happen/**is** happening (again, if i'm not too angry). Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely keep it in mind.
The way I see it, if you didn't notice it while playing the game, it's not a huge problem that needs to be fixed...is it?Although I'm not disagreeing. The NPCs are definitely not the smartest. I can silently take out an entire group of people from about 10 feet away hiding behind a tree, and no one so much as looks at the dead bodies.

hey guess what? You're not a special little snowflake. Your gender issues have been around since day dot, the way you deal with them is how you rise about it all.The message is simple to be safe and even then you were fucken offended and made it a gender specific issue AND ABOUT YOU. Your reality of the world needs to change quick fast and you need to adapt, sure it sucks but thats the way its always been. YOU are not going to change it.Get a fucken grip and seriously come back to reality. 
It went well, if a little awkward (when is it not, am I right?). We had been dating for about 6 months at this point, and we knew we were serious about each other, and we had already talked to each other's respective families a lot about each other. I can't remember what the occasion was, though.Neither of us was at all anxious. I actually was looking forward to it because I knew it would be fairly entertaining (my family is very conservative, hers is very liberal), and that nothing our families did would affect our relationship very much.
I don't like to farm low rate stuff. Example, I've been on Mobliz all day trying to get 5 greater wind orbs. After all my stamina so far today, I've gotten 1. If there was at least something else besides the minuscule XP to go along with it it wouldn't be so bad. There's a big difference between farming and sadism. 
Very informative video. Thanks for making this! Some of your sources were mentioned in the video but would mind posting them so we can further analyze and research? 
Man isn't annoying how only certain players on a baseball team ever pitch? The game would be so much more interesting if they had the players switch positions more often. Man metas are the worst.
I'm done. I don't need to give advice. I'll just continue reading about how everyone has 100k in student loans and can't find a job or hate their jobs while most people I know have 100k salaries coming out of college who all love their jobs. it's cool. no need to offer advice to the unwilling.
&gt; I don't trust that they all know more about drugs then I do, as pretentious as it sounds I like to think I know more about drugs (maybe not how they work on a biological and neurochemical level) then a lot of doctors.you probably do. GPs tend to only know the most common issues people present with in any significant detail. everything else they either know very loosely or they just refer you to someone who does. or they just bullshit their way through the consultation, because if there's one thing us medics are good at, it's being able to sound like we know what we're talking about when really we have no clue ;)
Well, of course there are places on reddit for it. There's like, a million gaming subreddits of differing flavors. It even had its own subreddit when the MLP version was under development."Having a place on reddit" isn't important; it's whether or not it's what we want it *here* that's important.
I misread that as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev  and thought I'd wandered into /r/imgoingtohellforthis.   'Cause that would take balls of titanium.Nice work, btw.
Season 5 during the time flashes, they share quite a bit of screen time actually! But it was standing outside of the well at the orchid station before John lowered himself down into the station to turn the donkey wheel and move the Island. Her exact words were "John, if whatever it is you're trying to do actually works, thank you". We know that what John did was influence the Oceanic Six to return to the Island and back through time until they ultimately caused Juliet's death at the Swan station.
Maybe we *should* cut them some slack though. Look at [all I've done in 5 years.](http://tj-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/printable-thumbs/a-whole-lot-of-nothing-printable-gift-ideas.jpg) Maybe they work as fast as I do.
90% of the time the bartenders at 45 Tchoup wont card a person if they look over the age of 21.  The idea that they would refuse a foreign ID while just "eyeballing" the age of most of their patrons should show how no one cares about foreign IDs unless they are looking to be an asshole.  If those bartenders cared about their jobs they would ID check every person, every time.  Luckily for us sane people, they dont.  
You guys would come subscribe to /r/New_Horizons. We post updates and everything else related to New Horizons.  I am totally pumped for the flyby in June
I disagree, Liberty University is a joke - for the same reasons that eminent philosophy departments don't teach "New Age metaphysics," or Ayn Rand's objectivism, Math departments don't teach Numerology, or Medical Schools teach Homeopathy, et al.That's not say that Prof DeWitt himself isn't qualified, he is. And, like you say, he's wrong, but that university should not be viewed in any shape or form as approaching anything we'd call scientific. I'll be surprised if anyone ever has taken their BS or BA from LU and gotten into a prestigious Graduate Program. LU is a diploma mill, pure and simple. 
Oh man, that is just terrible - I am so sorry to hear you've had such a hard time! Has your MS been diagnosed as degenerative, or is it more episode-based? Question: does anyone in your family have it? They keep flip flopping between whether it could have a hereditary link or not. My husband's dad had MS and my mom has MS, and we're expecting our first child, and we have always worried that it could turn out to be genetic.
&gt;Gustin chinos are some of my favorite out there, although I have been problems with the buttons breaking...nevertheless, I'm hoping they offer selvedge chinos again. They look great!Yea, I got the navy's last Nov. My button fly hole broke. Gustin's customer service was flawless though. I was able to return for store credit and get the Navy Duffel (it finally came back up). The navy's are back up right now though!

I dated the same girl 3 times over 5 years. There was never any animosity between us, we just wanted different things out of life.Dated for 2 years, broke up, saw her at a party 6 months later and fooled around... dated for another year. Broke up, saw her at *another party* a year later, fooled around (alarm bells are ringing, dumbass) and dated for 6 months. Then she moved to New York and I haven't seen her in 10 years.
never said i was a psych major, never was defending psych majors , never called engineers boring, only boring when they are talking about their work life, which seems to be constantly cause they are in love with themselves for being engineers
Does your team have any Commando classes? If not there's your problem. Commando's at this point in meta are your Tier 2 Killing Machines. The Scar combined with the 20% Damage increase makes them perfect for disabling Bloats/Husks/Sirens at a longer range than any other perk.If you do have a Commando and he is shooting Trash mobs with his Scar most of the time. He's doing it wrong for the team. I personally will only trash kill if I have a Bullpup/AK12 spare to have mitigate the trash. Otherwise by round 3/4 I have just a Scar to deal with Tier 2 mobs and that's it until I'm Full Buy.Just my 2 cents.
it looks like some kind of coating has worn off or their is oil smears. If you had more funky direct light you would notice it. The image you attached was pretty flat light.
ughhh I really hope they make it possible to log in and just take notes of the playlists... like a "no listen" mode... if I lose ALL of my years of playlists I'm going to be heartbroken :(
&gt; Australian history professor Philip Dwyer documented, McIntyre’s factual assertions are simply true.Including claims that ANZACs bent space and time to be involved in Japan? Or how about that Australia was somehow involved or complicit in the nuclear bombings of Japan? Makes me think the historian has alternative motives if he doesnt even qualify his statement when declaring the tweets "simply true". 
That's manipulation, not gaslighting.Gaslighting is when you start making someone question reality. It's when someone comes here and has to *ask* if someone beating them is abuse, or if it's okay because [reason]. It's when people come on here and are confused because their SO keeps doing something, but then denying that it ever happened and making the person wonder if they're imagining it.
