Yeah. It sounds familiar to me, too.
Why does no one love Williams..
Small typo: It says "Dread Cosair: Kept...".
THOU HATH BEEN FORGIVEN YOUNGBLOOD
my favorite photo of her of all time
Does Williams have leprosy?
Well crap, I thought it was a foot.
Pffft, wayyyyy better than them getting Leo.
Don't sell that damn lighting coil


He needs work and he may need surgery.
&gt;best player in the draft 

K
WHY DIDNT YOU TRADE DOWN?????????
yeah, tec9 is shit now compared to the 5-7
Jesus christ do we take LEONARD WILLIAMS? OMG
"Irritated" obviously understated. Bastard OP. 
That isn't necessarily a bad thing though 
**THE REDSKINS FUCKING SUCK**
Ctrl + F "cunt"


81 matches.
You're bad for society in general. 
Dam, the bears are getting Leonard
Got you added and am online now!
WAOOWW!!! In all seriousness, great play
I don't want the Jets getting Leo.
I'M GONNA HAVE A HEART ATTACK IF WE TAKE BEASLY

Very well played Washington
Valid point, we need a control. 
Could be their crew color 
Excellent pick cant go wrong with an Iowa man
We needed OT but this sucks. 
Well, okay then. Good job Washington.  
They call me 'tater salad.
Gotta have a strong OL to be successful
Oh, I know it. I'm an exresident
"I hardly ever have anything to do Varis"
So, less? I don't get your point...
leonard is got to be a bear
You bend that cap! You know you're white!
You got it. Gotta love um all though. 
How much would we have to give up to get to 6?
We like to circle jerk each other.
Sc13nce aka safeway has always done me right.
Good for online but terrible for single player.
I'll say "scooped out of" for moderninity.
Redskins needed an OL badly
Surprised it wasn't Leonard Williams 

^^^The ^^^one ^^^I ^^^actually ^^^posted ^^^xP
GURL! I'm dead this done killed me RIP.
His story stinks to high heaven.
Hopefully. I've had enough of the Waltrips.
Hate to say it but Leonard Williams?
It just keeps linking back here.  WTF?
Landed in Dallas Texas.  Go reds.  
Almost the definition of devil's advocate? Haha
pls keep doing what you're doing
ill buy it right now for 150k
As long as you dont get Williams.
&gt;The ~~Nuge~~ McDavid Awakens
RIP Seattle Predator Catchers
What a stupid play by Carlson
Jets gonna take blarcus blariota 
Back up to double the points!  76-38.
Holy shit if the jets get Leonard 
~~Maybe they can finally get along?~~
Chicago got the clamps on defense. 
This has been reposted long before /r/thebutton
Look at those monster hands.
Wow, honestly thought he'd fall to us.
I may have been a bit preemptive. 
It's still terrible, though. 
Not really. Bears would have taken him at 7.
Since it's BO3, just put 6 grips on there!
No mechanically inclined friends? or bravery?
Team needs &gt; BPA i guess
I don't see the correlation can you elaborate
In Eric DeCosta we appreciate
Oh shit, that's next level thinking. 
Oh I loved this stuff. I miss it so bad. 
He sure doesn't look 3. He seems very happy
PLEASE WILLIAMS PLEASE I WILL DO ANYTHING
I was not expecting that. 
ahaha, this makes so much more sense
Didn't Bush the younger introduce tax cuts?
Yup, it all starts up front.
Is it another DDoS attack?
Spring rolls for the duck sauce! 
I prefer him over Leonard 
The bears have to be shitting themselves.
I've always thought that too.
LOL Mariners home give away is fedoras. M'ariners
I WANT FREE TUITION I HAVE A SPENDING PROBLEM. 
To defeat ^^hi-yah! Ro-mannn
at this point how do we not pick williams? 
my best guess is the burning crusade
How far will williams drop? This is fun 
Oh wow. More dudes? I love this place. 
As long as Leonard falls to the Texans. Plz 
Too late! I do this for you!
I'm guessing it won't be IDPA legal.
Pig or Men or simply PigMen
See guys. taking Cooper wasnt dumb.
That was answered quickly 
we did it first. 2010 bitches
I go back and forth between the directions.
Maybe the guy cheating is also a bitch.
for starters, he stabs people.


Shipping is gonna kill ya..... 
Tackle...the least sexiest pick 
Yeah Derrick "2 days rest" Rose is unstoppabull.
I love this sub so much already
So the 5.5lb is a lie or what?
Red Hot Chili Peppers could be pretty cool
http://i.imgur.com/vfNqcBZ.jpg

Fuuck bears might take Williams!!! Pls Jets

Gonna be Shariff Floyd 5.0
Cousin wants in. Just hit it true and hard, Z.
This is a great pick honestly.
Reports are coming out about a shoulder injury
My shower timing is impeccable...
Wow that's such a relief. 
I quit the show before the tears began 
You can take Derrick out now, Thibs. Please?
YESSSSS HAHAHA U DONE GOOOFED WASHINGTON!!!
If you keep saying it it won't happen! 
How do we know that, could be a small one
Ah, thanks for letting me know.
You look better with short hair, big time
It's okay Sarah. You are safe now. 
I DON'T CARE BUT I HOPE HE SLIDES DOWN TO #15
Jets gonna do something crazy? 
Green eyes brown hair inspo? 
Agreed.  I can see McLellan in STL actually.
We're about to be up by 40 points lol

We need to do this immediately
How is it living in the future
This just freaked the heck out of me. 
Well, looks like you were right!
Way cool!  Thanks for sharing.

We gotta play like this every night.
HE WILL BE BLINDED BY ALL THE DONG
I think Nico liiiiikes you
Seems sort of like the definition of one
Lol why not Leonard Williams?
Guys.... What of Leonard slips to us?
Congratulations.

You've invented the ox.  
Fuck. I wanted the Giants to draft him
Ugh fuck Williams in Chicago
It's actually on PS3 and PSP too haha.
Why did that give me a boner.
So glad i think leonard is gonna be a stud
certified fresh and not out in theaters yet?
WE'RE ABOUT TO DRAFT LEONARD WILLIAMS FAM BOOK IT
"He's got huge hands, thick cock"
the Rams would like to have a word with you
Yeah, same boat - 34 here.  Too old for MFA. :(
Now I wanna know what McCatty said. 
COME ON WILLIAMS. WERE KILLING QBS IN NY
Obligatory, "Thanks, Babcock!"
Have you considered Bug Spray?
What am I looking at here?
Like in the United States. 
It works without the apostrophe
Is Williams gonna make it to the Bears?
how the fuck did williams fall this far
did not see him sliding to 6
&gt;Jerk baby.

Wasting milk is not cool!!

Please fuck this up Jets, please. 
Bought a soldering kit from /u/Readysethorrible
Leonard Williams @ 12 pls...
Nobody, thats his problem.

*no killer instinct*
I don't have a newsletter, sorry.
Very deflated. Nobody's really into the game. 
We had him Lagares played perfectly.
where were you when chip was kill
Beef jerky sounds uncomfortable.
Should we trade up for Williams? 
whats the story so far? just woke up.
I was hoping it'd be a chunk.
Derrick is digging their grave.
holy fuck that kid is a beast
Bill Callahan loves 0-lines
Poor williams must be getting stressed. 
Nope. Shame never really helps anything. 
Oh well.  At least he didn't go to the Browns.
That's a fucking head shot 
At least when we reach for a lineman, it's at 31.
*she plants a soft, loving kiss on his lips*
Ahhhh gotcha, is the shark appealing as well?
Barefax has a free buffet...
Not sure because I've never not used shock pads
Like I said, your front office is special.
You mean, trade to #2 and take Eichel!
Up vote gets to 25 we upload a squirt pic
could you guys imagine the jets with leonard? 
So I feel like you like Matt Adams
when will we get real nudes *w*
"jesus"

or so i would suspect
Guard or Center is less sexy
Not fat doesn't always equal healthy.
Now, he better not fuck up lovie's fucking day.

I read that in maddens voice
They better not also break up Kepner and Avery

Do not let Williams fall to the Bears jets!

No idea. But I am thankful
One Vic Beasley for the Falcons please?
Originally it was for trading up for mariota
I think he's a great, speedy, option for Cutler. 
uhhhhhh we got a shit defense still
Wanted Williams so bad but I'll take that. 
You should probably get that checked out.
Something about broken arms
But how else will I get rid of my change?

How much would we have to give up to get to 6?
We like to circle jerk each other.
Sc13nce aka safeway has always done me right.

This has been reposted long before /r/thebutton
Look at those monster hands.
Wow, honestly thought he'd fall to us.
I may have been a bit preemptive. 
It's still terrible, though. 
Not really. Bears would have taken him at 7.
Since it's BO3, just put 6 grips on there!
No mechanically inclined friends? or bravery?
Team needs &gt; BPA i guess
I don't see the correlation can you elaborate
In Eric DeCosta we appreciate
Oh shit, that's next level thinking. 
Oh I loved this stuff. I miss it so bad. 
He sure doesn't look 3. He seems very happy
PLEASE WILLIAMS PLEASE I WILL DO ANYTHING
I was not expecting that.

Didn't Bush the younger introduce tax cuts?
Yup, it all starts up front.
Is it another DDoS attack?

Too late! I do this for you!
I'm guessing it won't be IDPA legal.

Bill Callahan loves 0-lines
Poor williams must be getting stressed. 
Nope. Shame never really helps anything. 
Oh well.  At least he didn't go to the Browns.
That's a fucking head shot 
At least when we reach for a lineman, it's at 31.

Great idea Mat! I am totally in.

KEVIN WHITE IS A CHICAGO BEAR
Yeah, but nobody eats chard.
Ha! They listened to me!!!

Dude, read the sidebar.&gt;No homework help.
Jay cutler just creamed his pants 
Scarborough is pretty unpleasant as well

Go for the yeard. Only few more months to go
Your prayer has been answered
TD, DQ BE SMART. BEASLEY PLEASE
Go! You have two days! Makispeed to thee!

Lol that dude in leather jacket
Only 50 of these exist, right?
YES THAT MEANS WE GET BEASLEY !!! FUCK YEAH!
Which is why Germany is still so antisemitic?
I'm ashamed how much this just made laugh.
Mods never have a sense of humor.
Nah those are dildo es for hotkinkyjo
Oh, fuck you Bears.Bring on Byron Jones. 
I know but he is not a dirty one either
Seconding this! Lotion helps.
it's an annoying repetitive comment.
So, no WR for us this round.
THE BEARS ARE WHO WE THOUGHT THEY WERE
ginger....not once made me laugh ....#SorryBoutIt
Beasley to the Falcons then?
so original, you deserve a nobel prize
"Well, what is something you wished you had?" 
I like "What reason do I have to accept _____?"
Meh. Doesn't scare me for some reason. 
THE BEARS HAVE JUST WON THE SUPER BOWL!!!

Ok now HURRY THE FUCK UP ATLANTA
It's starting to get pretty stagnant...
Go buy yourself another box, ya whiny twat!
You know what, I will. Fuck it. Thank you! 
YYYYEEEESSSSSS Beasley pls!!!
Odd, not a single boo to be heard.
Ooohhh, so that's where they make Gak.
That Bear's receiving corp is going to be deadly.
10/10. Would interpret again.
Oh good, more receivers to cover.
GET JIMMY AND PAU SOME REST PLZ.  AND DUN3VEY
I think non genuine news posts are.
''60fps almost all the time'' WTF almost?
Pretty sure we knew this weeks/months ago....?
Bayless?  More like Scoreless.
He's got dreads. He's destined for greatness.
the bears have yet again fucked up big 
Brisbane, as it turns out, is a city in Australia
I really hope you are right.  
First pick I haven't heard booing for
FUCK YES THANK YOU FUCK YES PLEASE
ahhh the smell of chlorine
Awesome! Can you pm me your paypal?
HOLTBY MAKES EVERYONE SWOON!
And yet ... they are *wisdom* teeth. ;-)
These can't be the same two teams right
BETTER DEAD THAN ORANGERED
Yeahhhhh draft more offense
Expensive round. Effective tho!
only in dota is it good to reduce your net worth
Where'd you acquire that? I want.
At a (7) but that idea  blew my mind 
More weapons for Cutty to overthrow!
I feel at times that wouldn't be so nice.
I AM HAPPY WITH THIS DECISION.
No you didnt. It was mean and untrue. :(
It is... It's quite relaxing. 
Funny he's the only one too.
No idea. But I am thankful
One Vic Beasley for the Falcons please?
Originally it was for trading up for mariota
I think he's a great, speedy, option for Cutler. 
uhhhhhh we got a shit defense still
Wanted Williams so bad but I'll take that. 
You should probably get that checked out.
Something about broken arms
But how else will I get rid of my change?
Pittsburgh-Charlotte-Las Vegas-Boone- Richmond.
So she went from the D to an A?
Aw, fuck. I was hoping White would slide.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! FUCK YA! Can't wait!
MORE CUTLER INTS FOR THE PACK
Where did you guys ski at? Weren't you in SoCal?
Had to get someone to replace Marshall.  
That would actually make a lot of sense.
GIVE ME BEASLEY BABY!EDIT: WHOOOOOOP
I LOVE CHICAGO. GO GET US SOME BEASLEY.
It's cool. Mistakes happen man.
Sugar would know all about making people cry.
BINGO. Except the prize is continued misery.

"You're"....the Oxford apostrophe.
Hey, we might die next episode. ;)
I don't like that we needed defense
You trade the guy who missed workouts
Yeah,  this isn't Meredith. . :/
We've gotta go Beasley with this.
Because Widodo's a dick, pretty much.
OMG Thibs, sit your starters already.  
Lol the 97 overall is going for like 110K
if the falcons dont take beasley im going to rage

Good pick. Can't wait to see him play.

WHY AM I SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS?
Big bellies or small willies?

Now you just need someone to throw it to them :P
It's good to be realistic.

I'm in here for the spoilers actually
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Well now the Falcons will draft Beasley
Not really sure how to feel right now
NO QB TALK IN 4 PICKS IM DYING OVER HERE BOOM
True, still pretty cool though
in this moment, I am euphoric
Brandon Marshall died for this shit
360,829 I gotta run, it's been fun
Hopefully won't be likely, chap.
Hoping we can win it at home. 
Good luck Kevin White WVU will miss you.
I don't know about that; you seem pretty awesome.
"Well, um, alright. It's a pleasure to meet you."
That looked like a poster shot
What about the hook/hold and line change button?
Needs to set hover height correctly
2 lefties next inning. Thornton?
Kevin White and Alshon Jeffery. Shit.
incoming comments about blonde girl...
Holy fuck! I though you were joking.
Holy shit, those deer had families.
It was good but missing...something. Maybe spice?
Holy crap! I have those blueprints too!
Q.Q Why? Our defense has so many holes....
yea that was embarrassing,
Auto correct does wonders to trashy people.
How is he boring or forgettable?
Gak. I can smell that and I don't like it. 
You can tell Hopkins really wants Manny to win.
THANK YOU BEARS NOW GIVE ME SOME BEASLEY!
Yeah dog that's the spirit!
Same at McGuire. Real midnight chow is a luxury. 
Do you work at the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop?

Suspicious quotation right there
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkk me
Absolutely intentional.Source: am author.
Stitches are cool, man. The ladies love a scar.
Alright Falcons, draft a kicker.
because it's not a good movie....
But didn't you essentially just replace Marshall?
Your husband dies, you get a bit of a free pass.
can you clean it for an extra dollar?
Whos the Snow Bunny  around Kevin White 
Thank you very much! This is excellent info!
Solid pick. I'm glad it's not Williams though. 
Brave man. Like walking into a mine field. 
Yeah pretty average comment 
ANY IDEA WHEN WE'LL GET FEHR BACK?

Not a problem mate. Submit more!
Beasley!!!! Come on guys! Please! 
But why did it become a giant tree?
*Very* interesting. Thanks for the heads up!
Cutler has some WEAPONS...kinda like last year.
*I shiver a bit.* Serena is doing good...
Gak! What did you do there?
Came here to say just this. 
I think Decker and Marshall have that covered
......................NFL is better anyway
Yeah, but gangbang is 'taboo group ménage' often.

Kicking someone and sending him flying and no damage really makes no sense,   what if the damage is a percentage of the targets current health? , is that too strong? 
Yeah.  I mean, it was never actually made formal as far as "This is my wife, Beth, this is our girlfriend Teslok," and that would actually have made me uncomfortable.  For a while there, in the first year or so, it was more like I was their pet alien, because I was so ... socially ruined that I had to learn a lot of things from the ground up.  
I gotchu fam.I forgot a step. You're gonna want to group everything together before you do that. So get everything in the logo aligned how you like, group, then horizontal/vertical align with rectangles. 
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck that's shitty. Hopefully it's' been a long time since it happened. With these situations, the other person doesn't think about it *anywhere near* as much as we do. The person who did the embarrassing shit always thinks it was much worse than it was. Hope that makes you feel a bit better.

You ram speed can also be a factor; but I'd def  look into your clock speed, and check all your drivers of course, make sure your .net framework updates are installed. Arma is not very well optimized, and I have a 780, fx8120, 16gb ramm and I'll still Fram drop on skyrim....I guess it's pretty heavily modder though. And I'll run only a solid 30fps on Arma three..
I know how you feel. After my first accident, the insurance company wanted to write off my bike. Having owned it for 2 years until then, fixing it and only riding 1 month until the crash, I've grown quite attached to the bike (it's also my first one), so when they told me they wanted to write it off, both me and my dad went berzerk in them. Worked, got new parts, new paintjob and it got into a better condition than it ever was
I took all AP courses my senior year in high school (I liked the fact they didn't give homework and you just took a test each quarter). My AP psychology teacher was a psycho bitch who really didn't like me and told me I'd never pass her tests let alone the AP exam at the end of the year.I was one of only two people in her entire class that passed the AP psych test that year.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think there's any reason to play the original RE 1 now that Remake is widely accessible. It has just made this weird situation where everything get's downgraded from a technical standpoint for the next 3 games.

I fear you might be right. Danish exceptionalism is definitely thriving all over the country. Although regular Danes easily change opinions concerning the EU, they are also massively uninformed and quick to focus on negative sides while ignoring that 50%-66% of our laws (which work great) can be traced directly back to the EU. It does feel a bit utopian to imagine the population and our politicians suddenly becoming massively pro-Europe and maybe even federalist. I'll keep a packed suitcase under my bed in case it gets relevant.
Sorry, maybe I should have been more clear, the point of my question was to narrow down my search to quality movie specific t-shirts similar to the website I linked. Amazon is basically looking in the Walmart of the internet. 
Ok, let me help ya'll out a bit. Get out a map of the USA, and a pencil. Put your pencil right where the Mississippi River crosses the Tennessee/Kentucky border. Draw a line straight east to the Atlantic Ocean. There is no good BBQ north of that line. There is also no good BBQ west of that river. There is also no good BBQ in the parts of Louisiana east of that river, get the shrimp instead if you are there.

&gt; I don't think that reasonable + rational + logical = objectivityWell objectivity to subjectivity is a scale isn't it, the better the methodology, the more snippets of understanding of reality we will get, the better the theory the better closer it is to reality. So reasonable + rational + logical = *higher levels of* objectivity.&gt; but if we're going by the true definition of objective, we can't have objective knowledge of anything without have full knowledgeI disagree. We don't need full knowledge for it to be reasonably 'objective', and how objective and objectivity are defined is a matter of interpretation.
Fripp's already pretty against digital music so he already did this begrudgingly, so I doubt we're getting that when he'd be getting even less money out of it. Weird that that tribute to King Crimson album is on there though.
I think I understand what he meant, and the title of this post is swinging the opinions a bit. He's just saying that if someone is out there looking to commit assault, you can assume they'd rather target someone who's alone. 
I hope not.  It's already hard enough to swallow that a complete moron is way richer/more successful than I'll be.  Him achieving that while actually being mentally retarded would be too much to deal with.  
It is actually quit interesting. Religious people like Islam and Russians, scared of the gays but men kissing other men is perfectly normal for them. And on top of that these people that are so scared of gays all bade together nude. Why on earth would you want to bade with other males nude if you are not gay? 
Here's the thing, unless her marriage somehow impacts him financially or materially, it's none of his business and you have no obligation to tell him or to have to tiptoe around his potential feelings regarding your mother's remarriage. I know that's not going to make a difference to your father, but it should inform your approach. Next time you talk to him, mention it, but don't harp on it and don't answer all the questions that are sure to come. A whole lot of 'I don't know' and changing the subject.         I have a mother and sister who are somewhat estranged and a stepmother. When I speak to my mother, she doesn't ask about me or my life, she wants to know what my sister is doing and she wants to know what my stepmother is doing. It's none of her business. I can't tell her that, because it would be the end of the goddamned world, but it's not. So I tell her I don't know and change the subject. 
Move forward in your stance, tee it up higher, and think swing up. Also tilting your spine angle to the right may help, but can't know that without a video. If you have a coach, why aren't you asking them? Strangers on the internet that have never seen you swing and aren't coaches/golf professionals can't possibly give you better advice.
Holy shit OP, that title.No one fights for humanity.  They fight because they have to, or because they're paid, or because they have a military alliance, or for an ideology, or for their home.  No one fights a war because it's the right thing to do.  Ever.

Ghana will commit 1B to this project. And spend an additional 750 Million for a Ghana based R&amp;D facility to cooperatively contribute to this project. However our investment in the project hinges on Ghana being able to produce this tank locally so as to stimulate heavy manufacturing jobs in Ghana.

I ported my Wind number to VoIP.ms and got a Bell flex data tablet SIM for my phone. If I use 1GB of data I pay $20, up to 5GB and I pay $40. My VoIP.ms ends up costing $2-$3 per month. Most months I pay half what my WIND plan used to cost, and the rest I pay the exact same.I get WAY faster data (because I can use LTE now) and the voice quality is much, much better. And if I'm on WiFi I basically have a perfect cell signal. I can make calls and send SMS from TCONNECT-enabled subway platforms. I am so happy with this change.
Cosplay is supposed to be a fun hobby. Dress what you want to dress as. If people notice your character and enjoy it, then rock on. If not, then just be happy in wearing a costume that you want to wear. Sometimes the best moments are when you dress as something "outdated" or niche, and find that ONE person that recognizes you. It has the same effect, if not better, than a swarm of people around you because you were (insert popular character of that year).
I'm a volunteer in hospice. My coordinators are very accommodating and usually want to make sure it's a good fit. Be honest. If you need more responsive patients, say that. Dealing with folks with dementia is not for everybody. If it's too far, tell them to get a hold of you when there is an opportunity closer to where you are.
So far only 1 plant (of 8) looks like this.  Maybe 60% of the leaves are spotted now.  I water 1x a week in the morning (now moving up to 2x/wk)  but we've gotten a lot of rain lately and started getting cooler evenings.   Has 4-8 tomatoes growing but flower production has slowed down lately.  I side dressed with coffee grounds 2 wks ago and plan on trying epsom salts this weekend.  Are spots nutritional?  Or bacterial/fungal?  Please advise!  
I'd suggest keep what you have,  save the money for ammo, shoot the shit out of it, then come back a few months later and ask yourself if you still want to go this route. Get some experience behind the trigger to figure out what works and what doesn't for you.There's nothing wrong with going this way, really. If you like it then that's all that matters. I just feel like it's a solution looking for a problem, or a solution inferior to other options.
Assuming both Gurley &amp; Gordon are gone it seems like we're headed for a CB, what do you guys think about these guys?  Think they're actually difference making prospects or just another guy that winds up as depth?  I feel like I just cant get excited over any of them.
And the Galaxy X. I understand that there was a treaty it just doesn't fit that if i have a cloaking device I can only put it on some ships. I at first thought the avenger class was going to mark a new era of fed ships that would be able to equip the device but I was sadly disappointed.
Don't forget, argumentatively it's not up to you to do anything. The burden of proof is on them. They are claiming a god exists. So let them argue. Let them demonstrate a deity. (Good luck to them, this has yet to happen in human history.) Atheism is not the claim that a god doesn't exist. Atheism is the rejection of a claim. All atheism says, is that "I'm not convinced". God doesn't exist and I'm not convinced are very different statements. You need to know this point inside and out. Period. Atheism is not a claim. Is is the rejection of one. And just because you're rejecting a claim, doesn't mean you're affirming the opposite claim. A rejection is a rejection, not a counter-claim. 
I think the point is to learn the terms used in Japanese so one can discuss CS is Japanese. So, while the actual code won't be much different, if you already know the code, then this is a good way to learn the terms.
Senior year of hs, I was dating the salutatorian, and everyone hated the valedictorian so much, that because their GPA only differed in the ten thousandths place, our AP Lit teacher let my gf discretely take an optional final without letting the valedictorian know because my school had the "If you take the AP test, you don't have to take a final in that class" policy. So my gf took it after school the day before the last day of classes, it bumped her from an A- to an A, and made her the valedictorian. My ex was the most popular girl around for that summer because everyone fucking loved her for taking the valedictorian down a peg......Now I'm dating the almost-valedictorian four years later.
She wrestles for Shimmer, she's really young too.. Like she was born 3 days before me, damn I'm old.ANYWAYS yeah her name's like Sarah Dobson or something, I doubt she'll get signed
I don't think that her refusing to pay for your dog's vet bills is a bad experience, especially since they are always in need of money.I've adopted a dog and fostered a cat as well as worked her adoptions at petsmart and never had a bad experience.
It reminds me of elementary school, where people just discovered sarcasm in the form of "omg, your shirt is so cool .......... *naawwwt*" - which eventually just turned into "I like your shirt not" as everyone got lazy.
No, that is what Quinn has aimed at others. "Oh people are questioning whether grayson had a relation ship that resulted in favorable coverage for a game! THEY ARE MISOGYNISTIC RACIST NAZIS!"

The only thing that I would consider even remotely misogynistic would be the way that Dan equated his struggles as being an adopted son as being similar to Shirin's abusive childhood. But I think that that isn't veiled misogyny; it's just uninformed and tainted with his distaste for her. Rodney has made some sexist comments, as have other players, but I wouldn't call him misogynistic either. 
I'm an asshole because I don't care enough about tips to fight on the Internet? You're a strange one. I personally am quite glad of my priorities after seeing how angry tippers get on the Internet. I think you all need to take a little break and remember that people are allowed to disagree. Don't be so childish please. 
Why yes, I can!  That happened probably 5-6 times in each calf that evening, then to a lesser extent every couple hours until noon the next day... and now that I've returned dehydrated from another muay thai class, the cycle begins anew!

There is gender which defines sex like male and female.There is gender which is defined as a **social/cultural construct**. How can one be born feeling like the opposite gender when gender is arbitrary.A man in one culture is different from a what a man is supposed to be in another. The same applies for women. Facts and Opinions dude.
I think this is at least close to something factual.My understanding has been that if you go below a certain daily caloric intake, your metabolism can shift into "famine mode" where you digest food more efficiently (or store more fat, etc.), and you effectively slow your weight loss.Can someone verify if this is just a myth?**EDIT:** Why down-vote me when I'm asking a serious question?

DEA has a few that they use for surveying for illegal "crops". I grew up out in the middle of nowhere, and it was pretty common to see them every few weeks over the fields 
Grading organic exams can be so much fun. I've never seen this sort of anger though...usually just stuff like "magic" or "science!" as reagents. I did once see a student who didn't know part of a mechanism so he wrote, "The next step happens with wood nymphs and chemistry gremlins (chem grems)." That answer got a smiley face.
The U.S. Government should change some regulations to allow big game hunting in all states. Nothing quite as fun as popping a few warthogs after all.

You can also just use parachord or bootlace to easily make something through which you can slide your belt. I carry mine horizontally on the front of my body- Don't have to carry a knife in your pockets, won't feel a thing, and can easily sheath it. The Izula is by far my favorite EDC knife.I would also like to note I like the parachord way better than the clip the kit comes with- It reduces a lot of bulk.
My guess is HSBC is long fossil fuels ... they are happy for the retail investors to be selling right now because most experts agree we are in for a long term (5-10 yr) bull market for all fossil fuels ... they and their preferred customers want to buy cheap ....
Yeah, I think Tony's hair is way too messy for Coulson, especially with now nice he seems to keep it.

I'd imagine since Clark Gregg got to voice him he had some say in the approval of his design(since its basically a minifigure of himself), but I'm just going out on a limb there too. http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131011175301/marveldatabase/images/a/a9/Phillip_Coulson_(Earth-13122).png
Thanks much! I used this [chart](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/the-wallpaper-had-it-coming-again) from a designer on Ravelry which also links to a "simplified version."
There is nothing saying you can't. Beyond passing the physical test, you also need a doc signing off on your medial paperwork. Part of the medical paperwork will include "does the candidate have any medical conditions that will preclude them performing the following physical activities..." There may be a few extra hoops to jump through (perhaps literally), but where there's a will there's a way.One of my coworkers is an amputee (leg below the knee) and you would never know.
Wow, if only I could have thought of that on my own, thanks so much for sharing your supreme intellect with me. Nice bluff with your written out plans, well played.
Thankfully I don't need to compile anything, it's just HTML/CSS3/jQuery. It's just some features a client wanted which are shit and they'll probably change it and cause it to break. 
I'm always interested in what the breakdown of different pollutants is in heavily polluted cities like New Delhi. I've read that (in the case of new Delhi) a large proportion of the pollutants are from cars but haven't seen any numbers to that effect. It'll be interesting to see how the problem of pollution will develop in polluted cities, like what technologies will come to the forefront to tackle these issues and what social/economic changes that'll bring for the places like India and China. 
&gt; It's still a lot cheaper than if you were to buy the individual ingredients themselves and cook it all yourself. Not really. If you were to buy a weeks worth of rice and veg and meat it would be a lot less than $2.50 a meal.

Gotta love that the draft is presented by Bose yet the top two picks stay home and are "very product placement-y" wearing ... you guessed it BEATS by DRE. For those of you wondering why the both stayed at home...

Unanimous decision for Floyd Mayweather.Pacquiao will try to make the fight exciting in the first few rounds and he'll win the first four rounds. After that, Floyd adjusts and lands perfect counters and avoids the machine gun of punches by Pacquiao. Pacquiao will land a hard left in Round 10 and Mayweather will be buckled, but he'll come back strong, but the judges give Pacquiao the win for Round 10. Floyd will then pick Pacquiao apart for the rest of the fight while he throws a lot of punches throughout the rest of the fight, tiring him out by the end.After the fight, Floyd will then act all humble and say, "It's been a long road. And I proved to the world that I can beat one of the biggest Hall of Famers and boxer. Manny Pacquiao is a great fighter, but Floyd Mayweather's a better fighter. I want to thank all the fans, the Money Team, Team Pacquiao, and everybody else who made this happen."Something like that.

It's also the only summoner spell that can miss (and will regularly do so). Mark has a low cooldown, but I'll happily bet that you don't end up using the Dash half of the spell that much more often than other summoners (expect perhaps Flash). Between the shots you miss and the shots that would end up getting you killed, there aren't that many good opportunities to follow up on casting a Mark. Maybe you could argue that the cooldown should be 25s or 30s instead of 20s but I really doubt that a few seconds makes the difference between balanced and "incredibly oppressive." 
I'm sorry you're being downvoted (if it makes you feel any better, it wasn't me), perhaps the way you phrased your initial comment made it seem like an attack on Messi, and the way you defended yourself in your first reply to me pretty much reaffirmed that notion (at least, it did in my perspective).As for this:&gt; The fact that I'm being downvoted says it all, because I didn't even say anything bad about Messi, or said "Ronaldo is better." This was about everyone comparing what Ronaldo does instantly to Messi, which is true.*You* brought Messi up. You do realize that, right? This thread had nothing to do with Messi until you felt the need to bring him in and say he "acts like the nicest guy on the field" unlike Cristiano who gives it his all or something. So yeah, that's why you're being downvoted.

I remember I tweeted Rekoil one time and he said he doesn't master. He just makes the mix good and doesn't bother with mastering. Just food for thought I guess. Also, [Heres a good Seamless video where he explains it perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jW7Y36A0VAQ).
One of the ways that people who are deaf and blind communicate is through a modified form of sign language. [Helen Keller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller), for example, would have an interpreter sign into her palm with their fingers. She became both deaf and blind at the age of 19 months and one of her teachers was finally able to teach her to communicate by doing this. For instance, her teacher would sign "water" into one of Keller's hands while running water over the other and Keller eventually put the two ideas together. I would assume some variation on the method is still used.

The thing with draining it is you have to compress it and protect it.  If you don't, it'll just fill back up again.  So if you're just going to drain it and then get back on the mats the same/next day, skip draining it.  If you're really concerned about it, drain it, compress it with some rare earth magnets or something, and take a week off training.  I used to be concerned about it but I quit caring.  I work in a bank and people don't see anything negative about it.  If nothing else, they get a kick out of the small, quiet computer guy who's in "fight club".

Unfortunately genetics play a big part in how your beard will grow.But the other thing it takes is patience! 2 months isn't that long really, particularly if you haven't grown a beard before. Give it time, take good care of it and then just let it grow!Shaving will only make it go away, it won't grow back thicker.

OMG &gt;.&lt; talk about annoying. First thing in the morning it's a full body stretch when mom unlatches the diaper, wait till I've decided he's not going to pee, take the night diaper off, immediately try to pee on me, giggle as I frantically put anything in the path of the stream, then roll over and run away (if possible) while I'm still recovering. Once the escapist is 'tackled', it's another three minutes of windmilling legs and rolling hips before a lopsided diaper is finally attached to that super wiggly little mass I love an adore. *sigh*
Legally the date of purchase is used.When you're married, your earnings are considered marital income.

Everyone's tastes are different and I don't know yours so I can't suggest anything.Look through [the wiki gallery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_male_heavy_armor) and see if you find some parts you like. Use parts from different armor sets if you don't like any whole set.[GW2style.com](http://gw2style.com/search.php?searchname=&amp;searchdesc=&amp;searchowner=&amp;world=-1&amp;race=1&amp;gender=1&amp;color=-1&amp;dye=-1&amp;armor=3&amp;armorslot0=-1&amp;armorslot2=-1&amp;armorslot4=-1&amp;armorslot1=-1&amp;armorslot3=-1&amp;armorslot5=-1&amp;dosearch=1&amp;sortcol=3&amp;sortdir=0&amp;ipp=20&amp;index=1&amp;displaytype=1) is good for inspiration too (basically like this place but easier to search and more popular nowadays).About dyes, start with your favorite color. If you want one color to stand out you use an opposite color (or slightly opposite) on other parts of the armor. Or you can ask for help again if you can't come up with something that satisfies you :)
I do work on the show. I was hoping my photo of the working scene was a bit of a visual proof of that. The reason no one has done any AMAs is we're just so insanely busy until season 1 is over. I'm sure someone would be happy to answer questions to all of you awesome fans.
not deadpool. not for the next few months at least. he's the last hero to get his 52 review so he's very very underpowered right now. Cable and Thing are next to get their reviews so you're looking at later this year for deadpool's review.
I have lower back/pelvic pain on almost a daily basis.  Not sure whether it's caused by IBS or endometriosis, but it gets worse in the 2 weeks before my period.  It feels like it's coming from my bowels.  I get sharp gas pains when I'm anxious too, but that's a different kind of pain.  The lower back pain is dull and achy.  Hope you figure out what's causing yours!  
Well, children *are* inconvenient. :-) This particular kid may have been well-behaved, but the rule is in place for a reason. Kids *with* their parents act a fool in public, but at least then you can ask the parent to get a hold of their child or leave. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't think 11 is old enough to be off shopping by yourself, generally speaking.
Hey! So of course those two are tentatively sold...but I'm actually interested in TLBC - I am on the small side of 28D so I wouldn't doubt that 30B's would fit. Also for the Heidi Klum ones, is the band fairly tight for a 32?

Next will be an imagined offense from her family and friends, such that he will insist she not see them on her own.  Actually, that's probably already happened.
They get mad at you if you tell them that you don't understand and it doesn't look incriminating though. "I gave you the information, if you don't want to see what's in plain sight then *you're willfully ignorant*!"There's nothing willful about not being able to discern the point of an info dump regarding people I don't know.
As a girl who got the family sweat gene, I hate deodorants that lie. Says it works more the more you move. The fact that I have to take a second shower at night because I smell like sweat, determined that to be a lie.

I am not sure how they will survive. I was super amped that they were coming back but they fell short. Some of their beers are great, some ok and some are horrible. Their food is basically normal bar and grill fair but a little bit more.They also did a terrible job early on managing the place. Beers were way to much (originally $4.75), there were too many inexperienced waiters, unprofessional managers, and don't get me started on the whole killing their $2 pint night without telling anyone and letting a whole bar full of patrons find out when their bill arrived...
the odd things about it are the numbing of your nose and the gray appearance.i've only time i've seen h that had a tinge of gray was when i lived in DC, and dope there is (well at least was) garbage.but hey, fire is fire!
Thanks so much!:)No worries! I slip into stuff like that. Sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me. It's always good to talk about stuff and I'm definitely here to listen:) It's hard to take risks like that, especially when it's your best friend on the line. Me and my boyfriend were best friends, it took him the whole school year to work up the courage to tell me and it didn't go so well the first time, but we were still best friends. You could always tell her "I like you, but if you don't feel the same way I understand. I just thought I should tell you." Maybe she'll feel the same and maybe she won't. I was always the kind of person who said "thanks for telling me that. I'm sorry I don't feel the same." and we would continue on being friends acting like nothing happened. Evertbody's different though. I wish you the best of luck!
I blush deeply and cover my flat chest with one hand instinctively, before quickly resuming picking up books. "I suppose so...So ummm...." I pause for a bit. *Calling me a stripper in response to my shirt....must mean she thinks I'm a girl, right?* I look to get and ask, bright red. "So do you think I'm a girl?"
Exactly. I always used to squeeze that hair tie the closest I could to my head. I always ended up with headaches and finally realized that too tight = headaches. 
&gt;At this point, it just seems like it'll end real badly if I try to keep it going. I'm inclined to agree.  You really have to be upfront with someone if you're going to transition while still dating them, and if they can't deal with it, then that's the end of it, really.
dunno, not an expert on other schools open container rules. maybe some just turn a blind eye on game day, but ours is actually a board ordinance that is officially suspended on gamedays (during the designated tailgate times)mainly just wanted to clarify dry vs wet though. because regardless of open container laws, dry campus would mean there's no alcohol allowed which is most definitely *not* the case at msu, regardless of the day
I think there's lots of people here who can identify with that. The socialists of the 80s and 90s who were fighting for a better life for the working class are being completely alienated by the left of today.

It's not easy to change friend. The confusion is the fear of the change itself. If you feel you just exist, hollow and you change will you still be you? Or is that the same as dying? Well that's for you to decide. Making that choice to be better in itself is validating your life. You can't be hollow when you have a purpose. In the end, regardless of words given. What do you want? Do you still care about those people? If you do, change. They deserve better, and more importantly, you do too. 
Eagles were more in the running than we were for Mariota. I really think the Chargers were just doing due diligence if he were to fall out of the top ten.

Wow muchas gracias por esas recomendaciones! Dices que debería especializarme y me está llamando mucho la atención especializarme en matemática financiera, un profesor me recomendó bastantes libros de modelación financiera y me está gustando mucho eso de matemáticas. También, ¿dónde recomiendas empezar para socializar y networking? Tengo contacto frecuente con la mayoría de mis profesores, pero para socializar con personas de la carrera como le puedo hacer. Hablo con muchos en mi universidad, pero la verdad no conozco a mucho profesionista, solo persona de mi edad. Sé que existe el IMEF, pero mi universidad aún no se afilia o existe una organización donde podría hacer network con financieros?

I think that is the most optimal way to play around espionage but that  implies you are sorta lucky with your spies. There are games where I will have maybe 8, 10 techs maybe 15 techs stolen back to back and my blind, inept and incapable spy won't catch anyone.For that reason I think denying the AI embassy entirely is a solid compromise.
I'd say the tea party is half a reaction to racism, and half a reaction to people wanting a reap choice, even if the choices to them is terrible. Think of McCain and Romney, imagine you were actually wanting a conservative. Now take the group that actually wants a conservative, throw in the racist and add fox news coverage. Now you got a political force. Opposed to the liberals, who actually want a true liberal, no one pays them any mind.
Bullshit. Every American lives in the top 4% compared to the rest of the world. You don't see other people acting like this. There are more whites in poverty then blacks in the US, yet somehow they aren't murdering everyone. You are part of the problem.

I hope we trade him later on in the draft if there are some better picks still available when such a trade would be possible.

I meant dance as a general term and added ballet; a lot of people turn into cunts when they have kids in theater too. Also, I really don't believe one can segment themselves into "oh I'm nice everywhere else" and want to force a kid to exercise until they vomit; it simply means they're hiding the cuntiness until they reach a context in which they can impose it on a kid...which is rather worse honestly.

Well its not half so picky about pH, and is fine with actives like niacinamide or green tea extract (L-AA is not). It can be a little tacky at higher percentages I believe, but that can be solved with more 'slippy' partner actives.
Are you because you don't seem to want to address the fact that theres very little chance of the mirror being used for spying, if she had found a camera I'd agree but the only reason the mirror is being treated as an issue is because it made her feel uncomfortable, seriously who gives a shit its just a mirror on a bathroom closet door. She made an issue out of nothing and people are jumping to her defense because she drew a line between the mirror and sexual assault and god knows how much social justice warriors are constantly on the lookout for anything that could possibly be related to "rape culture"

Yeah whenever people see me as different I am glad, because that's actually what I am and so I feel like they understand me a little more.
They said they weren't doing the tats. Seems like DC threw it out there to see what people thought and when reaction was super-negative they backed out.
You *really* don't have to hoard those quality armours and weapons. No, seriously. You're feeling smart now, but just kill more stuff instead of trading for scraps and whetstones. You'll play the "how to get to 40%" game often enough with flasks and gems later...
I make an awesome playlist and pay for the bar for everyone. After everyone is drunk, really drunk, I punch him in the dick and every other dick there;)
Luckily my body is not sensitive at all to body rage acrylics and stainless steel jewelry, I've never had a problem with them! I know there are way better options but I've never felt the need to go elsewhere.
I love playing basketball, and although I've been playing for years now, I'm not very good BUT I can see and know how plays are unfolding - I recognize elevator doors before they are being set, i can tell when players are going to pull up to create a 2 for 1, how defenses are specifically attacking  a certain PnR compared to another. That being said, I am sure that the talent/skill gap between myself and a world superstar like LeBron James or Stephen Curry is smaller than the talent/skill gap between myself and a celebrated LoL pro like Faker. And there's no chance in hell I could even reach 1% of LBJ's level so... Yeah, the LoL pros are just really fucking good.
Watching the extended interview. Man, this woman is blaming everyone but herself. She's blaming 9/11, blaming the White House, blaming Clinton, blaming the intelligence agencies, then blaming her editor... I found myself yelling at the TV.Stewart once said that his show is basically the people who yell at the television, the guy in the back of the bar yelling "Bullshit! You said X last week, now you're saying you only said Y?" It's kind of refreshing to have someone on TV be the one to show clips of the same politician lying from a year prior, but I'm sorta surprised it's only Stewart doing this. (though to be fair Rachel Maddow has been doing it too, but not as frequently nor as popular as TDS)

Thanks! I'm trying! I thought I made progress with /asoiaf but I was mistaken, and they cleared it right up for me upon further questioning. We promote piracy still, according to them. 
Defense is a problem. LA is a good defender, out of our starting 5 Lillard is the only weak link defensively, not sure Lopez could cover both Love and Lillard's defensive duties and still be doing all the dirty work he does now.Offensively he'd work just as good if not better than LA.

Well, May 1 is Labour Day here and May 4 is the Restoration of Independence Day in Latvia. Where are you from, by the way?And I'm watching Nichijou, Watamote and 9 airing shows at the moment. Have you watched Plastic Memories? It's my favorite anime of the season.
/u/hojomonkey posted the video and info, but adding to it: The match was a draw because neither opponent was submitted in the 20 minute time frame. Metamoris rules differ from most tournaments in that a win can only be achieved by submission, forgoing the more traditional system of using points and submission.
["Verizon can't do math..."](http://verizonmath.blogspot.com/2007/08/original-recording-of-verizon-customer.html) is a *classic*.  Ahhhh, 2007.  It was a simpler time.
look at his submitted first, but yeah Andrematt was some person up here posting customs claiming that they were his. He was banned and I'm guessing "hipstermegaman" is him; because of his thread. 
Man honestly I'm starting to think perhaps I'm doing something wrong. I have been using the same stick for about a year now. I started loading super aggressively and still its like it's not even going down. And... I have 15 more sticks to go. :(
I think you are an exptovert/exhibitionist.    You like to be the center.  Fortunately you are very attractive.  Too much ink for me, but its a valid choiceMaybe the overall effect is overdone/stimulation overload.  7-8/10
I think it is one of those things you need to use before you can make a judgement. I like the idea of a bigger trackpad (some companies, Lenovo especially, seem to enjoy putting tiny trackpads on their laptops), but I wonder how this idea would work with a Japanese keyboard which has a smaller spacebar due to (useless) extra keys either side of it.
Server: NAType of Bug: In-Game BugDescription: Elise can no longer self-cast rappel Steps to reproduce: Go into any game mode. Try to cast rappel (not onto a target) via self-cast.Expected result: Elise rappelsObserved result: Elise does nothingReproduction rate: 100%System specs: HP laptop. Elise can still do a target-less rappel if she clicks E with your mouse cursor within the range indicator. If she clicks outside of that circle, she will walk to the edge of the range and then cast it. It is extremely clunky to use this way and also GREATLY increases the chance of accidentally rappeling onto a minion or enemy when using the ability during cluttered teamfight situations. To avoid this I've always self-casted my rappel if I didn't want to immediately drop on a target. Now the self-cast does nothing. IMO this is a pretty big bug that makes playing her extremely clunky. 
Idunno, I'd like to give her the benefit of the doubt and think she's not as comically retarded as her peons to try and substitute a vault door as an image of the entry site into an allegedly secret, fortified underground nuclear weapons production bunker.Because then .. we couldn't actually deride her .. we'd just have to pity her.
Transparent blocks do not affect Villages, so you can safely build with glass outside of the design, provided it doesn't leave a path to allow zombies to enter the titan and break doors or kill villagers
I really want to call him out on it, since this shit pisses the living fuck out of me. But I'm told I would sound clingy if I did that and I really do not want that.

From what I've read, Letrozole tends to have less side effects than Clomid, and doesn't dry up CM and thin the uterine lining like Clomid can. I've taken two doses of Letrozole and have a bad headache this afternoon (google says that's the most common side effect) although I'm not sure it's the Letrozole yet. My Dr put me on it because although I O on my own, it's very early and maybe the egg doesn't mature, and also it doesn't give my lining enough time to build up. 
Same here! I already said it on r/nintendo, but that's what I'm hoping for, because I prefer duos with one boy and one girl and I'd like to see a gaming duo where the girl isn't the sidekick. I also think Yooka looks more feminine with her more rounded features and Laylee looks more masculine with his prominent eyebrows.
the difference being that the mets have turned those picks into talent. it's amazing how the jags have had so many top picks and are so bereft of top talent
Yo I'm all for fanboying, I have several anime stickers on my DJ laptop. That being said mine are all pretty tasteful. I'm just saying some anime upskirt saying "LOOK AT THIS!!!!!!!!" is pretty embarrassing from any standpoint. I mean go ahead and put whatever stickers you want haha, I was just saying he should try to find some less cringy anime stickers.edit: and i don't think it's fanboying if you just have an generic anime upskirt sticker... 
Yeah, I taped them off and spray painted them black haha. Took me 3 hours in total to do. I did the same with the front and rear bumper and around the windows. Semi Gloss black.
Not counting ones that use stolen moves or reflects:* The Dead Woods stage brutality. iirc you have to use 2 interactables when you're one away from winning, then be a specific distance away from the enemy when you finish them off with the log interactable on the far right.* Reptile's acid spit brutality, except you hold up (or a different direction, I've also heard towards the enemy).* Sonya's X-Ray brutality. You have to be holding up for the last hit.* [Cassie's American Way Brutality](https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/33mp6a/cassie_cage_hidden_brutality/). Idk if anyone else found out how to do this consistently because I couldn't. But it is indeed real.* Kotal's suicide brutality. Basically you off yourself when the enemy is one round away from winning with the damage buff that hurts you when you perform it. The enemy gets a Brutality for your troubles.

The chances are something like 1 in a million and this happened tens of thousands of times in the Gallipoli war. At least it's what my history teacher had taught us..
Unless this was a movie you shouldn't assume you know what he was thinking.  When I think dirty thoughts I don't bite my lip, and when I bite my lip I am not thinking dirty thoughts. That only works in movies. As far as looking at her ass. People need to grow the fuck up. Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable to realize that adults are sexual beings doesn't make it wrong. Your parents had sex, your dad's pen was in your moms mouth; get over it.
Didn't Oliver say something along the lines of "I don't think that bolt of lightning struck you Barry. I think it chose you" in the pilot? If so, it gives some credibility to this theory
Honestly, the books just seemed to keep adding but players and random characters to the overall story without much forethought into trying up their individual stories. I have absolutely no idea where the books are going to be honest. 
Wow. I had no idea there were issues with licensing on this site, since they were so popular. I hate to see them go, but I think they're taking the high road here (whether voluntarily or under duress.)
I actually TWD more as its gone on. I loved the first season, found the 2nd boring, liked the first half of the 3rd, found the 2nd half a little slow, loved all of the 4th season and loved all of the 5th.
I got in at 10.50.  I think the lawsuit is just a temporary setback, but I'm a noob.  Worst case they'll settle, which will likely be covered by insurance, and then it's business as usual.  Earnings soon, and more info on their product trial which I'm hoping will get them pointed in the right direction again.  The trial stage failed to prove that their product is non-inferior to the leading competitor based on specific criteria, although "a subset of patients showed evidence of non-inferiority".  They'll try to leverage this partial success to change the criteria and start a new trial, so success isn't out of the question.Again, I'm a noob.  You can safely ignore me.
The films are offensive to critics because they're offensive to the art form. They're cheap, pandering pieces of Christian propaganda that the studios know will make money in certain regardless of how bad the films actually are.Basically, they epitomise everything that is currently wrong with Hollywood.
The only place he's depicted with nipple rings is the box art.  The cinematic doesn't even have them (which I would consider the most canonical design, especially when going for realism).
While I did think of Social Democrats immediately after posting that, but I decided to leave it alone. I'm sure you already know this, but people typically draw a distinction between private and personal property, with private property typically being referred to as things like land ownership in the absence of actual, personal use, owning means of production, and other similar things. I guess you just see that as metaphorical, though, which I don't.
I still do that, but just a little.  My recommendation?  Get a manicure and some nice gel polish.  If you're a dude, still do it, but get clear polish if you're self-conscious.  For some reason I do it less when my nails look nice.
If the teacher or principal is doing the bullying, and I found out as a parent, I'd raise 50 kinds of hell because it is a violation of the fucking trust placed in the school. Same for police. If the police are bullying a person, there isn't an outside mechanism to deal with them. *That's* the point.
I've had this issue when I use two rudders on the sides instead of one central one.Is this the case?Edit: Also, if the rudder is too far below center of thrust
I could, but I uninstalled the beta, cause that is what I was using earlier, If that is causing the problem, I'm just gonna give up on the app, even though its cool. Anyway, I've never used iCleaner, so idk what I'm doing with it and dont want to break something. Any tutorials you can show me?
Can someone explain the peeker's advantage to me?  I've been throwing the term around (mainly in fits of rage :P) but I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly, or even know what it it.

If your character have filled the bag, it's happens and maybe it's a wrong items in the bag or the items.txt changed. Another cause is much data. Otherwise is bandwidth or something else.
My personal approach to scheduling has been:* 4 courses  * Part-time job with (semi-)fixed hours  * Tutoring  * Clubs/volunteering/etcI enjoy the extra money, as it ensures I can stay debt-free while also having a fair amount of disposable income to blow on things which I want to do (such as eating out with friends frequently). Just find something that works for you.As for financial problems, you should be able to sustain yourself off of just co-op sooner or later, but if you want extra spending money or just something different to do a part-time job is nice. That being said, if you're going to go for a part-time job, you should probably be at least a bit choosey (taking anything less than ~$20/h is probably not worth the stress unless you have lots of free time or really like the job). Anyhow, it's ultimately up to whatever you find works for you.
I actually do this a lot because I had no other way to hold my little brothers tiny cello when I taught him. Now it is a convenient way to play when I can't use the pin. 
Knowing Benjy though, there's a bit more to it than just a random name. Detlev Bronk, according to the Wiki, was big sh#t in New York City in his day. Is Benjy suggesting that his family is some big powerful clan with roots in NYC? Then again, it's not impossible that Benjy himself created that Wikipedia entry, just prior to mentioning the name for the firs time... in an Kaufman-esque move. If so, it was a lot of effort that went nowhere since no one followed up on the suggestion to look the name up. 
There are 82 million gun owners in America.  That is a force to be reckoned with and the Federal government is just as afraid of it as Admiral Yamamoto was.
Are those maggots? Why is everything being eaten by maggots!!?!?!?!? (yes, i know why, but...wasn't really for this number of maggot infested pictures. )
Was wondering when one of these rants were going to pop up again.I think for anything to actually change, there's going to have to be a country sized riot. Problem with that is people generally suck in large numbers. But it may work. Then again it could backfire terribly and end with a lot of people dying. Hmmm, I guess what I'm trying to say is, is that maybe we need a civil war. Middle/lower/working class, black, white, every color, and creed under the rainbow working as one to take down this horrendous sham of a government and instilling a new and better one that *is* for the people. Buy that'll never happen. 
I think you have them backwards: 0.8x speed for cross-class weapons and 1x for class. Or you meant to multiply the time instead of speed.I think this change would be ok, but don't have a strong opinion either way.
Multiple studies have concluded there's no evidence to support longer sentences having any impact on reducing repeat offenses. After 3 years the ban has served its purpose, and it no longer provides a deterrence of value, as any further effects are merely punitive and no longer associated with the original act, so the real question is, why not? By that time, the cheaters have already created new accounts (and probably been banned on them, too), and the multiplayer community has moved on to other newer games, and if they do cheat again, they will be banned again, so really the only people still being affected by the ban are the innocent ones who got flagged with false positives.
I am always hyping brawlers, so why not. Their unarmed strike levels pretty decent. You can use unarmed strike while holding whatever you want so you don't have to waste time swapping weapons. You can use martial flexibility to take ranged or melee combat feats depending on the situation. In a shootout? Take deflect arrow and catch arrow. Snatch their arrow out of the air and shoot it back at them for cool points. There is so much crazy shit you can do with martial flexibility. The only draw back is you need to burn a feat on longbow unless you take a fighter dip.
I just checked the website and it does say that it opens on May 7th. I guess it's been a while. xD There is no specific time so perhaps check at midnight and periodically check. Unfortunately, you can't do anything before hand. You simply have to wait online or go to the department of housing at the time registration opens. It's a first come first serve thing.  I am not sure, but I THINK you can't get meal plans if you live off campus except for the 5 meals a week or the meal block plan. 
You know, maybe since there is now 3 objects completely out of whack. Keen will somehow figure out how to stop them from going ape shit and maybe fix rotors and pistons for once perhaps? One can wish.
I have a feeling shonda is just going to jump another year and then it will be the end of dempsey's contract and she'll be like- "See, We didn't break any contract!"
Its origins as a word are pretty racist, and I kinda feel that it traditionally has been. It's true that people used it to refer to gangsters, but it was generally Anglo-Saxon people referring to Slavs, Jews, and Italians, who weren't really considered white at the time.I guess you can argue that it's more of a classist thing, since people mostly use it to refer to uneducated people who don't have social graces, but I think it's racist too.
Stubborn persistence and growth by month into 2016 might begin to change minds in the media. If we get bigger and louder and never stop getting bigger and louder then there is no reason for them to ignore or dismiss us.
Something to note about the yetis is that they seem to roll more easily. Maybe the weight being more centered instead of towards the top/ flight plate.Totally anecdotal but my buddy's yeti seems to stand up and roll away after basket hits far more than my r-pro. Could just be that he putts with more hyzer. Am I just imagining things or does anyone else have experiences with the yetis rolling around?
Fixed! We've gotten a few comments and compliments about having a game that has a bit 'more melanin' as you say from gamers who are glad that there's a game where the default racial skin tone is a darker one. 
What if she wanted to have the kid?  I'm not saying the kid was planned, especially not that early, but why should the kid have to live away from his mother because she wants to "find herself"?  She can do all of that at any time. Having a kid isn't the end of your life like many people are so inclined to believe. Just because she had a kid that early doesn't stop her from being who she wants to be.  The reason I said good for her is because she stepped up to the plate and took responsibility for her actions. She didn't just abort it or give it off to whatever family would take it. 
Elsevier is a huge conglomerate of many many journals. lancet were led to believe that the wakefield study was true, as were many others and this wasn't proven false til many years later. in hindsight it was a bad mistake but you can't judge them for publishing it in the first place. 
thanks man! Not so good at doing the name mentioning. Unfortunently, I had to use a monster that couldnt be destroyed by battle to get my point across, and he was the first one i could think of. **BUT BEWARE MORTAL. FOR THIS CREATURE IS ONLY THE FIRST TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF THE CURSED ONES**
Why do you say that. I consider Kobe really tough minded. Hard to consider Lebron tough minded when he choked hard in the 2010 finals. He's a smart guy for sure but not tough.
Hamling v Roberts in the VFL:  Round 1 - Hamling 13 disposals 6 marks 1 tackle, Roberts 14 disposals 3 marks 1 tackle.  Round 2 - Hamling 13 disp 6 marks 1 tackle, Roberts 13 disposals 6 marks 2 tackles.  Doesn't give us a whole lotta insight aside from Hamling's remarkable consistency across the two games! I'm curious to see how Roberts goes as I really have no idea at all what he's all about 
Fortunately "Gaming" accounts technically don't have retention departments because we realize that the entitled customers we get are usually spoiled little kids who want it their way all the time.

Difference is that Greg Martin doesn't throw out ten-dollar words or reference existential philosophy every other sentence. Best thing about Sky losing the Premiership rights is no Barnes.

I've never even been CLOSE to show biz.  AND you think I'm shitting on indy film makers like I don't watch them?  Hmmm.  K.  I'm not gonna bother with ya.  Think whatever you like.
Because of how the damage and scaling works between the two. There have been countless posts in this sub on the actual math behind it. And I know he spams, which is why I said probably. I'm not a Ryze player, though, so I'm not going to bother doing the math for him specifically.
They haven't been calling it any kind of finale, though.  They haven't called it a season finale, they haven't called it a series finale...I just checked IMDB.  It shows two more episodes in this season: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/episodes?ref_=tt_eps_sn_mr
Was this sub supposed to be an insult to fatpeoplehate? I'm a proud shitlord, this was a fun joke that started due to a spelling error. I was *there* when it started. OG
I'm moving to James Street (which is pretty close to the downtown core) very soon and will be living in the smallest room I've ever stayed in. However, what I am losing in room space I am making up in location, as I'm within walking distance to my two jobs, my favourite pub, and a short bus ride to Carleton. The point is, you gotta give up some things to get others, as someone else pointed out. I'd say it's a pretty good location, and Hartman's Independent is right nearby too. Maybe try to find a few friends to live with, or a vacant room in a shared house. :)
A boy in my class in year 4 was incredibly intelligent but never did anything that the teachers told him to do and for that reason was treated as special needs. I have no idea if he has special needs but I know at that time it had never been diagnosed. My year four teacher (who, incidentally, was named Mr Gay) was furious that Lewie wasn't doing what he wanted him to do. So he made the whole class sing "There's hole in your head, dear Lewie, dear Lewie, there's a hole in your head dear Lewie" while he pointed at poor fucking Lewie. 
Yea I commented in that one. According to some guy (who I dont even think was American) The Stones, Pink Floyd, Led Zep and Black Sabbath all mimic American blues singers.What is funny is the article even says singing is more or less accent neutral, it just stupidly assumes that American accent is the neutral accent. 
Apparently a lot of democrats and liberals hated O'Malley. I'm curious about Jim Webb, he seems like he could be the dark horse of the race, if I'm using the term correctly. Like Hillary already has brand recognition. Sanders is incredibly appealing to a lot of people and pretty well known. O'Malley has been making some media appearances. Jim Webb just seems to be sitting back a bit and watching things. 
No problem I would ask the same question. I don't think the current memory will Imost the performance of the machine but you can always upgrade it if you need. If you handnt supplies me with memory I would have done 16gb DDR4 same brand 
No worries...I'm on the west side, so makes it simpler for me to have some idea as to when to be available. I could probably help Saturday, just give me the details.
But PhotoJim99 I'm only concerned about parking for poor people not about the long term fallout from my entire neighborhood turning into a concrete jungle! Why can't you of the poor people!/s
Not unless you can safely completely reformat your phone's storage or whatever partiton shows up as storage to your computer - because that's what you'll have to do to turn it into a bootable install drive. Even then, it's risky. I'd just get a cheap 4-8GB drive somewhere instead.
I stalled out once on my cut and just kept at it and then randomly I dropped like another 10 lbs overnight. Try to keep your diet tight. It will be the hardest thing you do.
I got my account back recently after a charge back. you will have to jump though many hoops, it took me almost 3 months to get back. I had to sent them a letter with a great deal of info about my account and identity. Good luck, and just remember to be patient.
Absolutely! Well...wish me luck, gotta go meet my friend to "tell him something important." So freakin nervous, I'm running the spectrum of feelings from being terrified ("OMG I should wait!")to euphoric("I'm finally doing it!") every few minutes. ughhhhhh, I need to relax after this week!!

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH NO!She needs to get dragged into the street by her hair and whipped until she bleeds to death in front of a jeering crowd.  This deserves severe cruelty to be instantly and mercilessly meted out.
&gt; On a side note, anyone that uses the words "be like" in a sentence should have their testicles scraped over broken glass.Aw c'mon, that's no way to be like.
I always thought that it was talking about the whiteness of a cracker too, until it was explained to me this was by a rather racist Australian, who then added "but it isn't really that bad of an insult, is it? We're still the ones cracking the whip, huh? They're on the ground and we're in a position of authority and they're trying to insult us with that?" Ah. 
Just a couple of rosewill red led case fans. They move a good amount of air, but I'm going to replace them with something else and put them on the front of my case
White people are almost always murdered by other white people. Obviously we need to do something about these vanilla skinned thugs before all the good ones are strangled in their beds.Why can't the white community stand up to these savages?
Many thanks to /u/skepticaljesus for the good deal on these.  Picked them up off the buy/sell/trade post after a bit of hemming and hawing. I'm usually a 10.5D/E and these were 10Ds, but the last runs quite large so they fit just fine, and actually have a bit of room.After getting them in today I went to town with the brush, AE burgundy shell cream and edge dressing.  Think they came out pretty awesome.

Galactic Wrecking Co.I've only demoed this at a few events and to a few other people, as I'm still tweaking some of the elements . . . but here's some images: http://imgur.com/a/0IAJX#5You're on the bridge of a starship when the other astronauts start having a dance party.

Just going to optimize everything and release it soon! Probably after the Oculus Game Jam. :)
That is sooooo not true! They might not be recording the whole thing (totally unethical), but you bet your ass they'd be cracking up and there would be inside jokes for years. Gotta find the funny where you can when you work in the medical profession.
Same guy that commented above but I lost the other throwaway. I came across more harsh than I intended. The words extremely, hateful, and destructive probably took it too far. Keep in mind this school is small. There are plenty of hooligans but also plenty normal students. It is one of the only places I still hear the word gay used as an insult besides online.This writing is completely unstructured. I'm just ranting about what people might want to know. I haven't been in four years so I only have what information my friends tell me and what I used to know.
ohh. what's that? i'm in the UK so i'm not familiar with that. do you know if it's a generic chemical or summat?...maybe i should google is and not be such a lazy drunk cunt. ;-) heh
Tell them that a DnD economy is inherently silly (true) and it isn't worth the time and effort to try and make it into something fully rational (arguably true), nor is it worth wasting gaming time arguing about econoimics in a economically silly fantasy world, (also arguably true) so take your 8gp and let's move on to more fun.

I really hope there is a big boycott soon for Newcastle, hopefully a media shit storm could do some good and get Ashley out. It's a shame he seemed great early on and now is destroying the club. I feel for Carver...he's a poor manager but the problem is with the people hired him.
i always liked the Attica, i just don't have the mods to make it as good as it needs to be for the missions i play. I also use Zephyr as my main frame, but my friends say she is gradually become less viable with the jump attack and whatnot
I took a look and didn't see any discussion about the 2012 CTS. Do you think it might have been the SRX you were referring to? both the CTS and SRX had similar NAV systems, however the SRX's was a newer generation that supported BT audio. The CTS's navigation hardware was never revised during the production span.The funny thing about the SRX Bluetooth implementation is that it used 2 separate radios: One for audio (through the NAV) and one for calls (through OnStar) and you couldn't have a phone paired to both at the same time.In reality there's 2 options if you wanted Bluetooth audio in the car: You could either purchase a bluetooh audio receiver and plug it into the headphone jack in the console, OR purchase an aftermarket controller that replaces the GM nav system.
MTurk is having temporary server problems for everyone this evening. Just have to wait for the MTurk employees to fix it. At the moment, it appears to be mostly cleared up.
My parents moved from Singapore to here shortly after I was born, and I grew up in Vancouver. They wanted me to grow up in a Western country and to escape what they saw as an authoritarian, controlling government.
You should watch the NXT Columbus match between Ryback and Big Show where this originated... he played off the crowd so well because of this chant, and it was actually Ryback that was pissed off by them.  Big Show had a field day mocking the crowd, talking about his ironclad contract and that he had 10 more years on it.  It was quite amusing.  He called for the mic mid-match to yell at the crowd.Here's just one of the spots, the only video I could find on Youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGQU1_os3RwThe problem is it's played out now, of course.  Gotta drive it into the ground.
I'll be honest. Without Conley I think we'll take maybe 1 or 2 games, but it will be next to impossible to win the series.  The hope around Memphis is that Conley is able to put on a mask and come back for Game 3 in the Forum. It's just a hopeful speculation, but how awesome would that be?  If Grizz went down 2 and then Conley comes back all masked-up and Grizz someone defend home court. Holy Cow! We'd have one for the ages.
I'll make anime out of Pluto Nash with a bad, Japanese, Eddie Murphy impersonator. All his lines will be in poor English, and I'll make it a point to have any narrative cohesion fall apart by the 2nd Act of the first episode with unnecessary padding. Good times will be had by all (and by that I mean people trashing it on the internet).
I think I am going to start with Ocarina of Time. Big gaming confession here... I love the Zelda series (even have a Zelda 3DS)... but I have NEVER beaten a Zelda game. I think it's about time, eh?

I read a little bit every day starting in seminary. Sometimes it was quite a bit, but other times it was only a verse or two. My family also did family scripture study where we read a chapter a night. Funny thing about the family study - we started out all using different scriptures until one night when we came across differences between them since we had a couple different editions between us. After that my dad had us start using some old BOMs that he had and we never spoke of the differences again. 
You guys got the better Quarterback, and it really feels like this is my fault.I always jynx myself. I said I wanted any player but Winston... and life just has to keep teaching me, if I really want something I just can't have it.
I know this is not a faction claim or anything but could the monastery of Cage be placed at on the map? it is at the cave at H14 and great job on the map
I absolutely adore Miranda Lawson.Learning more about her and breaking through her initial, and intimidating, outer shell and discovering the real, and sentimentally caring Miranda underneath was pretty special.On the flip side, I am not a fan of James Vega either.I just never got into his character as much as the others. Maybe because he was introduced so late, and hastily at that.

My big (read: only) reason for sticking with SwiftKey is emoji prediction. I know Google Keyboard has it... But they might as well not, with how useless it is. It can only predict like 5 emoji... 
Maybe. Then again awakening had like the largest sales of a fire emblem game right? a lot of people who bought it were very fond of infinite grinding on the world map and such, getting loads of money. making insane weapons and re classing a million times for perfect characters.I don't think a large number of people would want the Nohr one. If it means sacrificing all of that. I personally want it because the on the rails games have re-playability. I can go through each time and try different characters on my party. Hopefully this game isn't a waifu simulator / pick whatever class you want for any character game like the last one.
Do you by any chance have a Kyogre with a Modest nature and perfect IVs in Speed Sp Atk and either HP or Sp Def? If you do I'll be happy to part with my spare Palkia
I really like this and I've been listening to it over and over. A little constructive criticism from a random person on the internet though; I feel like the vocals are really loud in the beginning. Because of this I feel like at the drop you have nowhere to go dynamically. 
You know I hope they do bring back a system that allows us to more easily support mod authors.  Because many mod authors do deserve recognition and money for their hundreds of hours of hard work.  90% of the reason I didn't like the system they had was because 75% of the money wasn't going to the modder.  I couldn't see myself ever wanting to pay for anything knowing that a quarter of every dollar would actually go to the person I wanted it to.
They did, which is a shame as imo Joslyn deserved it. That was more a knee jerk reaction from the viewers regarding Dela's loss and people wanting her to have a consolation prize of sorts.
Who would you put? I'd say top is the only difficult one to call.top - Odo/Huni/Cabo leaning more towards Cabo/Odo.Jungle - SvenMid - FebivanADC - ForgivenSup - Yellowstar
She was out fixing Greg's van, and they didn't take the time to alert her to the monster because they didn't want to lose it. Did you miss the first minute or?
Yes, they removed our ability to spawn those objects. They added this to them in the last update:*"printable" : false,* (Can't print it at the 3D printer)  *"hasObjectItem" : false,* (Can't spawn it with /spawnitem and won't drop when mined)  They did that with several other items as well, like graffiti, which is why some people got Perfectly Generic Items when the update hit.
http://www.reddit.com/r/FFRecordKeeper/comments/3492ig/equipment_analyzer_v05_beta_now_with_actual_magic/Do you mean this? I haven't used it, but the creator says it analyzes your inventory and tells you which items you can safely get rid of.
Yep, exactly.Worst case scenario, all you've done is shown there's hope for the world. In a somewhat twisted way I'll admit, but still, silver lining, glass half full, et cetera. That's the important part!Best case scenario, someone didn't die.That is also the important part.
Forgiven isn't upgrade for any top 3 team in NA/EU LCS. Sorry, while good players, his champ pool is weak. Lack of be able to play Corki, Kog, sivir was a problem for SK. This make so comp are limited because of his weaken. Not be able to play corki make harder for team to make comp with AD mid, need that extra magic damage from corki. Not play strongest team fight ADC of sivir really hurt most of comp that are played.KoG is very nice champ with tank heavy meta.When he learn to pick up and play a few more champ than maybe top ADC.
Yeah, but let's assume this person is living in Denver. Even so... who cares? There are over 2 million people living in the area, I don't think one person (even a very crazy person) matters.
i wouldn't mind a fixed shotgun trap like you see in the movies. Uninvited guest opens the door to your shelter and as it opens up they're just blasted by a shotgun trap fixture on the other side.
My interest has suddenly been piqued by RPG video games.  Does anyone have a recommendation?  Difficulty level: I don't own a console, and my PC is 4+ years old, has an i7 processor, 8 GB memory, but only a 512 MB ATI graphics card.I've heard good things about Dragon Age: Inquisition and its predecessors. The first game's ultimate edition is on Steam sale for $7.50 right now, actually.  However, I'm not beholden to this series of games.
Irrelevant.  Network, late-night, talk shows,  can't be political or controversial.  All they care about is ratings.  The show will have no teeth, no balls, and it will suck. 
I'm okay with this as long as she was all for it.I knew a guy who spent 2 hours finishing a WoW raid after getting the call that his wife was in labor. I don't think she would have been all for that.
Well the v2 coils are backwards compatible with the V1, so I'd assume they have to be the same. They look the same to me, other than the v2 coils have larger juice and airflow openings.
&gt; Alexis Karteron, a senior attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union who represents a woman who, like Disisto, was falsely arrested for videotaping police activity, says better training is needed.&gt; There is very little in the police training manual about how to respond when a bystander records an encounter, Karteron said. She pointed out that when many officers were trained, cellphone video cameras were not nearly as commonplace as they are now.I don't know what the NYPD manual says to do when someone starts video taping, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't say to arrest them, break the camera, and to make up charges against the photographer. No amount of training in the world would have prevented that officer from doing what he did. 
There is more truth to that than people like to admit.  When I moved to Texas one of the locals explained to me that people who display the Confederate flag are saying that the War between the States isn't really over.
This trailer is just full of liberal greeny bullshit and bias. Technology (and technological-advances) are not "automatically" evil and negative or destructive. Technology is just a tool,.. it can be used for good OR bad. * There are lots of examples of technology making the world a better place (spreads knowledge, instant communication, improved global-medicine, better data-gathering for storms/earthquakes,etc) * There are also lots of examples of technology being used to do shitty stuff (wars, hacking, inequality,etc) Technology is not necessarily a bad thing. Growth is not necessarily a bad thing. This trailer makes it sound like we should all go back to living like the Amish. However the inventions you outlaw,. might be the very inventions you need to help save you. 
I have no malware lol what. Also 60 people in server including friends of mine that have played with me on the server before the patch so it seems its not the servers fault. Reinstalled game deleted all my data folders and checked file integrity nothing worked.
Yeah, really nice place.  Those three carom tables looked really nice, but I feel like that game would be a lifetime investment to become decent...like snooker.  Looks fun, but I know it's just not realistic to take that game on.

Homeopathy dilutes the material to such a degree that it is not possible for you to really even consider it there. It also does not always use what makes you sick. 
My wife is Russian dipshit. You're the ignorant one. You asked a question about Russian culture and I gave you the answer because I am knowledgeble in the subject. You should learn the definition of ignorance, and not ~~ask questions~~ read answers to questions if you can't handle the truth. 
Rooster Teeth is my favorite YouTube channel.And the only podcasts I listen to are all of their podcasts.I haven't gotten around to listening to the /r/anime podcast yet.
I used that case for a while, everything should fit. If you are willing to forego the optical drive, I would get an H80i GT liquid cooler so you can overclock more. in order to fit it, you'll need to remove the side HDD mount and you'll have to put the HDD in the optical drive bay. You should be able to fit an SSD on the bottom of the case too, and another beneath the optical drive bay if you only use one fan for the liquid cooler.Also, I know that [these dust filters](http://www.demcifilter.com/c211/ELITE-130-MINI-ITX.aspx) were made for the case, and should prevent most dust buildup.
Yeah. Money can buy a lot of things, including but not limited to campaign ads and rallies. However, money *cannot* buy votes. I embrace the challenge, and I'm sure Bernie does as well. I think there's a real chance to make a difference here. 
Yes the guy who cybers online and blackmails people out of money is someone worthy of everyone's sympathy. I mean sure it's possible, and likely, that this is one messed up person if this story is even true. That doesn't make them a good person though. 
&gt;I don't understand how you can compare that to something as detailed and as deep as Camp Omega and the various missions, vital story cinematics and rich lore laid out around the various missions.Like you said, it's subjective. GZ made me feel like it was a glorified tech demo, P.T. entertained me and gave me just enough content to make me feel... satisfied?It might also be that P.T. is a great party thing. I love getting new people to play it and watch their reactions. Don't get me wrong, I liked GZ, I just. I don't know. It felt like a demo with some achievements stuffed into it, I'm sorry, that's just how I feel, and I guess feeling aren't always rational. 
If no one was protesting you would not even know about this issue. There are people who are still not convinced that black, brown, and poor people are treated differently by the police and are routinely beaten, killed, and victimized by police in a police by numbers system and the war on drugs. Slowly phone cameras and the protesting that ensues following police murder on camera are convincing middle class and rich white people that there is a problem. There are some who will never be convinced because they either benefit financially from the current setup or they are just evil and like people being brutalized, murdered, and caged like animals for the color of their skin, their economic status, or even for victimless "crimes". But, little by little more people cannot stick their heads in the sand and claim its "only a few bad apples" and "most police are good people who want to protect you" and "its a dangerous job so a little killing and beatings is justified".

###There were a lot of migrant workers in Texas by WWI, but not as many permanent residents. Those who chose to stay after the Mexican-American War weren't necessarily happy about it in many cases, and they faced severe discrimination and even terrorism over the years. It's a really complex and fascinating subject. I took a class specifically on immigration along the border and even that barely scratched the surface.
Tupac. I would appear on the streets of Los Angeles, enjoy a long day of partying, food, and festivities, then as my 24 hours came close to expiring, I would wrap myself in a blanket, twirl around, and appear as my white, pasty, bearded self. For the rest of my life, I would be known as the Tupacocoon.
Seriously, the Rifs?[This shit just writes itself](http://readingisfundamental.org/).Cleon's ghost is very disappointed in you.(But all that aside, yeah pretty much.)
It has been changed. While you still have to choose from the three schools (Hauptschule, Realschule, Gymnasium), your parents have now full authority to send you to any school they want. The teachers only give recommendations based on your grades, but your parents can ignore them. Which is one of the reasons nearly all of the students now go to a Gymnasium, making it very very difficult for the teachers.
If you look at a finished weld on dirty aluminum, you'll often see graininess or black specks on the surface. That's what was cleaned off. It doesn't actually clean the metal, it just breaks up the oxide layer which has a much higher melting temp than the aluminum which then migrates to the surface of the molten aluminum and makes it look a little less nice.
I don't even care if they try skydiving, go for it I say.It's horseback riding that pisses me off. Animals don't deserve abuse so you can feel better about yourself.
Pretty much constantly in elementary school, especially in 4th grade since the teacher wasn't very good. Led to me being labeled as having behavioral issues and having to have a special behavior report card signed at the end of every day. My parents were so mad at that teacher. Eventually I learned to just keep things to myself mostly.
It really says a lot that blacks think text over the internet expressing opinions they don't like justify them physically attacking others.It says they're a profoundly weak and sensitive people.

What I want to know is why his friends left him.  The article says he "fell behind" the group.  Did they not notice he wasn't keeping up?  Did they look for him or try to help him along?  Did he walk away from them when they weren't looking?  I don't get how they could leave him behind.  They don't sound like very good friends.
As is said, install the OS onto the SSD then set the SSD as the startup disk. He can use Migration Assistant, in the Utilities folder, to move his files and settings across. This can move some apps but they may need to have serial numbers etc reapplied. When he is sure that the files have been moved, he can delete the files on the old disk and reuse it as wanted.  There are also utilities like CarbonCopyCloner, shareware/commercial that can just cole to the SSD.
I think it would be pretty cool to have the #1 SBC, MAC, MWC, CUSA, and AAC playing head to head in two bowls each season, round robin, ~~with one left out every year~~, with the top mid major getting into that access bowl. So lets saying its SBC and MAC champs play in mid major madness bowl west the first year, CUSA and AAC champs in major madness bowl east that year with top MWC getting into the access bowl. The next year it would switch. Possibly there would be teams that wouldnt be game, but I think it would be fun

This is the best reply so far.  I didn't get hard the firs time I had sex and I was just like OMG its happening and thinking to much about it gets you out of the moment. If you just enjoy her instead and make her have a good time your dick will get on board, even if it doesn't showing her you are willing to please her regardless of your pleasure is generally a huge turn on for women.
I'm so gonna get this foundation.Plus, I think it's pretty rad she's having a book on the history of beauty!

Both are good, but so far in one season with Gaya I've seen more promise going forward and defensively than Bernat. If anything Alba is better Bernat.

I'm cool with that, now that Mariota is gone we still have some flexibility to move around and get a really good player for a smaller price. I'm not entirely comfortable with rolling the dice on Bradford's health myself, but I'd prefer that than what we were gonna give up for MM. If Bradford implodes and we get Sanchize all year next year at least we'll still have a (high) first rounder to try and get another QB. Or, Bradford stays healthy and we keep our good players. I'm good with it.EDIT: wrong word.

Exactly!   I had terrible nosebleeds all the time until, on vacation, my nose would just not stop bleeding and I ended up in urgent care.  The doc told me to use vaseline on the inside of my nose.  I've done it every day since and the nosebleeds are GONE.

I am there and doing that and your response makes me think you do not understand US taxes. If he does not make a dime in Cali, he does not have to pay income tax in Cali.E.g. If he has a house/car in Cali, makes $1,000,000 in Texas, and makes $0 in Cali. He will pay property tax in Cali, US Federal income tax, and state income tax in Texas.

&gt; I was told to step down so it wouldn't hurt my own reputation to stay there and the organization's reputation potentially.Eh, they lied to you. Stepping down was the worst decision for you make, and hurt your reputation the most.Because* You signaled that you were incompetent when you stepped down.* It was just an honest mistake.It only required an apology, and making sure to be more aware of what you're reading.* It wasn't actually your fault. It was the screener's fault.* Stepping down made it seem like you might have done it on purpose/ are grossly incompetent/ this happened before* You had the ability to make it an honest mistake on everyones' part, but instead you decided to take full blame and just step down. 
I would still talk to housing. I left Tech in the middle of the year. The process was more like a negotiation in my opinion. The housing faculty have the final say and can bypass the rules.

I just hope the whole Alliance debacle incduced some humility into him. He is just such a great player and I'd be really happy if he'd be be back on the team. Steelback is fine, but arguably he is just not as good of a player.
Unless you have some specific need c++ and java aren't that different. Most likely your choice should be dictated by available libraries. Biggest difference as languages in my mind would be choosing between RAII in c++ or garbage collection in java. Second consideration would be template metaprogramming in c++ vs generics and reflection in java, though you might not end up doing anything complicated in either. As I said they're not that different, but we can't give suggestions without requirements.FYI this subreddit is more focused on academic views of languages not helping people choose between them. Maybe /r/learnprogramming is the place to ask.

Fantastic for that.  Transcoding 1080P movies which are 3GB+ easily with no hiccups.  It is also running the torrent server and indexing server along with that, I highly recommend it.
There are some stuff that teams work better. Like when the legion of doom attacks, superman and Wonder Woman can only do so much. Also the mortals can fight on par with some of the powered supervillians. Also superman maybe strong, but batman is more brains too.  Their collective force makes them both better. 
I'm glad you like it, and I hope it proves useful to you! Please do pass on the word to others – I'm good at coding and good (I hope!) at writing tutorials, but I'm *terrible* at marketing what I've done :)
Is this solely for chrome? Or is there possibly support for Safari?  It looks nice, I didn't like momentum because it swamped my new tab page and didn't let me do anything!

Yah I wonder if theres a site with a list of randomized companies that have like one or two lines of description about what they do. I've been meaning to do a challenge similar to this to help up my own game too. 
Rivers won't be the QB next year when the Chargers move to LA, unless something very random happens and/or they throw extreme amounts of money at him (even for QB standards).
They're spammers. Their main accounts are /u/Rafix2105 and /u/RHthemadking. I know them from /r/shittydarksouls. They hate me for having a trans ex-girlfriend and calling them out as bigots when they denied her identity. They have now proceeded to spam all of my subreddits with random shit. First it was ants, now it's sausages.
Actually, it had a lot less to do with any supposed advancement on the part of Europeans and a lot more to do with the host of new diseases they introduced to the native population.The fact is that urban settlements and agriculture were commonplace in North and South America centuries before Europeans arrived, and there's zero reason to believe that the introduction of European culture would be viewed as noteworthy by a species of immortals that have already mastered interstellar travel.
But /r/aww is usually mostly dogs.As of right now the front page of /r/aww has:Dogs - 17 ^[note ^1]Cats - 5 ^[notes ^1 ^&amp; ^2]Racoons - 1Giraffes - 1Bears - 1Bunny - 1*Note 1: One picture includes a cat and a dog together that why the total is 26.**Note 2: I included a baby cheetah in the cat section.*I have been doing this for over a year every time someone claims /r/aww is dominated by cats and it is always more dogs than cats. Don't take my word for it though, just do it yourself. Every time someone says this look at the front page of /r/aww.
I think the most cutting I've heard from a colleague is, 'why don't you go outside and make some friends' to a miserable, rude boy who wanted to sit in the classroom at lunchtime.If the staffroom door is closed then you may speak freely.Though never heard any sleazy/sexual comments. Don't know if that's maybe more of an American thing? 
Period summary,  caps blew, rangers dominated, alzner nearly killed a ranger with a slash to a leg,  rangers are winning the cup but ^^^^ovie ^^^^scoredThanks nbc
Well in my defense they kept bringing it up in the subreddit drama thread. Like 5 different commenters said oh look it's the next stripper because her parents are going to make her hate them. That's where the whole stripper thing originally came from I didn't bring it up they did.
Think about its actual application. Men don't have control over reproduction at all, no say in it, even if they use contraception, or are deceived out of it. A partner can abort a mans child without his consent or carry it to term against his will. 
Go rewtach the moments were MCW  got punched  at the same spot like Giannis did.Giannis never flops and he got angry for a reason.https://vine.co/v/e7neQHjgql6yeah, dunleavy is the one starting this shit.
I use to have really bad cramps, and terrible mood swings. The thing that really calmed down my mood swings was when I started working out but the cramps were still there but I'd rather deal with the cramps instead of the terrible emotional mood swings I'd get a week before and during my period.
It *is* that bad. Mentality and perception don't come with an on-off switch. How you talk about a student is how you will think about them, especially when they annoy or frustrate you. 
Well. I didn't play many jrpgs, but Persona series is definitely best for me especially in comparison Persona 4 with Final Fantasy XIII. Persona has excellent balance of good dialogues, interactive things and fighting. There are good characters. Game is really long but you don't feel tired. But I have bad feelings about Persona 5 and even don't know why. Maybe it's all about style, main character or three second role characters which look too typical. Typical guy, typical blonde girl and strange cat.
Weirwoods in the south are only in gardens. You don't want rogue saplings of any tree to clutter the garden, let alone ones that get that freaking big. And there's no point in transplanting them since common folk would destroy them.
Campus rape epidemic? I bet this has something to do with the way childs are educated, or rather not educated about sexuality and alcohol and those who are worried the most about campus rape are part of the problem by focusing on preaching abstinence rather than proper controlled and educated contact.
2 or 3 for me.- 1 is too hard to read- 4 looks like some kind of cheap bulk goods warehouse- 5 just doesn't look like a real logo- 6 looks like some kind of sports goods logo.
I know a then-student, now fully-fledged teacher who fucked one of her older students at a club without realising it when she was on her prac.It was the weekend before she was going to this school and...yeah.BTW: Yes, she is fucking hot.The student was so chill about it too, he took her aside, assured her no one would find out...and then asked if she wanted to continue the relationship lol.Heard all this from her btw.Proof of hot (face cencored obv): http://i.imgur.com/kpuGP4j.jpg
You are the man. What a privilege you have. I can't even dream of owning my current obsession, the Nomos Zürich Weltzeit Nachtblau (Worldtimer), let alone dream watches, aka ART, like you have. Keep up with the pictures! Very cool to see these!
Not very. They last for a while on me if I'm not eating/drinking/etc but they'll normally need a touch up after a cup of tea. I find them quite variable though - some of them disappear as soon as you look at them (Romantique can be picky, Triceratops, Demon's Desire) and some will survive a couple of drinks and light snacking intact (the ones with better formulas generally, like Sexy Nerd and Winter Romance.)
I'm still trying to figure this out as well. If you find out, let me know! I only have 2 friends left, hah. Ruined all romantic relationships so I'm staying away for now. 
I completely agree with this.  I watched a cyclist use a turning lane to travel straight across an intersection, and it resulted in a car lightly clipping her.  Cyclist fell off, car immediately pulls over to check if she's okay.  Other pedestrians have already helped her off the road, etc.Meanwhile, her friends are verbally harassing this guy who didn't do anything wrong, and clearly felt *awful*.  Nobody drives and says, "Damn, I'd *love* to hurt a cyclist today."  Screaming at a motorist about how much you "FUCKING HATE THE CARS IN THIS TOWN" isn't helping your friend, nor is it changing the fact that your friend caused the accident in the first place.  
Sorry, it's GMT+1 here and very late D: I can trade for the next 15 mins but if you're not around then we'll have to rearrange for tomorrow I'm afraid!

It's Release to Manufacturing, however, RTM is the first build that consumers will receive. In the case of Windows, RTM releases go to the OEMs (Dell, HP, etc.) months before a customer can purchase it. This gives the OEMs time to install it and bloat it up en mass in preparation for the release to the public (general availability). With that said, there could be patches available through Windows Update by the time it becomes available to the public.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_to_manufacturing_.28RTM.29
There would have been a hint of that behind Tywin taking Tysha away. Mostly however, it was because she was a commoner and not someone Tywin wanted to marry his son.

heard this from a former policeman teaching a defensive driving course.A cop pulls over a driver for running a stop sign. the guy says but officer I didn't run it, I slowed down.  the cop says that's not the same thing, the driver says sure it is officer. the cop pulls out his billy club and start beating the driver in the head, then says now do you want me to slow down or stop?
Good. Any team that wants to move from 20 to 2 should have to give up a shit ton of picks/players. There's a reason the worst teams draft first. They need the help more than you and have all the leverage.edit: salty eagles fans downvoting. 
There's a special rule in Reg 25.2505 that says that previously used DSUEs are included in the total available exclusion amount, but it seemed odd to me that an individual could go around collecting additional estate tax exclusions ad infinitum. The only example that's ever given in relation to that specific piece of literature assumes that the cumulative DSUEs aren't in excess of the $10.68 million maximum that would be available without the special rule, and I couldn't seem to find anything else about it online...
The way I see it, Qunari refers to the religion, qunari refers to the race. We don't capitalize dwarf, or elf, so why not let the lower-case variant refer to race?
Jags probably taking Dante Fowler Jr. Wouldn't be surprised if it was Williams either. Edit: YupRaiders are taking Williams! Damn. Not a bad pick though, Cooper should be a great receiver. Skins won't let Williams slip any lower. Ayy lmao
got a big hangover after a reunion with my old friends from high school, but it was an enjoyable one since we barely see each other and mostly talk on chats and got a lot of catching up
I don't mind the casting, but I hope they don't screw up the story. Like many books, this one seems like it would be a perfect 10 part Netflix or HBO series.
We had a personal finance class in grade 10, and options for "home" skills through grades 10-12. Those included law, fashion (which was really just a sewing class), cooking and nutrition, parenting, living spaces and shelter, etc. I didn't know it at the time, but my highschool actually offered a wide variety of useful classes outside of standard education.. Also auto, welding, computer tech, drafting, portfolio, etc. I hadn't considered it in a long time but I guess we were really lucky.
I can attest to this. I lift in a gym where dropping is prohibited. Controlling the weight back DOWN to your shoulders not only builds strength but builds confidence. Learn to be comfortable bringing it down slowly.
You said that 'it [platypuses] never really evolved after the reptile/mammal divergence.', which is why I pointed out that echidnas evolved from platypuses. Many other extinct mammals did, too, and once upon a time (many millions of years after the reptile/mammal divergence) monotremes were a thriving clade of mammals like marsupials and placentals.

This pseudo-intellectual is disgusting. 'Caste'?Anyway, you should not have covered up his name. Also, no. Just because you go through difficulties does not mean you have to support or emphasize with other minorities. Black people in the USA, on average, oppose gay marriage more than white people. 
You guys have played a hell of a series. I would say that I think you could fight your way back in this, but without Antetokounmpo, I don't think you will 
If you said why you feel that way I'm sure some people would agree the series has some flaws, but that show was really revolutionary at the time.  I remember ordering a bootleg End of Eva VHS tape and excitedly sitting in front of my cathode ray Tv getting mindfucked as a teenager.  Ohhh the nostalgia.

Amarillo is kinda expensive to use for bittering. I'd consider using Magnum or Warrior. You'll probably only need 0.5 - 0.6 oz and it should be cheaper. Then take that ounce of Amarillo and add it to your dry-hop.

Ok, who told you they didn't? Two can play that bullshit game. Why would there be all of these rumors for no reason? There is zero point in putting it out there just for shits and giggles.
Yeah I totally agreeHopefully Giannis will learn from this. But Dunleavy has been a bitch the entire series, not saying it redeems what Giannis did at all, he just has to learn to pay back by dominating on the court instead of playing into the bulls small dirty plays thats going on.You can really see the difference in experience between these two teams, the bulls know just how to make the Bucks frustrated so the young Bucks show it while the refs are watching (13 techs in the series)

And yeah it has an awkwardly good fit for some reason as you mentioned a few... it is just so fun to play, if you have the cards I'd suggest giving it a shot for 5-10 games, it is an absolute blast and may inspire you to play it more- it has had that effect on a lot of people
Thank you very much for the well thought out response! Unfortunately with the way my program is structured, I have to wait until my final quarter to take my senior capstone course, so it's kind of an all or nothing deal. It's a bummer you don't get anything extra from employers for completing two degrees, but a double degree vs double major is only like a 5 course difference in my program.

The nightly news. Local news isn't bad, but the national coverage by NBC and the other major networks is hard for me to sit through. There are agendas to be pushed, I get that, but I can't help but wonder why anyone would take them seriously.

&gt;Draw a freehand circle, then click to see how close you got to a perfect circle. Help with server costs.It wasn't built to compare results, it was built to see how close *you* got to a perfect circle. You *could* reliably compare results if you categorized circles in small, medium, or large variety. You could refine that accuracy but adding a fourth, fifth, sixth... nth type to the category. It does none of that for you, but doesn't appear to have been built for that in the first place, and all of that would immensely add to the complexity of the design.It could pretty easily normalize results, but that would ignore the fact that larger circles are harder to draw freehand using a mouse.

Every ship in the game is designed to be universal to an extent. The Hornet can carry cargo. The Origin 890 can be a pirate. That's the entire point of the Aurora - to be adequate at every job but exceptional at none. &gt;it sounds like whatever variants the Hulls can be converted to, they are going to be good at the roleThis is the illogical leap you're making. Greater modularity does not mean greater effectiveness. The only other role that we know the Hull series will be good at is as a [Q-ship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-ship), which is a narrow counter-ambush role and makes perfect sense for a freighter. Every other role that you're theorycrafting is at best speculation and at worst panicky rumor-mongering. 
A lot of athletes actually fuck that up. David James was an elite level goalkeeper for like 15 years and he's declared bankruptcy. Countless NFL players run dry post career.30 for 30 did an interesting show on the topic called "broke" I really recommend watching if youre interested in the financial minds of people who make six figures before they know what a mortgage is.
Every time I get Abel from a chest, I just sigh and pick him up anyway. There are worse drops (like Fate as The Lost), but I rarely get any decent use out of him besides large stationary bosses that we can double team with all the ultra mega massive DPS Abel adds.
That's a pretty bad situation.  I definitely don't have answers but clearly the city needed to be better prepared if it wanted to take an influx of arrestees.

Rabiah's flavor is too tied to the real world and the source material (with cards like Aladdin's Lamp, Shahrazad and Bazaar of Baghdad). Nowadays Magic likes to keep its flavor separated from its real world inspirations.

I was a subtitute teacher for a few years. One day, I went to the high school I graduated from to substitute for a gym teacher. The class was taught by multiple teachers, and the other substitute, "Mr. C," frequently substituted when I was a student there.We got to talking and he says, "This district is going downhill. It's all of these blacks."I pause for a minute. This man is Sicilian. I'm white, so I'm guessing he thought that meant I'm automatically of the same opinion.A black student walks up and asks some things; this kid must have heard some of the conversation. Mr. C answers him. The kid has just turned away and he says to me, "He's OK for being one of them."I was floored.

I bring the combines for life powders and spread the healing love when it's needed. It's saved so many missions and hunters are normally very thankful for it. I've been hunting the T. Zamtrios and he is quite the hungry fatty. Instead of throwing poop at him, I take the time for DPS and life powder the hunter who's been named dinner. Extra DPS and no one dies, Yay! But once I am in the belly? No dung bombs, no life powders, just stomach acid till death. It's disheartening being the only one helping to keep the group alive.

Primaries aren't actually general elections though. They are just the party's way of choosing a candidate they want to run on their ticket. Also, there are only three countries in Europe with enforced compulsory voting (Cyprus Liechentstein, and Luxembourg) . . . and only Switzerland gives postal notifications for all voting elections.

Those people would be wrong, he definitely is one of the greatest ever.In my country (Portugal) there is a consensus, he was the best of that era, we all liked Figo (one of is rivals in that time) butt Zidane was a lot better.Di Stefano was the king in the 50's, Pele in the 60's, Cruijff in the 70's, Maradona in the 80's, Zidane in the late 90's early 00's and Messi since then.Ronaldo Fenomeno was closed, and arguably better than Zizou in top form butt he had to many injuries and only as something like 3, 4 years in his prime (when he was in his early 20's). Zizou had a decade in contention to the best player in the world.One of the most skillful players ever (his first touch was unreal) who won every important thing like CL, WC, La Liga and Seria A (the best league in the world by far in that time). For me he is the best I ever seen apart from Messi and this comes from a Portuguese a country Zizou used to kill in the big tournaments.
Chill. u/exccord is right. Even white supremacists have some right ideas. These ideas are just a piece of everything that supremacists thing and as a whole they end up completely misguided, hateful, and awful, and just totally unacceptable. Even in the speech portrayed in the video, Derrick has some points which in general make sense but simply do not apply to the situation at all. He is ultimately wrong.

It'd be way too strong if it'd activate no matter what if the unit is killed during it's duration. 2 infestors and you're guaranteed to be directly converting up to 24 supply directly into your army MIDFIGHT, STRAIGHT into the battlefield.I'm not sure how to tweak it to not make it too insane or too broken. Probably energy cost. I feel like if a infestor could only do it on one unit in a fight, it wouldn't be too strong, maybe?EDIT: If you want it to introduce some actual micro it'd have to be way shorter than 10 seconds as well, 10 seconds is like, the duration of a 200 vs 200 fight, if not longer.
I know that's the point of them, but I totally get what you mean, and the lack of an obvious "all actors involved were above the age of 18" disclaimer makes my skin crawl a bit
Follow this advice.  Spot on.  Exactly as I did it, but I took 5 days in the T-9 and was ready to buy a fully outfitted trade Conda.  Since Conda I bought and outfitted a combat Clipper and put 50 Million credits in the bank trading about 1 hour a day.  The rest of the time I have fun with the Clipper.  I will add more ships after next release.  It was a long road, but really once I got to the Python, the rest only took a few weeks.

I had no idea that was a law myself. Perhaps he did, and perhaps he didn't.  As far as I knew, the cyclist was in the wrong because she had attempted to pass the taxi on the left. One of the passengers even asks her why she was passing a stopped vehicle like that.That being said, as I mentioned somewhere else in this thread, I would've stayed there and waited for the police but I definitely would not give her my information.
I've always had an irrational fear of little people.  I'm really not sure why, although I blame "The Wizard of Oz" for it.  I have intentionally tried to challenge this fear as an adult and have worked through it somewhat.
I doubt that they are sleazier than any other billionaire. But I gather they have become very active in in the culture wars and have made lots of enemies. Its in the mind of people that the koch  are evil billionaires pulling the strings of us politics. So people are looking for it more now. Sometimes finding it sometimes making connections where there are none. 
No. Marvel movies aren't dumb movies with explosions and mumbo jumbo. There's something more to it. If that's all we wanted, we could watch Transformers. It's a melding of several separate things.GDQ's are meant to be in that same vein. So, if you're complaining that they're doing things wrong on the speedrunning end, those complaints are valid. How many of those WOULD lead to them losing money if they fixed it?It seems to be that the overzealous rules policies and the occasionally unprofessional behavior of the staff, coupled with poor organization and communication make up the brunt of the complaints, and I'm sorry, if you think that is going to lose you money, you're off in the head.I would say that these people don't think that, but that they don't care. If you're okay with that, fine. Keep watching and support them. If you're not, say something. Doing that is the only way to change things.
See, I disagree. The fedora doesn't *enhance* any of those outfits except the bottom middle one. Each one of the others would be better without the fedora. It's just not a good hat because you have to fit within an extremely narrow description range for it to fit.
Wouldn't keeping it well oiled avoid much of the risk? I've always found that if you keep the wood in a fairly saturated state from the onset, you end up with a pretty consistent life. I'm in a bit more dry climate. It may be a little more difficult in a humid region, but OP should be able to control moisture content. Keeping it somewhat high. This might all be moot if op got lucky with his species of wood.
Dunleavy started some shit and got roughed up. Giannis got tossed for retaliation. No one got hurt. Bulls advance. The end. Take your moralizing somewhere else.
If it wasn't so blatantly a parody, I'd take it seriously.  I'm an English SNP Cllr, and I co-founded English Scots for YES, so this kind of nonsense really annoys me...But read the post...it's clearly an agent provoceteur...I mean "scotts"? Seriously?What next? "It was him wot dun it, wiv a shooter, saw him gud an proper I did, guv'nor"??
FBI is always creating "stings" and often using entrapment.  This happened to be a drug sting.  Instead of sending more people to jail and going on a witch hunt, can we please simply decriminalize drugs?  We can do away with the DEA, and large portions of the FBI an DHS.
I'd go with a white watch face, silver or chrome bezel, and a tan or brown strap. You should head to /r/watches if you want a specific model recommendation. 
Can you be a socialist libertarian? It seems like his views on what the states should take care of are more along my lines of thinking but it sure seems like the rich have to pay a lot of taxes. Why aren't people upset about taxes that huge corporations making billions of dollars are finding ways to avoid paying?
I've used this technique a couple of times over the past month. It works, but reheating them doesn't get them as hot as I want them to without over cooking the yolks. Next time I'll pull them early the first time through so I can reheat them more without over cooking. 
Well one of the studies I linked suggests that it is not a piss poor anti-androgen.http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM197404182901602"Mean (± S.E.M.) plasma testosterone — 416 ± 34 ng per 100 ml — was significantly lower in this group than that in the control-group mean — 742 ± 29 ng per 100 ml — for age-matched men who had never used marihuana"That is a significant reduction, and it was seen in humans. Also it is thought to interfere with androgen uptake as well.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6249575I don't see it really being a weak anti-androgen. Perhaps weaker than others, but it still has a significant effect. And as I said before I was never suggesting it could be the cause. Rather could it be one of the influencing factors. 
I don't know, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be a big deal. If you're in Baltimore, have you checked out Exile Fitness? It's a really hardcore powerlifting gym and it's awesome.
in scid vs pc you can do a premove by using ctrl+click on piece to move and click square to move to. Not ideal but it works. Pychess also has fics support but i havent used it much for online play.
No. Never, even if I believe it. I always model respect and consistently expect them to do what they are supposed to do. I feel like a broken record, but if I tell them they'll never amount to anything, they'll just switch off, give in and never trust or believe in me, which makes managing the classroom that much more difficult. It's a vicious cycle that I can't perpetuate in good conscience.
I love how they teased Bard using summoners Rift, the 3 little icos that would glow on the map. That would be awesome if they did something similar. However I think with this update on the baron pit they just wanted to give it more structure and a "dangerous" vibe. AKA 2SPOOKY5ME
His non-witnessing testimony is becoming more irrelevant anyway. The cops cant count to 4 unless there's independant video of them stopping more than 3 times, the arresting officer had his guns taken away because he's unstable, and 5 cops have already been shown to be filing false reports. smokescreen like this isnt going to help them as much as they hope
Can you link a source where it's mentioned that the bottom core trait line is being replaced by the elite? Sorry I just haven't been able to find anything on that
We were at DL this weekend and picked up a few of these amazing postcard prints from Wonderground in downtown Disney. They're going to go around the Wooden vintage Tower of Terror sign that's now available at the ToT store, the sign had to be shipped to us, I can't wait for it to get here. I'll post the final presentation when we have it all up. 
try going for more defencive or aoe spells, also if its somthing like dark fog or the swishy swoooshy spell ry predict where the phantoms gonna go e.g if you've notice hes a reactive player, try argo him with soul arrow, if hes a super agro dude who wants your ass on a silver platter then you know he is not gonna waste time in hacking you up therefore lay a aoe spell right i front of you, cs thats where he/she is gonna roll to) thats my theory thought, overall if you feel unsatisfied with your build then change it, cos theres no point play if you're not having fun you now :)

Yeah, Wind employee here, was totally frustrated on Tuesday trying to get data in the Financial district. The more dense the area, the less speed you get. At home I'm fine. 
You would really need to take a calculus course for it to make sense easily, but essentially what he's doing is reordering the equation without actually changing the value so that it matches a predefined identity which one would have memorized, and is very easy to solve (the part where he says "∫sec^(2)(x) dx = tan(x) + c" is the predefined identity, with tan(x) + c being the solution).Essentially what this means is that he's taking the integral of sec(x)/cos(x) (finding the area underneath the curve of sec(x)/cos(x)). He then proves that the area under sec(x)/cos(x) is equal to that of sec^(2)(x) and solves using an identity to say that the indefinite area under the curve is equal to tan(x) + c (where c is any real number).
Ugh, I don't even know what goes on in the minds of such individuals.But hey, live and let live, she can do what ever she wants, I don't care. Just please for the love of everything holy do not call this "art".
it's hard 4 me 2 go nuts over a video no matter how many people r around me going crazy. there's just so much energy b'ing in the same room with the band and feeding off of their energy 2.  maybe death grips r COMPLETELY different in this respect and if that's how this tour is going 2 b, we'll all find out whether they can convey the same energy as a tru blu live show.  i'm going 2 6 shows and i'm just fuckin hoping they r physically playing.
I bought the lucian one, would of bought lee sin one if I liked the skin it was released on.  These are great and really fun, gonna enjoy buying them for all my fav champs.
It's very refreshing to say the least. However, it's still mindboggling to be called a racist by a white liberal for pointing this out in person. It's very depressing to see whole generations of whites being taught so much self loathing and uncompromising acceptance of people who hate them.
They are one and the same. Speed = distance/time. You you have super speed it means that you use very little time. If you can dilate time, then you move at regular speed but the rest of the universe slows down. Neither you nor the rest of the universe would be able to tell the difference.
If you're certain the relationship isn't salvageable, perhaps approach the "daunting" part of the breakup -- the actual logistics of it -- by pretending that you've already done it. It's a good exercise. Right now, this minute, tell yourself that it's over: What would your next steps be? Where would you live? What would you pack? What bills need to be separated? Work it step-by-step so it doesn't seem so overwhelming. Then, you'll be able to sit her down and explain you're ending it without an added panic attack. And I think taking that week to sort things out seems like a solid plan. Good luck.

Potence + Obfuscate + Melee = MASSIVE OUT OF NOWHERE ONE-SHOTSMileage may vary on Obfuscate-immune enemies, but you'll still have Potence and dabbling in Animalism to keep enemies occupied will help defensively.
My thoughts are that the media is obfuscating what is really going on and how badly the police are losing, and that I wish there was more counter-cultural uprising going on in other American cities simultaneously.  If we all stand up at once, they can't stop us from taking our country back.
The troops she's stuck leading in Meereen is the event spawned stack of about 10000. I've had Dany slowly ship a considerable amount of troops from Slaver's Bay across to Westeros before to help my battles when I've married her before. Poor Dany has never been married for love. Always for her armies or Dragons...Sorry to hijack the post - but does anyone know what happens if Sansa is installed as LP of the North? Will the children be Stark as the title trumps the marriage, or will the children be Lancel's little Lannisters?
I got a smaller, but still nice ring when I proposed to my wife. She was/is very happy with it, but says she wouldn't mind having a bigger one sometime in the future. Some of her friends have bigger rings with more stones, but I like the one I was able to afford at the time. I tell her I'll replace her plain wedding band with one with more stones, but I always want the engagement ring to remind us of where we came from.

What's sad about this, is that A LOT of parents will say the same thing. But, of course THEIR kid is suited for college! Only the dumb kids aren't, which of course, couldn't be their's.So basically, you have a bunch of people that all agree that college isn't for everyone. But at the same time, those same people aren't willing to admit that perhaps their kids are the ones not suited for college
Same here :/ so I guess it isn't a problem with just me. I checked the website and it has a notification about a system error. I'm guessing that's what's going on. When I try using the website I keep getting glitch notifications as well. Come on Microsoft.

I agree with GRRM. But, only because I can separate the worlds of GoT and BB. What is acceptable in one, is less so in the other. I believe he was speaking about the character relative to the world he lives in. Walter in GoT wouldn't last. Joffrey couldn't exist in the world of BB. Also, the evil in GoT is much more just out there and on your plate. 
Sure. I feel like you'll still be unconvinced but I'll give it the good old college try anyway. Give me some time to organize my thoughts and evidence and expect a PM from me soon.
I still have a few glitched-paintjob adders from the early days of the original console version. There was some neat stuff you could do, lie pearlescent with matte finish.
Well, they're all different races and D&amp;D can often have racist peoples. Especially against races they believe are ALL evil (half-orcs, tieflings, drow, etc). Racial issues have existed in the Fantasy genre since its conception.

Because it was bred by a man who had a couple illegal wolves and some other dogs, including an American/white shepherd. This was a neighbor of one of my mom's friends. The guy had warrants out in several states and was in hiding, so our future dog was starving and killed another neighbor's chicken. He said he was going to shoot her when he got off work, and when my mom found out, we drove out there and rescued her.Some of the guy's other dogs were adopted or put into shelters. Several of the vicious ones, including the two wolves were put down. I'd upload pictures, but I don't have any and would need to dig them out at my mom's house.
So in that study, the kids who saw their moms sporadically were more likely to develop depression than kids who never saw their moms again? That's interesting.Edit: Grammar
Pretty much, which would lead me to believe that the ones who are complaining are the same people struggling to adapt to the new meta, or feel like they have less of an advantage compared to Classic mode. That said I'm still curious to see how much OC'ing affects a bots performance. I was shocked too see my medic shredding through a plasma tank in an earlier game.
The challenges these days are pretty varied so it would be almost impossible for someone to go on a complete immunity run. Rodney or Sierra should be able to beat Mike at some challenge. 
1. Get tickets in section 22 and show up at 5:00 when gates open to catch BP, and ask guys coming in and out of the clubhouse. Alternately;1.b. Get tickets anywhere and wander down towards section 22 at the beginning of the game and/or and at the bottom/top of the 9th. Tip the usher at the top of the stairs $20. Wander down and see who's around signing after the game.  2. Left-center as near the field as possible!edit - Section 22 'cause it's right next to the clubhouse stairs that lead out to the field.
Same steering wheel in the base GT as well. And you have my favorite center gauge up. I just wish it would magically tick over into the boost section sometimes.

Friend's mom teaches at my school, he sometimes tells me the interesting things other teachers say. The worst so far came from a medical teacher and was directed towards one of the students in my class: "I bet fagboy is going to show up in his nice little dress shoes." Not my favorite teacher.

The only point I made is that it's POSSIBLE for it to flop, there is no wrong to that statement unless you want to claim it's IMPOSSIBLE for it to flop. 
Fowler wouldn't really compliment Mack well unless they moved him to a 4-3 DE, he's more of a 3-4 OLB/DE. Leonard would fit in way more in oakland, but since he's good and fuck the raiders, I hope they pick a receiver.

To be fair, a lot of teacher education programs have only about one semester of actual developmental psychology courses.  A lot of teachers don't even work with kids until at least their second year (unless they're in a good program, which doesn't necessarily mean the school's even good).This may sound like an oxymoron, but teachers oftentimes come out of their undergrad with too much education and often too little experience.

Other than having mini-rule book to pass around, no.That said, the minis and map tiles were worth the cost for me. Actually, the minis alone were worth it, and I didn't know how much I'd love the map tiles.However, if you have tons of terrain and minis from Hordes, you don't really need it.
My ideal scenario for the Undertaker's retirement, since this is the only thread that's ever seemed appropriate for it. Wins rumble, wins title at Wrestlemania. Taker receives such a beating that the light from the urn flickers out and dies. Druids come out, lights go out, and then they come back on, and all that's left in the ring is the urn and the title. Commence a tournament next night on Raw, because tournaments rule.

It's not a good pick. I wish him the best, but he's not the answer there. Glaringly obvious to me, but maybe I'm wrong. FWIW, I don't know if Mariota would have been the answer either, but Tampa did have to pick one of the two of them. It's a gamble either way. Shitty year to have the #1 pick when you need a QB..
SV and MM are getting slight buffs in PTR. I too run SV but also play MM, and have found that a decent SV/MM hunter can outperform BM. In all honesty the fact BM does so well with 4pc currently motivates me to push harder as SV/MM. I really enjoy the specs I play and relish the challenge. Don't worry about who is the stronger/weaker spec to play, just enjoy what you do and you'll do well

Or they only play POP from the 70s/80s and no rock. Belinda Carlisle is a great singer, but her songs are NOT rock. Journey does rock. The Moody Blues did rock. "Music made in the 60s-80s" is not the definition of classic rock. The phrase you're looking for is "classic music." But apparently we can't use that because people can't tell the difference between classic and classical or some shit. 
I would recommend looking on Airbnb and seeing what similar sized houses around your area are renting out for.  Say you end up listing the room for $220, if you aren't getting any requests after a month or so, lower the price.  If you're getting flooded with requests, you know you've undervalued yourself and bump up the price.  Also, keep in mind peak traveling seasons for NYC and change your prices accordingly.

Having flown over Mexico city during some studying abroad, I can say that picture does not even start to show the full scale of the city. In all directions literally as far as you can see, even hundreds of feet up in an airplane, all you could see was landscape covered in buildings. The true scale of it is so mind blowing still that it is something I definitely want to witness again, even if only from a plane.

There's a great app called Tenuto on the app store. It costs a few dollars but it has some great exercises in it that will help you such as note recongnition, ear training, and interval training. A great companion app is their app which I believe is just called Music Theory. This can all be found at musictheory.net but if you want to support them or use it more conveniently, you can buy the apps.
Could not agree more. Your body is most likely doing a fair amount of compensation elsewhere in your hips and core and this book will work on your whole body rather than treating what may be a symptom. 
I dunno, I liked it. But then again I watched it only a few months ago for the first time, followed the rewatch threads for it, and asked a friend of mine questions and discussed the show with him. I also love to over analyse the anime I watch, especially those that seem fairly intelligent. I get why people don't like the non-EoE ending, but I thought it was pretty interesting and insightful.Of course, EoE blew the whole thing out of the water, but NGE wasn't bad at all.
This banlist looks like someone misinterpreted the "casual" part of EDH to mean "Decks should be janky as hell and not have good cards"I can say for certain that I would never bother playing at a LGS with rules like these. Not only does the expanded banlist rule out a lot of fun strategies, none of my 5 decks would be legal to play there without swapping out several cards, and some of them wouldn't be legal ever.
Strikers could work with Death From Above, mainly because everyone knows that a reckless Titan running at you in a straight line has about the same possible outcome as standing on the path of a moving train, so they'd likely run/blink away. DFA is more unpredictable for the enemy, possibly not having a visual on the Titan until he's literally in their faces with his fist. 
Depends on how ok you are with interacting with other players. If you do it all yourself, it will likely take you a few months or more. However if you choose to involve other players you can reasonably get them all in like 5 hours. It depends mainly on logistics like are people trading what you want to buy and does the reddit armory have what you want in stock. And if you decide to buy them off the steam market it's probably something like 30 minutes since theres a lot of clicking involved. But as I said earlier, the stock weapons you start with are head and shoulders above most of the alternative weapons.
As one opinion, this sounds like a recipe for buyer's remorse to me. If you already feel big reservations about the purchase before making it, I don't think they will go away once you buy it, unless the money is nothing to you and you're okay turning around and ordering something else right after because something broke or just looks bad. If you feel locked in to one option, in my opinion that's a good reason just to defer the purchase. There are so many quality keyboards in non-gaming brands that just don't have the RGB feature.

You do realize that he had not only an entire army of silver Knights, but also nito, izileth and her daughters, and seath. And he knew their weakness, right? You seem to be under the impression he soloed them. 
And Conner's evolution from a normal whiny teenager to a fucking coldhearted badass was amazing. Like, you don't really care too much for him until that event where he Shows Up as a badass, and then he gets better and better. I fucking loved that series 
well I feel better but fuck that shit. that was one UGLY MOTHER FUCKING experience.my sense of cold and taste are completely different then I remember. Bananas have this nasty taste, ice feels like it did when I was like 11 years old, gatoraid has this nasty hint of piss...I did burn my lungs good with Cl2 gas 4-5 years before, perhaps the opiate withdrawal resurrected some dead cells or something, idk. pepperoni tastes funny too, and toasted bread has a odd smell.all i got was clonadine. I did not taper (though like 36 hours in I took 1mg in an attempt to get to sleep, it did not work, so I got rid of it, i decided tapering was just gonna extend the illness.fucking drug bullshitAnd yea, it was pure, at first I needed only like &lt;300ug. Tolerance grew astrofuckingnomically.my parents got involved and I got some serious anti drug sanctions going on, like zero tolerance, probably for the best though, I have had enough fun for a long time.
Thinking about building up a custom one after college is over. Maybe by then cards like the 980 will be waaay cheaper.I feel like every gamer has a dream desktop, what's yours?
I think Jameis is much closer in personality to Cam Newton than to Johnny Manziel. As smart as he is at the game I think he'll be focused enough to calm down and settle in.
okay, serious answer: I'm not sure, if there is enough plot for a whole movie, but maybe it would be possible in the final fantasy style. [here is something, not sure about the original story](http://steamcommunity.com//app/301520/discussions/0/622954747292709238/)
It may have helped. [This](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2896138-goldilocks-and-the-three-bears) miiiiiiiight be it, but I feel like I need it in my hands to flip through and look at the back cover. Thanks for the suggestion! I'll keep playing around with my wording within searches. 
cept it screwed over the scripthook and single player mods. I mean Come on rockstar are you so worried and paranoid about GTAOnline you gotta disable ANY single player mod?  terrible. you give us a great editor and all that but do everything possible to prevent modding of the PC version........and we were having some nice mods coming out too :-(.
I love Lovecraft but he's not for everyone.Pros:Fantastic writer. Very clever.Original stories.Fantastic monster descriptions.Most of his stories can be found on youtube. _________________________________________________________________________________Cons:A bit dry and can be hard to read.He's very racist._________________________________________________________________________________People are listing their favorite stories so I'll give you a few of mine.Whisperer in DarknessThe Shadow Out of TimeThe Outsider (Pretty short)In the Mountains of Madness (Has the most lore if that's what you're looking for).The Shadow Over InnsmouthEdit: 14 by Peter Clines is a fantastic book. Very easy to read and it was very much inspired by Lovecraft.
Since these opponents control the dice of the game in regards to gambling it makes financial sence to employ them at a high rate.  Across the market for boxers inside intelligence can move and make money. Like a ton of money is involved.
I think you can list the related sites in the sidebar (go to subreddit settings, and there write in the sidebar box).I meant if there are some nylon legwear subs I didn't add there.The people I know who are into this are my friends who I figured out were into it and asked them. But they aren't very knowledgeable about hosiery though... First time they heard of FF stockings was when I showed them...Also, it's kind of difficult to find like-minded people with such a stigmatized fetish topic.
I'd just let him correct her. I have a 6 year old, almost 50 lb Standard Poodle, and a Mini Schnauzer/Boston Terrier mix puppy. When I brought the puppy home he was 8 weeks old and weighed 7 lbs. He is now 16 weeks and weighs 13ish lbs. I have let my poodle correct my puppy to his heart's content the whole time. Your puppy will eventually be a full grown dog, and preventing your older dog from laying the ground work for doggy respect will lead to fights down the road. The last thing you want is an older puppy or full grown dog with no respect and no manners, because this will lead to real fights and discontent down the road, which will be much harder for you to sort through and deal with than allowing your older dog to correct your pup now. As long as he is not drawing blood or being overly aggressive, I'd let the corrective growls, body posture, and snaps happen. 
hahahahaha you know, rapers going to keep raping 1000000 years after you're dead. Its not like, you know, like, you know me being angry on, you know like, online, will change the way crazy people act.Lets focus on the safety message rather than dilute it with chest thumping faux anger by idiots in safe positions.Men are going to rape or force themselves many many years to come, unfortunately people are hard wired the way they are. Fucken SJW trying to rewire humanity one fucken outrage at a time while making serious issues worst for people.
As someone who lived in TN during his reign, he'll be missed.  I thought he showed pro potential for sure.  Always was rooting for him.Hopefully Mariota doesn't get the same welcoming Mettenberger did.  
Pretty much nailed it. I like Pearl a lot but now that we're down to the last few girls and someone has to go every week, I'd put her (or Trixie)out next. I just think the other girls deserve it more based on performance to date. It doesn't mean I don't like them.

What does that have to do with what I said? Claiming that everyone is "easily capable of doing that" is patently false and unprovable. Stop with the sensationalist hyperbole.
then she should've just split it and bailed instead of trying to keep it all.. no, it's not a million, but half a mil should give you one helluva new start..
For real though. This is somewhat unrelated but now I am kind of on the other side of the situation because I am going into medicine and we study psychological diseases and whatnot. I have really come to appreciate how much they are BS'ing it half the time. I'll be shadowing and some girl comes in saying she's depressed. Doc will be like "hmmm have you ever tried *insert medicine here* before?" then she starts taking medicine for her depression... The dose is small and everything but for real it's basically all guesswork and the doctors just hope that it works.
is it just me or is this the stupidest headline ever. Damn, dont tell me that bitch is actually a seattle journalist! All my ISIS friends are shocked!

Glad to hear your opinion, Indigo. Your comment on poor coping skills is rather on point. That'd be a good place to do some reflection, me-thinks. And you're definitely right about my yearning for psychiatric labels. I'd blame my curiosity on that; I can't stand to not know exactly what's going on. I know I know, I'm probably out of luck on that one with the inherent difficulty of psychology. As to what I've been diagnosed, I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, SAD, GAD, OCD, ADD, and hallucinations triggered by deep seizures. That's off the top of my head, but that's the general overview of my mental health diagnosis. One thing I do know, this whole talk is reassuring and will definitely spark discussion with my next psychiatric meeting. 
check the hoe not the player, a girl wanna fuck then im down if she sexy. Frankly its the man's responsibility to use dread game to such an effect where she cant cheat, because shes so worried you willEdit: changed fine to sexy 
&gt; I'm sure we'll see an article on this by Kotaku and Polygon any minute now.I can see the click-baity header now:"Misogynistic game-dev American McGee supports entitled poro gamer gate hate group. Vows to behead any who oppose them! Also, he kicks cute kittens and drinks the blood of the innocent!!" 
Oh very nice! I'm happy to read a review like this. I actually have a B&amp;M authorized retailer about 10 mins away. So I'm super stoked to give them a try! Just rebuilt an RDA to go for the samples and come home with a winner! I usually do "special" or favorite juices on Fridays, so 1 day a week may make it the exact treat I'm hoping for. Thanks again!
Oh I know they are, I've been listening to Big Bang and their solo stuff for quite a few years now so Im not surprised at the experimental stuff at all, just this specific song isn't my style ^^ I don't mean any offense, taste is subjective!
That video makes me crack up every time I see it. Also, I agree. I've grown up in Canoga and it was bad a while back but has gotten a lot better (especially with the police station on Canoga/Roscoe). Canoga is not very different from Northridge, imo. There's rough spots throughout the Valley.
I haven't. But I'm a UI / UX designer who has worked in and around healthcare for over 10 years. PM me and tell me more specifics and I may be able to help give you some ideas. 
The fake journals were reprinting previously published studies and weren't included in Medline or other search databases. They'd have had basically no impact on medical research, I imagine they were promotional material given to doctors. There's no reason to take this as a sign that the research on vaccines is dodgy unless you're completely paranoid.It's still shitty but it's important to keep this in context - Elsevier produces a huge number of journals, some among the most reputable in their field, and by far the biggest knock against them is their subscription fee is too high.
Shipping a device that's known to catch fire and possibly explode thru the mail seems like an incredibly bad idea. Vendors should just credit everyone that bought it and get they money back from eleaf. What's the ramifications to an individual shipping the device back and it catching fire? 
WE MIGHT ALREADY HAVE ONE!  Say what you want about the ACL, he was a former #1 overall pick in the draft.  The best part?  He's already on our team.  We don't have to give up the rest of our team to get him.
I do this too so much! But with a pair of nail clippers and a pair of scissors... I will literally sit there cutting and cutting till I break my nails or till my hands are bleeding like crazy :/

My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI.  It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into it (doctors, insurance, diet pushers).  In the same way, the Bechdel test is a simple way of looking at movies that in the aggregate but is too simple to draw any solid conclusions.  Such as:&gt;demonstrates inequality against women.From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.  Maybe an MRA would hold a stronger objection to the premise of the test, but I don't have any issue with it as originally formulated.  I think it can point out a way that we can change the film industry, but not really say much about the level of inequality unless you define inequality as failing the Bechdel test.
&gt; They sat there and claimed my door was open and when that didn't work they said they thought it was like an apartment complex where anyone could just go through the front door and then knock on apartment doors.One of them didn't go by the name "Nobby Nobbs" did he?
How great would it be if there was some unknown player who had a very similar name to a prospective first rounder that got accidentally selected because the team mispronounced the other guy's name?
I played a bit of Mortal Kombat X. I've been in training mode as Bojutsu Kung Jin, trying to perfect some combos. Played some Persona 4 Golden this week, got up to Kanji's dungeon.
It's one week of train up, one week of rigorous testing. Generally by the time you do the ruck you're pretty beat up from the week of studying and testing, so that adds a little bit of difficulty to the ruck. It's 12 miles in 3 hours which isn't difficult for anyone who is regularly rucking, but many of the officers in the medical field are doctors or nurses, so they likely haven't rucked much before. In fact, they're arguably closer to civillian than military. Again, the chances of this officer ever having to do a 12 mile ruck in real life are virtually zero, but she was able to do it (even if it was ugly in the home stretch) so she earned the EFMB. Congrats to her. 
When I was in 5th grade my teacher basically said I was stupid and "the apple doesn't fall far from the tree" insinuating my dental hygienist, RN, and very mouthy mother was also stupid. So because she flipped right the fuck out and because my grandparents both taught in the district for 50years (so they knew everyone). I got checked out.I had a college level understanding and ability in every subject except writing which was admittedly a 3rd grade level. My IQ was pegged at 165 and that year I scored top 1% on 3 different standardized tests. The discussion changed from whether I needed a tutor, to whether I should get moved to high school at age 10. Didn't end up happening though.So by the end of that year after I got my scores I walked into her class (because I'd changed teachers) and told her to go fuck herself. 
23, Male, Spain. I started watching it when the first Dungeon and Dragons aired because I heard about the show on some internet forum. Since then, I became obsessed with this TV show more than with any other AV thing. And that's pretty important to me because here in Spain I'm trying to get a degree on audiovisuals and work in something related with visuals, and audio, and stuff.
"when botlane was hard carrying" you might mean "when yellowstar was hard carrying". Rekkles did nothing and was way less better than he was supposed to.

Don't waste time dieting! Just waste time by stuffing your face, walking slow (until you invest in a scooty-puff), injecting insulin, taking 3x as long to bathe.....

Start running now.  Seriously. They'll probably give you a recruit handbook the first day.  Have that read entirely before you show up the second day.  Don't do anything unless you're told to.  You don't want the instructors to know your name any time soon.

Refurbishing and regenerating the base map would be quite the challenge for them. Then again, the two map expansions together is probably around two-thirds to about the same size of the base map.
700+1 was released last Thursday and this week is golden week so assuming the pattern is followed, which it probably will be, we'll receive 700+2 next Thursday which is 7 May.  Every Thursday after next Thursday will also have a chapter. I don't know what at what time 700+1 was released though.  I'm guessing really early in the morning, like 1 a.m. - 7 a.m.
I',m assuming that you've never heard of Simon Wiesenthal or the Simon Wiesenthal Center, responsible for tracking down more Nazi war criminals than any other entity you care to name.
Keep in mind that while she is a girl, she is also a human being.  Talk to her like she's a human being.  Girls really like it when you stop freaking out (OMG, a *girl*) and acknowledge that they're just normal human beings.  The boobs are incidental.
I was a class mom last year, the sub had come in for the day as the regular teacher broke her foot in the snow. I was volunteering in the classroom. The kids were not in the room yet and this woman said "I heard that this class was filled with a bunch of assholes." The kids were in first grade and really great, fun, kids. I said that nice to know how highly you think of my son and his classmates. I walked out of the room, went to the front office and shared what the substitute said. The kids never even met her. They escorted her off of school grounds before the kids arrived. One of the school administrators taught the kids for the day. 
Of course, if snipes are rarer, then farmers with crazy storage loot are gonna stay unshielded for longer, possibly resulting in better loot overall. Maybe especially with respect to DE.

I disagree. We already know that ships needed for SQ42 are being developed first, and given that many of these are secret we won't hear about them. After that comes pledge ships prioritized by the number of pledges, size/complexity, or to test new mechanics in development.We are regularly told when ships enter and approach completion of  different stages of release (Concept, Hanger, Flight). I agree that a short section of ATV which gives this update is a good idea, so you don't have to search through RTV notes.I don't think reports on every ship being worked on at any time is a good idea, priorities change, teams working on ships can be prioritized for weeks to work on another ship which gets flagged as being required sooner, or for core gameplay systems/releases. It would just cause crying is the forums about why X ship I pledged for is 'delayed'.
i've never seen such irrelevant opinions of fiqh, even when comparing to opinions of people who aren't even muslim... What started out as a curiosity in what my ideologic enemies state, turned into a 'what the heck am i reading' and ended up with me disgusted, wondering how any of my Muslim brethren can believe any of this trash. That was bad religion even by salafi standard... nice picture of the tigris though
If it's under 600 dollars total for the year I don't think it's illicit (don't have to report it to the irs). But my actual advice is to find a local coin star and do it in person and pay for groceries with it (they are mostly in those stores anyway) then just send a buck to night attack via paypal each week. It's simple and relatively friction free.
Or because a close friend of his stole a car that happened to have a dead girl in the trunk.There is never only one answer for any situation in this case.But just to feed into your frenzy for a minute. Something came up for Hae, we don't know what, or where, but she was in a hurry after school. She left, not to get her cousin, 2:20-2:30. So, that alone shows that you can't prove Jay wasn't near Hae. Jay did know Hae, they went to the same school, hung out with the same people, played on the lacrosse team together. To say that they didn't know each other when there is a very large probability that they did, is just silly.
Lynn Ahhh yes, her girls just awful. It's so hard to parent too. Im torn to think kids are your reflection all the time but the bucks gotta stop some where. Gretchen giving parenting advice bc she took a college class, laughable.

Akuma is now rescuing the triforce from Ganondorf. I think Akuma could defeat Ganon if he actually cared enough. Just drop from the sky on to the castle into Ganondorfs main chambers and rip his soul from his asshole. Might not be that easy at all but I still feel like akuma would win 7/10 times
This is exactly how XMod will adapt.Clans will add a few fairly low level accounts for revealing traps and CC that way higher level attackers can sandbox knowing where the traps are. XMod will add a feature allowing them to manually input the traps and CC discovered by a clanmate.
The money will come from summer jobs, my savings, and my parents.It won't be 3k if there are three people in the apartment, and I have friends who are students and pay 3k/month. The dorm isn't desirable and I have lived in it for two years. People are loud and there is not enough personal space.  
My teacher repeatedly called an asian kid in my class a communist just because he was asian, called a boy a rodent because he was walking around funny and made rude racist and sexist jokes about kids she wanted to pick on. "Jeff, you're never going to get anywhere in life." "Bob, how do your parents deal with you? " 
well that's 20 minutes I'm not getting back. Honestly this is just about negligent discharges. if you always follow the 4 rules almost all of these would be avoided. the last one of not leaving guns out for kids should be obvious.

To be completely honest, I think that may have been a lot of the reason Ray left. They play so much stuff and are expected to be hilarious in everything they do, and I can see how that can burn someone out. That's like waking someone up in the middle of the night, shoving a mic in their face and telling them to make a video that'll have a million views.I'm with you about the GTA IV LP's. I've watched all the cops and crooks episodes at least 4 times each.

My school counsellor (not a psychologist or psychiatrist, just a teacher with the title 'counsellor') told me in grade 6 that I have anger issues and ADHD, and suggested to my parents that I should be put on medication.This was after a single incident where I lashed out violently at a classmate who had been brutally physically bullying me for over a year. He was never punished. I had no history or violence before this and academically I was doing great. My parents called the counsellor an idiot.
Glad it was useful guys.That's a whole bunch of stuff to keep track of Charles!My instinct is always to keep things simple by sing as few tools as possible.  Oftentimes I feel like the more tools I have the more I forget them, and I just keep them around as a security blanket of sorts.  But that's just my personality.  Working with a team, I need to be more flexible and try to figure out what works best for everyone.Working on paper or just working unconnected to the internet has definitely boosted my productivity.  I have a Surface that I work on once a week.  It's exhausting, but I usually get one and a half day's work done just because there are no internet distractions like Reddit. :P
Ah, the cherry picking.&gt;"Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to fulfill. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

This update has shown me that Hussie is not only hilarious, he has a style of writing that is utterly beautiful in some weirdly fucked up way that is such a goddamn treat to read.
Definitely junk food gotta go grocery shopping and use coupons. apply for help from the state, get food stamps. Its always the junk food that costs the most. The average wages life sucks ass and has plenty of paperwork to stay comfortable.
1. I understand that you are a full RN and spent 6 years in the various departments but what allowed you to start travel nursing? 2. Did you apply or get headhunted? 3. Have you been away the whole year or do you get to go back home occasionally? 4. Do you ever fly with patients home or is it just driving? 5. Is it done solo or do you have a partner to assist you with the patient or client? 6. Would you possibly explain some of the duties you attend to with your patients?7. How did you find out about it in the first place? Thanks for allowing me to ask these questions. I am a Unit Clerk and I have been able to speak to one travel nurse for a brief amount of time. Your job sounds very amazing and rewarding. Edit: After reading your other comments. I realize you have already answered some of these questions but I will leave my comment as is. 
he probably didn't want a bunch of idiotic fanboys spamming his ask.fm, asking if the rumors were true.  I would probably do the same exact thing in his position
This would be handy if I wanted to try these masks and didn't have any AB hauls planned. Spend the $$ up front for a single package, see if I like it, then buy in bulk from somewhere with a better price.I could also see the instant gratification aspect being useful to some people; until about a week ago, I'd have been one of them. But I had a moderately-sized sheet mask haul come in, and there's more on the way, so I don't think I am in any danger of running out and needing them Right Now.
Lives are more important than property.  Businesses are generally insured and can rebuild, but you can't bring back a life.  Even if police only tried to target looters engaged in egregious activities, avoiding escalation and death/injury to innocent bystanders and peaceful protesters would be difficult in an urban setting.
I have a white exclamation mark inside a red box next to "MSE &amp; WebM VP9" in that link.  No idea what that does/what it's for.

So they do the broadcast for each day of the draft right? And doesn't the draft take four days because they have so many rounds? Seems a bit extravagant doesn't it?
Antetokounmpo apologist here: Doesn't it come with the territory? You gotta expect that somebody might retaliate like this. Especially if he's 20 years old and you're up by 30. Not saying that it was smart or a cool thing to do, but you can't instigate and not expect people to get pissed.
Yes, it was made in the spirit of the Irene Adler Ringtone from BBCs Sherlock. So, just for text messages and the like. I guess I could have added a few seconds at the end, to make it loop more nicely.
If we don't see all 3 eldrazi titans on Zendikar, perhaps the one(s) that aren't on the plane, could go there, due to the mana, and they could finish the eldrazi off once and for all their.
So, to have a chance to witness those endearing messages you say, you can wait and see for a few more time in this subject (shhh xD) I've already done my part :P
I'll have to get back to you after I read those but I think I'm considering the justice system to be part of the same system as the police, which maybe needs to be examined further.
You know,  there's something to this. I made this exact observation years ago.  My 1st week of my 1st semester (out of three, but that's another story) at BYU, I was actually amazed at how beautiful the BYU girls were and that their skin was absolutely flawless.My 3rd week of my 1st semester (yup, that new car smell was wearing off) at BYU, I finally realized that the BYU girls were putting their make-up on with a fucking trowel.I should have quit school and dove head-first into the Mary Kay pyramid scheme, with a little Avon on the side...

I am fairly inexperienced with turning as well. I invested in a wolverine system and I am pretty happy with how sharp my tools are. I am less happy with how terrible I am. It is still fun and I will keep at it.
When our SS screws up, our fans cheer him his next time up (there were boos, but there were more cheers).When the Mets SS crews up, they boo him out of the building.
I am aware of and agree with all the phenomena you mention.  I'm arguing that, for any hallucinogen or anesthetic that isn't a prodrug, if you use slow infusions (or other methods) to achieve equivalent concentrations blood concentrations in nonhumans and humans, then you'll get almost equivalent brain concentrations, almost equivalent binding, and almost equivalent effects.  Do you disagree that this is the case for ketamine, LSD, DOM, etc?   
To use the same anime, I think better examples of my perspective are [Fate/Zero](/s "Tokiomi \(fuck that guy\) and Kariya \(so sad...\).")  Both received about the same level of development.  Even though it was obvious (even without reading / watching *F/SN* first) that both had to die, the latter was presented to the audience in a more sympathetic light, therefore his death had more meaning.
Based on what is in their store, as well as reading the live letters, the all-in-one package is different from the others.  If you look at the store, even the digital download of the all-in-one package doesn't list Early Access as one of the preorder perks, whereas the other ones do.  And like I said, I distinctly remember it being mentioned in a live letter.  The official forums translation only kind of implies it, it isn't stated outright, but I remember the big kerfuffle when it was said.

A twelve part HBO series would've been interesting, but HBO doesn't like to go into expensive, effects-laden shows like that unless they could get multiple seasons out of it.  With Forever Peace being a non-sequel, I'm not sure if that's possible.
Looking back now it kinda looks like a spoiler but Heenan always thought Hogan was a cunt and no one really believed him about anything he said about Hogan
I have loved ALL of Grant Kirkhope's music. Goldeneye, Donkey Kong 64, and Banjo all had memorable soundtracks. I'm so glad he is a part of Yooka-Laylee. 
Dude this is hilarious. I know it sucks now, but you have a story to tell for years. Scan all these stupid bureaucratic documents and police work they make you comply with, screen shot the emails, and post them on TIFU for the world to laugh with you when you change schools.Seriously, for rollerblades. My sides.
Wizards tried doing the nostalgia trip twice already, first with Time Spiral, then with Coldsnap.  Neither one sold very well, so I think they'd be very hesitant to try tapping that well again.  Also, like I said before, Dominaria is a huge place.  If you want to tell any kind of focused story, you'll need to pick just one location and deal with what's going on there, and that's going to leave some old fans dissatisfied because why didn't they go to *my* favorite sub-continent?Wait, I think I've got it: Dominaria is to Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar, Innistrad, and Mirrodin, as Urza is to Elspeth, Jace, Nissa, Sorin, and Koth.  The former are gigantic, with extensive histories that, as a new player, feel almost impenetrable.  The later are smaller, but more relatable and have stories that are much easier to digest for six months before we move on to something else.

Not too much protein. Lots and lots of water. Then more water. And carbs.  You need carbs to charge your muscles, protein is best in the first hour after you finish. Dry clothes!Expect the course to be in worse shape the second day after 10,000 mudders tear it up the first day. 
Tamers kind of goes into the consequences of the awareness of shape-shifting creatures from another dimension. There's no way that there wouldn't be governments trying to get their hands on digimon for experiments or used as living weapons of mass destruction.Really, your best-case scenario would be to get someone like Gatomon as a partner, who would probably pass for a regular cat (albeit with unnatural markings, though you could just say it's hair dye). On the plus side, her evolution is an extremely human-looking creature, so you could pass her off as your hot cosplayer friend.
ya nothing like learning some physical chemistry, i ofcourse further researched and i see how that holds true. though if the mod had some sort of capacitor/inductor system at the base it would allow for the metal in the coil not to matter since it would put out a constant it would delay the recalibration of the mod... but that would ofcourse make things clunky.
Yes! I have wanted Mariota for a long time. This team, like all other teams in the NFL, can only be successful if we have a good quarterback. I don't know if Mariota is a franchise guy, but he might be. I am excited about this new era.

Hoarding is a real mental disease.  Getting the city involved to force them to clean up would be a start but they are in need of counseling as well.  Calling in the city would definitely be helping them for their own health and safety whether they like it or not. 
So even if its by accident that the company hinted towards this, it's still rape culture? Does not thinking how something connect to rape 24/7 make you a rape sympathizer? I'm not picking up what your putting down here. Also, I'm not at all saying that the ad doesn't show rape culture IF its on purpose, but I highly doubt it is and all twitter's outrage proved to me is that people are not accepting of these kinds of ads and no company in their right minds would put this out because they would be ostracizing a significant amount of consumers (and that means less cash money).I could also be way off the mark with what you are trying to say as your comment is fairly hard to understand. I would really like it if you could tell me what you mean like I'm 5 or, if I understood what you meant, would care to elaborate.

if you abort a mission you will still get xp without bonus xp. I kinda like the prisma gorgon look and firing sound, but there's nothing amazing about his stats. It's viable, but if you don't want to keep weapons just because they are cool / rare, I would advise selling it.
&gt; LIKE LITERALLY DONT SAY THINGS YOU DONT HAVE ANY EVIDENCE FOR.&gt; EVEN IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE (I DONT THINK IT IS). IF IT WAS TRUE IT WOULD PROBABLY BE JOE ROGAN JOKING BECAUSE HE IS A FUCKING COMEDIAN. GET IT?!??!?! HE MAKES PEOPLE LAUGH, SO IT WAS A JOKE SO YOU CANT TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY.LOL It was a joke was it like when he told that woman to fly to Peru to take ayahuasca despite never taking or going to Peru himself.
There are studies that say I have to accept people no matter how fucked up they are? No, I don't think such a study exists.You can go off and fantasize about little ponies and becoming a sexual tomato all you want, I just won't approve of it.The fact that you think 'family values' are bullshit probably confirms you're a teenager with divorced parents.. and your ignorance of world affairs, and attitude towards people reflects your subsequent lack of respect due to said lack of values.
I do some of my own repairs but sometimes the time it takes and life gets in the way, the $80 is so freaking worth it to have to back better than new :)
Alot of pessimism already. I'm excited. last year the titans made a pick in the first round i didn't like but they proved me wrong. im hoping they can repeat again.
The reason I mention the Zelda song is because the Irish-esque style fits really well on dulcimer. I can play it in a basic form, and even that sounds really cool.
I always have to mention that this happened at Utah State University while I was attending. I didn't see the accident but have a few friends who did. Motorcycle hit a car, guy went under the car, car lit on fire. Weird series of events.[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHS3GL7Ynz8)
Hey, whose current  platform calls for legalization and decriminalization? Who has their idiot health minister babbling about the children when asked about the proven medicinal properties?So yeah, 100 years ago, today, let's talk about today.
I took it as he isn't gay "now" but that he always was. So John asking if he's gay now is wrong because he didn't turn gay. He pretty much says this flat out in the convo. He was insecure about it and trying to bury it.
Well they can't go back and call it after it happened. The Giannis play was blatant and everyone saw it. There wasn't even a foul called for MCW so they obviously didn't see it and didn't have a chance to review.
Origins sucked BALLS...                 What is worst is games you can not pause at any time.               You are in the middle of a huge story dump or cutscene and you want to pause... Every button you press skips forward or cancels outof conversations...          EVERY GAME NEEDS A PAUSE FUNCTION!
When it comes to officers we are a mile wide and an inch deep in knowledge. They navy will teach you everything you need to learn, but having a STEM background sure as hell helps. As far as height goes my classmate as 6'10'' subnuke another was 5'1'' so if you want it go get it.If you want looking to be an officer your first job is to lead sailors, your second job is whatever your designation is. Think about that before going for officer.If you like International relations, check out a [Foreign Affairs Officer!](http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/officer/communitymanagers/restricted/Pages/foreignareaofficer.aspx) though it would be later on down the road.You will miss your family but the people you work with make a new family and even when they leave to go on a DEP. When you see them X years later it was like nothing was missed :)
I went to go get fitted for a pack last year and was actually in a similar situation at REI. The salesperson kept giving me giant packs (at least to me) to try on, and my dad sort of had the bigger is better mindset as well. I ended up leaving the store with nothing and coming back a few days later with more knowledge of what I actually wanted. I ended up with a Deuter ACT-lite 40+10 which has been working pretty well for me so far. It's insane how tricky gear shopping can be sometimes, especially with parents who aren't as interested in it.
EUIV has a pretty steep learning curve. I got into Paradox games through Crusader Kings II, and I think that's probably an easier introduction to Paradox.
Mr. Unicorn had to pick me up from work and drop me off in the morning. Did the same last week. I nearly didn't go last week, good thing since I won an Ovechkin signed stick.

I use Gold Bond's friction defense (on my nipples, inner leg, feet and heels, and on any other parts that seem like they may get rubbed).  Use liberally, more if raining!
I never hated the guy. He's ok. His matches on the last few PPVs have been entertaining, and that's really all I ask for. He doesn't have to put on a wrestling clinic; just be entertaining and put on a good performance which he's done. He's improving on the mic, definitely getting more comfortable. But there is one thing that really bugs me about him: cocking the fist is corny as hell. I don't mind him raising his fist then punching the ground. I fell like that's enough to signal to the crowd what's coming. The fist cock is just stupid. The fact that I have to talk about a fist cocking at all kind of pisses me off.
they dont have a fosher to beat anymore after last torney, gaem is boring now cuz they win every scrim, similar story with fosher cuz no one would scrim them cuz tembest hid strats for big torney and nemesis dedded and lg dedded too
Honestly it's up to the clerk and/management. I give the basic discounts out at my store, senior citizens, military,  and student, as well as having a special with wine on a certain day of the week. I'll give random discounts out depending on my mood, like if a hot lady walks in and I'm chatting it up with her, or if I'm in a bad mood and someone makes me smile. Hell, I gave a discount to some people just because they were born in the same year I was, lol. High dollar bottles I'll haggle with you somewhat,  but I'm still going to get money on it,  other products the price is as is, no ifs,  ands, or buts, or I'll just kick you out or raise the price if you keep pushing the issue. Remember, these people are small business owners,  and every dollar and penny counts to us/them, so if you want that $ 18 750ml bottle of vodka but only have 10, either down grade or don't bother buying it,  because if you can't afford what you want, then budget better, or plain and simply you don't need it.
Yeah, it isn't a choice, and sometimes it'd be nice if it was - I have a few male friends that it would be so *easy* to be in a relationship if we were attracted to one another - but we aren't. It's as simple as that. Doesn't make instances of unrequited love hurt any less, but that's just how it is.

Nice approach.I'd also consider training time multipliers for logged in players, like the vitality system used for Lineage 2 where players starts with 3x XP modifier (or something like that) and that amount decreases along his session, reaching a point where he must log off or be inactive in a neutral area for several hours before reaching max boost again.It wouldn't prevent people from learning offline at 1x, but would benefit those who actually 'play' the game.

Just for the record, he can still be traded, like Kip said, its just unlikely.It makes more sense to take him and then trade him after discussing instead of rushing it in in the allotted 10 minutes.

It does for me. The second time I dropped gave me the most memorable dreams. I dreamed very vividly, and there were lots of things swirling in my dreams.

You just gave me this theory. 5 years from now every time Winston and Wilson play they will say "he used to play baseball guys!" Instead of the basketball bs we hear 7 times during every chargers game. 
The same thing happened to the one on my 125 over the winter. It should be fine if you tied it around the bike in strong winds, but that's just extra hassle every time you want to ride.I'll probably be buying the Stormex next time.
Well, I did a session once when I was 15 and once when I was 18 with two different therapists, but once I was there I was too anxious to admit to anything and never went back.I had a consultation at a different place the other day, and a counselor talked to me. They asked if I had a plan, and it doesn't seem like you can have suicidal ideations without there being some method.My selfharm isn't necessarily life threatening (bruises mostly), and it's not with the intention of suicide when I do that. I'm just afraid to talk about it with someone who doesn't selfharm because they may not understand that.
That's actually kind of cool. I wish more providers would do this.They get to protect themselves from people dicking around with phones, and no one necessarily needs to find out a workaround for that model.
You make a good point, however the hunt doesn't end because some hunter is killed by Gehrman. The hunt ends because the source of the scourge is wiped out. That is what we end up accomplishing by killing Mergo's Wet Nurse and stopping the Mensis ritual from beckoning the red moon. Obviously none of this has been accomplished before because the Mensis ritual and Merog's Wet nurse are still around by the time we show up. This leads me to believe that the first hunt has never ended. Djura and Eileen must have failed to accomplish this goal, or for some reason been released from the dream prematurely.Of course this is all speculation and not absolute fact
What's the source for that metric? Because it's neither borne out by the exchanges in this thread, nor is this thread a relevant sample relative to the Big Bang threads you're disturbed by (gee yes, happy people - very disturbing), much less the 34k subscribers to the subreddit.Your response marks you as trying to prove a point, which makes phrasing it in the form of a question disingenuous. You're not in pursuit of understanding, your beef is to comment.So you're that person now. You walked into a assembly of happy people and are trying to convince them they're stupid for being happy. That's you. What's more disturbing *really*, spazzing out about a well-shot music video or the fact that you went for that energy expense?

I've never been involved in any for of rape and girls have called the cops twice to report me. In both instances they were proven to be completely  full of shit and nothing happened to them. You saying it doesn't matter is exactly what's wrong 
Because it seems feminists are not pleased in general until women are the majority in an area.  For example college enrollment.  Most feminists don't think there being 60% enrollment of women in college is an issue at all, many actually think its a good thing and should remain such and some won't mind it go higher.

I don't know how many times I have to fucking say it: inequality isn't inherently bad! Can you wrap your head around that? In equality is much higher in the US than it is in Australia... but, on average, who does better? Their median wage or ours? Their cost of living or ours? Guess who wins. 1 guess. "Oh, but they have a higher minimum wage and lower inequality." Yeah, and the average person is doing much better here than there. If you want to aspire to be Ecuador, I'm not confident I can have an intelligent conversation with you. Yay for them.... we are much better off than them precisely because we haven't been implementing their policies.
I'd love to see what he managed to put in his Roth 401k accounts... In theory if you had some sort of hypothetical shell account that had post tax money in it, and then you had the same sort of multiplicative effect 200-300x earnings as his regular 401k, you'd be in the tax free billionaires club at retirement, all probably perfectly "legal", though not ethical. It would make off shore accounting look like chump change.

This would seriously be the greatest plot twist they could come up with. The entire time we think Waltz is the leader and Batista is a henchman, Waltz carries a white cat starting about half way through the movie, once he's an established villain. Eventually, Bond kills Waltz and we think "what the fuck?! That's it?" then the cat trots over to Batista, standing with a dozen henchmen.
Meh, everyone survived before when the total rate was nearly 20% (prior to 1997) and when it was 15% after HST was introduced, up until the GST reduction in 2008.Sales taxes are good taxes - and the negative impacts can be offset by giving lower-income people (such as the seniors everyone seems worried about) grants to off-set their tax burden.Since the province brought in nearly $1 billion from its portion of the HST last year, the increase from 8% to 10% should net it another $225-$230 million or so (after roughly accounting for a possible decrease in spending). Not a bad chunk of change.

More frequent injections will give you more stable blood levels, lower spikes and should keep E2 from spiking as much as with weekly injections. AI dosages are individual dependent. Bloods are the best way to dial them in. If you are planning to take a preventive dosage you can search to find most common protocols. 
I think he's worth about 4 mil. This kid got 28 goals on his sophomore slump, you can't argue with that. Nyquist may not be the next Zetterberg, but he's a great player. Trading him would be stupid, unless we get another young stud.

Minny. They're another team that I feel has some great fans who's heart and soul is in the game - seeing the cup won by them would be amazing.Also, they really deserve it. They've been building for a long while, and they're finally at the point where they have a really good chance. They've worked hard to get where they are.
I'm so fucking relieved. It would have been neat to see Mariota but with the trade rumors circulating there was no way we make a trade that favors us in the long run unless Mariota is the 2nd coming of Jesus. 
theyre dressed similarly to popular videogame characters, except they have a disgusting lack of self respect.need to me explain anything else for you captain aspergers?
Keep in mind nearly all open micers are at the bottom of the barrel in terms of income/opportunity and bottom of the barrel in terms of looks. Many open micers feel the only way to escape their/our/my lives at the bottom of the heap is through standup. But, we're not all going to make it. In fact, almost none of us are. Thus, douchery.An old bitter comic explained it to me like this:  no one you know is gonna make it, and even if they do make it, they're not gonna want to help you, and even if they do want to help you, they're probably not going to be able to before you quit comedy or become/stay so terrible you're beyond all help.He's probably not wrong, sadly.

Just adding this in - there's also the South Island Distance Education School (SIDES) for online courses. I took some online in grade 12 (including physics) to be able to balance school with volunteering initiatives that were going on, and had no problem getting those high school credits for uni. Not sure about that 19 or under policy, but they have a pretty clear website if you want to check. 
I probably won't unless he shows me unequivocally that he wants to fix his issues by going to therapy and genuinely retracting his statements about wanting me to quit my program. Either way the wedding is not happening in June.
we sourced our house through a local real estate agent who was extremely helpful (our Thai friends made sure there was no gouging)we backed onto a market with another about a kilometre away. Food was super cheap. owned two bikes bought at a bike market out past Mae Rim.  the more comfortable and lavish you wish your lifestyle the money you will spend.  simple as that.
What I think he has in mind is a grand coalition.Of course, I can imagine the scene on May 8..."Let me say to you David, I would like to serve as deputy PM""Get the fuck out of my office, Ed, you snivelling little bitch."
That's not true. Mine downshifts for me if I neglect it.  If I've got it in 5 and slow down to a light it will put it back in first.  The Auto will not let you damage it. Sure you can run around at 6500rpm all day in 1st, but if you go past that it will up shift for you to protect the car.  
There were quite a few mentally challenged kids in my school. One named Angel, was of the loud shouty sort. And one of the shop teachers had his impression of her perfected, Like, he clearly practiced it. It was fucked up

That pattern of 2nd picks being considerably worse than the first pick (except for Couch of course) is kinda scary if you're the Titans.Edit: And yes I know Archie was kinda good.
One of my coworkers made a sport out of sneaking into the MWV building for the cafeteria and river view.   The story was/is ridiculous but he's got it mastered like a damn bank heist.  
I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not honestly sure how you're connecting this to my point. What does the question of whether or not the industry is giving women what they want have to do with how the Bechdel test illustrates a clear imbalance in media that cannot be attributed to the Bechdel test's emphasis on dialog? 
It still shocks me that it's not seen as weird to say this. To be talking about a living creature's intelligence and how sweet and cute it is and then talking about eating it. It's just so strange. Like if somebody was talking about an infant and you said that it would either be looked at as satire or you'd just look fucking nuts.. And most likely it's the latter. 
I feel deeply uncomfortable expressing any kind of spiritual certainty. It's difficult to explain my feelings, but they are very strong, and they are reinforced by the disgust I feel with myself for having ever believed any of Mormonism's claims. I call myself "spiritually unaffiliated" and leave it at that.
These guys all bitch about it, but its not like YOU are the only one who has to play that tough-ass setup.  It doesn't really matter what the par is on a particular hole if 9 out of 10 golfers are bogeying it.
Think about it a different way. Most people are far too busy worrying, "What if this person sees me and thinks I'm a dumbshit?" exactly like you that everyone completely ignores everyone else around them. 
The improved performance in that in java you are writing a native application. There is no native js applicaiton. It's basically a website using html/css and javascript running in a webview control.
I agree with this in theory, but Ive seen too many whipsaws amd giant candle swings in juatbseconds that wipe out every technical stop there is, just because bif money knows the market and knows that rhere are stops in key places
And like that's fine. I don't exactly agree with the "Let's suffocate the rioters" stance but I certainly think anyone who thought this thing with the pizza shop owner was a good idea were out of their mind.My objection was only to giving "most" of the rioters a unified reason for rioting. I admit that this might not be the best time to make such objections as that's minor compared to the terrible situation in baltimore. Perhaps I should have thought it out more before responding
Most of my engagements in pistols rounds go something like, person jumps around a corner then starts spamming A D A D A D and crouches occasionally, making it impossible for me to hit. Generally happens when they have a glock, but it is no more difficult with a USP or P2000. Running accuracy is a joke. I understand to a certain extent the glocks being more accurate while moving than the CT pistols, but in their current state, pistols (default and others) are incredibly luck based and unbalanced.TLDR: Make standing still and tapping with pistols more rewarding. Decrease movement accuracy of all pistols. Only pistol that can 1-hit head armor should be deagle.

I know Michael Giacchino by name because of this show. He is truly amazing and I think his composing is what made this show so emotional. I wish he would do another Lost concert soon

I completely agree. I can't stand to see people and their self-entitled rants, which to me, sound like they go a little something like this:"You mean they updated the game and now i have to pay attention and play it, like I used to? THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!!! I won't stand for it. Someone get me my bottle and safety blanket while I throw my temper tantrum!"I mean, seriously, you vote a game 1 star because 1 thing changed? How is this such a big deal in your life, that you set out to ruin a company? You have to play a game that you originally liked before you had this thing? Big deal. Get over yourselves and live with it. Don't like the change? Ok, no big deal. Give some feedback and let them know. But to try to ruin a company who has been bending over backwards to better their FREE game? Shame on you.Downvote me if you want, but everything I said is true.
Nothing you cant already do with good management of TP scrolls/BoT + your TP skill. Boots&gt;Midas&gt;mael&gt;Blink&gt;Mjol&gt;BoT if you wanna splitpush like hell. This way, you can rat and not let your teamfight capabilities suffer mid-game.He has a 20 second TP so I really dont think 5 second reduction is gonna matter, even more so because we're talking 6k worth of an item here. It's gonna be nice to have at some point, sure, but only if you get cheaper and more effective items first.
I look at it this way:If you're shooting at a wanted criminal and a civilian jumps in the way and gets hit, that's accidental.If you're aiming at a civilian and forget that your holding a gun in stead of a camera, that's *not* accidental.It's also worth noting that you can't assume someone is wanted under any circumstances. Even if the system authority are shooting at them, you cannot assume they are wanted. They may simply have a hostile reputation with the local faction so that they get attacked even though they aren't wanted.Wait until you can confirm their wanted status before firing.This change will force people to have a little more weapon discipline, but that's fine since people absolutely should have that weapon discipline anyway.
Github is a project management platform built around git. First, try to start using git. It's a version control system. You make some changes, describe those changes, share those changes. Until you get comfortable with that you're not going to get much out of github. If you've got code other people will want to use, its not a bad place to put it.Most employers are not going to look through your github with a monocle. They might take a glance, but very few will deny you a chance based on that alone.My githib activity is huge, but unfortunely 99% of it is private repos for companies I've worked at, and that data isn't shared even on github with anyone else.
You mean the Trimmed Comp req? I blame Castle Wars for that one... seeing how Chris L asked for suggestions on the HLF and Castle Wars suggested the arbitrary 5k req since he was the only person in-game who had that done already.
Economics is what you need. Either that or Finance/Accounting. Everyone who starts a business lives or dies because of how they handle their money.  Having said that, even if you don't end up starting anything or even if you fail, you have a legit degree to fall back on.

Erm, that woman is crazy and is "addicted to being outraged", but let's not join two disparate groups.I don't have any allergies, but damn straight I want to know *exactly* what's in my food. It's *my* body and I reserve the right to know what I'm putting in it. I also don't trust food companies in the slightest. Neither should you.You realize you're making the same argument that people made to block *any* nutritional information labeling, right?
Their example was a bad one of the Oxford comma ruining a sentence, as it wasn't any worse writing than any other way of ordering the statement. 2 of the 3 examples in OP's pic are also bad examples of not using the comma. The functional rule when making a list like that would be to use any plurals at the end of the sentence."Among those interviewed were Kris Kristofferson, Robert Duvall and Merle Haggard's two ex-wives.""This book is dedicated to God, Ayn Rand and my parents."Personally i think the 'lazy' way to write is to use the Oxford comma primarily, because you don't have to worry about what order your list is in and can just write as the ideas come along. Not using it and still having functional grammar requires more thought or editing.That said, I use the Oxford more often than not. In data sets, you really should always separate out individual items via comma.

&gt;Austria/ÖsterreichWait, WHAT? That looks crazy.On the other hand, calling it by its German name would help stupid people avoid confusing Austria with Australia.
People get irrationally aggressive when you bring it up too. Like you've assaulted them personally for suggesting the limits of the male body are lower than tv and movies would lead us to believe....meanwhile there is nationwide outrage over how hard it is for women to meet the expectations put on them, to not be obese.
I would have been wandering Home Depot for a long time if I hadn't asked my mom. HD also has Rainbird products, but they were significantly more expensive than the DIG brand. The starter kits are definitely convenient, but I would buy piece by piece if I were to outfit my entire garden with the system, of course. So much more customization options!
As a modder of other games, I'm glad I never got into the Skyrim scene.There is no way I would deal with this amount of bullshit from ~~the userbase~~ a large portion of the users.
I was wondering if Medivh counts as a villain since he has had an influence on a lot of huge events pre-WoW, but since his villainous actions were due to Sargeras I guess that counts under Sargeras.

Honestly, vegan food has no calories. I'm cutting and I sometimes struggle to reach my 2000 calories a day.Smoothies are my only source of dark leafy greens, though. I can't stand eating them so drinking them is the only option.You don't have to enjoy smoothies to gulp them down. Most of the time I just do spinach + berries + some flax seeds, but thats all low calorie stuff.Oats, peanut butter/nuts, bananas and lots of plant milk might work and can easily get you 800+ calories. Maybe even add some protein powder.
Don't bother trying to argue or reason with anyone here. They're all too busy having a circle jerk and masturbating each other with tears that they don't really give a shit what anyone says, they just want to be SJWs.
i  made a few 300 dollar deposits before finally running hot in the pre black friday days at the 3/6 table then the 10/20. Ran 300 up to 5400 and cashed out never to play online again... i was playing with my entire roll the whole time... and had AK vs AK in a 5400 dollar pot where my flush came.... LOL Then i started playing live a lot... lost 6 buyins at 2 5 nlhe before becoming a break even live player.... then discovered MTTs ... finally hit a few final tables and got my MTT strategy down... now i play cash recreationally but try to fit in as many live MTTs as I can when the majors come to town.

Mustard is probably ground.That said, without the ratios or process, good luck. Who knows what they're doing to their ingredients to bring out the flavor profiles they achieve. Cooking is as much science as art - give 20 experienced sauce makers this list of ingredients and you'll get 20 totally different sauces. 
Why in the world would you jump to that conclusion? Fidgeting is not being mentally unstable.  Those are different though not mutually exclusive, and you yourself said you aren't a professional.  I don't think we need to assume his friend is mentally unstable in any way that would require help from professionals based on the info that was provided.  
Yeah sure thing. Here is a [guide I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/31vuuw/the_ultimate_way_to_fix_jailbreak_issues_ft/) about using iCleaner Pro to disable tweaks. Follow the guide carefully and read it since it has some important information. I hope the guide is helpful. It has screenshots also :)
Both aren't really super offensive picks in the lane phase. Leona is incredibly passive until she can get a lead off a misposition, gank, roam while Thresh is basically Janna with pick potential + stronger punish in lane. Thresh is a far better trading champ and has a lot more room to play aggro in lane though, and in general is the end all of the support role rn.If you like aggro supports you probably want to pick up something like Sona Lulu Nami who basically aim to fight the entire lane phase and win off superior trading + without hard committing to a fight.

Glennon won't start. You don't sit the number 1 pick. And you don't take the pro ready QB over the project QB unless you plan on starting them right away. 
The scientific method is rolling in its grave.Also, the word "prove" is in the first sentence, which is a pretty good indication right off the bat that the author of this article doesn't have a fucking clue.And then...sixty percent?  That's their best evidence?  Maybe it's just because Mormons have a reputation for being dorky and people associate that with pasty skin.  I wonder how many of the photos they looked at were of black people.
It's not strange in the context of professional sports. If the NFL allowed a team to, say, draft and trade players in between winning the AFC conference and the super bowl, and a perceived slot upgrade opened up, they would. 
well, it might sound very queer. but it's kinda just sad if what it comes down to was that opie thought he had found a best friend when he met ant and it just kind of dissolved over the years until he's just someone you know.but this happens all the time. a friendship starts strong and dissolves. i don't know how he couldn't get his head around that and not let it get to him.it's easy enough to work through that when you have two people on the same page and don't let anything get personal. but when one person is very clingy and needs validation all the time, it's a fucking disaster that is waiting to blow up.
Asian parents tend to see their kids as a retirement plan which I think is pretty messed up. The whole collectivist culture/filial piety doesn't help either.Not to mention, the cycle of abuse and violence in each generation.
Florida's public records laws are almost freakily transparent.  Florida's public records laws also require extraordinarily easy access to public records, the process is very frictionless for a reporter.  Even am email from a school teacher can be requested, and it will be provided upon request.  No reasoning, just request it.  A government employee's email is always sent with a disclaimer that reads like this: **[Florida has a very broad Public Records Law. Virtually all written communications to or from School District Personnel are public records available to the public and media upon request. E-mail sent or received on the School District system will be considered public and will only be withheld from disclosure if deemed confidential pursuant to State Law.]**Another reason we see so many stories about Florida, is Florida is now the 3rd most populous state in the nation.  More people, more shitty behavior. 
I would totally crossplay, but my problem isn't lack of bravery, it's lack of a convention to attend. One day I might make a long trip with the purpose of attending a convention.
This is the top six. You get eliminated because you messed up. You have no filler queens to lay back on. Hell, Latrice was *reamed* for having a visible bra strap.
&gt; ala PokemonFrom what we've been hearing from the developers it seems more like a Oracle of Ages/Seasons type of deal. Two games that come out at the same time with different stories and emphasize different aspects of Zelda gameplay (Ages focuses on Puzzles; Seasons on Combat/ Hoshido on Awakening conveniences; Nohr on more varied map objectives, limited/no grinding, etc.). 
What's your relationship with your grandmother like?50 years ago multi-generational living was the norm, and still is in much of the world outside the US.  I think its one of the reasons having kids didn't seem like such a burden to our parents and grandparents.  Embrace it maybe?
At this point I'm just wondering where her talents lie. She can't act, dance, sing, isn't particularly funny, her runway walks are always the same and the last lipsync (in which she did exactly the same movements as in her first one) was a bit too boring for my taste. Her look is flawless and her fashion sense is current and cool as hell but does that grant her stay? I just can't help but wonder if we are not majorly missing out not having another queen there in Pearls place that would show us a little more. Idk don't hate me it's just how I feel about her at this point but who knows maybe she turns it out the next few challenges.
Ok.  So what if Tenn wants Bradford, but they are not sure that the player(s) they are targeting will be there when the Eagles pick.  So they select Mariota, who they are ok with, but wait to see if the Eagles will blow them away with an offer later - if one of the players they want is available when the Eagles are slated to pick.Off the mark?

In general, there is "ger" and "ger toshav". "ger toshav" I think means a gentile who lives by the noahide laws and resides in israel. Though this particular commandment might apply to both; someone else can clarify.
CNN is shitty too, but the mistakes they make are less obvious than Fox news. Like one I remember in particular, they were reporting a story leading up to the Beijing Olympics and it was about Chinese police beating protesters, yet the picture clearly showed that the officer was:1) Not Chinese as he was very dark skinned.2) Not wearing a Chinese police uniform (it had some other language on the badge)Turns out the police was Nepalese, but most Americans won't catch that if they just look at the news. Whereas Bill O'Reilly exclaiming that we don't know how the tide works is clearly bullshit to anyone with half a brain.So yes, CNN also misinforms, but it's usually less obvious than Fox. And I don't really think it has a liberal bias, if you want to see liberal bias look at MSNBC, and even they're not as bad as Fox. Mostly American TV news is shit, the only news source I really trust in the U.S in NPR.
You obviously have strong affection for ESO, but if you feel so wronged by the game/Zenimax, just. move. on. The amount of time you've spent in the game is clearly substantial and worth the money you've forked out.Or if you don't think that's the case, chalk it up as a lesson not to trust Zenimax in future. So much out there in the world to sink your teeth into, another game might meet your expectations.
Exactly.  Yet anyone who tries to present scientific evidence against the global warming alarmist agenda is labeled a "denier" in a clear attempt to delegitimatize them by invoking holocaust imagery.
Not sure, but it's definitely possible to measure! I don't have [the tools](http://smashboards.com/threads/physics-input-etc-display-in-develop-mode.391956/) to do so unfortunately, hopefully someone else could lend a hand.
Good points! I forgot to mention the horizontal force as one of the potential problems, but it did go through my mind. Luckily, living in coastal BC, I have a huge selection of very strong trees to hang from! But I can see where this could present some issues.I really don't mind adjusting the hammock each time I set up... It only takes a minute or so and I have been able to be quite comfortable at a few different hang angles in my GT hammock. This concept of a structural ridgeline is more for simplicity than for hang angle. I've seen a few setups that have a tarp ridgeline, hammock suspension with ridgeline, and a bugnet ridgeline and I thought this could be a way to make setup simpler!
FYI, stucco by itself is not waterproof.  The only thing that keeps it waterproof is the exterior paint, and the sheathing and waterproof paper under the stucco.
I use them to define the risk of my sold options in the form of spreads.If volatility is low, buying ITM credit spreads are a viable option.  Tastytrade says to put the price in the middle and collect 1/2 the width of the strikes.  Probability of success is about 50% 
Honestly believe that Tennessee drafted the guy who will prove to be the best QB in the draft. Yes, I'm biased (Ducks fan) but there are no question marks over the important intangibles Mariota brings. Perhaps most importantly I believe that the Titans are a good, almost perfect, organisation for him to mature from a collegiate stud into a Pro Bowl caliber QB. Other than that I agree with most of what Gruden said about him - a quick study, smart kid, etc.Congrats Titans.
Stick to German beer people.  They have beer purity laws which stop company's putting in ingredients that don't belong in beer like GMO Corn Syrup, GMO Corn, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Fish Bladder, Propylene Glycol, Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) Natural Flavors, GMO Sugars, Caramel Coloring, Insect-Based Dyes, CarrageenanBPA &amp; lots more!  Carlton &amp; united are not under this law.  So if your drinking beer everyday you may want to choose a beer from Germany that suits your taste.  That way you can be sure your only getting proper ingredients like water, barley, hops and yeast

It should be  Philippines, bad auto-correction. =/ anyway...In the last century, USA was pretty bloody with it's colonies, and yet it still holds one of the world's last colonies, occupations, US backed military and fascist rules, mass massacres, super-NATO organizations, CIA operations, policies over Latin American countries, US backed fundamentalists, etc.Also, crimes against the Native American population had committed in the modern times as well.I mean, you are the ones that armed and backed tons of bloody fascist death squats, contras, and orchestrated a coup d'etat and backed the military rule, just for banana profits for God's sake - banana profits. Is this your definition of "pretty good"? Really?
Motorcycle helmet manufacturers are usually really good about designing helmets so they don't block your peripheral vision. At least with the few helmets I've owned.
I haven't either, so I'm not sure if you can add the new customer promo on top of the other one. Give it a shot!Also, didn't mention this before: the PSU has a 7 year warranty, which makes for some great peace of mind :)
How many rape victims do you know? It creates agony for the rest of their lives. I'm not necessarily agreeing with a death penalty for rapists, but I think punishment should be on par with murder.
That is true. On the other hand, if the Clintons hire someone to oversee their homes while on the campaign trail, and the overseer hires illegal immigrants, it would bite them in the ass.If you appoint people to do things, and they fuck up, you're ultimately responsible because you appointed them. How many people does the POTUS appoint to run things? It's a valid criticism. Otherwise, there is no incentive to appoint the best people.
I love being fit, and i love that my husband is fit! It's a sexy mindset, to want to push your body, and to know you are in control of your own appearance and you can sculpt your body into whatever you like! He drives me so crazy, I hope I can do the same to him for the next 40+ years!

Just wondering, because I like the book a lot.(1) What's outdated about his approach to sexuality? Do you think other authors do better?(2) Ought military scifi focus more on battle?

You know honestly the world really cant afford your population and India at the same time, keep up the planet fucking and you make the choice much easier. And your govt is a bunch of corrupt commie thugs and Taiwan is a separate country, please go fuck yourself.
Don't bother, the person you're replying to is a troll with several banned accounts. They openly admit that their trolling and don't want to be taken seriously.
Not that people are consciously faking it but that it's the in thing now to be a little nerdy. As far as his accent goes, you do know that producers and directors commonly give directions to their actors on how to act and speak during scenes right? I have known and hosted Japanese exchange students before and their English doesn't sound anything like his, which sounds more like the shredder from the teenage mutant ninja turtles.
One of the main themes in Toradora is coming of age and being more mature than your parents. For taiga to grow up she had to leave and move past her upbringing. She loved Ryuji and wouldn't have been able to tell him face to face, and feared that he would stop her. She had to face her family issues alone. This whole segment is incredibly important to her character. It's hey moving past the problems the series had spent building up around her
When I transferred from scotiabankk I withdrew my money $400 at a time and physically walked it over to the TD ABM to deposit it so that I wouldn't have to pay $50 for a cheue book. I would go with TD e-series, forget what CCP reccommends. The TD mer is .5%, while at tangerine it' more like 1%Personally I'm using virtual brokers because it's even cheaper than TD and it allows me to better diversify, but I've heard some people have trouble with them
Pretty much that I assumeSince the poem is about a busted, buried statue of a cruel ruler in the desert, with an inscription that basically says 'check out everything awesome I'm done', but the only thing around him is desert, it corresponds pretty nicely
As I can see with the 12k and 10k attackers, this deck is somewhat aggressive. Therefore, it is nice to tech in Archangel, Doombrace for the grade 4 line-up. It also helps filling up the drop zone without any disadvantage, since you will be soul charging 3 cards at the end.
The statement that the war was fought over state rights is an old way of thinking about the war.  It wasn't.  If it was fought over state's rights then why did the South push so hard to violate Northern state's rights with the fugitive slave act?  The state's rights argument is an old, sympathetic, southern apologist style label that is given for southerners fighting the war.  They might have even believed that themselves, but really they were trying to protect their "Peculiar institution."I would highly recommend you look at Edward Ayers's the Valley of the Shadow that has a wealth of primary sources, from both the North and South.  It's a focus on two communities that are very similar and really not that far from each other in the Shenendoah valley.  Here's the link: http://valley.lib.virginia.edu/
It probably mess up the mouse's tracking. And in terms of immersion the mouse is only use by one hand, and only 'replicates' a portion of a gamepad. Also rumble makes you less accurate on a gamepad.
You are one person who can only reach a very very very very small portion of the human population. You can't say "most don't learn." Secondly, I could say "I've tried to physically help anorexics. Most don't learn. That is not an exaggeration or slander. Honestly, these people don't care that...Anorexics inflict the pain on themselves." Do you see how flawed that is?
If I was those two teams I would be VERY concerned looking at that.  One has worked out well...the other has not.  Which is it going to be?  Tampa's or the Titans?
If your child loves sushi and doesn't absolutely require princesses, I'd put my vote for California Grill! I'm pro-food quality over everything, and you could also have the great experience of watching Wishes from there.

I just drag and drop samples, and if the samples are similar, I'll group them in to summing tracks so I can do group effects. Just a workflow thing I guess, nothing incredibly beneficial about it.
1. Yeah, prejudice does play quite a role in what gets published. I've had my supervisor tell me that it's easier if it's sent in the professor's name rather than in the student's name.2. Quality over quantity. More papers doesn't mean better research. Different researchers have different standards on what constitutes novel, publishable work.
On larger stages King Diamond can almost outdo Alice Cooper. Word of advice, even if you don't normally wear ear protection, wear it for him, his falsetto literally hurts. 
Not even a little bit, they'll just stop printing those cans and move on. Maybe they take a hit and destroy the ones they haven't shipped out (they can just re-can it, no one would know).If they were real geniuses they'd have already stopped production long before their one and only set went out.
Someone already started it. It hasn't had any activity yet. I just submitted a post. I don't think it will catch on, but the Bernie Sanders circlejerk does need to be broken. And I actually like the guy. I think he's great on several key issues, but reddit is going crazier over him than we ever did over Ron Paul.
It doesn't feel like it but Onepunch Man has been going on for a while. But yeah Dorohedoro is so fucking awesome :D It ain't over yet, but apparently it's only got one more chapter :/ 
I had to look up the rise and fall times of standard leds for a high speed flash system we were building in the laboratory. In my field there are very few things one has the luxury of regarding as "instantaneous". Turns out LEDs are one of those things. Rise was around 4ns and fall very similar IIRC. That's about 1/100th of a clock cycle on the processor I was running it on. 
For me it was the fact that Steam was, relatively speaking, a considerable resource hog and my PC was a pile of shit. It was the straw that would break the camel's back for a lot of games that I could barely run to begin with. 
Nah I'm not upset. Just because I disagree doesn't mean I'm upset. What I hope I can do is talk with people with different beliefs than me, not only to help them see my view as something that isn't ridiculous, but to see their view as well. I wouldn't mind doing that with you actually. A chance to learn someone else's PoV, provided they're civil. 
As long as it isn't the Tumblr variety left I'm pretty agreeable to it. Inb4 someone says there isn't anyone who shares their views in government offices/positions of power, lol.Edited for clarity
Dude.  These are super cool!  I've known the technique but never thought to do it for headphones before.  Awesome idea, which I am now gonna try to emulate.
When you are doing dirty work, you just want to toss it while driving by. Its easier to hide one piece of metal in the car than it would be to take it apart and then put the pieces into a bag.
I'm pretty sure it's an aftermarket landau bar that doesn't use a bulb, but it would be nice to see a pic of a functional lamp to know for sure.Chrysler used this kind of crap in the '90s.
It could be repaired, but I'd like to see it half the price if you have to repair it.  If you don't weld or have a friend that's a welder, it's going to cost a bunch to have it repaired.
You can't heal wounds if you fail the check, but you can still heal strain with advantage and critical hits with triumph.For example:Jax, wound threshold 12, is unconscious having taken 13 wounds.  He also received a critical hit (broken arm) and has five strain damage from using abilities in the combat before he went down.The groups droid medic, 1G-0R, tries to fix him up, fails the check but rolls 2 advantage and a triumph.1G-0R, splints Jax's arm and shoots him up with a stimulant.  Jax briefly wakes up but passes out again from the pain.  He removes 2 points of strain and the critical hit.1G-0R curses in binary and injects him with a stim healing several wounds and Jax wakes up having reduced his wounds below his wound threshold.Narratively his arm is sill broken, but usable and he suffers no ill effects.Note:  Personally I don't like the auto-heal critical hit effect for ongoing effects like that.  Any non-incidental crits should take time to heal.
But that's what's so promising about this to me.  Just shoving more electricity through it seems to have produced thrust in the *hundreds of millinewtons* range, rather than the 50 micronewtons from 50 Watts. I guess I should have been more clear on *why* that was a really big deal.  750 millinewtons is huge!
DL, its pocket change compared to sirenic. If youre planning on losing a few times, use the cheaper stuff to save youre money till youre comfortable with the kills. 
Well, that's not very democratic to set criteria for candidates based on their background and education. ;)Going back to Ross Perot, his background was in Sales and Computing.  Go watch some of the videos of the 1992 debates and such, he had some pretty far out ideas but actually made a bit of sense. A lot of his campaign was based off of the fact that he wasn't a politician.  In one of the opening statements I believe he made the remark "Well they have a point, I don't have any experience in running up a four trillion dollar debt."https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-W4GWjN2kg(edit: For the record, Ross Perot is one of my personal heroes, so I could talk for hours about him lol)

Get a tall one!! Best bet for collapsable fence that would work best is probably something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/PetEdge-Steel-Exercise-18-Inch-X-Small/dp/B004WP8MPE/ref=sr_1_4?s=pet-supplies&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430439966&amp;sr=1-4)They can be taken as a line with the ends angled up against the walls of the patio. But if the dog is always going to be supervised out there, might not need a super tall one. Just prevent them from easily jumping it. I also live on the first floor with a patio to grass. So I bought 2 50ft leashes so my dogs could romp on the grass. I tie the leashes to the chairs we sit on, the bush next to the patio and sometimes my 20lb kettlebell. That is also an option if it is feasible for your location. It's also great because I can take them out there and throw the ball, play with them, without any fears of them running off since we don't have fences.
Panamonia is concordar, we stay for one temporada.Panama is of umido, with rivers many running through the waste rubble, spanning the country.

I did not witness this but heard the story many times. A few guys in my high school all spat into a test tube during science class and offered the dorky awkward kid $10 to drink it. He drank it. The substitute teacher came over and asked what was going on. Beans were spilled. "Don't pay that idiot" was all she said.

Titanfall has sold a shit ton there bud. The sales that are going on are too good to pass up. Not to mention the game kicks ass and has received some really good word of mouth as of late. 
Not necessarily. There are tons of kids who devour books at a very young age; I was one of them. I think it's still very likely that Greg taught him to read :P
Our current model has problems before the expansion point itself. This has some evidence for explanation.It needs more research yes, but we have something to go off of instead of just saying all the laws of physics break down at this point.When we have the Computers to solve these Quantum problems more evidence will surface, honestly it's possible that all these models are wrong. We just don't have the means of accurately saying what happened before the explosion.

Thanks, although I'm not too keen on waiting to start recording till I'm in-game, usually if I do record something I want it to be the entire experience, Load screen and all.  I will try bumping up the bit-rate, pretty sure I have some misconceptions about what it actually does so it may actually help.

I don't know about Canada, but in the US you can file a return without disclosing where you got the money. That's how they got Al Capone -- he didn't file his taxes.

Well, I expected the black finish and I got gray. Also The magazine was a little beat up. I have been meaning to take it out but never did. I like the heavy feel in my hands though. I think it would manage recoil reasonably well. I'll try to take a picture when I get home tonight if I have time.
I'm not that good. Really not that good, that's why I wrote the comment. Chikage and BoM just seem to be the easiest weapons to learn use effectively. If people get parried easily, they play predictably. (Edit) no matter what weapon.
I've posted this chunk of text below on reddit. Feel free to use it as you wish. Definitely point him to this sub and RCgroups etc." Resources to absorb are below. They will answer some of the questions you asked, and some of the questions you will ask yourself eventually* My newbie FAQ intro video. You might be beyond some of it though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRYkUIhujlc* Find RCModelReviews on youtube, and watch all four parts of his recent "Build a Mini Quad" series. This is a 250 sized "racer" setup.* Find FliteTest on youtube and watch the electrohub build video. This is a 450 sized setup similar to the phantom.* Find FliteTest's beginner plane series. It isn't multicopter specific, but still has a lot of good info.Your first point of decision is what do you want the quad to do? If you are more interested in photography, a larger 450+ sized quad is what you want to be researching. If you want fast racing FPV, you probably want to research a 250 sized quad."
Well, just as an examination of the text, the initial term "the heavens and the earth" is extremely broad and can be taken to mean "all physical matter and things described below". It appears to be a Catch all for all of creation. Then the later verses go into more detail about our little corner of the  and the things relevant to us. So, even though it doesn't explicitly say "God created water", it is a de facto reality covered by Genesis 1:1.     But we should avoid overanalyzing a 6000 year text that tells a legendary creation story. It is a theological text, not a historical or scientific one. Thus the theological message is that very first verse: "In the Beginning, God created the heavens and the earth."     Edit: and I totally didn't even look at who was submitting this. Why do you ask, namer?

Like the other person said, get there plenty early. We want to a sold out concert at the HOB on valentine's day this year and it took us forever to find a parking space in the parking garage. So just make sure you have plenty of time to circle around for parking. The plus side is Mandalay Bay is usually not too bad to get to traffic wise since it's the first casino, I find it pretty easy to get in and out of even on busy nights. Unlike having to deal with traffic getting to a casino further down the strip. 
Back when I was a little kid me and my entire neighbourhood used to play baseball. Some day this one kid accidently hit me in the face with a baseball bat. Blood EVERYWHERE. I nearly lost my eye but it's all good, it required some stitches and left a nice scar in my face.
Premier League does not compare to the NFL, it is more comparing it to the SEC in NCAA, where as the whole UEFA compares to the whole of the NCAA. It is a comparison made to please the american viewers of the program by purposely not looking at the full picture.

You guys get real fixated on the taxes. We actually get stuff for our taxes - its like social insurance : Decent public transport, holidays, maternity leave, social welfare, education, health, national radio, TV, films. Shows like Doctor Who, The Thick of It etc are made with public money. Also we don't get super stressed out about our taxes either because we pay it automatically at source - no yearly filling. We also don't have to pay taxes to our country if we aren't resident unlike US citizens. 
Well since its the first run its normal they don't accept me as their leader and that it takes at least the whole so that I can directly aid them with lead.From the GM point of view becoming the leader requires RP (wich Im totaly OK with), But in a way those command action wich include RP are part of becoming the team leader. 
It could most certainly be rebound anxiety, many people get the same thing after a night of heavy drinking.So while I'd agree it's a dosage issue, an adulterant is most likely not the case.  Even if it's not alprazolam it's almost certainly another benzodiazepine.Any GABA agonist in high doses has the potential to give rebound anxiety, and when you wake up in the morning with a feeling of panic you can't understand - it may just make you do irrational things like punch a hole in your door.  I'm not sure what your personal experience is like but there's plenty of documentation on exactly this feeling OP has described.  
The way we speak is correlative to the way we thinkI'm not really talking about mixed language, more of when the more polite "saya" being replace with the more crass "aku". "mane leh" is quite rude compared to "mana boleh seperti itu"
It forces out all the money you'd normally spend on detection vs. a Shadowblade/standard invis hero at 2/3 the cost, plus a relatively spammable defensive/escape/utility cooldown.It needs a mana cost and/or cooldown tweak as a limiter.

I had my bicycle stolen in uni once and I was pretty upset as it was the last thing my grandfather gave me before he died. A few weeks later I saw it at the train station near uni. It still had one of the locks I used on it. They just abandoned it unlocked as it had a flat tyre. So I just took it home and fixed it up again.That's the only time I ever got a stolen bicycle back.

I know mine would especially in this case as I'd guess it is a metal catalyzed reaction where typically the ligands don't matter as much for the general reaction mechanism. I don't know this reaction though, so these ligands may have some effect on the stereochemistry of the reaction or on the mechanism directly. So it's probably very case dependent on whether or not a prof will tell you what  the reagent is. Although in OP's case, it looks like the student immediately gave up as soon as they saw it.
If you define socialism only in the traditional Marxist sense, then he isn't a socialist. But conservatives are going to call him that anyway, so he might as well run with it. 
I've ran D&amp;D groups for years now, and honestly address it like you would any other player who isn't a good fit for the group. Leave the transgender stuff out of it, and just explain that she wasn't a good fit and its nothing personal.I've had to do this plenty of times and some people understand and some flip out. There isn't much you can do to mitigate that except by being brief or non-accusatory.
In the actual Lovecraftian mythos, Cthulhu is pretty far down the totem pole. He's an ex-slave who learned a little of his master's magic, got a big head, and tried to lead a revolution against the Elder Gods. This got him and the other Great Old Ones banished to other dimensions or sealed away in the earth. He's still way more powerful than a normal human, but more because of his psychic abilities and magical knowledge than his physical power. He was still asleep when the boat hit him, so most of his powers and defenses were offline.He got popular online because he actually has a describable physical form, where most of the Lovecraft creatures don't, he also had three stories about him, where the others got one each. A lot of the more crazy shit people say about him would be more accurately attributed to the Elder Gods.

Not really. They lack tone in their muscles, have small breasts, almost linear hips and often slightly overweight bodies. While I do appreciate them as beautiful works of art that does not make them beautiful people. The key here is to remember their origins as meaning to appeal to the aristocracy and in those days the physical distinctions between the rich and the poor were highly apparent. These painting aren't meant to indicate what the artists or people of those times would find attractive, more what the aristocracy of those times looked like.

A teacher at my school really disliked this kid in our class, he was a dick head. But that day he'd just had a haircut, she asked to stop talking and then when he didn't she said, "Being stupid isn't a lifestyle choice, it may be a haircut choice but it's not a lifestyle choice." Also nearly every teacher that day made a joke about his haircut. It was pretty bad. 
Obligatory plunger comment.Besides that, make sure to stock up on good cleaning supplies now, instead of buying them later. Get a swiffer sweeper, lemon pledge etc. etc. it'll save you a trip when you realize your apartment looks like crap.
And he's useless with that many ships on the board.  The only way I've found to get his ability to trigger with that many ships is to either have him or the swarm constantly sacrificing position.  Of course, there are plenty of better pilots out there than me, and N'Dru is a fantastic value when he works, so YMMV.
I'm not talking about the former, that's... just a cutscene.The latter is what I meant, it's the tech demo. They made a third one for PS2 with VIII as well.

I just wish the situation wasn't so binary. It's not that I don't like chromas, it's that I don't like the price and the method of acquisition. But not buying the chromas will not tell you any of that, it will just tell you that I don't want the chromas.

I think this thread is about locker rooms with the assumption that people (particularly students) will be changing in the common locker room area not in stalls.
As nice is that is, I'm more of a realist and from what I saw last year was exactly what all the NFL scouts predicted. I have very little confidence in him.
Edmonton takes this in a heartbeat, Montreal never offers it. Price and patches have great contracts. They're all young. And those 3 guys will get you in to the playoffs given whatever middling talent you surround them with. Edmonton would contend next year. Montreal might take years to recover.
Being captain is about knowing your team and getting the most out of the guys around you.  Not everyone needs a shouter or a guy that gets in their face.  A good captain knows when to rile and when to keep the guys calm and he has the respect of the team to be able to do both.  The abilities and techniques can be learned through experience.  Gaining the respect of the other guys on the pitch is much harder.
Listen to your coach. No one here can tell what it needs.I'd say you could drain it (syringe) if you feel a squishy pocket or "pillow" of fluid. See a dr for professional advice. CE happens, if you want to avoid it wear ear protection.Good luck  
Sometimes its really fun to be the only sober one. You get to watch people cripple their motor functions, while you stand over them, unihibited. You rise to nearly godlike ability, with super reflexes, decisionmaking prowess, and unparalled speech. In comparison anyway.
Don't think it's cool to wish injury on someone. If anything it'll make the division more exciting and competitive. Which is bad for us, but good for football, y'know?

He's extremely smart and understands that the "physical" side of the game is stupid and proves nothing, which I believe is the point Kenny was making. 
There's shops in Orion and CW that sell Mooshroom eggs for not that bad of a priceSource: I once went on a glorious quest in search of the great mooshroom
As he should, but not because of Mariota; Mariota could completely suck out of the gate; I honestly expect him to be less than average. But because we traded away Foles, a proven winner.
I suggest making accounts on rabb.it It'll let online rooms of people watch the same thing and talk about it in chat while it plays. Great way to interact with everyone. 
Well, I have no real basis for comparison as these were the first morels I've ever picked or eaten, but I thought they were fantastic. In fact, one of my favorites. There *was* a bit of grit on the one that came from a very ashy section of the burn, but it washed off pretty well with a quick swish in a bowl of water. I have heard that 'natural' morels are tastier than the burn morels, but couldn't say from experience.
It's hard to believe this is true by just this picture when there's already another tank of lava at the same level that the controller is. Why do you think the controller is actually using the tank under it?
I believe someone had a similar question in Washington. And I believe the answer was that they can't force you to waive your breaks and there is an anti-retaliation provision in Washington law that makes it illegal to fire an employee for reporting a forced waiver. See [this site](http://www.lni.wa.gov/WorkplaceRights/Wages/HoursBreaks/Breaks/) and contact L&amp;I if, after reviewing the information on that site, you conclude you want to report a possible violation.
Gender dysphoria does exist. These people are born with sex characteristics that do not match who they are. Genital reconstruction (gender reassignment is a misnomer) is a treatment. Facial surgery and breast augmentation/reduction are treatments. Hormones are treatments. These people are not to be shamed or disgraced for who they are. They are to be embraced and respected for who they are.

I'm not sure he necessarily *directly* killed himself over her.  I think he ended up withering away when Voyager got home because he had nothing to distract him from Seven's death.
"This book is dedicated to Ayn Rand, my parents and God."The omission of the comma is popular because of AP Style, which is like the standard for journalists. It's a style choice mostly. Either way, it's the responsibility of the writer to remove ambiguity when writing and, as others demonstrated, it's possible for lazy writers to make the oxford comma ambiguous.
While that is true, I find that most System Hacks used are by people that just mainly want the assist points to lead them into their larger streak. So they usually just have assist points and that is it, or assist points with extra time so they gain more points. With it being rare that they use the disable exo suit module, I find it more useful to use a different perk in place of hardwired, most of the time. 
A complete rehaul of melee is literally throwing away a PvP system that so many players love to use. Some of the stuff in here is cool (ex. magic bar), but redesigning the most basic PvP mechanic would be like removing a cooldown timer on LOL
Holy shit DC killed it this week minus that turd of a book Convergence. Justice League and Batman were fucking incredible. I have to go with Multiversity though. I'm not going to pretend that I completely understand it but I will never forget this series. The $6 price felt justifiable, shit was long.
I wrote a chapter on the general topic in my book, which recently went out of print, so [here it is](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4bulqcqu8hqbo11/MVIP_Chapter_4_-_Inventory_and_Reporting_FINAL.doc?dl=0). :)Mostly posting for nostalgia, both PowerCLI and PowerShell have changed a lot in 6 years!
I am in my kitchen, running in place to get my last few steps in for my daily goal and I literally have tears in my eyes.  Shit! This is it! I am so damn tired of feeling like food controls me.  I am down almost 20lbs in 45 days and I am thankful for that but still, there are days when I don't say no the extra bite of ice cream or the extra beer or or or, and even though I am always under maintenance calories each day I still feel powerless against the food sometimes.  I am 45 days better today but damn I look forward to owning my shit instead of letting it own me.

Have you ever seen an elderly homeless woman pissing her wheelchair while simultaneously chugging 40 ounces of malt liquor at a bus stop?Because it is kind of like that. And by "kind of", I mean "exactly".
Not sure yet. Unfortunately, I probably won't be able to have the listening party until tomorrow after work. I'm definitely listening to the whole album without interruption to take it all in as a whole.The video release for Insomnia was excellent. I have high hopes and expectations, for sure. 
Ward's turn is the best character move I have seen in this show.  I absolutely hated Ward.  Since the turn he has become one of my favorite characters.    I stand corrected on that actor.
The Buffalo's got better sights, whereas I think the Elephant Gun is a flattop, so it's harder to aim. Plus, the Elephant Gun is a rare drop from an exceptionally annoying miniboss.
I can see matchmaking ruining raids for a lot of people.  If you go on LFG, you definitely want to do a raid.  If it's as easy as selecting it directly, you will get a large influx of short attention span players who will ruin it for the rest of us.  I agree with you that options are good, but this option would lead to a large number of complaints that the raids are too hard.  This already happened when VoG came out.  I sure as hell don't want Bungie catering to the casual gamer at the expense of hard end-game content.  I haven't even had to resort to LFG or any other third party websites.  I made all my friends in-game.  Play a bunch of ROC strikes with someone?  Friend Invite.  Need a PvP buddy?  Crucible Friend Invites.  Someone waves to me at the tower?  Friend Invite.  It's really not that hard.  I'm shocked at the lack of effort leading to all these complaints.
Call a local law firm that doesn't do divorces, maybe an officer in the local bar association who isn't a divorce lawyer. Ask the receptionist if she has a minute because you need a good recommendation. Describe in 60 seconds that you fear what your soon-to-be-ex will do, you know he'll lie, and you need a tough, well-respected atty who won't overcharge you. Maybe she can check with her arty and call you back with a name.  Lawyers know lawyers. Some are great, some haven't that respect yet. Find out before someone is learning on your case. Also, if you interview the best ones in the town, he can't hire them.

Everyone needs to reproduce. That is the purpose of life. That's why you eat. Why you have a job. Why you go to school. Why you live.Those who don't or can't don't fulfill the expectations of their ancestors, the direct lineage that had ran continuous for eons suddenly comes to an end and the geenpool becomes devoid of potentially unique alleles and the combinations there of. Not ensuring genetic continuity is like being a traitor to human species.
Not a touchy subject, but most people were saying no and getting crap about it. I figured it would be best to give a full explanation. Use of the word fuck or any other swear word is everyday life use. 
So what was your remedy for the situation?  When I meditate, I feel like I'm contracting even further.  Yet people say meditation is helpful for stress/anxiety.  What do you think?

Saying Ireland is not associated with the UK at all is like saying blah blah blah you get the picture.    Edit: Really? Ireland has NEVER been a part of the UK? Ok. Keep enjoying that 1st grade education.
Depends on the issue. Labor organizing is strong here. The majority of service industry workers here are Filipino and Chinese immigrants. Our hotel union here is very active and organized, and not just around labor issues but around issues like the environment, immigration, affordable housing, etc. But other issues like increased AA representation? Yeah, it's just not that much of an issue here. I was part of the Asian American Journalists Association on the mainland and thought I'd get involved with the Hawaii chapter when I moved here. I thought the chapter here would be huge because there are so many AA reporters here. Turns out it's a small and relatively inactive chapter. AAJA's key issues are newsroom diversity and fair representation of AAPI's in the media. My guess is that here in Hawaii, where AAs are well represented in the newsroom and fairly represented in the media, AAJA's key issues don't resonate as much. 
Holy crap lol! Thanks for reading, and for the info. I can't promise I'll beat everything, but I sure as hell won't go back to my old ways of unfinished games. :D

I don't really know if it counts as erotica, but the Fever series by Karen Marie Moning is SO. FREAKING. GOOD. And the sex scenes are SO. FREAKING. HOT. I'm not really into erotica as a general rule, and I wasn't expecting to like the series since typically urban fantasy isn't really my thing either, but they're just so addictive and by the time the sexy bits really got going I was full-on invested. And I just realized now you wrote this comment like 3 weeks ago, but hey, it's already typed up, so there you have it!

Off topic, but I see you have pulled them out of the ground, but you see, it's more benefical for 'them' if you just cut at least 3-4cm above the ground with scissors. 
I'm not taking a side here but&gt;Be real. You can't rely on aim to get out of a rank.lol. aim alone can get you to global bro. there's plenty nowadays that don't know how to play, just shoot well. Hell, I don't even know any set smokes or standard pop flashes (to be fair tho pop flashes are intuition). 
Good point. It's not like the politician was making a statement/civil disobedience for a point. On the other hand, it was a different jurisdiction that I am not familliar with the laws. At the time in Canada, prostitution was not illegal, just things associated with it were. Also, there is no reason to be morally outraged for breaking a law that is stupid; elsewise, politicians would be disqualified by parties for jaywalking or speeding, or whatever. 
Maybe the Titans can get the Eagles or Browns to panic-spew for Mariota later. I wasn't really keen on him, but with Winston gone, it was either him or Leonard Williams.
I actually found Christine's whole adulterous edit and subsequent boos to be a horrifyingly misogynistic joke on the producer's part. Let's not forget that Derrick was also quite flirtatious with Victoria on the live feeds as part of his strategy, even though producers decided for some reason not to push *that* storyline any further.
Jenner claimed to be a woman in spirit and soul and mind.  No where did they claim they were a genetic female.  Not hating on ya, but why imply he thinks transition makes him a biological woman? More importantly, if you aren't their significant other, why the hell do you even care??
I actually think Fleksy is overall much faster when you take making corrections and having to fight autocorrect on other keyboards into account. Most of the time even when I hit the wrong keys it knows what word I'm typing, but more importantly it's really easy to change or add words to user dictionary.
Congrats on 22 days!  Keep up your great work.  My wife has made comments about how nice it is to come home and me have coherent conversations rather than slurring or babbling about something.  I'm so thankful to be able to offer a clear mind to her each day.  
I didn't get the impression that cultures were being compared (edit: in yarn's original comment). It sounded like theories of ethics were being compared.

You know it might be tax evasion is punished worse than their lowest degree murder, like murder that is accidental or the accused showed extreme remorse. Tax evasion is always premeditated and intentional. 
Nice.  First time ordering so went with a sampler to lockdown a favorite and picked up a 30ml of the crunch berry on a recommendation.  Looks like you love is that tiramisu? Almost ordered some ill have to grab a 10 ml next time to try
How much time/training do you put into strength and stability? I cut days from rolling to spend on yoga, weight training, and conditioning, and have found myself somewhat less banged up and broken.
Yeah, we sure do love a good shitshow.ETA: Someone actually asked if we are bringing in Islamic State fighters. I just can't. How did this LTC maintain himself? Someone better be up late tonight writing that man a COA for that.
They're also entirely different champions. They're balanced around different strengths and weaknesses. Just because TF got a nerf over something *kind of* similar doesn't mean Annie should have the exact same thing done to her. You might as well be asking why Garen ult doesn't do true damage, because Darius's does and they both spin. For starters, TF card has a pretty low cooldown and most importantly can be activated on the spot. It doesn't require a certain amount of other casts to happen, isn't charged.If you actually think her stun should deteriorate after a few seconds then you must have never played Annie. This would ruin the champion. Annie bot might even stop playing her if they did that.
yes that is also if it is improperly stored, aka leaving it out at room temperature, exposing it to air for long, THEN putting it back in the cooker. which i do not do
"If you want to get better get better."Please, please please! Tell me how! That's what I am asking, I want to know how I can have fun but get better. Fighting nastys is the only thing I can do (to my knowledge) that I can train to get better. I want to play this game and get better but I can't find that I can based on what is provided for me. Also, I'm sorry that I came off that I was telling the guy to fuck off, I was trying to simply say. "Thanks for the suggestion but do you have other, (in my opinion) more interesting examples of a fun to play character." I mean their is what 51 characters? Mario can't be the only easy one to try out.
Thanks for the time tip, I forget how many I had right but it was 80%, I knew all 140 characters and what they looked like but lacked the names.If you want to improve it I would try to get more name options in there too as you have already done so with most. For example I was confused why 'Susan' didn't work when I thought it should've since I didn't have 'Strong' at the end. I couldn't remember 'Bartram' for some reason but I did remember 'Bar Bar' which Finn also uses.All in all I can easily see this have close to 1,000 questions with so much in the show already (not to mention questions outside the show such as which VAs voice which character).Great work and keep it up.
I kind of wish they would go full-scale in their attempts. America could just say they're vacationing citizens that aren't based in America, so we can't do anything ^^while ^^giving ^^them ^^ships ^^and ^^shit

As long as I know, there's no such thing as a genre only for anime. They usually take ordinary jrock songs to openings/endings, you could look up for some jrock ballad songs, like this for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGb_aizCIEg
As regards to when you move out, that will depend a lot from how long it takes you to get the benefits you want. Your social worker will likely dictate that I am afraid, If you get a choice, the sooner the better!I understand and agree with your points, I am simply asking you to think as if you are in your sisters shoes. I also feel you have made up your mind as to your sisters fate if you tell, when your fears could be completely unfounded, you are not a professional, and are not qualified to make a decision in the case of abuse. Your social worker and others involved deal with these situations countless times and will have experience that none of us here would have. Just bear that in mind mate. If you are happy with the way you go I think that's fine. I just want to try and help you see that just because there's abuse doesn't mean your sister would be instantly removed from your parents. Especially if she says she is still happy.
I figure you can't outlaw oppinions, even if the majority of a country could be persuaded that this or that oppinion should be treated differently.That's how we got our Reichskanzler in the first place. East germany could tell you about another sort of extremism that hated nazis. Didn't work all that well either and when you supress things, they will blow up in your face.Let the Nazis be Nazis and wait until they break a law. Then force them to read some books in the prison library.
Sweet! I had been looking at his site, but shipping to Canada was expensive as always. While I don't need one right now, I look forward to seeing your work in the future (maybe on my desk!)

I know you've already received a ton of comments but I just wanted to give you my .02 worth. First of all you look fantastic and congratulations on your transformation and beating depression with something you now have a passion for! One life skill I have acquired recently is not giving a shit what people say/think when they are not in a position to judge you or even put you down. I'm sure if you looked at every profile of these people they would all be sad human beings jealous of your hard work. At the same time, I know it still eats away at you. Keep doing you, and even though you are a stranger I am proud of you!
Hey man I love it.  I had a similar idea but never had the motivation to actually make it.  Pedal and store some potential energy in a big flywheel and build a tractor around it.  You can till and maybe even make a snow plow and cutting attachments.  But I always thought you'd never be able to get the power to actually make anything useful.  Great job!

Incorrect usage of the upvote/downvote buttons. If you've read a post, you're supposed to upvote it. If you haven't read a post, you're supposed to downvote it. If you like the post, you're supposed to gild it.
I couldn't even watch that all the way through. How can they call themselves media when they are so damn biased? The only bright spot is the relative low number of views.
One thing I've noticed is that the difference between taking .5mg and taking .75mg is huge. One relaxes me, one knocks me out. My doctor gives me a prescription for 1mg because I travel a lot, when in reality I take .25 to .5mg.It's true that Xanax has a high chance for abuse. Withdrawal is also fucking terrible, and I assume your doctor is trying to protect you. he has probably prescribed you the SSRI in an attempt to reduce anxiety in the long run. Try coupling this with therapy as well so you're not so dependent on Xanax. Also avoid caffeine, etc. 
&gt; So this is all Reddit is going to be now, Obama stuff?&gt; He has literally no chance. None. Why are we wasting time pretending he can win anything on a national level?Annnd the cycle continues.
i'm sorry but i'm really losing faith in this F.O atm. They could have gotten an insane amount of players(that we need) and picks from eagles. Mettenberger have potential and i think he will be a stud QB in 2 years.
Is that really something worth complaining about? If you don't like it there is zero reason for you to keep watching. He puts it after the content so there is nothing forcing you to watch it.
1: Thanks for having this giveaway, it is very cool of you2: I should win this because fire emblem path of radiance is the first fire emblem game i have ever played and Ike is my favorite smash character. Unlike other fire emblem characters who are all from royalty, i relate a lot more to a commoner like Ike. Wii fit trainer would just be nice as i have never seen a wii fit trainer amiibo in person.
LOL you live in a fucking sanitized, sheltered, lily white bubble if you think only 1% of ANY population is racist. In fact I think whites are the only race where a minority of us are racist. Non whites don't get criticized the same way for being racist. White people are the only ones who catch flak for saying they'd never consider an interracial relationship.
Right. This is straw man bullshit. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
My freshman year my geography teacher asked me if I was born in the U.S. Because I got 48 out of 50 in the states test and everyone else did very poorly. I'm Hispanic decent born in the U.S. and she was white. I guess if I was born in Mexico or anywhere south of the border it would've been embarrassing for the other kids? I don't know why she even asked.
I don't have an adapter yet, either. And I've only had my telescope (Orion 4" Mak) for a little over a month. I didn't realize how tricky it would be to hold my phone's camera lens in the right spot.Edit: phone's* camera
....... 20 years is really not a huge difference? I'm only 32 and feel like I have absolutely nothing in common with the generation of people on HBOs girls.
I just bought an 1989 dodge which I'm pretty happy with. The engine was rebuilt 9 years ago, the transmission is good. The downside for sure is the suspension that will need some TLC but I'm okay with that for now. I only paid $2,000 with 35,000 miles. The body is excellent. It passed calif. smog. I'm loving my van. I shopped for newer vans and found that the style I wanted were out of my price range (I only wanted to pay cash) and were not as attractive to me. I want to love what I'm living in and the older styles appeal to me. It's carpeted, the windows are tinted and it has slide windows that help with air circulation. I wouldn't pass up the older vans. Lots of people buy these for road travel and hardly use them but hang on to them so usually only one or two owners. 
&gt; Co-op was something they wanted to do for SoD but they decided to save it for Class 4.Actually they were planning on doing it, but it would have required them basically rebuilding the game, so they cancelled it. 
Not gonna lie but the kpop fandom can be quite dramatic, us noonas included!  For us it's just for comedy, but I find the younger Kpop fans to be a bit more serious about their overreactions and they get very easily angered by people who don't agree with them or make jokes about their favorite group or bias.  Kids, don't take things too overboard, just enjoy the music and freak out when you actually see the band in person ;)
Probably.  Just like there's probably a good reason they were on "the list" in the first place, but this was from their strength &amp; conditioning coach - not their official coaching staff.  Tommy Moffitt is good at what he does, but I'm sure the HC had a real long talk with him after he flew his shit list in front of NFL scouts.In the two years since he pulled that shit, he's never talked about it and never tried it again.  I think that says all you need to know about how official "the list" was.
I don't think he implied what you're paraphrasing. He said something to the effect that he didn't expect he would win, but that he would hope that he could still fight, or "play chess". Something like that. To even "fight" against Carlsen, one would have to be among the very best players in the world.
Lol what? This isn't a survival trip. This isn't even big enough to be considered a land nav course. This is like a "two kids playing in the woods and coming home because it got dark" course.
I like how everyone decided that chanting "please retire" at a heel Big Show is the most offensive thing in the world. Especially, when the prevailing opinion on this subreddit is that people are sick of him, and Kane, being in main events and that Show is past his prime.
Look him straight in the eye and say "This is the truth. You can choose not to believe me but I refuse to discuss this any further. I am not a liar and I don't like being called one." Say it every time. Word for word.If this has just started in the past year, I would be concerned that he is lying or cheating and is projecting on you.

It's different because "hack-a-Shaq" in basketball gives the advantage to the team committing the rule infraction.  That's why I don't like "hack-a-Shaq" but I have no problem whatsoever with shifts in baseball.  That being said, guys in the NBA need to work on their free throws just like guys in MLB need to work on hitting to the opposite field.  It's embarrassing for players in both leagues.
I was talking more about nationality/country instead of race, but whatever.I still find it a weird leap of logic how smash picked up an odd slang definition.

The Android Pebble app doesn't hear about incoming events from BBOS, so it doesn't send notifications to the watch.In the past, people have used the side-loaded Android app just to browse the Pebble App Store and upgrade the Pebble firmware, while leaving the actual message notifications to 3rd-party apps like [Talk2Watch](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/39743920/) or [pBBl](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/36059891/).  But you'd have to remember to stop one before launching the other because they conflict.Now [Talk2Watch Pro](https://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/47592888/) can do everything, so there's really no point in side-loading the Android app.
Was what Cuban said not correct? They are a predictable team. They run, run and shoot the three. Also they wouldn't be that good without James Harden. Is he supposed to say "oh, that team over there is stacked and great. I hate playing our rivals because they're so good"? Don't be so sensitive to what an owner says. You don't see Mavs fans get up in arms about every little thing that Morey says. I'm not justifying the firing. I just understand the reasoning behind it. And if you don't, then it's pretty clear you've never been involved with a professional business of any kind.
For people who can't see the video (on phone etc), he is using:* Firebolt Grenade (to hit around corners, play hide and seek, or hunt a wounded enemy)* Balanced Glide* Radiant Skin (because PvP damage reduction is awesome)* Flame Shield (more damage reduction)* Viking Funeral (doubles DoT of Ignite abilities)* Touch of Flame (to cause Ignite with grenades, and so see where your opponents are with the DoT caused by grenading around corners)* Apotheosis Veil (for a one-use "regain all health" buff).
LoL's meta rotates *a lot*. When I was a LoL player I loved playing Aatrox, then he got picked in the world championship and got nerfed into the ground. He was really weak and if I picked him I just put my self into a big disadvantage. LoL nerfs and buffs are really big, they easily destroy a hero in one patch.LoL's meta rotates so often that you can't get all the meta picks with free points, if you want to play all the OP champs you have to pay or play extremely much.
On the rational side, the Feds don't bring a case unless they're very confident of the outcome. They wouldn't appear to be consistent or reliable if they were losing cases left and right. 
I'm not saying don't date at all, I'm saying having friendships should trump dating in terms of priorities.Dating is a temporary form of socialization in, I'd say, at least 50% of cases, filled with many rejections. The vast majority of relations end after 1 date. Maybe OP wants something more than that, and I can't imagine it's easy when you're eager and desperate to communicate, especially if you are male. I've seen guys get depressed over no replies, no messages, no dates because it happens. I don't want OP to see this as a magical solution to their lack of knowing people.
Since everyone is giving you the "water is a chemical" shit, I'll add something constructive to your comment.It actually has a lot to do with how they are labeled between "Non fat," "Fat Free," and "Light."How they are labeled determines what is changed in them in terms of sugars, artificial sweeteners, substitutes.
A note and a title are NOT directly connected.You can have one name on a note both names or a title, which means he still legally has part ownership of the car.Don't remove his name from a note, as he will still have his name on a title, and hence claim ownership of the car.  If the title says your name AND his name, there is no way to remove his name from the title without his consent. 
Seriously though. I don't know how did it but your characters reached out to me very deeply and whilst I'm not happy about it, the experience was incredible
Well if you're smart you keep a diverse portfolio so that if any one industry takes a dive you are protected. Also, I can personally vouch for the merits of the stock system. I'm in highschool like /u/DenseCookie and over the course of two years of mixed investments I've grown $5,000 in college savings into around $20,000 not to mention some sizable bitcoin stashes I have lying around. To be clear the stock market is VERY DANGEROUS and only suited for a VERY SELECT INDIVIDUALS but if you are smart and know what to do you can make a lot of money. You'll also lose a bunch of money if you're stupid. I may have quadrupled my money in the past two years, but I should be currently sitting on 30k instead of 20... I really fucked some things up about halfway through... But I've learned since then and I'm prepared for more :D
Wow.I came here for support. Instead, your response is "your fiance flat out lied for months about something, but you're over-reacting." How is that helpful or supportive? Also, good job at placing all of someone's self-worth on their body image. I have plenty of worth that has nothing to do with my physical appearance, but I don't really have confidence problems in those areas.

We need reach helmet variants into this.Are devs working on a exporter/converter to enble custom assets? that would get a whole community of halo fasn and 3d modellers involved into the projects.
Even before it the councils, it was not considered to be applicable to Christians.  Now it's almost universally accepted as just the laws for the people of Moses, PRE-Christ.  The only time Jesus ever referred to it, he quoted Deuteronomy 6:5:   Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.There are two important parts to religion:  the content and the practice.  In both cases, you'll see Christianity has evolved and Islam has not.  
Yeah but this is painful. It's not about losing, it's about how we're losing. To be so utterly embarrassed and shamed on national television is excruciating. I had to turn the game off and switch to the draft, can't bear to watch this team self destruct and crumble in real-time. I need a shot.. or twenty..
I would be stunned if Kansas ends up in the SEC. We're not a good fit culturally at all. First of all, we're a basketball school. Secondly, a huge part of the history of Lawrence and Kansas is that we were aggressively anti-slavery and pro-Union. Our mascot is derived from a term for anti-slavery guerrillas and we're [damn proud of our free state history.](http://archives.kansan.com/media/1969/12/120225_BKCvsMissouriFans_cneal28.jpg) How well do you think we'd mesh in a conference that until recently had student sections chanting "the South will rise again" and a school with Colonel Reb as an official mascot? I can't speak for the entire fanbase, but I'd literally rather be in any other P5 conference than the SEC.

Tell your parents. First step in a righting a wrong is admitting you fucked up, and if they are paying your tuition you owe them that much. Next is talk to an advisor and see what your options are. Can you re-enroll in the classes failed so you can redo them to get second year standing? It will also be important to clarify if you are on academic probation or not. If you are, you're gunna have to enroll elsewhere. And in general take ownership of your education. You put yourself in this situation, all you can do now is change your behavior going forward. Study, go to class, procrastinate less and go to your goddam exams! 
He's a gobshite, deliberately over the top, brings people on just to talk over them, and then acts like a dickhead. It's misery porn for people who like to give politicians a bashing; it's no wonder so many of them refuse to go on his show.

[I my self am an american](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQwKVspiMA). There's... a UN provision if I recall that says nobody can own any area in space, however. That said, if that provision (or treaty, whatever) is overturned, I guess we know who went there first (well, based on the lander. The flag is actually bleached to a blank white by the sun).**EDIT:** Edit to assert my love for the stars and stripes and the people it represents (but not the /current/ government body running it)
[Here's the relevant thread and comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Xcom/comments/2u1k5y/lw_plasma_stellerator_or_more_aim/co4exqr). There's two caveats to that post and my spreadsheets, though:1. The linked-to post was written during Beta 14.2. My Beta 15 spreadsheet hasn't been updated to reflect the nu-Battle Rifles that lose 10 aim after any non-turn-ending action.Anyways - I haven't put math to anything here, but my expectation is that Rapid Fire will still yield more expected damage from less reliable shots, and that the Nu-Battle Rifle will be... complex.

Now I really want to know what features that Ephone has. Does it have a built in wand, only possible to make so short by manufacturing it in a fractal curve that cancels out it's own distortions? Is there an app that summons small purchases by displaying a diagram on the screen? Does it sync with a retrieval charm on your bag of holding to display a searchable inventory and pop whatever you click on into your hand? Is it enchanted to shield itself if dropped? Is there a mode where it levitates in front of you face, hands free?
Ah, her. You're right. I think I'll get gloomy about it now instead of waiting. It's stuff like this that will keep me playing the GBA titles instead of shelling out for the new ones.
so, how are you getting enough heat with just map gas... i have the same setup and i cant seem to make more than 1/2oz liquid, and even then it wants to solidify before i can think of pouring... do you have a few firebricks to make a makeshift furnace?
As a small business owner, this is totally true.  Yelp sucks. If a customer opens up a new yelp account and reviews your business with 5 stars it gets buried.   However if that same customer instead gives you a bad review, it sticks. Also yelp aggressively calls you trying to get you to sign up for they paid version, which is way overpriced compared to other Pay per click options. 
American CEOs are overcompensated in general, but for what it's worth Yahoo's stock price has tripled since she started there 3 years ago.Fun fact:  She fired her COO, who pulled in a total of $109 in his 15 months there.  She could probably make more money there than she already does.

I felt more suspense at Breaking Bad, but I like the setting of Game of Thrones more. I think it's unfair to compare these two unless they were of the same genre. They're both enjoyable.
No one is hurting per se, but people generally don't want to feel like they are deliberately handicapping themselves by choosing a different class. Beyond that, if the Cypher is too epic, then the difficulty-settings scale differntly for different char builds.
From what I hear Executives want Williams and the Coaches want Cooper.  I'm so nervous!!!! I hope the Executives get their man!  Williams all the way!!!
Not OP, but yeah it's fun alone. but you gotta have somewhere to chat with people, like the tripsit IRC. First time I did MDMA it was alone. I also like doing cocaine alone. 
If an attorney can help you plead to a charge that doesn't combine the words "battery" and "officer", it will do you a world of good. Yes, lawyers are expensive, but you should borrow money if you have to. Just imagine what "Misdemeanor Battery on a Peace Officer" will look like on an employer's background check next time you apply for a job: *"This guy attacked a cop?!"* This has serious life-altering potential. Even if your lawyer is ultimately unsuccessful, at least you'll know you did everything you could. You don't want to be kicking yourself in the unemployment line a year from now thinking, "Why didn't I get a lawyer?!" 
Agreed on the learn networking, design and management first. Disagree on the over hyping of scripting. Scripting is so underutilized at the moment. We should be using it to do firewall reviews, review configs against templates, generate documentation on the fly (so we don't have documentation we always have to update), generate new configs, find a switchport only given an IP address in a network of 100's of switches... There's so many uses. 
This long-winded pontification of what GDQ "is", doesn't at all invalidate the views of those of us who don't like the way the events are run, which is what I assume it's supposed to do.And if GDQ isn't for speedrun fans, who the fuck is it for you then, bunghole?
The reason he ended up paying child support is because the state went after him and he didn't show up to the court date, so the state got a default judgment. There wasn't a chance for the judge to decide that this is fucked up. Even then, the judge still probably wouldn't have ruled in favor of the mother since "it is about the child's right" and no one cares about a father getting raped.
It sounds like the police were using the possible exigent circumstances of evidence being destroyed to enter the house. In the pdf you linked, it says the officers followed a suspected drug dealer to the house, and claimed to smell marijuana. This sounds as though they are claiming that following a suspected drug dealer to a house, and claiming to smell marijuana is probable cause for a search, and then used the sounds coming from the house to manufacture exigent circumstances. It doesn't in my opinion, but that doesn't count for shit. I believe that if police officers pulled this shit, and didn't find any drugs, they would have opened themselves up to a civil suit.Even with the information you provided (thanks for the reading material) it doesn't change the fact that demanding the police obtain a warrant before they are allowed inside my house is a perfectly acceptable response to them banging on the door.
I'll stick with my preferred order.  It helps that 1: OWB gives a lot of useful perks, and it makes sense to be able to use them rather than throw away content without their availability, and 2: OWB is content with a _manifestly_ lower level requirement than Dead Money, especially on hardcore.
Razer isn't selling a headset. The devkit headset they're selling is for people to toy around with their OSVR thing. So far, they say they have no plans to make/sell a consumer version.According to them, they want standardized VR headset software so they can make peripherals for it (like that controller they made a year or two ago that failed miserably).
I have the same jacket but unlined, and I would have to concur with the above. You really can't go untucked with this jacket because it hits right at the beltline. Everything else in the outfit has to fit just right as well, nothing can be too big or too loose as this is a very slim trucker-type jacket.
I can wait at least for 1 month. Then I'll say fuck it. The sad part is she only cares about the money and she is set (and I mean fucking destined) to inherit the business. If she keeps this up she will lose more than me...
More specifically, Go is a game of complete information.  Given a board state we could compute a solution given enough time and resources.  Bridge is a game of incomplete information and much of the challenge is not only is solving a given "board state", but even deducing what the board state is.  In addition, the partnership aspect of bridge makes it a very different dynamic.  Solo efforts are quite different from team based cooperation, especially when the rules of the game itself enforce limited communications.  (Bidding, signalling)Where the luck factor comes in could be somewhat similar to poker:  we can compute that we are 90% to succeed in an action, we still fail 1 time in 10.  Nothing like that in Go.

Whether they did it intentionally was not the point I was try to make.  What I am saying is that if your non GMO corn has cross pollinated with GMO corn it is no longer non GMO because it now contains DNA from GMO corn.

This is the opposite of how it normally is for me, I'll be pulling into my driveway then have to sit in the car for a few extra minutes til the song is over.

I have been a trader for 2 years now. And I used to be able to trade bulk in decent quantities then they just started disappearing. When I started using puca power I saw these trades become available again... but only for a second or two before being auto traded. I used to grab maybe 10 to 15 cards from one user but I was barely able to grab one lately.
yeah, that's what the kids keep saying, i don't know that for sure but whatever the case most people get employed with a decent salary no matter what they do, engineers may get a head start (according to popular belief) but who gives a fuck, that only counts as an advantage when you're starting out, what about the next 40 something years you're working being stuck in a dull job most people can't and don't care to relate to

Harsh. I kinda stopped going to movies the day they came out after a really bad experience a few years back where people would not shut up during the film. I got so annoyed I vowed to stop. Unfortunately my ex still loved watching movies the day they come out. Oh well.
Well you seem to be using it as an insult and said he may re-apply when he stops, so you seem to have a problem with anal fisting. I guess technically it might not be homophobic, but the way you said it makes me think it was.Hope middle school is going well :)
I don't know if I really want to.Bethesda made a bad choice, and they should pay the price for it. Just because they corrected their error in judgement doesn't mean that their action should be forgotten. Forgiven, fine, but not forgotten.
Jaromir Jagr was drafted in  1990. He signed another one year contract to return next season.Not  sure if you count strike-shortened seasons in there.

Mod chips were very popular, easy to get, and easy to install if you knew how to. I knew people with spindles full of pirated PSX games. They had so many they would literally transport them in garbage bags. I ended up playing tons of japanese games in my childhood because of how easy it was to pirate games for the PSX and DC.I really regret how much I pirated when I was younger, but I don't regret how much it taught me about software and hardware and the internet, and I certainly don't regret actually playing the games.Funnily, even now Nintendo is still using proprietary discs in their consoles. Look at the Wii U - it uses a very slightly modified Blu-Ray. A lot of people wouldn't notice if they didn't look for it, but the discs look different.
Anywhere that a nice-looking car isn't very common, people are likely to overestimate its worth. You barely see any muscle cars over here, so when people do see them they think the owner must be rich even though it's just a base level car. Although to be fair, if you want to buy one without importing it yourself you do have to be pretty rich...$55k for a 2010 Camaro, seriously...

This was the biggest disappointment with his list of supported issues for me too. "No new spending" won't help. What needs to happen is "smarter spending". I'm not military, but I am military spouse and even as a low level spouse I hear about far too much wastage. Reduced military spending won't fix the problem; it will only exacerbate an existing problem and denude an already limited force. Being anti-war doesn't mean you have to be anti-servicemembers too.
Yes, it was a joke - and that's fine. But, it was still a accurate reflection of reality at the time. I don't care about the note - it doesn't tell us anything that we didn't already - but it's not untrue. And how can Cameron possibly not use it as a prop? It reinforces, albeit somewhat unnecessarily, his argument for choosing the Conservatives over Labour.

I did CF for a year, towards the end of my 200/mth year minimum subscription, I just wanted to do strength training.I was only allowed to do strength training as apart of a class, which was 3 days a week, tuesday, thursday, and sat.They had 0 open gym times, unless of course you were on PED and competed or a chick, then it was ok...I joined a rock climbing gym, also expensive, but there are incredible perks in terms of eye candy and no one touches my oly platform or squat rackrock climbing gym is 75$/mth, still 'expensive', but far better than the 200$+ you pay for a CF gym. The only benefit of attending a CF gym are the girls, or some trainers who could actually know what their talking about.If you dont need someone to help you, find a better gym, too expensive

It's about money. The same reason they played Hamburg in the UAE in January. It's also an opportunity for Pellegrini to get a closer look at some younger players, but it's 99% money.Those senior players who are there will be there in body more than mind, so to speak.

I think it's part of the Johnny Manziel thing from last year, where he was expected to go early...and didn't. They kept showing him sitting there, looking more and more nervous/uncomfortable with each pick that wasn't him. Some guys didn't want to risk that being them this year.
I'm here, but if it's late, then I don't want to keep you up! I don't think I'll be able to trade tomorrow as I'm moving some of my things back home, but maybe sometime during the weekend?
As I said, I guess I agree with you.  In a society with full equality under the law and a lack of social double standards, I can't think of any reason why statistically men and women would have different resource availability.  But I would consider resource equality to be a byproduct of the other two things, not a goal in of itself.
That's kind of where I'm at. I might just have to play around and see if I can find something that works. I saw on Ravelry that there was one person who made several pairs of socks in the same natural yarn, but the projects were finished in 2012 and I'm not sure how weird it would be to message the person and ask if they remember how well the socks they made three years ago held up.
I feel like they're talking about the release schedule in this case. Anet's already tried out a couple different update schedules. If they stick to the season/expansion setup, we could end up seeing new specializations earlier than before.
Oh yeah, we got the Montana for the property away from home. Nice, but you have to take it down in the winter, or the cold here kills some of the fabric. 
He's only apologizing because you caught him. If you hadn't caught him, he'd still be fucking this other lady (are you sure he stopped?). Unfortunately, I agree with other posters that this might not have been a one time thing. He's got perfect cover with odd hours at work and seeing movies alone.If you attempt to work things out with him, a condition needs to be that he gets tested for STDs periodically. Also, you both need to download a GPS app so that you can have piece of mind and be able to see that he is where he is supposed to be. Of he is truly remorseful, he won't argue this.
Yes that's just a myth because when you shave and it regrows, it's shorter and doesnt bend or anything so the shorter hairs feel harder and thicker. Guess thats what leads people to still believe in that myth
Moffit, our strength  and conditioning  coach did this. He said in an interview  it was more of a joking punishment  and he'd  back any of these  guys to NFL scouts.
Don't worry. They're just jealous. My parents bought me a laptop to use for school when I was your age. I called it my computer instead of the computer my parents bought me. I didn't try to pass it off as something I had worked for (even though they had me "earn" it through grades) and neither did you. 
Meh.  My friends know about it and if anyone asks why all my art features these anthros, I'll explain it to them.  It's not something I wave around or talk about much.  I don't really make a big deal of it and people generally don'd mind and think it's actually kind of cool.
to be a little fair, it's also about how much you play the game, average people don't play nearly as much as these popular streamers, and just by playing so much, they are actually better hearthstone players than most

Bread did nothing. I hope it's just that. It just makes eating and drinking painful. It feels like it could be inflammed. How can just a pill do this?!?!
Someone who let himself achieve that grade of sickness (come on, if I have maggots anywhere I would remove/kill/burn or whatever the hell takes to finish them) deserves to die.
Wow...Thank you for going so in depth with that. I'll admit though, I was just curious about the dynamics of "when a girl starts a tickle fight with you, TAKE THE HINT". I mean, more often than not its been with someone whom I've been intimate with, or about to be. But on the flip side, 1\3 of the time it was just genuine fun 'n games (so I think, at least). I guess for sure though, what you said is accurate and there is no " one size fits all" with human emotion!
speaking as a Christian myself, we do not hate gays. It is said many times in the Bible that God loves all his children, but hates sin, and homosexuality is a sin. Therefore, God does not hate homosexuality, he merely hates the sin of homosexuality.
Most of the endgame gear is droppable for raid tanking sans epic and a few vp drops which are only small upgrades.  Red is just about rolling with your gang and they're always looking for more :P  edit:  Also, holo kinda just walks through kunark content atm with only a little comp from azrael, so just app and walk through free loot / raidz :P
Wow.I know this was probably not their choice but it sucks that some of us won't be able to extract our playlists. The site literally went down and shut down in a matter of hours. That was fast.Funny. I was going to pay for premium when the site came back up...
Ingenuity I + II will become mandatory once you start crafting 1★  and it'll also make your rotation for lvl 50 stuff efficient.Piece by Piece and Waste Not II will become mandatory for 3-4★ (once you get to this point you need a very specific full 10 abilities from other classes at all time)

I think the team will consist of original Wells and his wife and Barry s father and mother after the Flash goes back in time and saves them.  Cisco and Caitlin (Killer frost) will be the villain s.
Trying to predict whether this is a good or not is like reading tea leaves at this point. If the two paths are really as long as Awakening (or close to it) like they're saying, people complaining about this don't really have a leg to stand on imo. That's a gigantic amount of content and they're absolutely justified in breaking it up. On the other hand, if it's obvious that they just split one game into two to make some more money, it's a pretty skeevy thing to do. Like I said though, nobody is going to know until the game comes out. So yeah, in that sense, I am also confused about why some people are already condemning the way it's being released. I don't see why you wouldn't at least give Nintendo and IS a chance, especially since Nintendo hasn't been egregious DLC so far. 
Can confirm - went to smoke dabs with /u/epidemic and was instead fed to Seymour. Currently posting from purgatory; overall it's not too great, not too bad. 
Damn. Why are people on reddit always such assholes?? Can you not have a discussion or disagreement without immediately being an asshole?? Damn. Is this how you are in real life?? 
So, haven't you told her about your feelings yet? If not, then do so immediately. Tell her, that you don't feel great about this at all, in fact it makes you feel very uncomfortable and ask her to consider your feelings about this matter. If she ignores your feelings and doesn't give a shit about it, you have your answer.
Sorry, don't know what you're talking about. Her win on the Conjoined Twins episode, which just happened one episode ago, was in no way controversial. It clearly was between her team and Katya's. As for the Max-Pearl win earlier in the season: it was no less questionable than Kennedy's win in episode 3 or Katya's win in episode 6 (as a completely forgettable Merle Ginsburg). In fact, a # of the wins have felt a bit arbitrary but I don't see how Pearl's were any less deserved than the ones I've mentioned.
Nah Diddy, some of these people just straight up threw away our mailout, then magically remembered it existed at one point and called out of the blue to ask about it a year later.  Blows my mind.

I mainly focused on that since that is where the event is.  I actually lived out hwy 27 near monticello, so I am actually more familiar with the flea market, governor square mall area.  My personal favorite pizza is barnaby's
Holy cow, I didn't realize new people would actually join during Omega Ruby. What drew you into twitchplaypokemon and had you known about it for awhile before you joined? 
You can. Google gives you an hour or two refund window after you purchase it to get a refund. The refund button appears in the app's page if you are within the refund window. A tap on the refund button is all it takes for Google to remove the app from your device and refund the purchase
I get angry comments about not having watched Dirty Dancing and the notebook. From what I can tell, one is just a dance film and the other looks depressing. Don't fancy that to be honest!
That's a shame. I can't say I feel the same way, and all I have to offer to the contrary is speculation on how everything will come together in the end.
Here is what the linked meme says in case it is blocked at your school/work or is unavailable for any reason:#***Bad Luck Brian***  &gt;***Post Title:***  *First time I had a girl over in 3 years...* &gt;***Top:***  *EATING 3RD DEGREE  BURN DORITOS* &gt;***Bottom:***  *NEW GIRLFRIEND STARTS TO GET FRISKY* [Original Link^1](http://imgur.com/volUNIN) | [Meme Template^2](http://imgur.com/memegen/create/volUNIN)
Homeopathy is using *none* of *something that produces the same symptoms as your illness*.Seriously, the dilution ratios are so high that there are mathematically zero molecules of whatever the "active ingredient" is in a homeopathic treatment. The purported effect comes from the "memory" of water.And it's not inoculating you against an illness by showing your immune system and actual pathogen - it's treating a runny nose with something else (or rather, the "memory" of something else) that makes your nose run.
When I was in high school my school system picked up the motto "Every student matters everyday." Not a typo. This was on the signs, on printouts, on the sites... We were a ghetto school system, sure, but even the freaking school board doesn't know basic grammar?
Happens more often than you think. A CEO spent 20 minutes explaining how his son was in IT while I was fixing his PC. After I checked it and told him it was fine, he goes , "Good. So my son did fix it."
Umm, I've been a long time Helixite Anarchist in tpp(though I am tolerant of Democrat Domites). I've participated since the first run. I generally hang out in the IRC channel, my nick there is different from my username here. I have experience modding, as I've modded /r/SubredditDramaDrama and /r/BotsScrewingUp.

You should probably see an ortho because we might have different clicking. My shoulders click when I make big circles and my ortho told me its because I have weak mid traps. I don't have any pain either but he said if I keep pressing it could eventually lead to a bad injury.

You're mistaken about what science is. Nothing is believed to be true until it's been proven to be true. At that point, it becomes a fact, not a theory.
Yes and Alex wasn't expecting a lucian / naut to lose to a sivir / thresh in lane.... their bot and top lane both lost hard and gave up a ton of map control.The pick was fine the rest of the team shit the bed. He played that pick as best as you could given what his team-mates were doing.
I'm pretty sure the two creatures are sakura-tribe elder and azusa, lost but seeking. The others I can only guess are Sensei' s diving top and umezawa's jitte.

That is because while I love college and higher learning in general (current student, learn for the sake of learning), that environment is BP as fuck.Just take your women's lib and theology courses and enjoy yourself making little atheists and misogynists.
I went to visit family over there. They had soda with every meal. My siblings and I love plain water with like 90% of our meals. They thought we were weird.
I also have Anterior Pelvic Tilt and the exact same kind of pain if I don't pay extra attention to my posture. Especially if I swing hard.I do a lot of sports who requires to do a torso rotation and I use to developp pain in all of them if I practice it to often. Like the previous poster mention and I can't stress enough that good posture, flexibility and core streght help a lot. However, once on the golf course, even if common knowledge state to be relax at address, actively engage your glutes and your abdominal muscle (as if you were trying to press down on your leg with your abs).It goes against common golf knowledge, but for people with anterior pelvic tilt, like me, it can mean a whole season pain free and you're even going to hit farther and straigter.
Found it myself. I was thinking it was some shopped chubby girl. But no, its exactly as fucking fat as seen here. I love me some love handles, but theres a limit. And she passed that by a mile.
A man filled with the gladness of livingPut his keys on the table,Put flowers in a copper bowl there.He put his eggs and milk on the table.He put there the light that came in through the window,Sounds of a bicycle, sound of a spinning wheel.The softness of bread and weather he put there.On the table the man putThings that happened in his mind.What he wanted to do in life,He put that there.Those he loved, those he didn't love,The man put them on the table too.Three times three make nine:The man put nine on the table.He was next to the window next to the sky;He reached out and placed on the table endlessness.So many days he had wanted to drink a beer!He put on the table the pouring of that beer.He placed there his sleep and his wakefulness;His hunger and his fullness he placed there.Now that's what I call a table!**It didn't complain at all about the load.**It wobbled once or twice, then **stood firm.**The man kept piling things on.

Excellent response! Thank you for taking the time to write that out. If you don't mind, what political system would you say has followed the ideals of communism most successfully, or as you said, who followed their own definition of the communist dream closest?
Are you implying he strategically ended up with a broken neck?The same guy who ran from the cops - a stupid idea as it is, planned this from the start with Machiavellian precision for the sake of a potential police brutality claim?I want what you're smoking.

Things have really changed in the last couple series going into today.  I still believe in this team in the long haul, but during the 11-game streak, it seemed like we always had an opportunity to take over and then we'd hold it out.  More recently, we get leads and figure out ways to fuck it up.

It seems nobody understands that actually lifting the weights is the easy part. Doing the science and statistics is way harder. And these celebrities have someone else to do that for them.
Use the standard build but swap Hydra for Meteor shower. Take Prodigy/Astral/EE/Unstable. Easily did a 51 solo with it, but with a 1 Hander you have similar damage output with more gearing options.
Each small island is supposed to have a luxury mansion on it. They put the islands on auction to buy. Sounds cool, but if I remember correctly, it will only end with the islands being washed away due to longshore drift. They spent billions on something that will only look flashy and cool for some time, before it is washed downwind. 
A Turkish architectural firm did the maths and came up with 1.7 billion on the bottom end. Glass manufacturers said the minimum cost of glass would have been 700 million.  As someone who doesn't mind erdogan. I would never trust his official figures. 
That's certainly one way to get around the issue of the one drop that hungry dragon spawns. Though I suspect you don't have enough dragons to reliably trigger BWT and corrupter. There's also no heals in the deck. Lastly, if I'm running BWT, i'm running both. I just feel like its inconsistent to only play one. 
Maybe it's to do with [the billions we give them in aid](http://dfat.gov.au/geo/indonesia/development-assistance/pages/development-assistance-in-indonesia.aspx)
Alright i think for a logo ill get a pic of me and my dog (hes always sitting my my bed next to me during streams) and then see if i can get someone to draw it cartoon-like.

I didn't even know there was going to be a Stagg Jr any time soon!The Stagg Jr batch #4 proof is only .05 more than batch 3, I wonder how it's going to taste compared to the third batch (which was pretty fantastic imo!) Also picked up a bottle of Maker's Mark CS for a pretty good price, so that's nice. 
I'll be asleep at that time here in Australia; any chance someone could ask on my behalf whether the band plans to do any sideshows around Australia following their Splendour In The Grass appearance? 
The funny thing is that I was just about to post this same question.  With the resurgence of podcasting, I was looking for some local shows myself.I've just started my own at [www.randomconnections.com](http://www.randomconnections.com).  As the name might suggest, it's not just on history, but on a variety of topics.  So far there have only been two episodes.  The first was on SciFi, and the second on the historic headstone carvers of South Carolina.  Upcoming episodes will be about flea markets, ghost towns, shape note singing, all with a South Carolina flavor.You can [subscribe on iTunes here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/random-connections/id968365267?mt=2) 
There are many people who are looking to sublet their apartments over the summer. They usually post in our facebook "free and for sale" page. Unfortunately, you need an rpi email to access that page. But that's where people post. For example, someone posted just yesterday about subletting their apartment (313/mo/person). Another person posted a couple days ago (305/mo , no utilities). I'm hesitant to post their listings here without their permission. But if you'd like, I can give them your contact info.
For anybody into punk at any point in their lives, The Other F Word is great. It's about what happens when the fathers of punk age and become fathers of children, and how it can be difficult to lay down authority after you fought it so much.
Well, for as fantastical as the story is, it still needs to have some ground rules.  That would be the science part of the fiction...  The base assumption that we are all making is that what we know of physics is pretty right, and would be the same anywhere.Throw out your expectations, not your assumptions.  If you throw out the assumptions you have to wrestle with all the philosophical issues, like why does any of it exist, to the point that you get so bogged down you miss all the fun stuff, like firefly references. 
Wow, I *am* getting old. A proposition bet, more commonly known as a bar bet, is a bet that proposes something. A guy might say something like, "I'll bet you a drink that my cock hangs below my knees." If you accept, he then pulls up his pant leg and shows you something like [this](http://www.zhippo.com/SkinDeepInkTattooHOSTED/images/gallery/medium/ROOSTER.jpg).In the film Cool Hand Luke, a famous prop bet involved the eating of a shitload of hard boiled eggs. Usually though, there is a "trick" to the bet.

Just to let you know, unfortunately this draft comes right before finals. So no redditing. But I'm streaming the draft (in the background). Solidarity with my Jetsbros, and here's to a good draft!
I think when I read On Acting I remember that there were older people in in class too. But that is also great to hear. I am probably stressing / worrying about the "personal statement" in the application too much, but I do that.
The face was drawn by builderman himself in ms paint and then he died. Taking away the default face is like spitting on the grave of the person who is the sole reason for the existance of the game you're playing.
Considering the circumstances no, I don't think it's over the top. He was scaring me badly, so I left. And I already said he constantly looks at my main (alongside the rest of my social media)
Since there is no evidence, none at all, that Adnan strangled her and threw her in a ditch, just your (and others) "gut feelings," I'm always puzzled by people who make the argument that he did it, end of story.  On some level, it feels like (yes, I'm going to say it) racism. It's not intentional, just good old fashioned institutional racism on a subconscious level.  It happens -- Adnan is brown and Muslim and there is a lot of Islamophobia going around these days.
Not what he said, really. He is, I believe, speaking about people who feel entitled to tech jobs without putting in the work studying. I also work with a bunch of awesome women engineers. They're degreed.
I couldn't answer the phone until I heard her talking on the answering machine...but ONLY if she used the code, "I need a King's Kid to pick up the phone." My mentally handicapped brother got grounded once for picking up when he heard her voice but before she finished the code. 
My friends mum was crazy. She couldnt go to movies or watch any M rated movies until she was 18. Couldnt go to concerts, couldnt stay out past 9pm, couldnt wear anything that was ''too provocative'' (knee length is considered bad), wasnt allowed to catch public transport alone until 18, no dating. She was very sheltered, but has turned out to be the most wonderful person I know so her parents did something right. That and she is the life of any party now and clubs more than I sleep.. 
How would you build the 6.84 OD?He has so many options to choose from now.Octarine for the huge +stats and -40s cd?Aghs + Refresher?Blink dagger over force staff for initiation and self-escape?Oldschool scythe of vyse?
Not my colleague, but one of my friends had a teacher remark about a black student who isn't the brightest, but very hardworking. Apparently she said something along the lines of, "if we were at a plantation, he would be my right hand man." 
Who else has been in one of those situations where everything is forced and feels incredibly awkward and people keep making terrible jokes to ease some tension?That's what watching the official NFL stream is like right now.There's no tension to ease, but their "banter" is just really awkward right now.
Your link indicates that's something that  some PA member proposed. Netanyahu would never propose such a thing. I suspect the settlers would return, but they aren't stupid and would riot if such a deal were proposed . I don't think any of the negotiations ever floated such an idea. The international community would expect that Israel evacuate and remove any settlers in what would be deemed Palestinian territory.
My problem with the ending of Soul Eater is that friendship *did* have a place... and they just ignored it. They spent so long getting Maka, Black☆Star and Kid to work together as a team, and they spent the entire penultimate episode rescuing Soul because his and Maka's teamwork was so important... and then in the last episode they just threw that all away and had Maka beat the villain by herself. It didn't help that the penultimate episode built up hype for the final battle *really* well, but then the last episode was just kinda a let-down.
The way they were all shaking hands made it look like no one was coming back. Maybe it was just me, but it seriously looked like they thought the whole draft was over.
Pretty sure you've got it backwards. Non-necessary DLC is the kinda people generally *don't* have an issue with, because you can just ignore it. It's the stuff that adds important story elements and such that people get pissed off about.
The test is used quite commonly just as /u/majeric is doing right now as in indicator of negative inequality between the sexes which it does not do. I don't think MRAs have a problem with the test when used correctly they have a problem when it is used as a gage of discrimination. like a wet sponge being used as proof of a cyclone  (edit) my bad, changed it to mean "between the sexes" not sexuality 
&gt; what I mean is not too bigsmhAnyways, focus on spending that $300 for gym access and grow some balls to work out in public. Trust me, no one cares about anyone but themselves when they go to a gym

Jesus, Hussie wasn't kidding when he said that these fake teens would sit around bullshitting to the bitter end.  There are going to be 7 more of these!
This whole thing sounds pretty odd, I'm going to wait until more details come out. Elsevier's not perfect but they're still one of the premier journal publishers out there, so it would seem strange to me for an editor to be strongly opposed to having them handle production and even stranger that he'd be sacked just for doing so.Edit: I can't access the medical site articles about this but they all say the issue was a 'staffing row'. I'll see if my wife can get them later.The press release claims that Elsevier is only going to handle production, they won't have any editorial control over the journal. I wonder if this is about some people at AMPco losing their jobs in production?

My last day at work. Ended up pulling a double and dipshit boss let the guy who just got there leave early because we didn't need so many people on. Actually screamed FUUUUUUCK right outside the managers office after he failed to give any fucks. He was kinda scared of me after that
Yeah, that would be nice, ha. Every time I've heard a "oh my gosh I had that and" I've looked into it and it was ruled out. While I'm happy I don't have endometriosis, I would have at least had an answer.The thing about BC is at least something basic I can try.
Ya, I think that's how it works in lol, I know that's how it works in heroes, but in dota you can set individual hotkeys for quick cast and normal cast on all skill and item slots.
As long as the trust was their for Shirin to not use it, then it should have been done that way.  Also reminds me of what Spencer/Jeremiah should have done in S28. Had Jeremiah wear the idol during TC and then give it to Spencer to play. I don't think anyone has ever done anything like that, but it does involve a lot of trust.  Truth be told, if I was in that situation, I probably would screw the person over and just use the idol.
We might have got the better out of the two qbs. Sure Winston is a better pocket passer and has the size but Marita seems like the smarter man. I feel he will be able to adapt and so will we with guys like McCluster,Douglas  and Sankey. Our O line sucks so get the guy that can scramble. I'm do fuckinn excited 
Absolutely. The confidence such a man actually has, attracts younger women, often sick of the stupid gamesmanship of their male cohorts. And please, remember, we are talking about preponderance of occurrence, not any kind of absolute "every time" bullshit. There is literally nothing that works "every" time.
Dude. Neil Degrasse Tyson is a much better role model than Tupac, a guy who moved to California when he was 16, was involved in the death of a 10 year old boy in Marin City, repped Thug Life and hung out with gang members, before being killed at the age of 25.Seriously, how about you tell me what the fuck was so good about him that you'd rather have your kids look up to him than Neil Degrasse Tyson? Seriously? You'd pick a gangster rapper over the head of NASA as a role model?That is EXACTLY what is wrong with ghetto culture.Maybe YOU can tell me why Tupac makes a better role model for your kids than the head of NASA?
Say something, make a stink about it, fuck that guy. I work in a school (IT not a teacher, but still.) that should not be acceptable, I would say something to the principal and if that doesn't work send a message to the school board. If you can get names from classmates for a petition go for it, else I would honestly start smear campaign with quotes from his stupid fucking self and post them around the building. Also on a slow news day local stations might like a story about a teacher making an uncomfortable and "unsafe"  environment for students. 
I mean,..yes,.. it is an electronic-device,.. so technically speaking it does have a finite lifespan. The LCD-backlighting could "pop" tomorrow and you'd be done. or it might work for 5 years if properly taken care of. There's no way for me to know. My experience has been that they are pretty reliable. I have 3 or 4 of almost every iPad made,..and they are all still going strong.

It's described in the original Star Wars novelisation:&gt; It consisted primarily of a short, thick handgrip with a couple of small switches set into the grip.Above this small post was a circular metal disk barely larger in diameter than his spread palm. Anumber of unfamiliar, jewellike components were built into both handle and disk, including whatlooked like the smallest power cell Luke had ever seen. The reverse side of the disk was polished toa mirror brightness.
I didn't hear this, but I was actually just talking to a coworker who told me this story. When my coworker was in high school, one of her teachers was infamous for calling students "Helen" whenever they did something foolish. As in Helen Keller. He would actually say, "What are you; deaf, dumb and blind? Helen!" A student apparently bought him a license plate that said Helen on it, and he hung it in his classroom proudly. What a jerk.
Sure, I just wish /r/space would have called out the Obama administration on doing this too, they have been gutting exploration to fund earth science. Dawn, New Horizons, Curiosity, Spirit, Opportunity, Messenger - all Bush era programs that Obama got to take credit for. What has the Obama administration launched? /r/space/, you guys got fucked by Obama, and have been awfully quiet about it.
SO AWESOME. Seriously, the team and every member of the organization and event staff is amazing, hard-working, and incredibly talented. And we work at the best park in baseball for the BEST FANS in baseball! What else can you ask for?
I did it for my BSN program. Should work. Edit: I see what you mean. That's strange that it says only graduate nursing now. I did it in 2012 for undergraduate

Just a little spiritual teaching I heard: "things don't happen to you, they happen because of you." So, surely this person doing you unjust harm, is something to do with the way you are, essentially feedback on the way you are being? Obviously, this cannot be 100% true but still. Worth considering, before you hex the shit out of them.
What works best for me is a simple "Hello. I just want to remind you guys that this floor is a quiet area, and we need you to keep the volume down a bit so as not to disturb other patrons/students." If they don't quiet down after a few minutes I let them know that a quiet policy is not enforced on the other floors and they may be more comfortable there. If they're still loud after that I simply call security. 
I'm gonna be completely honest with you, and some may hate me for saying this, yet if you can get an R9 270x or 270, whether new, used, or on the hardwareswap subreddit, you're better off getting that instead. The GPU is the max that CPU can handle without bottlenecking. It's up to you though.
Ugh, I used to work the Haunted Mansion. Our standard spiel is "two or three bodies per buggy please". So of course they'll try to stuff three of their hambodies in there, causing the ride to stop and everyone having to shuffle around.
&gt;I hope that you like it when characters in stories talk to one another, because there's an awful lot of that to come. Please stand by patiently and enthusiastically as my fake teens sit around bullshitting to the bitter end. Then a bunch of cool stuff will happen, and that will be that! 
You can't just fucking turn up to a gym class and say you're trans-gender and they'll let you into the locker room. Nor will turning up in a skirt work either, it's a long term evaluated process. Think living as a women, permanently and psych evaluations and possible hormone treatments. Basically by the time you'd be allowed in the locker room you'd have tits yourself.

[DC Deck Builder: Heroes Unite](https://www.cryptozoic.com/games/dc-comics-deck-building-game-heroes-unite) is awesome. Has a great theme and replayability with the crisis pack and the alternative modes. Can't wait for the JSA crossover pack and Teen Titans version.
Clean and sober for 5 years off of heroin, coke, pills, yada yada yada. Started gear after almost two years of being stalled and frustrated in the gym.  Still figuring it all out, but I can relate to the feeling.  I look at it like this... I am actually trying to achieve a goal with my aas use.  Before I used with no goals and no purpose.  Is that rationalization?  Maybe, but my life is good and I feel great.  I can also pretty much guarantee that I'll never be sitting and sobbing with a syringe full of test because I can't find any more veins to shoot in.
Realistically we were never going to win the league, but in hindsight I think we will all look back at the months where Monreal and Debuchy were playing cover Centre Back and thinking what if. Really though, if we secure second and win the FA Cup, I'll be delighted. It's positive progress, and I think big things aren't very far away now.
&gt; and don't you have the ability to be just as good a player yourself?Bwawaaaaahhhhh!!!! My bronze ass. I'd probably do better against the NFL than I would against the LCS.
Putting up with his paranoia is all you've done wrong. He wants you to sacrifice your career to ensure you're not cheating? That is psychotic and controlling enough of a reason to GTFO.

Here's what the message is boiled down as simple as I can see itHuman nature is social. When resources are scare we tend to clan up and trade on what we can scavenge. This happens in all communities. When even that is threatened people get violent. You see it from Appalacia to Compton.
I had much the same experience on a winding, isolated road along a river in a rural area, only it was a deputy sheriff in what I assume was an unmarked SUV.  He wasn't very happy I flashed my brights at him, and he made sure to light me up with everything he had when he pulled me over.
I would say the Rangers are my second team, but I'm fairly confident that my Sabres are going to take the cup, so I don't even have to think about settling for number two.
Or maybe just take it upon yourself to be a more thorough reader when this subject comes up. It seems important to you to have "actually seen it happen" I'm sure /u/ellibound truly appreciates being given "another shot" at proving her statement is 100% correct to you, but since you seem so invested in finding proof that's been accurately screencapped, make it your homework! Luckily those comments tend be frequent when discussing topics like this, so it shouldn't take you that long .
They don't.  That's the whole point of science - to continuously question.It is not "theories as much as God is a theory" - it's continuously testing the best theories you can make.And some things are actual facts, not theories.
I actually went to 5 different places to get quotes and look at artists work and they all loved the tattoo so that part about the artists laughing in your face is completely false.  And personally, I'd be flattered if someone loved a design I did enough to use it.  Lastly,  I'm genuinely curious about the last comment. Why will they blob together?
Having been someone that was very disrespectful and aggressive like this kid, and who naturally proceeded to get my ass beat - it didn't make me more respectful, it just made me feel humiliated and angry. I very nearly brought a knife to school later on to murder the guy who beat me. I'm a completely different person now not because I got 'some respect beaten into me' but because, with a lot of help and understanding, I gradually started to understand I was making other people's lives hell. I realised it was possible to get respect without being an asshole all the time.

As a pedestrian I am curious why it is okay for cyclists to endanger pedestrians on the sidewalk? The majority of cyclists do not, but I have had my share of cyclists come up from behind, most without warning. 
How dare they ever have a good or positive thought! They should live in constant shame and emotional torment. That always makes *me* want to get out of bed and exercise!
And neither do you. If we take your logic THAN NORMAL would include their own practices being just as dangerous if not more so than the helmetless ones. I'm telling you this isn't dangerous. You're insinuating they should continue their dangerous tackling habits and not try and fix something dangerous. This is a move in the right direction, you're just stuck on DIFFERENT EQUALS BAD. You are not correct.

Tie fabric is usually classified as such. Most of the nomenclature has to do with the weave of the fabric. For example a silk twill vs silk faille. Also ties can be made in other fabrics as long as you cut it on the bias (45° to grain line )
Why do I deserve to win? Well I think I deserve to win just as much as the next commenter. Why I should win in particular is that I'll happily share the wealth with my big brother. He's constantly spoiling me, giving me the life he didn't have. So by giving him Ike, I would feel like I've done a good deed. That's one of his favorite Characters, along with Falcon and jiggs.

Do it!  Short girls make awesome lifters because we don't have to move the weights as far :)If I were you, as a new lifter, I'd just do Starting Strength at first and eat at maintenance (or at least not think about diet too much) at first.  You will notice changes in your body within the first ~2 months...don't focus too much on how much you weigh or how you look at first, just focus on getting stronger, and the rest tends to fall into place.  After you've been at it for a while...that's when you might want to mess around with diet.  Cutting too much will leave you passing out on the platform!
Old profile: my summary was a list of things I liked rather than things about me. It also prominently mentioned feminist blogs. I still read the blogs; I just don't talk about them. Old and current profile: selfiesssss and idgaf they work.

Woah, my previous comment was a joke about the lack of affection felt by most Europeans towards Europe as a concept (plus I must admit a jab at the bizarre convention of having military displays and heavy handed national symbology before sporting events) , not a jingoistic attempt at one-upmanship. The use of anti-semitic, racist, and otherwise discriminatory language in public, particularly prevalent as you mentioned at events such as football games, is indeed deeply troubling, but not quite as prevalent as your comment would suggest. 
Did they all come in around the same time? If so can you please share it? It sort of seems like they are working all day and then mass dumping the information to us at the end of the day. Thoughts?
&gt; However both jokes are awful to make to the people who were there, I'd imagine.But not for the Romans, what makes me respect American soldiers more than Roman soldiers?????
That video is intentionally misleading. Notice the quills all do the same amount of damage; this means he had 10 stacks of quills on the svens before the video started.
I started crying at half time, i was in complete disbelief how horribly they played. I would rather watch a close game like the 2005 or 2006 GF than that game! 
YES. A firmware update to make this possible would make me so happy. The folder would be filled with all killscreens of rajang, just so I can cry/motivate myself for another run and rejoice in that bitch's death.
So this is happening over a couple of days? I assume we are just picking from the random dudes as well. Are our regular dudes in contracts or something?
I've actually been so pissed off about Canadian politics I've been avoiding it.Who, what, where, and how did the NDP get a chance in Alberta?Edit: Just looked into it. Seeing a conservative party fall to vote splitting on the right would be just too good.
Yea but 15 years of being horribly disfigured to the point where people thought he was a ghoul would make him a hundred times more psychologically in need if you ask me.
If you can do it get a friend to take you (should be less than an hour procedure if you are doing in office) or get a cab there and back. While I wasn't in horrible pain it would have been a bitch to drive home. Don't jiggle the boys any more than you have to for the first week.
Yeah, plus a really unflattering picture. In the other picture she doesn't even look that bad - definitely not haggard. Like you said, she's gained weight and isn't wearing makeup. 
My high school American Lit teacher used this poem as an example of writing in which many people try to find a deeper meaning that isn't there. In her words: "Don't thos plums sound delicious? Wouldn't you eat them? I would!" Same woman described a pop-up book edition of the Kama Sutra as "Penises! Penises everywhere!"You're a beautiful human being, Mrs. Shoemaker.

Veins are one of those genetics type things. Some people have amazing veins despite either extreme of weight. There are some fat people I love to stick and some skinny people I dread seeing. The biggest thing, though.. I work in a very rural part of the south. My patients are very low on the socio economic ladder and they've no regard for their health. Period. I feel like I never stick any normal people because they're either really, really fat or strung out on meth and weigh ninety pounds. The fat people always smell worse. I have a hard time getting the tourniquet tight enough. I've seen yeast in the antecubital space. Many are rude. They just gross me the fuck out. Generally they are harder stick, yeah.
I have listened to Migos Cross the Country just about every day since I first heard it about a month or two ago. Best trap song I think I have ever heard.
But she's not like "Oh hey don't talk to him he's mine" she's just trying to get his attention in a more subtle way. I wouldn't think it's that bad unless he told her to stop and she didn't.

&gt; Matt never said it was coming today.I never said he did. My point was that he regularly posts store banners and the like without any indication of how he came across the files. As  Belvedere just showed, Matt got the file from the Dota 2 website. Matt is quiet about sources so as to make people think that he's got inside knowledge of Valve.

I'm American, yeah. Most of the reason I debate here in the first place is because of how influential religion is in my daily life, usually through politics.
Five is pretty much the lower bound of Dixit - it depends on whether she has a fully developed Theory of Mind yet. If she has not, then Dixit will be an exercise in frustration as she doesn't understand that your mind works differently than hers.
The dude is funny on Twitter. That's his thing. There are a lot of people, myself included, who use Twitter as a platform for humor (he's more of a mix between humor and day-to-day stuff, but still). Just don't follow him if you don't want to see it.
I think it is a great idea, but if you are going to be presenting this it is going to be very distracting to the audience because of the proportion changes in almost every frame. It would only take you 2 or 3 hours to redo this in chemsketch and the proportions would be correct. You also might want to consider working on a grid to avoid movement of the structure off center on each frame which is also pretty distracting. This might sound picky. but people are going to notice the imperfections first and then wont be paying attention to the main idea.    
Depends on if the planet suits it or not -- most of Tatooine and Hoth is open and barren, because that's how the planets are, compared to more mountainous, forested, or urban planets that aren't as barren. One of the things I disliked about SWG, some planets were a bit too open, and you could just drive up and over stuff which didn't make sense whatsoever, giant canyons, big mountains, etc
Thats what I thought, but I went to report a user for scamming and didnt see anything pertaining to sharing of an account and it just got me wondering.
Again, if you take the time to quote the things you're replying to, I'll reply in detail.  If its too much work for you to quote the relevant things I said you're replying to, why should I put in the work to go look up whatever you're talking about?  That's why we have quotes here.  If you were interested in having a discussion, you'd facilitate that.  But if you're unwilling to use quotes and just want to throw a bunch of sentence at me without context, I'm unwilling to take the time to reply to you in detail.
I'm with you there. I don't identify as a feminist either, for all of the reasons /u/Lluxx listed, but mostly the first point listed. I'm not interested in directly supporting the feminist movement, and so I don't feel that I can really call myself a feminist. 
I was just shocked it wasn't downvoted into oblivion.One of the posts on /r/videos has some of the most vile thinking I ever saw. And with so many upvotes, it disheartened me.
Dante Fowler Jr number 3. Wasn't there another DE that was ranked higher than him and everyone thought was better?Edit: Leonard Williams is who I was thinking of.
&gt; I believe you're using the nomenclature improperly.You do not get to make up what words means. I seen routine usage of term "paper rocket" for rockets that have existing physical hardware, but not flied. "Paper rocket" does not mean literally rocket that exists only on paper. It means rocket that is completely unproven, without any successful launch.
No problemFor me it was just a matter of calling a few weeks after I did my medical for an update..they said everything checked out so I would assume they would know before you get a letter in the mail.Don't want to answer your second question for fear of giving you the wrong info..but as an infantry applicant myself I know thats where my med file went along with many others so assume yours is going there too.Good luck!

Ugh, I hated that Battle. It looks like an old PS2 game, *and* it has Yoda... fighting... with a lightsaber...I actually liked a lot of the earlier parts of the movie better. Chasing the changeling assassin? Fun, felt like what I always hoped the prequels should have been, if only for a few minutes. Obi-Wan's fight with Jango on Camino? Excellent. Everything else was garbage.
You're still not getting it. With a bicycle you're still not disconnecting the wheels from the power source manually. This is what I prefer about a manual transmission, not simply the fact that I can select a gear. It's the clutch not the stickIt's not an argument. I love driving stick and won't go back to auto until I'm too old or crippled to drive it anymore.
Has anyone noticed how legally shaky this argument is? This requires taking a *very* broad reading of "substantial burden", and proving that abortion is an actual part of her religious practice (rather than her religion just having no objections to abortion). Using the same logic, I could sue a state for not allowing the sale of liquor after 9pm, since I don't have any religious objections to drinking.
Non-black: Culture has accomplished something more advanced than wiggling around a twig in a termite mound at suppertime.

I met up with a guy I had only met once at a bar through mutual friends.  We were supposed to go out to dinner then meet friends, but he said he forgot his wallet at his place and would I like to come up to see his apartment- to which I agreed.  We get up to his apartment and he starts asking if I'm into Astral Projection, and saying its the most liberating thing. Asking "Do you want to try it? you could try it now, I could lead you..." I kept saying "It really isn't my thing, I'm not really into that spiritual stuff."  He had given me a drink and kept saying drink up then we'll go, but feeling a little freaked out, I said I needed to eat before I drank anything. Later found out he was hard into hallucinogens.  Dunno if he just made me a drink or was so fuct that he thought he'd liberate me with an outer body experience whether I wanted one or not. He never once tried anything sexual either, so I think he really just wanted someone to trip with him.     
&gt;Seriously, can you imagine a dark, complex Optimus Prime?Batman's parents died, and he got really dark and moody.Optimus Prime's entire world died - imagine how dark and moody he could get.
I used to just ignore and scoff at the ponies when visiting r34 sites. Eventually I thought, with so much pony porn, there must be something to the show.  So I watched it.
I don't mean to be rude - but 15 years later you want the guy to get excited? Lol, I'd probably be like "yeah and........?"It would be hard to get excited about it after already spending most of your life in prison. Also, we need to be careful, just because people react in different ways than us, doesn't mean they are acting wrongly :) Just fyi - I actually think he is most likely guilty.

I'm really glad they did the responsible thing and hotfixed this.

Just to make a few more from the top of my head, Animal Crossing New Leaf, Mario Kart 7, *Fire Emblem: Awakening*, Fantasy Life, and there's a new NN3DS exclusive called Xenoblade.

How can they put fourth an effort when nothing can be done? There is literally nothing that can be done by police officers. How are you supposed to put out an APB for a stolen bike? Most bikes look pretty much the same, and require very specific descriptions to differentiate. Then, even if an officer found the bike with someone, how are you supposed to prove it's yours?It's not like this problem only happens to bikes, pretty much any kind of property theft works out this way. Police certainly don't organize huge busts trying to find things like a PS3 or diamond ring. Pretty much the only property police are able to retrieve with some success is cars, because they are something you can't hide as easily and they have unique identifiers easily visible (the license plate, and if it's removed there are lots more discrete serials hidden throughout the components).
You don't have to change anything except the order of the list and eliminate one of the commas. "Among those interviewed were Kris Kristofferson, Robert Duvall and Merle Haggard's two ex-wives.""This book is dedicated to God, Ayn Rand and my parents.""Highlights of Peter Ustinov's global tour include encounters with an 800-year-old demigod, a dildo collector and Nelson Mandela."I think the first two are much more clear. Maybe the third one is still a little ambiguous, but I think it reads more naturally and is easy enough to decipher through context.

Sanders is running in the Democratic *primary* - he isn't running in the Presidential election as an independent and unless there's a huge amount of support for him outside of the Democrat party, I don't think he will run in 2016 as an independent.
I wont disagree to the logic behind your comment at all because frankly you're very correct. I believe the tool list has just never been considered (at least not in my local) as a requirement for change in contract so it's been left after all these years. There are certain tools that people won't give grief over for having but the tool list is mostly to get a good grasp of items. The real key is that you are to only require hand tools and I'm sure all if not MOST locals would not require any power tools to be personally supplied.
So how would you protect all the property in the city of Baltimore.What if you only protected your own house in a riot. Are you racist against those people in the other homes?I think I've just always seen racism as an active thing, not a passive inherent thing. I might be wrong on that thinking. I mean I am a white person in Los Angeles. That does not give you the typical experience of America. I've been the majority race in maybe 50% of life experience depending on how you view it. For instance Caucasian was the majority in my university, but within my school and major and most classes I was a minority. And I now drive through watts and south central at least once a week in the course of my job.
I have to disagree.  Mr Magoo consistently gets out of every situation,  but i doubt you would say that isnt plot armor.  How does he do it?  Plot armor.  How does batman dodge bullets? Plot armor.

So. Much. Cologne!I'm convinced the first Abercrombie was originally european night club that raved so hard Europeans exploded and their form-fitted clothing few off their bodies and folded neatly into piles. Once the police arrived on-scene they entered a darkly-lit building full of folded clothing too tight for the average person, and with far too many industrialized rips. Only the siren of euro-club techno throbbing in their ears and choking fumes of over-sprayed cologne left the deafening and pungent signs of the stereotypical Europeans which had once occupied this space.

I dont know if anyone uses this method or not. But i use 1.65@800DPI and i use my wrist for aiming and use the letters C and V for left and right sharp turns. Been using it for almost 10 years now. The low sens helps me get accurate aim in duels and the letters help me with quick turns like 180 shots. Once you get the coordination down you can be pretty consistent with combining the letters for turning and your mouse movement. 
Well, when the patient it's 100% ready to be discharged from the hospital we will call up social services and they will do what they can. Those guys are heroes. I just kill some maggots and take dead skin off. Guys at social services will try their best to internt this patients in a municipal shelter or something equivalent. There are very few available. The patient most likely will not want to remain in the shelter (mental health problem + drug addiction) and will drift off.
it definitely would take a little while and should be careful. it seems that the more amethyst unpoofed the more unstable her body became. the gems risk giving themselves physical adnbormalities that could hinder them.

Looking at the picture of the big cat thing and the dogs eating the raw meat - "WTF, they're just giving them raw meat?!  That could make them really sick, wtf?!"Then seconds later:  "Verily, I am a dumbass."
For one you basically need to:1. Read in the number *as a string*2. Loop over the string, accumulating the number according to the rules of positional notation.To use 9876 as an example.* You can convert the character '9' to the digit 9 by subtracting the character '0' from the character '9'.* You want to end up with a number like 9\*1000 + 8\*100 + 7\*10 + 6\*1This can be done by starting with the number 9 and shifting digits to the left via multiplication by 10:          9    (x10) 90    (+8)  98    (x10) 980    (+7)  987    (x10) 9870    (+6)  9876You might want to implement in another language first to make sure you get the logic right. This process is similar to the C `atoi` function.

Way to overlook that a major factor in this phenomenon is that Whites **aren't allowed** to *have* a racial identity. You really can't blame them then and have it both ways. That's pretty bullshit.

The level of complacency with health, careers, and almost everything else in society today disgusts me. The only person who can change your situation is you. If you're ok with where you are, great; but don't bitch about people looking better and making more money when they actually put some work into their lives. I couldn't agree more, OP
http://www.hurstbeans.com/recipes/285/Hursts-HamBeens-Vegetarian-15-Bean-SoupHave you ever made 15 bean soup?  It calls for onions and I add a good amount of diced carrots and ham hocks for flavor.  Honestly, the quick cook recipe on the package is foolproof - and a dollop of ketchup when it's ready to be served - heaven in a bowl!The packages of Beans are found in most grocery markets.  Good luck!Edit:  Recipe on the back of the bag
I think it's best for Italian football if other teams start becoming stronger. Otherwise, if Juve has no competition in the league, they won't be pushed to improve and will begin to struggle in European competition.
They edited their errors.It was a joke. The joke is now gone and now it looks like a malicious attack against a nations intelligence instead of just pointing and laughing at the errors of one person.
Too bad the rest of the bosses are not as responsive. Kinda lazy on Blizz' part considering it doesnt take that much work to come up with several lines for each boss.
You don't understand. The science modules did not have to go with, even if you didn't bring a scientist.  Any kerbal can approach a science module and remove the data rendering the science part inoperable.  This is very important for long duration missions because it saves a lot of mass.  
I have the argon oil one for my 2B/2C hair and I love it. If you put it in when your hair is a bit drippy, it spreads better. You will feel like you're using too much, but it's not. Then let the gel cast set while you diffuse or air dry. Once fully dry just scrunch out the crunch and it will hold all day. 
Ain't that the truth?!?!  My Ngrandparents were wealthy and tried to control everyone with money. Friends and family. Of course friends came and went very quickly. They died with no friends and very little family who cared. Zero worshipers. 
Somewhat similar to your story. Had a gf that said she doesn't do bjs. When I was in the process of dumping her she randomly started giving me bjs out of nowhereBluepill me had no idea why...
&gt;Implying EA as a publisher deserve any credit for the number of sales Tetris accrued.ISHYGDDT. I'm pretty sure even the KKK could publish a tetris game and it would sell in the millions. Tetris is a pretty established formula and has been for over 30 years now.

Yes. Guardian concept, or rather lack of it, annoys me. Healing is bullshit, whole idea of "mighty aegis" turned out to be a gimmick useless only in pve to tank boss skills, jack of all trades, master of nothing.If guardian does not receive interesting specialisation, I quit.
&gt;carried in their completed forms aboard larger HullsI wouldn't be surprised if this means you could unload them and then use them for escort. Maybe that means boxing up a ship with a pilot waiting in its cockpit. Who knows?
For sure man, if you ever come to Berlin, we gotta smoke up.But yeah, exactly, that's the main axiom of absurdism as I see it, freedom on consciousness, freedom to act. Oh man, I love that feeling of... you know when you have some ideas in your head but don't know how to express them eloquently? Then one day you are reading some book and find that the author is just describing what you had in mind in the most beautiful way possible. I totally recommend you to read Camus' books. Or for that matter, you could probably also enjoy Sartre's Nausea. Fucking loved that book.
I only wish it would have been Reagan, because then I could have linked an image that people would understand. :)*"I've found that when one has a difficult job to do, personal reasons can be quite an incentive."**--  You, DS9, Indescretion, s04 e04*
I don't think those could be switched. Lol. I learned cursive in grade.. 3? I had my personal finance class in grade 10. Imagine trying to teach 8 year olds about personal taxes. Lol. I mean, we probably learned about sales tax as an example of multiplication, but not income taxes. 
Unfortunately, the Bill of Rights are not rights, but instead privileges that can and have been revoked for "security" purposes.See Executive Order 6102See internment of Japanese-American citizens.
Nope.Symbiotic Titan was made by the dude who did Samurai Jack.Steven Universe was made by Rebecca Sugar who wrote some of the best episodes of Adventure Time.
People do realize that there's no shame in having your mama whoop your ass? Even on TV. It doesn't make you less masculine. Hell, grown ass men can be scared of their mothers, and it's not like you'd raise a hand to the woman who raised you.
Results? Not much if you could already do 2x20 push ups and 2x20 squats... But, I guess it's good if you want to do *something*... *anything.* You need something harder if you want results in regards to progress of some sort.  For a legit routine, look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine
I don't think they should nerf weapons unless the class as a whole is overplayed(Demo). Rather, buff the other weapons until the class has many options and playstyles.
In my opinion probably not.This is one of those fighting games that people play religiously. You'll want to play the story mode to see which character you like, however the downpour is is that the story mode gets old QUICK. People will quickly point out "You don't buy fighting games for the story mode option", however if you're new to the game and/or want to find out what characters you like the most appropriate option is to play the story mode. Which is complete shit let's be honest. 
Good article. Another group that repeatedly falls for this type of nonsense are [geologists.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/magazine/25wwln-geologists-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)They're more concerned with the rock of ages than the ages of rocks.
Not joking, once saw two OpenBSD boxes communicating routing changes by bash scripts. When people say "I have a complex setup" I now laugh knowing it can never be that bad.  
Thanks I picked it up really cheap a couple of months ago, it shoots really well. But today out on the range it turned full auto on me. Meth found the part I need to fix it. so until then it will be in my safe. 
Can you link to a replay of yours on a site like ggtracker? Given your league, I'd say MiddlingPenguin has a good guess, but a replay would help me be more specific.

I bought some bologna for the first time in forever at the store last week, and made some fried bologna burgers. Definitely not the healthiest thing on the planet, but definitely tasty! I'd go get some if I were you!
[This is the youtube version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdSsBYO1oNI). Someone put it everywhere! I can't believe I didn't see this video when reddit had a racist fit over Ferguson last year.
It's probably only PvE players because there was never any reason to have PvP content there until now. This is the first end game PVP content we've seen, and now there's a reason to form groups to smash the opposing team. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens, but I don't think finding a group will be a problem. 
I was about to... I got an offer around this past Christmas. They have recruiting for students around October or November I think. You can check it out on their websites. I remember seeing a pretty detailed schedule of the recruiting timeline. However, the big4 in HK are desperate for help and you can basically apply at anytime during the year if you have some experience. That is what I did. I applied sometime in late November and heard back from them beg Dec. there isn't really a "best time" to apply unless you're a student (in which you would apply during recruitment season). 
Same here, I've had a lot of luck with FL and okcupid (met my wife on okc, in fact). It's tough finding poly accepting folks in some areas, I'm lucky to be in an area that is much more open to that, which is super surprising since we're also the home of Focus on the Family. 
I'd go insane if I did 20...I got out a year ago after my four, and I got into dental school, which the VA is paying for.  As I said, I don't regret a thing.  I probably wouldn't have got into dental school without the military experience.  My degree was Biology B.A. with the med/dent pre-reqs completed.
You are correct! The thought of shooting a scene but having to be a mile away to do it is hilarious. Obviously it's not built for this purpose but it's a funny thought.
The question is now if this is more due to fnatic being an overall healthier team than elements. I just think it is hard to doubt that Rekkles is a better ADC then Steelback if you just look at the fnatic games from last split and last summer.
His independence is exactly what will be appealing to most undecided voters. And I think you're missing a big distinction - Sanders is running for the Democratic nod. It's not like he's just running to run - it's win or bust. He's in the race already, so just being there gives him a chance, especially against Hillary. I'm a fan of Hillary, I'll admit, but I love Bernie. He has my vote and a heck of a lot of others' votes too.
I have an ML3RC  It plays extremely well, neck profile, fret access , the works.  Pickups sound alright full but dreadful split.  Electronics feel kinda crappy (scratchy push/pull etc.)  Cosmetics aren't great, you can see a lot of tooling marks on the neck and fingerboard, and the finish isn't perfect.  IMO it's a decent guitar, but not worth the money.
In many cases, yes.But some dogs have [extreme loyalty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachikō) that lasts [until they die](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greyfriars_Bobby).
Hi! My friend and were going to start developing games as a hobby. Seeing as you are THE guy who made Deus Ex, do you have any tips for game development? Thanks! :)
That is true. However House isn't a proven pitcher being in his sophomore year. I just think if a pitcher has been struggling through all of his first four starts something needs to be done.
There are answers to all your questions.  However, it requires you to invest time in study.  If I simply gave you all the answers you wouldn't accept them.  If you really care you could look them up and have answers in just a few hours. 
Vancounver and Edmonton are probably up there too, I'd guess. But Winnipeg, unfortunately, has just developed a negative connotation that sticks with people.I mean, how many times have you told someone, "I'm from Winnipeg", and someone just looks at you and goes, "of course you are".
In the less traditional area, I thought about using some traditional mongolian music for the Unicorn clan instead of japanese stuff after I discovered Tengger Cavalry recently.It's probably too metal to use as background music, but imagine a Unicorn cavalry charge to [Tengger Cavalry's War Horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUja-wrQVgs).I'll need to look into less metal mongolian music. :)
IANAL however assuming that Rabia and Adnans brother were at one time the sole possessors  of CG files, no judge in their right mind would rule in favor of IAC. I'll let a real lawyer weigh in on the precedence of this but if there isn't a second unadulterated version of CG's records how could any judge not assume that the defendants advocates could tamper with the source material. How could anyone prove what may or may not have been in those files? 
The part where white people don't drive 30 minutes into the inner city specifically to murder black people, and vice versa. Also the part where you're likely a two-week-old Chimpire alt account.
I'd be really happy with that myself, that way 3/4 of the starting secondary is solidified. If we don't trade away our younger defensive talent that unit could finally be a beast again. Really wish JJ were still around to get a crack with these guys.
We get it. You're the Last Angry Man, standing up for democracy against an almost unstoppable tide of progress and equality. All those gay-hating, think-of-the-children No voters must be so glad you've got their backs. 
Extremely sexiness. My husband has a legit man crush on Lundqvist. Although the grey in his beard this year is a little bit of a downer for me. He needs some of that brush through beard color they keep advertising on these channels. 
That's been the popular opinion so far, that dynasties have no place in office and that we don't need another Bush *or* Clinton in office. Even Barbara Bush said, before Jeb expressed interest, that "if we can't find more than two or three families to run for higher office, that's silly, because there are great governors and great people eligible to run."
Not a teacher myself, but my middle school gym teacher once told us to divide up into teams by saying, "Beaners over here, whites over there." She was fired pretty soon after. 
Seems like a good thread to bring this up; if I am Atma/Alex grinding as PLD and I equip one Animus weapon and one Zenith weapon (Zenith Holy Shield + Animus Curtana, or vice versa) would I have a chance to get am Atma and a piece of Alexandrite? Should be easy to do since you can repurchase the i80 relic from the Calamity Scavengers in each city.

Hind sight is 20/20. You have no idea whether they are armed or not. These idiots have no idea how much they are turning people away from having empathy or sympathy for there situation. I'm not from the US, but reading about these incidents just makes me think "That's why the police beat your ass every chance they get".Seeing the brutality that the police are responsible for is just as fucked up, they are even bigger cowards then these teens.
&gt; I've been in the staff room when it's been announced that a kid has been kicked out of school and everyone has stood up clapped and whooped!Woah. What did the kid do?
Mostly Pokemon. I used to play Melee, Brawl, Double Dash, and Mario Party 5 a lot, but not so much nowadays. Been meaning to get into League of Legends, but no time. :(
So, as I understand it, you asked a question about financing but are getting opinions on your relationship and what OTHER people would or did do when buying their rings...Honey, you buy what you two want her to have. After the ceremony, after the cake has been eaten, after the guests have depart and the dress and flowers have been discarded that ring will still be on her finger (for MANY years). If it makes you two happy then it is a good use of your money. Hopefully, someone in this thread will give you some good advice about financing. 
#According to IMDB this is NOT the finale of the season there are two more episodes to go this season.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573/episodes?ref_=tt_eps_sn_mrThis is a public service announcement.... carry on with being extremely confused about this episode and wondering WTF Shonda is thinking.
it was from the standpoint of people being atheist after having been christian but that is not all atheists, which the title would have implied. it was not about any of the logical arguments or writings and whatnot.yeah, reddit is very judgemental especially atheists lol. plot twist: i'm a minister and i get judged, attacked, and harassed by the people who claim to not be judgmental
As a recent UCLA alum, I can guarantee that our stadium isn't ever half as full as the ones pictured. I'd also like to brag that I played on those courts earlier today :)
Yeah it has money wise, but it has never been where you can get more magic log killing a boss than chopping magic logs. (not including all the other drops.) So you're clearly missing the point.
Well, I look forward to playing some Smash with you in any case. Don't sweat about the name, it could mean anything as far as your teacher is concerned. 
Pick a character who you already like and who isn't terrible to play as. Maybe you're loyal to a particular series, or maybe one of the characters just looks cool. Screw around in training mode for a while until you find something. Then search the character's name on /r/crazyhand and read read read. Think about and practice the strategies you see mentioned there.But don't always play to win, either. Maybe you're just happy because you kicked a bad habit or landed a really good down smash or something. When you're sick of playing, walk away for a while.
Yeah! Though I would be looking forward to the Fallout 3/ New Vegas series that may hopefully happen. If anything, that would be a kind of bridge-gap. 
I know you've answered the previous question a few times, but never really elaborate.  What's involved in being a "head ice tech"?  Is that something you need specialized training for, or is it something that any Zamboni driver could technically do, but Bob's been here for 40 years so he just keeps doing it until he dies?
Nothing really, but it seems like once you buy on the first thing any one dose is mod them even if it is just new exhaust or removing some of the things like the throttle override and parking brake assembly, that just wind up causing headaches at some point. But for the most part I meant it is hard to find a completely bone stock one and stock parts are a nightmare to sell, heck go to a forum and try to give your stock exhaust away for free it will be more effort than it is worth.
They don't have to. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve dearth and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
When i set them as primary and secondary I get the error message "The WAN IPv6 address is not valid" and it won't let me apply the setting changes.Is there something I can put into the IPv6 address to be able to push the changes through?
It's nothing to do with him or what Kelly wants. Most of us *wanted* Mariota, but knew it was really, really unrealistic and were so tired of the hype and constant talk like it was going to happen.
an aggressive limit order. Profits are profits and waiting for a special number like 50% is great way to turn lots of winners into losers. The market only gives you so many chances to take a profit. You're lways on to the next trade. the bigger the sample size the better the results. The premium is set at entry. your profits will smooth out like a bell curve in the end.
I went to two of the shows when they toured together. Incredible. I have a couple of the videos saved somewhere but I really enjoyed this one thank you!
I think it's not about content (which there's already a ton of) but if you say open up twitch look how many people view hearth vs Hex, how many more streamers too. Blizzard has the edge with their huge following and coming out sooner, we as a community have to spread the word
The Silverstone isn't a very high quality PSU. I'd take the Leadex Gold [here](http://www.prisguide.no/produkt/super-flower-leadex-80plus-gold-1000w-220634). It's a very good PSU. You could do with 850W however (unless you are going to be overclocking/overvolting the GPU's). 
We've got programming exits every step of the way :) we're calling them "Oracle Stops" similar to how on the Oracle you can exit your color set programming after each one.
I spent about $1700 all told, but I'm in IT and it is my workhorse travel laptop. That included a pair of docks and all manner of what not with it. I live and die by this machine, so it is worth it for me. 
&gt; Yeah, that is your opinion but it is wrong.I don't think that's how opinions work. &gt; Death penalties do nothing to deter violenceThat's not the main point of the death penalty.&gt; Innocents will be executed and have been executedRaise the standards of proof then for the death penalty. A the very least, the death penalty is good in theory. In practice, there are many murder trials where it is pretty clear who the guilty party is.&gt;Until people realize that we are supposed to have justice system and not a revenge system, the US will continue to be a laughing stock of the first-world in many things including the practice of executions.How is executing someone after due process and years of appeals considered "revenge" but locking them up for life is not? Losing your own life after you take another is a pretty clear case of justice. An eye for an eye. 
I am honestly blown away by how miserable so many people think law school is. Sure it is stressful (particularly 1L year), but I didn't find it to be any different than undergrad. 
In your list of requirements you forgot skill and pride, nice work.. and the 'We Recycle' sign really makes sense in the way you reused what may have otherwise been waste.Now wtf is the garbage bag thing? Never mind, pretty sure I don't want to know..Up vote for coming to your senses on the roof issue, am sure the tenants will approve as well. Generations of them.
And if it finishes level it's a draw not a tie, they're boots not cleats, its a shirt/kit not a jersey/uniform, and there's no S at the end of 'offside'
I played that game after playing extensively the earlier Lucas Arts "Battle of Britain" flight combat sim. It's a strange feeling looking back at the sparse pixels. BoB was 16 color; SWOTL had 256!
My book group is split down the middle on this one, so I'm hoping you can answer it. Are the parallels between Arlen and Jesus intentional? (We see him as a youth, then a large gap until he's older. He's the "Deliverer" a religious figure.) Is he meant to be the second coming of Christ? Were your trying for religious undertones, or just borrowing? 
The only law I know of is about the legitimate reason.  If you use your knife and arrowhead for your work, and can prove it, you're good.  And if it's a non-threatening knife, most of the cops will probably let you go.  Here in france the only law about knives is : sharp things are not allowed.  I still carry my crkt K.I.S.S. everyday, and twice I got pulled over because of it, once by a cop, once by a mall security guard. Both times they let me go and all the cop told me was "don't flail it around".
Yeah I noticed in 2013 when he had a bad season at the plate he looked tense batting. Then last year he was killing it until late August/September and he looked much more relaxed. Now he looks tense again and it just seems like he's trying too hard to hit one out.
Never would've thought I'd see Blue Streak getting discussed on reddit.  Loved this movie as a kid and I'll always love how he accidentally wowed the entire police force at every turn.  Of course it's dumb but this'll always be one of my favorites from when I was little. 
Alright, I ran the ping test on my wife's laptop, and the ping was way better. It was almost always 34-35, but the highest it went was 120, once. The ping spikes on my laptop were up to 500 ms.[Here are the inSSIDer results](http://imgur.com/pmcjMsj). I had changed channels to channel 3 on another person's suggestion.I take it that this means there is a problem with my laptop adapter?
Yeah I tried editing my comment but I'm on mobile. I just figured people would assume I meant that he Fucked a chick anal and then she sucked him off. But this is the internet where if someone can try to make you look stupid then they will.
It's true - all the cool kids are doing it. And when has peer pressure hurt anyone, really?Now if you'll excuse me, Jimmy Henderson is jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge, so it looks like I'll have to go too. Thanks, mom.
They have a system where people can donate on the Nexus. But people don't donate; like Robin said in the discussion, the donations modders receive are very minimal.
Shiro's Chimera. Halp me. I love the colour so much but cannot get it to work. I've tried patting, swiping, primer, bare skin, and I can't get it to apply evenly - some patches are deep, dark grey and some patches are light taupe/silver, whatever I try. I love it so much but I cannot justify keeping it unless I find a way to make the damn thing work.
I like "this is wrestling" when it isn't over-used (as in, chanted during more than one match per show) because it's a nice little nod to what fans want between those ropes.
That's a damn fine amp.  Same spec as the 360.4 .. I've run 3 different versions of that Zapco powerclass over 15 years (AG, REF, DC) .. Bridges 180x2 watts of A/B goodness.
Ok agreed but have you seen EoE?edit: I guess if you consider the TV ending the "ending", then yeah it is pretty bad. I personally consider EoE the ending but i can since the literal show's ending was those last 2 episodes I can see where you've coming from.
Something something vomit something go home with ugly stranger something something buy crack something urinate on the carpet something something wake up in the psych ward. This was not only one occasion.
Combine pushy sales people with a mysterious filtering algorithm and there will be people who are absolutely, swear-to-god certain that Yelp is fucking them over.  Most of the time I see "proof" of this posted on reddit, it is some family restaurant with a bunch of filtered 5 star reviews from users who have reviewed nothing but that restaurant.
Well it's not fraud if you aren't lying so just don't lie and you'll be fine.  Also, I'm pretty sure that most of the colleges have a VA office that I found very helpful for transitioning from the military to college.
I'm a relatively new knitted and I love this pattern, but seed stitch is impossibly slow-- flipping the yarn back and forth.  Do you know of a tutorial on how to do it faster?  Or do you just get better with time?
The new multitasking screen I don't like, I do like the subtle design tweaks though (Im a web designer, so it brings it up to whats currently "standards" for design), I suppose sense 7 will make a big difference though. What interface do you use... I use to be into launchers but I got sick of them. 
Sit her down, tell her you have to talk to her. Make her feel as comfortable as you can and then just tell her that you want to end the relationship. You still love her and care for her but you can definitely see you two are different people and that you two probably aren't meant for one another (word this differently i'm just trying to get the general guideline of what you should say). That out there there is someone who is way better for both of you and since life is so short she deserves someone who matches her better than you do. Tell her she deserves someone who can make her happier than you will something along those lines because of your feelings that have left you or something. Tell her she is someone you will remember forever and that you will always cherish the memories you had with her.Word it however you want but there's a fairly good template to let her know it wasn't her fault and just remember to avoid cliches and to leave her a better girl for the next guy.
Kubica's crash in Montreal and Senna's crash were somewhat similar, and the fact that Kubica came out with essentially only a twisted ankle is amazing and shows how quickly the safety technology developed in the years following that weekend.
You're both wrong, but mostly you are.  Communication is an interaction between two people, and both sides have the responsibility to ensure understanding between them.  That means that you have the responsibility to use appropriate language and tone, and he is responsible for interpreting the words with the knowledge he has of you.  However, it has to start with you, because what you say and do is the only way he has to understand you.Of course, it largely depends on exactly what is being said - a detail which is notable by its absence, by the way - and how it is said.  If the only things you ever say to him are criticisms of every little detail of what he does, then yeah - he's pretty justified in feeling attacked.  If you're just mentioning that the green dishwasher powder works better than the white, then not so much.You are responsible for getting your message across to him, and doing so in a way he can understand without an undergraduate degree in DDgun99ology.
Interesting. Do you need to apply Rend during CoE rotation to receive the bonus for the full 15 seconds, aka Snapshot? Or will an already applied rend start ticking higher for 4 seconds during the CoE activation?
&gt;Forcing me to watch these over zealous intros is the same as having credits at the beginning of a movie that you can't fast forward through.Yup, and neither is going away. You're buying someone else's creative choices, not "the best gaming experience possible"; and those choices are almost invariably going to include splash screens in games and trailers in movies.The Idle Thumbs podcast had a pretty good discussion from a dev's standpoint [about Alien: Isolation's splashes.](https://youtu.be/fgoFIiz4Rhw?t=2290) Link is to a youtube timestamp of the discussion.
&gt; Googles data and services CAN be copyrighted, and patented.Google services are actually available to licensees regardless you use Google Play APIs or not. They have separate APIs available for those purposes, and have been widely used on Windows phone since inception. Microsoft could then make API wrappers that mimic Google Play APIs to access Google Apps API legally.
Why would you even get a Windows phone? It seems there is absolutely no actual advantage over android, so unless a person is required for work (somehow?), there's just no reason to get one. Especially considering how small the market is, and how little software is available. 
Vimpelcom was trying a power play with the Canadian gov't. They basically said if you won't let us own the company outright, we won't invest, thinking Industry Canada would fold. They didn't, and here we are. 
&gt;You will be the kid at the party that didn't have a slice of cake because you wanted someone to ask you why you aren't eating cake.What?Is this a thing?
I want to agree with you but whenever my girlfriend says she's "so in love with me" I just have to reply with "So, love has blinded you?!"Personally, I think that scene should have come after the opera scene, had the opera scene been a shakespearian style ye olde epic (though I guess talking during would have made Palpatine a bit of a jerk, huh), and had Anakin and Padme make fun of the dialogue in that style. But I digress, grrr prequels, much hate, throw rocks and big pointy sticks, hammer large pieces of crooked wood on all the windows!
It's really not different. The difference is that some of the more crass mysteries of magic have slowly been revealed by science. Throwing fireballs is really easy with the right "witches brew." 
I would like to circle back to the witness who told police he saw a suspicious person near the burial site during the correct time frame, and was ultimately dismissed as being irrelevant. That's beyond belief IMO.
&gt; As another has said, this might be more of a case of poorly worded/unnecessary criticism than sexism.I am going to disagree with you here. Under no circumstance is suggesting that the authors bring on a male co-author to tone down possible ideological assumptions not sexist. That just isn't ok.Maybe the reviewer didn't mean to be *deliberately* sexist, but their attitude is certainly such that it suggests that s/he thinks men are less ideological than women.&gt; the manuscript in question was not a scientific paper, but more of an opinion pieceI hadn't seen that -- can you point me to a reference to that effect? My impression was that the authors were conducting survey work to understand the frequency with which men and women scientists have co-authors on research papers and how that impacts on their careers.
I don't understand how you don't see thisHe didn't say he looks for people who *describe* themselves as overachievers, he said he looks for people who **demonstrate overachieving** at something.
hey, someone HAS offered 50, but since they haven't linked me to their spreadsheet yet, if I prefer your collection better, I'd be very happy to make a deal with you :) 45 shinies, correct?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union#ReligiosityNorthern/Western Europe is between a third and 18% religious. Though it's not a majority, i'd certainly not say it's a real minority.Similarly, the percentage professing some level of spirituality, when combined with religiosity, still outnumbers atheism for the most part, so I'd argue feeling in northern and western Europe is not laughing at the religious. Anecdotally, as a resident of the UK, it's quite rare to be ridiculed for my own faith.Also, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium are hubs of the scholarly study of Christianity (a community of which I am a part). For good scholarly research to take place, an outlook of ridicule is generally discouraged, otherwise you end up with unscholarly twaddle like *The God Delusion*.
I don't know what it is, but something about this image caused my eyes to report that this was a very elaborate clarinet, and he the world's most badass clarinet-playing motherfucker.
i forgot to mention this has been happening all week long since playing with my buddies. shotgun death after shotgun death. it's getting to the point where i rather be killed by hackers just to break the pattern. and its funny cuz some of the players are using esp and no-clip as well as the shotty. becuz you are that terrible at this game you need hacks and the most op gun in the game. ffsi would be fine dying to it ever so often but 4 times in less than 10 minutes is just fuckn absurd. i might as well be playing mw2 or some shit. guns, especially high tier weapons should be RARE. PERIOD. high tier ammo should be RARE. PERIOD. not fucking craftable like it is now. smh
Done, for misc. team. Looking forward to the post:&gt;After that, a new post will be made with official teams and objectives.Do you know when we can look for this? Can applicants be notified directly?
How do these people become top mods of so many subreddits? How do people become mods of popular subreddits in general? It's crazy to think one guy is in charge of so many subreddits, and he barely has to do anything. 
We've only ever bought larger amounts. Our first trip we just pooled money with several friends. Last time we bought for the whole week. Got about an ounce of mid grade for around $100-120. I honestly don't know how easy it would be to find smaller amounts???
I HAVE A [MASSIVE ARSENAL](http://24.media.tumblr.com/a833ace484d4c85f4b599b726985bded/tumblr_mxet6qeISE1qzew87o1_250.gif) OF [OVI GIFS.](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lxunt8NpwY1qbeorio1_250.gif)
My thoughts are that any conversation about the specific situation and n Baltimore is going to devolve into useless reactionism.  If you haven't been talked ng about issues like poverty, race, police behavior, the drug war, inequality prior to this, you probably won't be talking about it afterwards either. 
Goddamn I really like Pedro. I remember going apeshit over the Zimmer incident at the time but the guy really is a great personality and a hell of a pitcher. Those were golden days to be a Yankees or a Red Sox fan. 
Three phase is smoother and more efficient to wire. It is almost always preferable when available. However, I find your explanation a little misleading because you have to look at the power delivered over time- the fluctuations in single phase voltage are accounted for in the meter. Can we use smaller motors, conductors? Yes. Is there some windfall because three phase is always delivering power? Not really.
I had a hard time justifying the price for a Milwaukee. When I was at Home Depot, I found out they have a General Contractor tape. Essentially it is a fatmax but I like the simplicity of the ruler on the Milwaukee better. 
&gt; this is partially why i believe geoff wants shorter LPs. but also, i dont think this is a bad thing. i personally dont watch all of RT content (at least not what you included) simply because i do not enjoy all of it. as im sure others feel the same. this then puts the question of "is this popular enough to keep putting out?" which is something we cant really answer.This is why I love Funhaus. Their videos are just long enough that I feel fulfilled in watching them, and every bit of it is hilarious due to their editing style.
But there isn't really a unified set of beliefs or practices.The closest think is the strainer thing, but conspiracy theorists have the tinfoil hat thing going for them, and that doesn't make them a religion. 
I was wondering what you were referring to.  Those are safety glasses used for dangerous environments (construction, lawn care, etc.).  I think they came with that strap. 
I really hope that pick 18 takes the entire time to pick their pick and that number 16 is something super boring so that we actually get talked about and get to see highlights of our guy. I feel like we always get fucked. Excepting a certain Hawaiian.
Before you do anything on social media it would be good to first figure out your target audience. Then create a brand that caters to your target audience. Treat this kind of venture like the business that it is. Setup things like you would for a business. Figure out your purpose, your target audience, what you want to achieve, then create a brand that includes everything needed to accomplish those things.  
Slightly above your budget, but what do you think of [this](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-14-2560x1440-WQHD-IPS-Intel-i7-4600U-8GB-256GB-SSD-PC-/161684418219?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item25a5246eab)?
I'm talking on Roman Catholic sense here, and no where in the dogma does it say that.In fact, here's how it goes.Do you believe in the One True God, Creator of Heaven and Earth?Do you do good works?Do you ask for forgiveness when you sin?Jews believe in the one true God, as do Muslims. But with Francis, we are kind of moving away from the "Do you believe in God" prerequisite.

I give the same advice to this question every time-Make a formal written letter. State exactly what you want. Show your understanding of the procedure. Explain why other options are not right for you. Indicate that you understand this procedure is permanent and not to be considered reversible. Print it out and sign it by hand. Keep a copy for yourself and insist they keep the original for their records.
Maybe you're missing the point... I know, for a fact, that there is another album with multiple pics of a different girl in that outfit. This isn't a guess, I've seen the album multiple times. Also, I'm pretty sure the  "yellow shade of paint" is just the white balance being off and no where did I see the wall stop in any other pic. Even if it were many homes also have those. I'll update when I find it.
so you dont wanna get slapped around???i would be more than happy to when the draft is over. bout 2 hrs. message me if you want it. u'll realize real quick how shit u are lol
She might move into the UFC's top 5 briefly with good booking and a little luck, but I don't see her becoming top 5 on any reputable ranking source.  I just think she has almost no chance against Gadelha, Esparza, Tecia, or Rose.  Penne is the only top 5 I think she can beat.
The Phantom from *Phantom of the Opera*  All the girls in my class used to feel bad for him. I was just like "He tried to kidnap her and kill the other man" Like the archer meme "Do you *want* to get raped? Because that's how you get raped"
Cool! Definitely try it at least. /r/Games has been talking about the disappearance of 3D-Platformers for awhile, it'd be nice to see it come back a little.
I don't think evidence supports the claim that dairy universally causes inflammation, but I suspect it could in some people."Dairy product consumption does not exert adverse effects on biomarkers of inflammation in overweight or obese adults. Several methodologic factors and limitations among exist- ing studies do not allow differentiation between a beneficial or neutral impact of dairy products on inflammation"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/97/4/706.full.pdfDairy fat does contain some estrogen, so it could it influence testosterone and estrogen levels in the body that way but I don't know. I haven't seen much conclusive evidence on the subject.
Unfortunately, they'd have to be friendly Buddhist business owners who don't mind being vandalized, receiving death threats, and being branded as the people who hate freedom.  They would also have to be willing to hurt and embarrass potentially lovely people by turning them away and saying they are unworthy of doing business with, and I've never yet met a Buddhist who would go out of their way to hurt a fellow human, even a little bit, simply over a difference in beliefs or to prove a point.  I would dearly love for the assholes who support these kinds of laws to get a dose of their own medicine, but that would just turn the rest of us into assholes.  
My point is that _it shouldn't mattter_ if someone wants to drink coffee or smoke meth. Either way, it doesn't concern you, unless you believe it does, in which case you've got your head up your own ass.
[[Gray merchant of Asphodel]] + black stuff is usually pretty good. :PBut seriously, if you aren't already running the good old [[urborg, tomb of yawgmoth]] alongside [[cabal coffers]], you are missing out.
And yet more evidence surfaces that the term "organic" is utterly useless.  "Why can't we use more non-organic synthetic protein the obligate omnivore chickens we force to eat vegetarian against their will and still call it organic?"It's torture.  It's inhumane.  It's a *lie*.  Great job "ethical" people.
The biggest mistake is to vote for a single policy.(He's TRYING to get the support of the marijuana community. And this is politics, he could just have been doing that the whole time to try to get the votes.) Make sure that you agree with a candidate on a variety of issues before voting for them. And remain open minded. Actually research the issues you care about, including the opposition. Know what you believe, and vote that way. Voting is the biggest governmental privilege given to us as citizens. Use it wisely. 
Every action is subject to only your own thoughts and wishes. You can choose to view the world however you like based on the knowledge you have. Each mind has the ability to gain the same information as you but only you can choose the ultimate opinion of it all. The tree for example can be objectified as being beautiful or strong, but an existentialist thinker will see the tree for a tree; It has roots, a trunk, branches and leaves, each with the ability to be transformed into whatever he/she chooses, within the physical capabilities of said component. But truthfully, there are no answers that lie within the tree, unless you choose to ask questions that will provoke an answer. Same goes for most things in this world... unless you don't agree.(assuming that my understanding is what I believe it to be and assuming that this comment helps clarify EqualityMeansEvery1's assumption of their understanding of what they believe it to be haha)
My puppy has been doing great at that. Pees and even poops on her pad when left alone in the playpen, but also does it outside. I would just make sure to praise the puppy anytime they get it right.
Hello - Sheriff's Office? Yes, I'd like to report some missing items I want to claim . . . "A number of bales of marijuana were found in the area but they've not been linked to the shooting scene."
Where would they recruit for this division anyway? 7th &amp; 8th grade wrestlers? Only the hardest of the hardcores even want to watch the flyweights. Leave this shit alone. 
They're good in those contexts. It's the people who wear them on, like, a college campus or something that just look goofy. The worst are the tacticool mall ninjas in their 5.11s who are trying to pull off some sort of contractor/security look. All that does is scream "shoot me first!" to any kind of criminal.
For families and particularly kids, no one really gives a shit. They're proud of their dad.Tacky? Yes. But would I actually say something? Fuck no, they're going to see their dad. 
You'd really be willing to trade 2 1st rounders, cox, Kendricks, Bradford and more for a quarterback who still can'tMake NFL level throws? I'm not trying to start shit, it's a serious question. That's trading our future for an unsure quarterback. I think Mariota could be a great quarterback, but Bradford can too and we don't need to trade anyone else for him. 
it's no use arguing with a moron like yourself. I'm going to quickly profile you, you are a white male, with a gun in your house. you enjoy drinking a beer each night and abuse your wife. did I mention you are strongly Republican and oppose gay rights?oryou are a teenager whose parents were republicans and I don't blame you for being brainwashed by moronseither way, KYS

Keep at it! It took 3 hours but my first time in t13 the other night, my group managed to push to the storm of meracydia add consistently. Phase 4 doesn't change a whole lot so if you master the first two phases it becomes all about handling the adds right and persevering through akh morn. Trying is the first step towards your clear ^^
Meh, I don't really have any objections to people who subscribe to the [Theistic evolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution). Honestly as a doctrine it's probably done the most good in getting people to look at evolution and accept it as being true.
They are pricy but those Karuna ones are heavenly. I haven't tried a ton of other masks yet, but even getting the cheap ones on Amazon, I may splurge in a pinch when I run out and am waiting for a shipment.
I just finished Gurren Lagann this morning. Most likely starting Rolling Girls or Tamako Market tomorrow, and marathoning Girls und Panzer on Saturday.As for current season stuff, I'm watching Nisekoi:, Danmachi, Plastic Memories, and my personal favorite, Hibike! Euphonium
Wii Fit, and Lucario. The only reason people don't like gold mario is because they don't understand what it means to own a golden statue of the most popular videogame character of all time :/
Not necessarily. A lot of stuff in Star Wars is no longer canon including the KOTOR games. The validity of SWTOR in the new canon is, by extension, unknown. Most likely, it's not canon.Only the 6 films, The Clone Wars cartoon, Rebels, the NEW Marvel comics, and the most recent SW books starting with A New Dawn are canon.
I think you understand my comment, and the comment before me.  The guy basically said that third party sites created by the community are better than just a board of names.  But LFG sites are just boards of names.   So I had know idea what the fuck he was talking about.   In fact it was absurd. 
I see. I was guessing of running few quintet walls can go well with Cider for instant 6+ soul charge but it is rather quite difficult to pull off and yeah, with the current clans with GB and strides, Quintet walls are more likely being opt out in many decks. They even gave Quintet walls an R rarity for the upcoming GBT-02 set.I won't mind having few quintet walls tho, budget-wise that is.
yeah, trading is about as fun as a brick to the skull. But when you can make 6 mil an hour, double what you can anywhere else doing anything else, it's hard to resist using it to fund your toys...
Why would anyone say no to this? We get 2 new characters! We get Banjo, who we've wanted for a while, and Master Chief, another iconic gaming character that could have a pretty cool playstyle. You may not like him, but you don't have to play as him. A top pick character and a somewhat weird pick character is better than none at all.
There is 0% chance you could EVER pick sports bets at 58%.Elite, full-time sharps who bet sports for a living and have the ability to move lines hope to bet at around 55%.
That's very impressive actually. So are you able to ship anything you buy online straight to Amazon, or do you have to still ship to your house for labeling?

Why would you stream to your computer if it was really just mirroring the XBox system? Not being a naysayer, I'm really questioning what this is good for? I understood how cool it was if you could do something on the XBox and something different on the stream, but this just seems like a way for people to stream to a laptop while the take a poop, but that's what Reddit is for.
I thought the shooting gameplay in Watch Dogs was really fun, and the ctOS in general was a really cool idea, but there better be some improvements up in this bitch.
Torp looks really cool when it fires - glowy blue and white ball of energy - looks a bit like the projectile for Emp Probe or Scramble Sensors - unstable, stormy.
yeah, don't wind yourself up too much - all the anecdotal feedback in the world will still tell you next to nothing about what *your* experience will be.  The closest you can get to an actual useful prediction is asking your biological mother what her experience having you was.  Even then, it's something of a shot in the dark.  You'll be okay.  Most of us get through this stuff and we do it by taking things moment-by-moment.  If you try to shove a whole steak down your throat at once, you're going to choke.  If you take bites and manage it piece by piece, that fucker doesn't stand a chance.  Feel me?And just to add to the pile of useless anecdotal feedback, prior to 4 cm was like period cramps in waves for me.  Not like super fun but also totally manageable, and a hot shower took the discomfort away completely.
Even if a relationship ends in good terms, you want to feel safe and have someone to vent, and take some time to get over the ex. If I date them, they will have one less person to hang out without feeling awkward and such. 
&gt; Skill Gems&gt; No suggestions here!Wut? The skill gem rewards are the single biggest issue with beta right now... they're plainly broken... I've been offered 2 flameblasts and 2 groundslams from a single quest as a templar, offered no movement gems, very few core support gems... I know they want us to test the new progression but without the gem rewards being completely unfinished that's pretty hilarious.
Absolutely. I just get pretty distracted easily. There are so many great games I haven't completed simply because of my own attention span. I just want to give them another chance.
Here's the thing. You're not apart of the Red Sox Front Office(presumably). You don't know your record by the trade deadline. I've seen moves which made no real sense to me. If Betts does end up in Philly you're gonna look really dumb. Or at least feel cheated. Either way I don't rule anything out. It's a fair deal IMO.

If they were in their jdub uniforms (men: off the rack untailored suit. Women: ankle skirt and blouse) I'd ask what church they were from, and then announce that their rude behavior turned you away from talking to them again. Hit them where it hurts. Their imaginary image of themselves
The TL;DR is TLDR; An insatiable urge came over me to suck cock, any cock, anywhere, anytime, just give me a dick in my mouth and let me listen to The Miracle on repeat. He just put it at the front because it wouldn't be useful at the back.
Hispanics are the warmest couples on the planet, I swear. I've never known any other people as public about their love as my people. It's a blessing and a curse.
I do 4 shakes a day bro, get on my level.All kidding aside (I do have 4 daily fwiw) and to answer your question:* Salami/Pepperoni* Jerky (buy in bulk, or make yourself)* Nuts (almonds especially)* Protein bars (I'm partial to quest being on keto, but metrx is supposed to be good, and pure protein too)
HAHA that's exactly who he is named after. Funnily enough...Scooter was almost an Ellie until I had him probed.   I've decided to name all my hoggies after BL2 characters once my collection grows a little more.
Well, then we could also say that Messi should never win a header over my Chiellini, but he sometimes does. That's how it works. I actually have really hard time recalling my Evra being as fast as Bale to be honest, yes they get a slight pace boost, but if they didn't it would make the pace even more overpowered.And please don't tell me that his Sau is always going trough your TOTY Silva and Luiz like a breeze all the time. We both know it doesn't happen verytime. Whenever i face some1 with those two at the back i really have hard time going past them, unless it's a race towards the ball, then ofc they can get outpaced. 
B'more's not bad, barricaded my door the other night. Reports were showing events coming closer, but light of day proved otherwise. Any thoughts re: licenses? My home base is a compact state (unknowingly lucked out), but I'm looking at all the areas I want to get to and questioning if I want to go through all the bureaucracy and paperwork. Same with checking out a different company.
Disclaimer: I'm a smoker, and I read the thing, so it obviously doesn't work for all.It focuses on the ways that you are rationalizing smoking ("nicotine brain"), and that the feeling of need and fulfillment surrounding smoking are not real, as you can only be as satisfied by a cigarette as a non-smoke is without one. It's a mind over matter thing, and I found it inspiring and helpful, but I'm still fighting the fight.
You and I know that, but to them we're the ignorant ones. As far as they're concerned, our knowledge is no match for their faith. They can use that exact phrase exactly the way I stated it, and it would make as much sense to everyone that believed the way they do.Use that big brain of yours to put yourself in their shoes and tell me it's not exactly the kind of thing you'd could hear a diehard fundamentalist say with absolute conviction.
thank you for clarification, I doubt my isp is at fault here, more likely my lack of understanding the UI.I get that manual dropping is superior to autodrops, believe me I learned it the hard way when the guy dropped on my kawachi literally 1 km away from the ship leaving me with nothing to do but eat the full spread. So I said okay, let me try the same. Well easier said than done, because for some unknown reason the edge of the dashed circle is not the exact point for the start of their run. Occasionally it will also randomly turn the manual drop in some random direction for no reason (my guess is it somehow locks on and tries to do an auto drop with correcting for target velocity which ends up wrecking the drop anyway)....eh, never mind my wall of text, I'm rambling. I understand how it works in theory but when it comes to executing in practice the controls are just so imprecise that it's frustrating the hell out of me. more practice needed I'm guessing
For slightly more clarity, the console showed that a calculation was done which seemed to be some kind of time calculation multiplied by my Soul generation, which was negative at the time.
WINDOWS PHONE UNITE! Really wish they release top-tier windows phones outside of the US... The only available Windows Phone in Rogers was the Lumia 830 (Fantastic phone, just wished for a 1080p screen and a better CPU and more RAM) 
I'm okay with poor people spending their money on things that make them happy (breast augmentation, video games, cars, the like). Reddit seems to believe that you have to make a certain amount of income before you are allowed to decide how to spend your money.
Bombed an Econ test. Not too worried, since the worst grade's dropped. Talked with one of my best friends from back East for a solid 2 hours which was great since I hadn't heard from him for quite some time. Getting a stuffy nose. Decided to participate more rather than lurk. Possibly going to make a new account soon-ish.
Blue Origin isn't exactly generous with information. Most likely, they didn't want their competitors to know that they were working on a methane engine and didn't announce the BE-4 until after SpaceX described the Raptor as being methalox. Don't take my word for it: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BE-4)
Where I do agree with you, I also feel as a soon to be teacher that the teachers shouldn't bottle up these thoughts and spout it out when they can. Instead they should be genuinely concerned for some of them and focus a bit of their efforts to mentoring them a bit more. 
In general, the current shingles vaccine only reduces the chances of getting shingles by about ~50% (and if one gets shingles with it there is ~60% reduction in the chance of postherpetic neuralgia).  So, like DrTestificate stated, she may have been destined to get shingles and she was one of the unlucky ones.Some people do get a shingles-like rash near the site of the injection.  Did she get shingles where she got the shot or elsewhere.
true...and that's why democrats are un-American IMO. Al-gore with Al Jazeera, Obama cozying up to Iran and Cuba, allowing Mexicans to cross the border for vote with your hand out democrat votes.... yes..  they are the un-American party by far
I sexually identify as a Navy Seal. Ever since I was a child I dreamed of being the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. People say to me that having over 300 confirmed kills is impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a secret network of spies trace your IP right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. From now on, you're fucking dead, kiddo. If you can't accept me you need to check your gorilla privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

It's saying that someone is more evil if they're less evil and gradually become a little evil then someone who is pure evil. It makes no sense because you're either more evil than someone or you aren't, it doesn't matter if you were good to begin with.Someone who quickly become evil from a young age, perhaps because of upbringing or a traumatic event, is still more evil than a good person who slowly starts to do morally questionable things.
Yeah I don't even live in the same town anymore and am only FB friends with him. I guess the flip side is that I am apparently an alpha female? Or something.... 
Not my argument. It was used by Malcolm Fraser, PM of Australia during some of the Vietnam war, (http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rn/podcast/2015/03/lnl_20150320.mp3) mostly WRT Indonesia.
Make an appointment with your Headmaster/Principal. Ask for their advice on how to handled this. Be truthful about what happened. Then follow the advice and let the rest of the year play out.
Um, why do you think that matters? It wasn't ILLEGAL for them to give them the money. That was their CHOICE. They CHOSE to discriminate against people who 'were criminals'. They were not legally obligated to.And for the record I am 100% pro-gay rights. I just also happen to be 100% Business owner rights. In the government, they should not be allowed to discriminate against gays etc, however a business owner should have the right, and if enough people really don't want businesses doing that thing, the business should fail that way.
Everstones pass down the holder's nature, not IVs.The destiny knot passes down 5 IVs, but it's random from BOTH parents, not just the one holding it. Alas, getting a 6 IV isn't as easy as breeding a perfect Ditto a couple of times.On the plus side, the effect it has on the end stats isn't that much, so it isn't really that important unless you're playing competitive where every single point counts.
I believe the technical name for what Kennedy's doing is REVERSE racism. It's a thing, look it up and educate yourself LMAO #serenachachaAlso, Kennedy is the worst, but this is not as bad as that nazi bitch Sharon.
Well yea, its the watermark for the free site. The point is you are making comments on things I've already pointed out in my post. These are things I already know. I wrote specifically what I was looking for comments on in my post.
Huh? I guess, yeah? Doesn't really bother me either way honestly*She gives a shrug as she rights herself, the last of the books having been put away*~Fuckin' queer~... Sorry
&gt;Bale is not worth £100m in any sense.that doesn't matter. he's one of the best wingers in the world so they'll pay whatever is necessary to buy him. it's the real madrid way of football.
How is IGN still going on about this game? how can they have been playing it from day 1 and STILL playing it... it was an interesting game at the start but it had absolutely no content... 
YEP.Knew someone in college who was almost raped and called both police and campus security. Campus security got there first, and spent several minutes telling her how stressful and terrible a police investigation would be for her, and so she should just let them handle it so she didn't have to go through that. (Of course, if it's not reported to the police, they don't have to put it on the crime statistics they post for parents of incoming freshmen...) She pretty much told them to fuck off, but it's always made me wonder how many other people were talked out of reporting...
I didn't mean to imply that the statement was actually petty, just that it could seem petty to think that simple accessories would make a big difference. I think Yooka would look pretty good with gloves.  His hands are already a different color, might as well give them more emphasis with actual apparel.  If Laylee is female she could probably use some earrings.  It's somewhat cliche to give bat characters earrings, but it would go a long way in giving her more character, especially since kazooie has pretty noticeable eyelashes to make her look more feminine.  If they do add something to the designs, they should be thematically consistent with whatever personality the characters might have.Edit: Donkey Kong is another good example.  He would look like a pretty generic gorilla if not for his tie.

Putting you in a match with people around your skill level. Pubs are usually very diverse in skill level, so there is usually one person dominating the entire server. Matchmaking tries to pair you against people of similar skill level so you can enjoy the game more.
There are many reasons why that won't happen.  Mostly because, since they drafted him, Mariota's salary counts against the Titans rookie cap.  The Eagles would need to draft a Titans pick at 20, then trade him (to mitigate the hit the Titans would take) and that would be insane.  
BOOBS! Having boobs is seriously so great I can just sit around with my hands on my boobs and it's awesome. Also shaving legs, then swimming is awesome but dudes can do that too.
I'm graduating college, actually. I had to take some years taking care of family matters, but I can finally move on to the next round of adult responsibility.Good luck in college! Only advice I could give is trying out new identities and personas is natural in college, just don't let people pressure you.
Never understood why people don't use that anyway. Get up to 96% chance to ignite, never have to curse, still one-shot almost all blue and white packs up to level 76 maps with a 2 channel conc effect hit.
Good luck. Is this amateur or smoker?Anyway, just have confidence in your training. All the nerves will turn into adrenaline once that bell rings (or when you take your first hit). All downhill from there bro!Lemme know how it goes haha
It is now legal to post your rsn, password, PIN, jag, and intent on a page for Turks to serve you, according to jmods inforum (Rules page hasn't changed though from "likely to be banned").This could be risky.

aww man. I thought it'd be like $150, because that's a similar price to where it's being sold at... that made it be a frontrunner with the BLU win hd lte... but now. well. Has there been an official release date yet?
sure, I know the hunt ends because of that and not just because the hunter gets kileld, but it could be that this time, the source is Mergo, while previously it was some other great being, with other stuff going on, it doesn't look like all "hunts" (if more than one) have to involve the same great beings all the times
Kerbal world is small, and the day is 6 hours long. Kerbals are smaller than humans (I guess?). So it's not awfully unrealistic, just Kerbals have it easy.Plus, with brutal rates resupply missions have to be regular, and mostly fail-free. It can get tedious for some players so I totally see why default rates are forgiving.I use x4 rates for food and water and x6 for oxygen.
Was doing some research on END and heard they don't mark down the items' value to the sale price on the receipts for customs, so you end up eating the customs fees for the full price.  Anyone know if they stopped doing this?Also could you possibly dodge fees by placing multiple &lt;$200 value orders so that they ship in multiple parcels?  I would drop a good bit of money on this sale if it wasn't so iffy on the fees that I might incur.
I saw the two candidates running for election.  I was worried to be honest.  Both seemed really bad, but Hilary would have been the lesser evil.  I'm wondering if there is hope if this guy really is what he claims to be.
The trickiest parts I've found with self check out: bringing your own reusable bags, buying produce, buying marked down items, and buying alcohol/restricted items.There's some simple steps to avoid issues with these, but mainly,  figuring out produce was the hard one for me.  If it doesn't have a sticker on it, write the 4 digit number on your grocery list as you pick it up.  When you get to the check out there will be a produce option,  and an option to type in the code.  Then it'll ask you to weigh it,  or ask for a count.  Some produce is by weight and some is by count.  Good luck!

I mean, in this specific instance I am still correct. The exact terminology is off, but given the spacing of the card in question the new mechanic shouldn't* be on the same line.Basically, I was right, I just used the wrong terminology. I'm aware of all the specific rules an exceptions, I just didn't have the correct jargon.*shouldn't, meaning based on convention it probably should be a line lower but there's no rule saying it needs to be that way.

Isn't that frustrating? Ugh, I know that feeling. I was looking forward to getting my hard drive that never showed up. Thankfully that seldom happens but my opinion of that company is forever altered in my memory, and I will always think they are deadbeats who can't even get a fulfillment right.
Is there any way to successfully report people who are intentionally deranking on your team. i.e. 2 guys on team have script to make them go in circles to keep their characters moving.Or is the deranking issue a non issue that is just accepted in the community?
Try http://www.goodrx.com/adderall-xr/price Also consider switching to adderall IR, and consider asking your doctor if they're willing to prescribe a higher dosage for frequent use that you can split during the day over a longer period of time to take advantage of any bulk discounts. e.g. if you take 10mg twice a day, ask for 20mg 3x/day you can split in half and save a little money on but go longer between prescription fills (instead of 60 10mg pills for a month, get 90 20mg pills to last you 3 months).

I'd suggest starting with 4 grams, and add one gram per hour if you don't feel anything. Dose on an empty stomach and maybe drink a hot beverage after to help break down the capsules. 
I love my 8. It's got it's downsides for city riding (as does *any* inline 4) with it being a little... tempermental at low speeds, but once you get the revs up above 6k, it's got great power. One thing I'd recommend for the low-speed stuff is a G2 throttle tube with a wider cam (to make the throttle more controllable at low throttle positions), and a fuel controller to increase fuel at low rpms (and to trick it into thinking the throttle is open all the time so it doesn't cut fuel and give throttle snatch). It's light enough (for me) to be comfortable, and with a few upgrades, it's actually not a bad sport tourer (I've done a few 2000+ mile trips on it). It's a good bike, but needs some serious upgrades to make it a *great* bike (mostly suspension, fueling, and brakes). 
If you watched the entire set that was linked you would see that the WFT didn't over-rely on the move at all. It was mostly used for recovery from below the stage and horizontally while he also added a lot of mix-ups when recovering from above the stage. At this point in the set the other player probably just lost his nerve from losing the past two games in a pretty one-sided fashion.
While I can't consider you "plus" at all, I agree with everyone else that you have a wonderful shape! Like, "yes trainer, of course I will tell you my goals while doing these fucking burpees" great shape =P keep on keeping on sugga!
I didn't see anything in this article that is cutting edge to the rehabilitation community. And the reason some of them aren't used in therapy (e.g. TCD stimulation) is because there is not sufficient research to determine efficacy and safety.

What use are these "generalizations" and "trends", most of which are very weak correlations, in interacting with women on an individual level for seduction purposes?Of all the poor logic in TRP, this is probably the most perplexing to me. Your entire approach to what you are ostensibly trying to do is completely wrong. The study of general trends in social behavior is only useful to those who are looking to manipulate large groups of people, like governments and advertisers. An average dude looking to get a date or hookup is interacting with women on an *individual* basis, and thus needs information about the specific *individual* being seduced, and the context of that individual's environment, in order to craft a successful seduction strategy. In other words, the intellectual skills required are closer to those of field anthropologists and not of biologists or statisticians.

**Concept Name:** [The Horror](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotaConcepts/comments/30njt7/the_horror/)    **Reason:** If I had to choose my favourite Gimmick concept, that'd be like choosing my favourite DotA hero.

I think it's the other way around. People with high elo spend time in this sub. Its like entering a hospital and asking why there are so many doctors around.

If you want to invent a new language, you write a compiler for that language in another language that already exists.  Once that compiler is stable enough, you rewrite it in the new language and use the previous compiler to compile the new compiler, a process known as bootstrapping.  From that point on, you use the existing version X of the compiler to build the next version X + 1, and you can discard the original compiler written in the other language.  The result is a language and a compiler written in that same language.C's original compiler was written in assembly before it was bootstrapped.  And the assembler was written in machine language, which is a direct expression of machine instructions and doesn't need a compiler.
Thank you! I will give those a try. What are some of your favorite snacks to help you stay full throughout the day, while getting in those healthy calories?
good question. i haven't found any indication that there is any interaction between them. i have found a few folks recommending taking nootropics *instead* of SSRIs, because they work better with less side effects. also worth mentioning that 5-HTP is another option there.
Small changes in your input delay from lag game to game can make a big difference. The sluggish games are just usually slightly laggier. Just not directly noticeably.
You've said yourself that you haven't introduced yourselves yet, so I'd go about it as if you're meeting him in any other context- "Hi, I'm RockinSocksReborn..." will usually be answered with an introduction of his own.If he is taken aback by the introduction and doesn't respond with his own name, you can take a leaf from the book of tryin'-to-be-cool males everywhere and pull off the good ol' casual "Hi, I'm RockinSocksReborn [a brief pause...] You're SeldomSeven, right? I sit, like, three rows behind in Math ..." Guys do this to come off as "not a stalker" - you can do it too ;)

Awesome to hear! I am hooked on RTA's and think this will be perfect. My KFL+ is a daily user at work. Have a Goblin and Lemo 2 at home. LOVE the Lemo 2 (just got it today and haven't put it down).

I've purchased A LOT of Apple products the past 11 years, and I would say that amount of lemons I get is about consistent. They've always been out there. 
But the sellers wouldn't raise the cost of the goods at. 1:1 ratio. Part of the cost of the goods goes towards the minimum wage employee, but a large part of it comes from material costs, non minimum wage employees, foreign trade, etc. so the amount of money put into circulation would be more than the inflation. Rich people don't want it because their salaries won't raise in comparison. So while the price of the goods increases, their salary won't. Plus, the money going towards poor people would be immediately circulated back into the economy, finding its way back to the employer.

So if you are saying tech jobs are better why don't teachers get a job in tech? Because they can't because they don't have the skills.

Why does it matter unless you were the one to have married them and didn't know? And even then, if you don't want kids and were attracted to them the whole time, does it *really* matter that they were once a different gender? (I realize many people would have a reaction to not having been told, but is it rational? I don't think it is)
its something iv always done with others, im finding myself speaking to a lot of people on Facebook right now, like people who i haven't spoken to in years ad were getting on realy well which is cool, going to get of now though and do some meditating so far it has been and an amazing night, feels good to do it at home when im not drunk or stoned.

Just book him in a serious fashion. Why is it so hard? Why can't we just see a guy we like get what he deserves? We're not asking for him to be WWE Champion. We just want him to be taken seriously. I know he's over AF but I would much rather see him in his old heel gimmick. That was much funnier than this. I JUST WANT SOMETHING SERIOUS WITH HIM. Rant over.

Old is good, in this case. :) It helps that it was played on a violin built to baroque specs, by the leader of the Irish Baroque Orchestra!ETA: And the octatonic scale simply alternates tones and semitones all the way up the octavel.

I configured my Sager np8651 for $1500 with an IPS screen and SSD. I've never reached the limit of the GPU (970m) while playing every game on max settings. It's not a feather, but it's not huge (5.4lbs, 1 inch thick)
I did that on purpose. If you hover over them the individual announcements will fully reveal. I did this because they were interfering with some of the banner images.As for updating them, I am not sure who regularly does it. I have updated the meta thread part a few times but I mainly just edit the  CSS. We've talked about trying to keep the side bar elements updated though.
Hail again :)Why would you not just build one driver and wire them all in parallel? This supports up to 20 amps. You have a potential draw of 10.5 amps with 10 of your led's in parallel.Just change the led's to a parallel configuration instead of series like shown.

Fair, I didn't read your comments outside of anger towards Texas. I just saw hate for Texas and raged back.But that's the points I wanted to make, our elected officials aren't getting it done. Republicans are getting elected because they are Republican. I'm waiting for my parents and their generation to leave the voting booth alone, they're rewarding dipshits for wasting our time, money, and are making life alot harder for people they shouldn't be messing with. Regardless, it won't hold up in court, horrible ideas get proposed and farther along in the process than they should, but this won't see fruition. I hope all this negative karma steers clear of your baby, best of luck.

I honestly don't know any names, but I'm sure you could call some of the realty agencies and ask if they have someone that would show you rental properties. Some of the realty places around here are Lindsey Realty (same as the apartments), but they might only show you Lindsey properties. There is Coldwell Banker Harris McHaney Faucette (yes that's the name of one agency, not multiple), Weichert Realtors, and Crye Leike. Those are the ones I can think of in the area. Happy House Hunting and congrats on the new job!
Hayne is mostly a returner - I doubt he sees much play as a RB.  And we've kept 4 RBs several of the last few years, so... i don't see any reason why we wouldn't.
While I think he was an awful GM, I have a hard time demonizing Hurney because he has given nothing but praise for the current staff. It's hard to hate on a guy who has been such a class act after his time here.
I'm not sure I agree with you.  You can look at their base but you can't look at their traps and CC troops.  My understanding is that when the server send this information to your client it has registered your attack to have started.
You can get a Fire Orb from Pyro lady which is nice.  And after you kill that little dude after Freja, you can go back and Great Fireball which is awesome.

Thanks to a post here, I took advantage of the Cult sale a couple weeks ago and got a great deal on those. The polishes in the second set were part of a kit so those were about 60% off as well! I found the OPI ones at TJ Maxx, and they were only $3 each.By the way, has anyone else had an issue with the caps on the Cult bottles? You can see that on a few of them the outer square cap twisted on the smaller cap inside and now it doesn't line up when the bottle is fully closed. Annoying :/
I'm not in the dextroverse at this moment, but I started out of pure curiosity. I didn't know what it was like to not be in this world. 4 years later, here I am. It has made me curious about many things, and I find myself researching string theory and possibilities of extra dimensions. I love doing too much, and dosing almost my full dose right away. I have had my best revelations in the rough come ups. I don't know what else to say, so, goodbye, fellow dextronaut.
You may be splitting hairs about spitting.  The reception of returning soldiers was met with hostility from many misguided civilians.  Mothers, students, flower-children etc. were documented in the media shouting epithets to GIs.  It's an ugly ignorance of citizens that was largely corrected during Desert Storm
I find it curious that they were able to address it (solely) server-side. I'm going to assume that ability cooldowns are "owned" by the server, and that the game UI just shows whatever the server sends back to it.
You're welcome. If this is just a mod repository where people work on different mods, I'd avoid calling it a project. For a lot of people, especially designers and developers, a project implies a single working goal or product. If it's a bunch of modders coming together to change and modify things, I'd go for using "community" instead to make it clear that these are all different mods with different designers and intents.
Cutting magic logs has always been a waste of time, like 100k/h profit, and pretty much only bots ever cut them so fuck them, screw bots.If you're a legit player well... get 72 slayer and go to wyverns. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The laws of physics apply just as much to video games as they do to real sports... That's a really strange things bring up... Also sports do change rules similarly to patches. You happened to mention Tom Brady,  someone who actually had a rule changed essentially by an incident he was involved in.Esports have some level of physical requirements, they're just a much smaller sub set of requirements. Calling them athletes is doing a disservice to those who have put in the work to run 4.16 40s and stuff but to act as though LOL Pros don't also put in work to hone skills and physical acumen us unfair. 
&gt; back. I'm not sure Reddit may be the best area for us to get specific feedback on this so we are exploring a few other methods.Judging how they handled the feedback about the PTS flight changes before they got pushed to live, it's hard to say if they even know what constructive criticism is.It seems like anyone who isn't sucking their dick or saying that the changes aren't that bad are the only people getting attention.
As a white male with an advanced degree, I won't even bother complaining about this because no one cares, including me.  I'll worry about myself and not about the system, because that's a more productive use of my time.
Smash makes me feel really bad about myself. I know I shouldn't play but I love it so much. But I get shit on by other competitive players and it really bothers me. Smash is a complicated subject...
The school psychologist said this to my brother. He graduated college and is a tv producer for major networks sports programming. People who say shot like this should not go into education.
ugh, some people are /r/eagles were actually hoping that trade would go through. I can't believe that shit, they really want to trade away Cox+Kendricks for one player..
&gt; As you can see here, % change in debt follows % change in returns..I don't really see it as a "chicken or the egg" kind of problem, but that chart clearly demonstrates that margin debt is a lagging indicator of peak SPX performance and, thus, is an accurate predictor of SPX under performance.The thing that is missing, that you can't chart, is that the current central bank policy of QE has never really been employed to the extent that is has been over the last 8 years.  And, in a more meta way, the QE policies of other central banks (Europe, Japan and China (and Russia and a few other lesser central banks) are sort of being timed to play off one another.  This could significantly reduce margin debt has hot money runs off to another stock market/central bank combination to make better returns.  That's the kind of thing that could force the FedResInk to discontinue QE and raise rates (a double margin debt whammie)
Huh? A man [born in 1972](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Gularte) would be at most ten years old in 1982.And a man born in a millionaire family would have a very good chance of getting whatever diagnosis his legal team wanted.He was just a dumb but rich spoiled kid, let's not make any mistake about that. No matter how you feel about the death penalty, this case is getting a spin that was paid for by a very rich family.
I hear it's not for sale anymore so you'd have to find someone else with a copy? But have you tried [Slasher Flick](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product_reviews.php?products_id=60714)
sry to be fair you can to get out of silver but above silver noI mean I got out of silver and I play like I have no brain, I always forget corners and rush and shit
Why not something simple like Fighter, Slayer or Ranger 2 (gets archery and  other weapon use going) and Brawler the rest of the way. You'll have tons of feats to spare. 
Oh don't get me wrong a nice tube is a nice tube. I just always try to support local glass blowers when its feasible. And thankfully I'm lucky enough to live in a town that has three nice, locally owned, head shops to choose from.
This pun was pure *gold* ^/s*you can't* make more puns because they suckYou should get **pun**ished for you shitYou should *spring* out of your seat and think what have you done
It's not even just on the court. Imagine the amount of bullshit other players would get into with that money/power/fame. LeBron's been a model citizen and hasn't committed any sort of crime in his tenure. He just switched teams.
The salt is strong but I'm glad chip didn't give into their insane demands. They're gonna still suck for a long time before they become relevant. Way too many holes on that team
Gonna have to disagree with you, when I went to college, the cliques were strong with a lot of the better looking girls. You would have lost out to a guy in the right fraternity even if you had all that.
The girl that stopped texting me for two weeks (I stopped making an effort because she didn't text back when I texted her on two separate occasions) suddenly texted me, I still have yet to figure out whether it's a good or bad thing. Mostly because I'm not sure how I feel about her myself. For something completely great apparently me and some of my friends know all the lyrics to "Never Gonna Give You Up". We shall soon be experts at reciting it at the most inappropriate times.
Well I certainly wouldn't mind people preventing it. I mean I am glad I am trans, because after being born I realize that if I wasn't it would change something core to who I am. Even if I was a cis female, and life would have been a lot better it still wouldn't be my life. I wouldn't be exactly the same. However if someone isn't born yet there is no reason to make them suffer. Their gender identity hasn't developed yet and isn't a part of them yet. All for prevention. If it were safe of course :) 
Seriously asking EME to ban a guy for trolling? I mean I understand if that person was hacking but we have like at least a hundred trolls (including me :D) in ZMR.
That's pretty incredible, to think something as advanced as aircraft were during world war 2 to be taken down by an eruption. This is close to what I wanted to find out I suppose but I thought it would be really interesting to see an actual battle happening as close to an erupting volcano as possible. What would generals do in that situation?
ah union square. happens every time one race even looks at another the wrong way. people are such self-entitled rich assholes with nothing better to do here 
To be fair, as of early 2014, electric vehicles account for [only 1.1% of Oregon's cars](http://www.edmunds.com/industry-center/analysis/drive-by-numbers-tesla-in-all-50-states.html), which is a drop in the tax bucket. Given the fact that these EVs are among the lightest cars, and therefore least damaging to our roads, I'm perfectly fine with letting them slide on the gas tax. Let those who make grocery runs in their 9mpg Hummers subsidize the EVs. 
Finally some real ideas amongst the down vote storm. In the UK cctv coverage is almost absolute - and I've read they also use algorithms to detect distressed voices etc in order to quickly notify operators. This would go a long way to ensuring public safety.
Mate what the early backers received was a little model of the Xian Khartu-al. One that you can put on your desk in your hangar ingame or something. Not the actual ship you can fly.Sometimes backer rewards are handed out during certain developer milestones. This can be some UEC, a little trinket for your hangar, a piece of personal armor, .... But always things that will also be available in the universe. So they are fun little things to get but by no means game breaking or even important.
Thanks for your input! The way you phrased it struck a chord with me (jack off all you want; don't jack off in the 'default' fashion). I guess because I don't watch porn, masturbating without porn is the 'default' for me, so I was viewing it as the default for him too, and porn is like taking it a step further from 'regular' masturbation. I'll think on this, thanks! And yeah, we're home together a lot but we're also doing our own thing a healthy amount, so if this is really something he craves I think he has plenty of opportunities to do it, regardless! 
It would be interesting to see if there were any long term studies that showed kid's developmental assessment results from age 2/3/4 compared to how they do when they're older. Do you know of any? My sense is that there are no statistics on the kids who end up doing well, because they never actually get tested again in the future once they no longer need intervention, so it's simply something that is not even measured. 
Add all ingredients except water. Fill to the half way mark in your pressure cooker. Seal and cook 30 minutes at pressure. Natural pressure release for best results. Voila, done.
This. This right here is freakin awesome news to hear (read). Still haven't seen the doc yet though... has it already been shown on HBO and/or released publicly yet?
Yeah...I'm just not feelin the IPV 4. I have a sig 150. I put it next to the Vaporflask today and it was taller and wider. IPV4 is about the same size as the sig 150 and i'd like something smaller

Fallout's example sounds like a super neat way to depict harm against children, actually. Would be nice to see that sort of in-game consequences in more recent games.
Only issue I have is that there should be different weight to the itemslying for example.  one word - one word that can create untold amounts of trouble in all areas of your life, trouble which may not be recoverable, once thought of a liar by your boss, your girlfriend, whomever how do you ever establish the contrary?Additionally great stress what did I tell him?  what if they get together and compare what I told them?  The truth makes life much easier.
They fucked up the balancing.Heroic BWL Nefarian and Chromaggus are far harder than the end boss, which is way too easy, while Maloriak is by far the hardest in the final wing, and Atramedes is a joke.

Ray gives him a cold expression, and ignores the question."Just checking something. Thanks for the help, though if you did that to get your sentence reduced I'm afraid to say I have no such power. I could put a word in with A, but I get the feeling he's preoccupied at the moment".Keeping his pistol trained at Zaeed, Ray opens up the comm line again. "This shall be my last broadcast on this comm channel unless someone responds. I need emergency assistance here. I am with prisoner HCMΔ-1610-IC, and have just been attacked by a Galen Marek Clone."The message sent, Ray turns his attention back to Zaeed. "How did you escape?"
Legally it wasn't her winnings, according to the law, which is what matters here, it was their winnings... To which she illegally hid.We do have enough info, you just choose to distort it.
Mine is  8 months old and clearly  has worked out who is fun parent. He was waking  up from a nap and we were  having  a quiet  cuddle. (Side note - aren't the  slightly  sleepy cuddles  just  THE  BEST?). Daddy  walks in and  my calm placid sleepy muffin  clapped his  hands  frantically  and started laughing  hysterically . Totally melted  daddy's  heart!
I think most adults don't understand mental illnesses much. They tend to always say things like "get over it" "it's just a phase", because that's what they were told back when there really wasn't much explanation for what we now know as anxiety, depression, ptsd and what not. Edit: By this I wish my mom knew I wasn't just faking my anxiety to get of doing things as simple as making a dentist appointment.  I wish the thought didn't make me want to cry.
Bullshit. She disrespected him by talking about how great the sex was with someone else (to the person she was fucking no less) and more importantly concealed a past relationship. It's a huge red flag, especially because she's only only upset because she got found out.
Or anybody hit by a bus, or cancer, or accidental electrocution, or live bomb in a body. Hey, have they had a biohazard event lock down the hospital yet?
I really like Wii fit, but I don't collect, so I'd prob take out of box. Sorry. But if I win, Ike would go to my friend who I think doesn't have one. Sharing the goodwill, yknow? :)
I've fallen in love with this character someone created. He unfortunately did not have any sliders, and I've been trying to reproduce this characters for 3 days since I bought my copy of DA:I. And then I finally had something close... and got stuck in the Fade bug in the beginning... So figures I'm kind of desperate... If someone will help me out with sliders I will make a drawing of their favorite DA:I character!

Well, every company follows one golden rule. Is it cheap and making lots of money, keep doing that. Is it sort of on the expensive side but still making money, ok maybe once every x months. Is it not making money? Burn that shit to hell.
Whatever team comes in first place should have their ward skin kept in store for a few weeks after the split while every other one is taken out, and the ward skin itself shouldn't be removed, because they won the split.Secondary idea would be the top idea but instead of everyone else losing ward skins they bought for teams that didnt come in first the ward skins everyone bought would all turn into the winning teams ward skin, to use or not to use.
One great thing about a painting like this: Everything is on purpose. You may have a scene in a movie that looks like this, or a staged picture, but there will be accidental things. An actor making a lazy face or a hand in any position at all. You make this painting and everything is precisely where it is because you meant for it to tell a story. My favorite is right next to the guy getting his head grabbed. The woman seems to be absently moving the cowl of the bearer in front of her to get a better view. Her face has a more curious expression than frantic or urgent like many of the crowd. She's almost a mirror of the woman on the litter. I like to think the person being carried was a decoy for the woman in the crowd, who just kind of wants to see her again to thank her for giving up her life so the other may live. 
he probably should have revealed them on fishman island. And I dont want him to change his fighting style I want him to not become useless by not evolving it. A zoan or paramecia devil fruit would help evolve his fighting style as well as the kick slashes and soru. Hell the strawhats need to continue to steal from cp9. Imagine life return monster point chopper or shigan robin. 
Like with the cage match... I was really hoping to see him be a new type of chickenshit heel, where it's what he does because it's who he is, but when backed into a corner, the old Seth Rollins comes back. Like, "yeah, I'm a coward...but you forget I'm a coward *who can fight*." 
Cacique's line goes B-C-D-DD-DDD-F-G-H, which in translates to UK sizes as B-C-D-DD-E-F-FF-G. If you're happy with the fit of your 38Fs, you'd still be a 38F in UK sized brands, though you'll need to be aware of different shapes. I've found Cacique's bras to typically to be average to narrow wire width and fairly projected in shape (except the plunges, which tend to be shallow) with a good underwire firmness.Panache tends to be about the same width or slightly wider but with much, much taller and firmer underwires. Freya tends to have softer underwires. Elomi and Goddess are often wider and more full coverage. Curvy Kate, IME as narrow and projected was a disaster.
At those rates you can pick from basically anyone in Chicago. Why risk it with the unknown?750 an hour is straight up theft and higher?The top rated lady on TER is 700 an hour. That's the #1 provider in Chicago.#7 is 400 an hour and everyone raves about her. (I tried seeing her, didn't work out.) Yet.No I won't tell you. Sign up.
I haven't seen this laid out anywhere, but I am glad too. With a little variation in the beginning and skipping a rewatch of Agent Carter and Daredevil (as I had just finished DD before doing the rewatches) this is how I went about it. It really does make sense this way. Thanks for sharing.
You will spudder around in circles and not learn much.  Sure, you may learn to play a sloppy amateur version of a song, but is that really what you are after?
I have two children and I'm not 100% sure how to do it. For now, I hide it from them but I foresee that once they are older (thinking mid to late teen) or when they start to show interest in intoxicants, I'd let them know what's going on. I like how /u/formerly_on_totse 's dad say that until he's 18, any weed found will automatically become the dad's. I'd actually tell my kids if they wait till 21, I'd buy one for their birthday if they're interested. 
Day ten in the switcharoo jungle. No end in sight. There are references flying all over the place. Provisions are being strictly rationed. I don't know if I'll ever get out of this god forsaken place alive.
No it doesn't. You feel nobody should care about giving up account security for a third party client. It has everything to do with what you are talking about. Appreciate the downvote though, truth hurts doesn't it?
Flea markets are a gold mine for classic game systems!! I bought a box full of stuff! (I.e. 2 snes's an original NES, a Sega genesis AND an Atari! Plus a bunch of controllers, and a few games for $60) garage sales are good too! 
I agree. it's difficult to feel there was not some exaggerations about the "energy" I would get this trimester. Still I'm early in so maybe it'son it's way? I may just nap until it gets here.zzzzzzzzzzzzz
TL;DR at 8:30pm&gt; Police say woman who had been placed into the backseat of police car -- already in police custody -- exchanged gunfire with officers. The incident/shooting started inside the police cruiser.&gt; The woman was detained during a stolen vehicle investigation.&gt; It's unclear if police searched the woman prior to putting her into the police car.&gt; Police were not injured.&gt; The woman is dead.
Your mom's boobs weighed 69 lbs, which she thought was 2 2 2 much, she wanted them to be 51, so she went to see Dr. X for 8 sessions, and this is how she woke up in the morning. 55378008
They're spanish playing cards. We use them in Argentina for a very popular game called "Truco". Micho and Maxi are showing monster hands, almost the royal flush of Truco.
This is a big problem in the US. People can spout all they want about cost/benefit financial projections analysis that you should have done and personal responsibility, but do we only want rich students whose parents can pay to become doctors? Or even, how financially motivated to you want your doctors to be? Looking at 4-5k payments every month for 15 years will surely have consequences. School costing that much in the first place, and the thinking that a kid should be a risky investment just the same as a business or commodity are the problems. 
I can take a photo with settings on the camera that will make the image not look like reality at all, however the image would still be unedited. Regardless, unless you are taking a raw photo the camera is editing the image for you.
&gt;  still can get you in jail. And does. Often. And aCANCAN if you are gonna quote me, dont take it out of context please ;).I agree with what alot of what you are saying, but I think we digress in that there are very few cases when I think statutory rape is "Ok".
I don't generally run Euphoria currently as it'#s pretty much negated on any fight where you're not standing still for too long - which currently appears to be a fair few of them, on top of Hellfire looking equally as movement orientated; though that's not to say there are fights where it would certainly excel.I just feel like if I'm not in Solar casting Wrath, I take too long to do any substantial damage besides multi-dotting, but gain this could simply be down to my break + being in what is effectively pre-Highmaul gear. 
Your question is based on an incorrect assumption. Scientists don't think everything they know is true. What they think is that something should be *tested* to find out if it is true.Without scientific testing all you can have is a hypothesis.
Chretien, as an ex PM, still represents Canada to people around the world and must comport himself accordingly. This being the case he should be adopting the same attitudes toward Putin and his policies as most of Canada feels. I am sure Harper represents the majority of Canadians' views in this area, but judging by Chretien's past careless regard for our feelings, he probably represented to Putin that Trudeau will be more forgiving and accepting of Putin.
Human nature is changeable.  Teenagers do not think or feel the same as the elderly.  Something changes them.Besides, you don't have to change human nature to change behavior. Human nature has many facets that can be accessed with various methods.  Designing a program with the idea of 'blacks are oppressed' versus 'blacks need to be more ambitious' is very different.The first targets the oppressors, who have little reason to change.  The second targets blacks, presumes they have power, and focuses on a population that has many reasons to change.
&gt;Yeah, I think its been shown that at best his timeline was a good five years off. All the stuff that was supposed to happen in 2008 is if you look at it like this actually starting now.Ripples man, ripples...  By coming back and commenting the way he did he changed things for us.&gt;2020 though.../me *shivers*
This kind of word is often said by children. First children learn words individually. They'll learn 'look', then they'll learn 'looked', and treat them like separate words.  Then, they learn rules, like adding 'ed' to the end of a word to make it happen in the past.Often, you'll hear kids "overgeneralize" these rules. They find the word 'looked' because that's the past tense word, then apply the past tense rule to make 'lookeded'.~This also occurs in AAVE (African American Vernacular English) as seen in your videos. I think this is the answer you're looking for.  Using this form of word can show that you're part of the AAVE community. Linguists theorize that it is a hypercorrection - an attempt to correct their regular speech to 'proper English', but overshooting the mark. [Here's my source.](http://www.modlinguistics.com/sociolinguistics/dialects/convergence%20of%20sound%20and%20meaning%20in%20aave%20language%20and%20culture.htm)
Just get them fired. I agree though. I have worked with people in the past who were always doing once off designs despite us having standards. Always call them when it's 1am and I've got an incident for their once off's. Haha. 
the difference is australia only has a population of 22~million, compared to USAs 300~million. australia is  ahead on percentage but the actual number of fat fucks is not even close.
Grew up with an old mutt named Turd.Also lived for ten years with a cat with no name. He was just "the other cat," as in "Yeah, we have two cats: Munchkin, and the other cat." His vet paperwork just said Othercat. I don't think he cared.

I took it.    Honestly doesnt seem like the questions were granular enough.    Question 1.1 when asked what program/website it didnt list any specific game collecting website.  vgdb.io darkadia.com collectorz vgcollect.com etc.    question 1.2 with the companion question on 1.3 (justify my "no", which there was "no" answer). the justifications did not make sense.    I am not satisfied with google docs because i just organize ti in pc folders? What? It would make more sense if a response was like "doesnt track prices" or "does not have custom fields". I get that you have an "other" but I would have to much to add to that.    If this information is all you need, I just feel that the data you get wont be that useful (at least from my perspective)
People said the same thing when the Legend of Zelda Oracle games came out, but they turned out to be completely different games - worlds, dungeons, everything. We'll just have to wait and see with Fire Emblem.
&gt; no one has the right to tell their own storyWell, I didn't specifically say life story "rights," simply that you need to secure the life story as in, "you're better off if you get their blessing," because while they can't stop you from presenting facts, they can challenge the presentation of such facts.  And whether the law is or isn't on their side is a separate issue from whether or not they can sue.  &gt; You can't defame if you are telling the truth, you can also not defame a dead person.True statement, hence why I made the note that OP implied the subject is still alive.&gt; if you have taken just the bare facts, that are evident in several of the biographiesThe several sources bit here is really important.  If you can't corroborate the fact with other independent sources then it creates a conundrum.
This is why I believe European authorities should allow Islamic terrorists to carry out attacks, they literally gain nothing by stopping it, compared to increased power and public support when they allow these attacks to occur. 
Pat Robertson has acknowledged that trans people exist too, although he couldn't help but go on about that stupid "boys will pretend to be girls to get into the girls' bathroom" bullshit when there was an attempt to pass a law related to that in California.
 &gt; The problem was Juve’s habit of signing players, then loaning them out for six months to other teams — exactly as happened with James Troisi.Fair call then.
If Nintendo does start selling the cards I bet they'll sell it like Pokemon cards where it's random ones in a pack but there are 10 different illustrations of each character. Obviously "rare" ones are shiny ones. Then again, I don't want to fall back into the slippery slope of "just one more pack" from my Pokemon fanboy days.
Well, 30 tons is more than you need for a 2 ton Tesla car. So using just 20 kW, which will make the car hover but not rise up, the 85kWh battery pack would be exhausted in 4 hours. Using the engine to move forwards would use slightly more power but I think we'd still get a few hours flying time using current battery tech.I doubt the engine will be that efficient... It seems too good to be true.
It's a bad, straw man argument. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from Leviticus. It happens in the New Testament too. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
i dont understand how faker is in any way related to this conversationi understand what they are trying to do, i just think its odd you drop a guy for "international success" when you havent played one international team yetand faker is the exception not the rule to pretty much everything in league of legends

I love Hardy, and he's one of my favorite actors, but I don't see him as Bond.  While he's a pretty good looking guy, he seems a bit brutish for the part.
It is. I invited some friends there, and they aren't really the type of people who indulge in any kind of "nerdy" things, so they reluctantly came along. Long story short, we had a blast, and try to do it at least once a month.

SpyFu has keyword groupie. But like Realsan said, it's not a perfect piece of software. There also exists many other free and paid (even Google has one on the AdWords site). The truth of the matter is that the human eye is best at making a decision as important as this.Just my 2 cents
I saw the crease and decided to consider it part of the uniqueness of this one pair...I think the color is accurate for the lighting of that pic, by which I mean, in the dark these boots are like a deep brown with some red, but in the light you get much more of that color 8. I'm pretty happy with the color but I have yet to see them in strong daylight, I got them a few hours ago, unboxed them with the camera, wore them half an hour, went out for a run, just got back and it's dark out. Tomorrow!edit, in the light the panels don't really match, the sides are more red than the toe box. But it's not easy to tell, and the reddish #8 is a great color. I'm psyched to see how these age over time.
There was not a *single mention* of Freddie Grey in the thread that led to this one. [To quote Jesse Wililams,](http://www.salon.com/2015/04/28/so_exactly_what_kind_of_violence_dont_you_like_actor_jesse_williams_baltimore_rant/) "exactly what kind of violence don't you like?" 
No one knows.My best guess for USA: check sites at 3am for them after wave 4 releases on the 29th.That or wait for the placeholders to go up and then set up page monitor.
The tax burden is usually averaged out ... but we also have an intensely *huge* economy and a *vast* amount of income is going to the top.   They squawk that they pay a larger "percentage" but in total ... they're making so much more it doesn't mean much.http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456This is the Federal taxes at least, which everyone thinks somehow should be cut more and more.
Life. I only put in a lot of time when I was a student; High school, University. It just took too much time once I was working. The expectation from guildies or friends got to be too much. I had to be firm that yes...I really do need to log off.  It was easier to just quit playing. I have gone back to my single player games. No more MMO's. I may pick up a game for myself once a year, more if a really good one comes out. 
I've seen Webs solo-commentate before (Melee) and he was really good, but that's also because Webs is just an awesome commentator in general. I can try to find sets to link you when I get back to my computer
Yeah I thought about that -- perhaps I can use that little decoupler that fires both ways and then just knock it out of the way. Thanks! I'll let you know how it goes.
Ha! I just had the opposite happen. My DH just gave me "his" room to expand my office. I guess he realized the more space I have, the more money I can make. 
I recently downloaded Hearthstone on my phone and have been playing it for a good amount of time this past week. Thing really takes a toll on your battery though. The small amount of data it uses is freaking crazy though. 
If you haven't been suckered into paying money for a survival game yet don't start now...they never get finished and there is no point to them the sandbox gets boring quickly spend your money on a proper game
Well, as far as I can tell, that was all speculation, and people blindly got on the hype-train, and surprise surprise when FROM didn't have some sort of in-depth transformation mechanic and covenant system, especially to the degrees that players expected it.  And it's funny that people somehow expected these crazy covenants and transformations and blood mechanics, yet what we wound up is the most hands-off, lamest, shallow and bland covenant systemto date :/All that being said, it's still the best game of 2015 so far, and likely will stay that way, and hey, at least Play Station 4 has one good game on it :)
Ok, so if you are a normal human, you can extrapolate that since it is so close to a 980, then it would be logical that it is much better than a 970.
I'm at 900 miles on my 2015 with the short throw shifter. Gear changes certainly aren't as smooth as I would like but it shifts like it did the day I got it. Unless this is a new problem for you I think it might just be a design flaw 
Exactly the onus of proof is on the police to prove he isn't Thor, as soon as he claims to be Thor.  His conduct seems like something a god might do if he/she felt the inclination. I'm just a mortal, my mind is to puny to justify humping a tree, but to a god, maybe tree fucking makes sense.
Attemdance and active faith are down because the burn agains have turned people off with a literal reading of scripture that cannot respond to contemporary western societies. You did it to yourselves by using Jesus as a cudgel to justify your own social conservatism that in no way represents a contextual view of the New Testament as a Christian Constitution--which like any constitution, cannot be prescriptively applied, it must be a living tree, with the ability to grow.
Fairplay for doing the difficult thing. I know it's easy for us to say, we don't know this guy, but he really sounds abusive. I can't imagine what it's like having someone you love giving you grovelling apologies like this. But, he has made so many unreasonable, unrepentant, demands of you that it seems as though he's only apologising because he's realized you've had enough. That basically sets the precedent that he pushes you as far as he possibly can, and you let him because you want to be a good spouse, this is pretty textbook conditioning for an abusive relationship.
Aahh the secret: use a shampoo for dyed hair, wash and rinse in cold water, and most importantly, rinse until the water is COMPLETELY clear. If the rinse water is still tinted, that means there is still loose pigment, and that will readily contaminate your other colours. Once out out the shower, immediately squeeze as much water as you can out, then wrap it in a towel, then swap for another towel after a few minutes, then maybe a third. Drying it faster means less time for further loose pigment to transfer. This will also prevent you from staining your pillow cases and shirt collars!
These fighters don't have any personal connection to the Kurds or Syria, whether it is a man or woman is irrelevant IMO. It's rather selfish to go off and risk orphaning your children, especially given that the YPG don't seem to have a manpower shortage.
I'm super excited for this new scent. I've been looking for a "scotch &amp;amp; cigar" scented shaving soap. Hopefully this will give me my fix being that it has some tobacco leaves in it. 
*[V](http://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/34g169/v_reintroduced/) notices the new guy covered in blood and walks up* Hello there, I haven't seen you around before.
[Here](http://imgur.com/MuIorEA) is a bonus shot from today. Before, I used to brush my hair in the shower and just throw huge clumps of it away. It was dry and unmanageable and I thought it looked decent because it had volume. I straightened it all the time.Now, I co-wash once every day or two, S2C, and comb, not brush. I also use a little bit of gel before plopping overnight. I never knew what to do with my hair, and while I'm not 100% satisfied, I know I'm on the right path!
Two things I take from this:* On the one hand, this shows crazy potential; if he is 8-0 and looking dominant already, imagine what will happen now that he is training with proper equipment and other fighters (instead of sparring with his dad and 17 y/o brother)!* On the other hand, this might very quickly lead to him becoming a big fish in a little pond, as Matthews will be training with the likes of Dan Kelly, aka that guy who fought Sam Walsh in Colorado in what looked like two dads brawling at a bbq.
You probably can do it yourself for cheaper; the question is do you want to do it yourself...  Honestly, with the way this is worded, it seems like you already have that answer.  You don't need validation from a bunch of Internet strangers.However, FWIW, I have Vivint, and have had it for some time.  I also have a separate veralite that I use for all automation excluding locks, and a camera.  I feel no regret in having vivint, because although I could have done it myself, I didn't want to go through the hassle.  Also, I'm a fan of the vivint sky app aesthetics, and find it to work well; ideally though, I'd love to have the 2gig panel as a secondary zwave controller, but it seems vivint has that thing too locked down for that. Just my $0.02
I got the bright idea to sneak into the community pool with a friend when we were younger. I thought it would be awesome, just the two of us, male and female in a dark secluded body of water... I had a panic attack in the middle of the pool and she had to talk me through it... 
Im going to assume this is pulsator without clicking on it in which case, i dont need to post what i was going to which would have just been like 80 all caps pulsator!'s
It's definitely running at 720p but fps might be around 30-45 or 50 if I'm guessing. You're right it definitely hasn't been running under 30fps but it doesn't seem to be above 55 either. Another thing to consider is that when looking at the livestreams that have been around the past few days you have to remember that twitch's quality settings might be a bottleneck in some cases considering the pc that they're streaming from has to be able to handle above 30fps. Derrik from GameXplain was streaming two days ago and he said even though the game is running higher than 30fps, that's the max we'll see because his pc can't handle anything higherEdit: holy shit grammar I need food
I figured so but asked because I wonder how that sort of thing is done accidentally. Then again my most advanced computer knowledge consists of bolding text with HTML.
what the fuck's your problem? Calling somebody a bitch just cause they asked a question. They obviously don't know much about opiates and are worried. No reason to get all pissy. 
I love how random the curse's methods are.Loss by horrible beating.  Loss by submission.  Loss by weird KO, followed by leg snap, followed by positive test.  Loss by mental issues and drug testing problems.  Loss by zombie knee tissue.  Loss by criminal accusations.  Loss by get real Aldo isn't going anywhere.
If you place all your value in PPP sure, but there is a lot more to a strong middle class than the ability to buy certain goods when the inflation of more essentials (healthcare, higher education, childcare, etc) are placing them further out of the reach of the average American.
If you had to select healthy food, and you had only one metric to go by, that would probably be the best one. Processed foods don't even list their ingredients, so evaluating their nutrition value is not possible. But when I'm eating an apple, I have a pretty good idea what it is.

You wouldn't have to make minimum wage higher; the wage would rise naturally as they have competition from the basic income. So people would be replaced with machines, or wages would increase to get staff. 
I PvP by myself and kill the entire server easily.  For money and xp heists with that ping aren't awful at all.  Seriously man.  You're missing a lot by not playing with others.  
Why do you want to age this beer?  At low abv, very few non-sour beers will last a year, let alone a decade.  Red/amber ales are not particularly known for their longevity.  Having the beer in a fridge helps, but only to an extant.  I doubt the results will be positive.
Yeah, that too. It also allows different Gem characters to be assigned noticeably different levels of strength and durability, without weaker characters having to either die, suffer permanent injury, or display unbelievably good luck.
I do. My friends all went their separate ways. Marriage/kids...Me making friends was not just gonna happen so i have to go out and get it. I go to bars by myself and initiate conversation with people. Its hard but you end up meeting cool people.Life begins when you leave your comfort zone.
Ugh that sucks. I run on a grassy path that's been totally worn down in places and has the odd tree root to try and trip you up, but I'm getting used to it now! I hate getting all excited for a run and having something out of your control spoil it (my last one was during an early heat wave when I discovered my sunscreen melts into my eyes whilst running!).Hopefully you can use the Google maps measurement function (right click anywhere and select it) and satellite view to measure up an appropriate section of your nicer track instead?
Gravity is a theory. If you can tell me why gravity works (or rather, how it works) head down and pick up your Nobel Prize. There's also a law, which is what you are talking about. Pretty easy to prove that one. This is exactly the phrase I came here expecting to see somewhere, and to anyone who has studied physics, you sound like an idiot. FWIW I'm not an evolution-doubter either. This is just crappy defense.
Well, an exaggeration of the situation to the point where it's an epidemic is a bit much, but even if it was, against innocent owners' private property and ordinary citizens of Baltimore? Not even close. Against the police? It would make more sense, but still no. The crimes of a few do not justify attacking the total group.
Not trying to be a dick. I just thought you might look it up after asking. It is a compiled list of testings like GC/MS, NMR and a few others. Wasn't trying to be mean.

Same thing happened to my in the exact same ranger. It ended up being the line that crosses the front k-member. It may not be the same location for you but that same truck rusted through the rears the year before so i would start there.
Gingerbread Cookie is okay, didn't really wow me. It was a little strong by itself at 5% I found. I personally wouldn't use it as a standalone, but it definitely has value if you used it with an icing/custard/vanilla. That's something I'll actually be working with this weekend. Thinking:* French vanilla 4%* Gingerbread Cookie 2.5%* Whipped cream 3%* Something else that'll probably run it :P This was one of the two flavors (the other being Dulce De Leche) I didn't really feel I had a grasp on. Kinda just sat there vaping it being like "hmmm, I taste...umm...hmmm...a little....hmmmm" I may have to mess around with this again at different %'s.
Not even that I was accepting as a kid (as a fat kid I was kind of forced to be based off the fact the only friends I had all had mental handicaps because everyone else called us freaks) its just that as a kid the only thing i cared about was whatever toy/franchise/tv show at the time I was enjoying. for all I care you could have told me my uncle joe was hitler; he fucking bought me transformers mate! hiel hydra and all that jazz!
Losing is aways a ding and can only be offset by a lot of winning like your example.  6/10 is incredible - making the finals 10 time is rare, and winning 6 is also hard!  Lebron is 2/5 right now... he's lost more than he won and needs to win a lot more. What if he ends up 4/8?  I would take 6/6 over 4/8 every time.  But if LBJ ended 6/10, which means he goes 4/5 from now forward... and he has two more repeats or a threepeat, then I could seriously include him in the GOAT conversation. 
If you don't like Lucha Underground, you not a REAL wrestling fan like me.  it's the best thing ever ( le FACT) and I came exactly 6 times during the last episode. People who don't like it are gay and enjoy sex with men.

Thanks for the comment - I definitely found a trend when I was researching the piece with users shouting 'troll!' when actually they were just in the middle of a discussion. Not always a mature discussion with good, considered points being made, but more than just trolling for the sake of it.I like this summary - 'A troll isn't part of the discussion, he tries to transform it into a clusterfuck of anger, frustration and wasted energy/time - where he can be at the center of it.' - it covers most of the different troll personas I was trying to create well!
I'm sure you can pick up something. Mostly stuff like proper positioning and general tactics, but I bet you can get something from playing with the more experienced players. I'd give it a shot.
In previous reply, I asked...&gt; The numeric parts are 4, 12, 36. yes? &gt; What is the greatest common factor?You didn't respond.Can we try again?If you see that part, then do the same thing for all the s parts. If you want, start by listing them.
I get shit from time to time playing Sheik and Jigglypuff, but that just makes the chaingrabs, tech chases, and rests so much more delicious, just ignore em, sheik aint as easy as people make her off to be anyway. :)
Yup. My father was killed by a drunk driver in 91. He got 12 years, got it after 7, and has been back at least 3 times since his release then for DUI. A lot of people I know that don't know about that will be having conversations about their weekends, and just laugh saying things along the lines of 'oh man, I was so drunk, I don't know how I made it home' or 'I don't even remember driving there' It really gets my blood boiling how many people think it's fine. And even worse - the people who say things like 'Yeah, I know it was dumb, but I mean, I didn't hurt anyone' 
It is, but as /u/Bzerker01 said, now its ideal for non-Americans, we exist too you know, we contribute with our time, money and effort, we are also being hired to work on Star Citizen in the UK and Germany (and in all likelihood, outnumber US staff too!). Non-Americans, they're just like Americans... they're just not in America. ;)Maybe once in a while they'll be able to get out of the office at a normal hour, expecting them to stream live outside of US work hours, when they're in the US, im sure isnt exactly ideal for them either.Also, isnt this the same time the show used to be done? It only went later when they pushed AtV later. It managed to run for months at around this time, and so 'Apparently you have not watched the resent shows' can be returned as 'Apparently you have not watched the first/previous 20-30 shows'. All they've really done, bar a couple of recent eps, is moved it a day later.
it only really happens in the middle of rounds, not really towards the ends of them. it's weird. when I have to cluch I focus hardcore, but every other time I can't seem to
Well my 8th grade science teacher had a picture of a female student as his wallpaper and got fired 3 times for sexual harrasment so i guess thats nice...
Awesome! love a bit of good dnb :) rolled last week and whilst I have experienced mdma on quite a few occasions last week was an eye opener for me as well, has spurred me on to move forward and stay positive! hope you have some lights to enjoy :P
Oh. I know. I have more guy friends than girl friends. My feeling is, of you can claim 3 women you've been friends with for longer than a year, you're golden. But I lived with a girl who literally had NO friends that were women. At all. And she is the poster girl for the kind of woman were just lampooning. Just. Could not be happy unless every man in the room was paying attention. And was aweful to any woman she felt threatened that. None of us are in contact with her anymore.
Couldnt find 2016, but I found 2015 if that helps: http://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/downloads/caas/downloads/content/autodesk-maya-2015-service-pack-6.htmlIt doesnt look like they have released 2016 in their support section yet.
Chip Kelly spent the night running naked through back alleys in Philadelphia high on bath salts and reeking of toilet wine. He will be making picks based on the advice of Mumbly Joe who he met around the burn barrel. 
Still, it would suck if you fell for someone of a different species and wanted to have a kid with them.No kidding? I thought that there were centaurs and shit running around! /s
I used to have dreams that I could fly, but only if I furiously flapped my arms.  I couldn't make it very high either, like as high as the 2nd story window.  I'd always get out of breath and sink back down to earth pretty quickly.

STOP TRYING TO BE FRIENDS UNTIL YOU ARE OVER EACH OTHER! No contact with him. Seriously. You can't be friends with exes until you have moved on. Two and a half months is not long enough to get over a year long relationship. Stop hurting yourself. You are only making the chances of you actually being friends in the future worse.If you are lonely, go hang out with ANYONE OTHER THAN HIM.
I use maple syrup instead.. But I also drink almond milk and eat lots of fruits which from what I understand in the U.S. are entirely pollinated by commercial bee hives.
It was well laid out and yes of course, drawn beautifully but a lot of people are upset because it incorporated little to no in-betweening or "actual animation" and is rather just a set of very still keyframes
When me and my little brother were in elementary school, our parents weren't able to pick us up on time after school so we stayed at this daycare hosted by the school.  One day, the one adult there asked my brother to stop running.  I forget what my brother said back, but he made a rude comment back.  The adult grabbed him by his shirt and said "I could knock your teeth out right now if I wanted to." We told our parents and they weren't too happy about it.  My dad came in the next day to "talk" to him.  The adult ended up puking from the conversation he was so scared.  
Awesome job of the hat!Which reminds me that I wish Ferrari would return to that style on their logo. The Ferrari logo and the style of writing is so much better then that Marlboro inspired crap they have currently.
The description is fine, but the photo is different. Maybe they updated the design of the camera? There were no rippled ovals on the front when I bought mine. 
I'll just add that I use VB, and overall haven't had any *serious* issues with them. But there have been minor issues here and there:1.) When selecting the "ETF Free" commission structure, *sometimes* I am still charged for purchasing ETFs. Not sure why.2.) I had some issues when setting up my accounts with VB, but it was resolved with a phone call to their customer service.I only use VB to buy a few ETFs and re-balance only once a year.

If they ever force me off I will just not pay the bill and let them send me to collections. Fuck off Verizon. Its not like I won't ever get a house or a car or an apartment because I have an unpaid cell phone bill
Nope. I actually had him my senior year (last year). He seemed a lot less bigoted. Still a smart ass but wasn't an outright asshole anymore. To my knowledge he's still at the school
That's nice to hear!German is a very hard language to learn. So let me teach you some more:Baden as a noun is a region in Germany (as in Baden-Wurttemberg).Baden as a verb means "to take a bath".And while you were close, the bathroom is Badezimmer, no n.Hope that didn't sound too condescending...
Holy, that's a badass helmet. I love how it turned out. Is the link broken for the airbrush site? It won't load for me.I like the design, it's like a reverse venom meets vindicator. Good luck in Toronto.
I miss them because there was a proper story mode. I don't care for the "Universe" aspect, and the reliving past matches thing was cool for a bit but they sort of peaked with the Attitude Era one.The old PS2 Smackdown games had a better "Universe" mode with Be A GM where your cards and rivalry's were rated, even that shit is way better then the current state.
Hers is also curled cork bark, however I broke it in half and firmly planted the bottom in the substrate and made a middle section with bark buried horizontally added more packed Eco earth, then finally added the top of the cork. Topping it off with- you guessed packed econearth. :)
Nah, it looks like pretty decent tech. So it should have a gyrostabilizer. Heck my small palm sized quad copter has one. The more weight put on an area, one or two of the rotors will speed up to stabilize it.  
My aunt sent me an email once after Christmas chastising me for not being grateful for getting gifts at Christmas because she didn't hear me say thank you to everyone. Another reason she is my least favorite aunt.
I would skip around my living room like a giddy little school girl  if they did a darker spin of the theme song when winter comes. Not too different, but noticeable.
I like how everything varies, it adds to it.  You'll have some low calm stuff then all of a sudden a head is lopped off.  Or a character basically threatens lives likes it's nothing.
I don't recall being either passive or aggressive.  For someone looking for people with good attitudes and so forth... you're awfully upset over extremely temperate replies. :&lt;

Prepare for the worst traffic of your life if you choose Renton ...especially if you start work during rush hour. Like most places, you get what you pay for. If you want to be closer to more and higher paying jobs with less of a commute, you will pay more. I pay $1,600 for a 2-bdrm in Redmond, and it's nothing special. . . but buying a place here would start around $500k for anything we would actually want. 
My pleasure! It's fantastic that you are able to manage them so well - good for you! Interesting how our bodies work, isn't it?Also, though I'm Canadian and just guessing you're American, thanks for your service. The Navy is badass!
I was in a orchestra last year with cello, and was Ok (First chair, district orchestra, professional side by side, higher level group, accompaniment to my school's choir).
i have medium to weak facial hair genes. i have spent upwards of 2 years (on and off cycling; on half the year for 4 years) on doses well above supraphysiological including injecting straight DHT, tren, masteron, test.....legit chinstrap came at the 1-1.5 years on high doses (800 mg-1500 mg per week) mark, full beard is just now rockable as stubble and will not be legit to grow out (not that i will grow it much longer than 1 cm) for about another 2 years of on time.i have also used plenty of minoxidil and dermarolled the fuck out of my face.also, accutane was used by me, which reduces DHT's ability to do it's thing in the skin.
But seriously, surely the machine shop at Mercedes isn't idle, especially with Ferrari looming in their mirrors?  Doesn't each team try to pick up a tenth or two each race from car refinements, and more from multi-week breaks?  Do you think they're just being coy because of the press they were getting after dominating in Australia?  
Hey Marc, most people probably won't see this since this thread is old, so if you really want people to know you should just make a new topic. If it's not that important to you, I wouldn't bother. Either way, it wouldn't be a bad idea to give these guys a quick reminder about Ragefest every now and then. I won't do anything unless you give me confirmation.That flair is funny. Marisa=Reisen?
Actually most people know what time zone they are using. Clearly since they are based out of Seattle USA they are using the Tasmanian time zone, I mean what else would they use?
Exactly! I've got a feeling that his Bankai will (I can dream, can't I?) be amazing.When I was re-watching the anime, I noticed something I think I missed in the manga. During the FKT-arc he was stressing over weather or not his healing abilities were up-to-snuff to save those injured by Ayon. I believe he mentions that he was originally in Squad 4 and that he hopes his talents have waned too much since then. Clearly, he was a stellar healing-kido user back then. I hope that he trained his healing Kido from FKT and on and maybe even became quite adept at it allowing him to save himself after being "gutted" like he was. At least, that's the explanation I want to happen. :( 
44/64 available Gods were picked/banned in the LAN this weekend. That's only 3 sets. That is *no where* even *close* to the same exact bans every time..
Couldn't you tone orange out with blue the same way you can tone out yellow with purple?  Granted it wouldn't make it lighter but it would tone it down.

Not just parking lots, test server 1 has a foundation deck built across the main road at wake hills hamlet.Also barbed wire across the roads in several clutch area's on the east side of the map.  I don't know why, it's pve and a test server, unless the test was "will dbags dl the test server?".

&gt; people who use the place as a part of their identity and are threatened by people who would come compete with them for houses, jobs, eligible mates, and friends. Well....yeah. I was born here and like it here but it's becoming increasingly difficult to afford to live in the place I've spent my whole life. 
I've always said that cat-days are just as important as sick days. Sometimes your cat is doing something that is just so goddamn cute/inhibiting your movement and that is not your fault.
Assuming there is on button i would stay there and push it all day. Not just for the money because that guarantees I don't die by other button pushers. Because as long as you stop and let other person in your survival is no longer guaranteed. 
The movie folk want people in the states to be chomping at the bit to see it. Money. Hold it off for two weeks, minor spoilers leak from over seas. Boom more people want to go see it opening night so they can be in it too.
This always killed me on the PS2. It's like nobody with any UI experience at all ever looked at it.Why in the *world* would I want to acknowledge that the save worked? Why in the *world* would I want to confirm that I actually do want to pick up where I left off? And why aren't you already loading the last level I was on and the last save I made while you're showing me silly cut scenes and menus? And why would I *want* to download a demo, wait for 20 minutes for it to download, then come back and have to push a button to start waiting for 20 minutes for it to install??
When asked to provide it for a 'security question' for most accounts I generate a maximum length random string and store that in my password manager. Unfortunately banks pull that kind of thing from the public record for authentication.
Besides /u/Terk1000 on-point remark, the pros and college are two different games in style, schemes, and rules. Also, what motivates college players, and what motivates pros, are two different things. Just because you're great at car sales, doesn't mean you'll be great at real estate, or retail, or software sales, or...you get the idea.
Better than most since she has a higher amount of shields and health compared to most of the frames, and it's not like mesa doesn't have the same problem once Loki uses Radial Disarm :3
North Carolina voters were *tricked* into voting for these idiots, but they'll still suffer from the consequences...FTFY.That political deceit is not limited to North Carolina and neither are the widespread repercussions that result from them.  Be careful what you wish for in life.
Hero dmg is the most irritating newbie stat in the game, we all had that "I'M BETTER THAN ALL OF YOU BECAUSE LOOK AT MY HIGH HERO DMG!!!" guy on our team at some point, at the same time the fact that he has more deaths than the other 4 team members combined doesn't seem to matter to him because "HERO DMG!!" -.-"
I would be more impressed if the charity they did was anonymous. Instead, many churches strike me as doing charity as a form of advertising. "We're so nice, don't you want to join us?" Other churches are so blatant that they'll [refuse to work with nonbelievers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/in-season-of-giving-atheist-groups-charity-rebuffed/2013/12/19/45ddbef6-68f2-11e3-997b-9213b17dac97_story.html) or [withhold charity to those who don't share their beliefs.](http://www.rawstory.com/2013/11/catholic-church-yanks-major-ymca-grant-over-links-to-lgbt-support-group/)And of course, the rumors of religious charitable giving [have been greatly exaggerated.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-briggs/the-flesh-is-weak-churchgoers-give-far-less-than-they-think_b_1846516.html)
You can buy a big bag for around $10 at St Michaels Special School. The money goes to a great cause for the school. Those kids are great and need all the help they can get. It's just off Tchoup next to the Saulet. 
I do need to be more careful. I just can't imagine what else to cut down or out. I already eat lots of veggies, salad, lean meat, no sugar, little fat and little carbs. I think being more religious about Journaling my food will help for sure 
You think looking at people's comment history is "stalking"?You should really talk to someone about these paranoia issues you have. And while you're at it, have you given any thought as to why you attract so much negative attention on this website? 
Hm.. I should sell Cellulase as an emergency food item and become rich. "One package of Cellulase, 1qt water, and 1lb of grass. Stir for 5 minutes. Makes (not so)delicious, healthy survival soup!"
Earlier he said the same shit he's been saying. They're doing the same shit. Difference being they aren't fucking chucking their possessions away playing too fast. They're playing at the same tempo they just aren't giving the other team the ball every other time down.    Thibs didn't do shit, the players just got sick of being outworked by a much shittier team.
Wow!! I will have to *eventually* go to court against my abusive ex and his friend.  I went to the police almost 2 years ago and there's STILL no trial date yet...I feel like I'm stuck in a nightmare sometimes. No one in my family knows about it...its a huge weight to carry :-(Unless people have been through it, I  don't think people understand how hard/stressful it is to be a victim of crime and have to go through the very sloooooow, very confusing and very scary court process.That's so awesome that you can now close that chapter and have all that weight lifted!  Good for you!
Ayeee, Like I've said before, I have flushed them. And once everything cools down, I will start smoking again, this time, taking extra care that no one knows. Besides that, I'm going to stay with a buddy in Chicago all summer, so much bud will be smoked, so I am sure I'll forget all about this Hydro nonsense.. I just so badly needed a filler.Oh and I like to be high, yes, but i can go without it. Once before, I went 4 months without using any substance to get high at all, so I think I have pretty good will.
I guess this applies to playing with as well as against but, Guqin Sona. The sound effects with this skin irrationally irritate me. It makes my skin crawl and my fiance trolls me by playing with the skin all the time.

i used to dislike terrorist especially during in its early stages, but when the later chapters came out i started to realize that they are the most emotionally-investing couple of the four pairings (if that makes sense). shinobus really serious and it just proves that the pair isnt just "for fantasy". theyve got some realistic aspects into their story that made me like them a lot. (kind of reminds me of why i like yukisa too ahaha)
Fuck, what a bunch of assholes. This sounds like it happened in the US. Cops over there really seem to be completely moronic dickwads. I feel sorry for the people living in the US and having to deal with such lousy police.
I have the same dream every time I am about to get sick. I open my eyes and I am inside of a giant sphere. The sphere is pretty much a hollow Epcot. Same triangular build and material. I see a hole open in the top and a ball drops in. Instead of falling, the ball circles around the sphere as it slowly comes down. The second I look away from the ball, I look across from me to see one of those scrambler rides. The ones that spin its arms in a circle while three seats attached to the arms also spin in a circle but in the opposite direction. On it, is a damn marionette. It's dressed as a cowboy and aims a shiny gun at me and right as he's about to fire it, I look for that ball again. It's feet away from me and it's about twice as big as I am. The puppet fires his gun and the ball smashes into me. I wake up and I am full on sick. This dream I have had every time I come down with anything more than a cold. The first time was when I was 6 and had pneumonia. 
I was being abstract because that guy was talking about abortions in general. But yeah that was my first thought as well - how can she even survive the pregnancy at ten? The risk to her life must be extreme.
"Hmmm." *Kris strokes his chin and goatee as he searched for another box. Spotting none in the places he checked so far, he turns to Amai hopeing ahe had better luck.* "I can not see any, although maybe there might be another one at a different store?"
Law school is a game (a VERY hard one, obviously) and part of it is to hype up the difficulties to new potential students.Ask yourself these two questions: do you want to be a lawyer? And are you willing to spend three years of your life studying when you could be earning income?If you do your homework and answer "yes," then disregard everything else. If you are willing to throw away three years of income to become a lawyer, the workload shouldn't concern you. It's hard as hell, but if you truly want to be a lawyer then it won't be miserable. And it pales in comparison to the financial sacrifice (lost wages plus tuition and living expenses) that you know you're incurring when you walk in.If 1) you have an idea of what it means to be a lawyer, 2) you're aware of the financial investment, and 3) *you still want it*, you shouldn't be scared off by horror stories.
From a few weeks to several months, depending on the severity and the treatment options. This guy will probably have permanent injuries because the top part of his back is gone now. His muscles are probably  necrotic to some point and don't get me started on the chest wounds (that we can't quite see in the image).
Ok, I love the feel of being connected on my bicycle, or my '48 farmall, as well as my E30. No matter the vehicle, manual control over the gears has always made me feel more connected, more in control, and more part of the driving experience.
Halftime Four FactorsFactor | Bulls | Bucks------|-----|-----EFG% | 59.2% | 39.4%OREB% | 27.3% | 04.8%TO% (est.) | 14.1% | 20.2%FT Rate | 14.3 | 36.4I did these Four Factors breakdowns for some Duke games on /r/collegebasketball because I like to see what some of the stats say about the game, and whether it agrees with my eyes. Here, it basically confirms everything we're seeing: the Bulls are shooting really well and the Bucks aren't, the Bulls are doing a lot better on the offensive glass than the Bucks, and the Bulls aren't turning it over as much. But what I don't think gets captured is the percentage of opportunities that the Bulls are converting compared to the Bucks. The Bulls are outscoring the Bucks 15-1 off of turnovers, which exacerbates the disparity in turnover rate. They're 7-7 from the line to the Bucks' 7-12, neutralizing the Bucks' advantage in free throw rate. That's just my two cents.
I grew attached to Matthias in just a few days, even though when I first got him he hated me. I think it's really hard to kill them with anything but brute force. Just watch where your butt is going X_X
The risk of being the best in a draft system that rewards the worst.  Which is ok with me.  The "problem" with Philly is that our teams tend to be good, but never good enough to win it all.  And not bad enough for long enough to bring in superstars.  So we always have good players.  But never great.
You could throw it away and tell her you ate it all. Or you could just not eat it, because you are above binge eating now. Or, just eat a little with dinner when it gets served. A spoonful or two won't hurt you that much, so long as you count it and don't eat a whole serving.
This video highlights the true nature of law enforcement in this country: absolute disregard or concern for public safety (and instead a focus on revenue generation and non-violent drug offenders)
It might be because the meta is so new, but T10 feels very disjointed. The towers are too far spread out, and that might be mostly because of the design of the maps not properly meshing with the current playstyle. Typically towers are captured so you can spawn up there when you die. I don't think people are really getting the incentive of the towers, or grouping up in one "siege area" to duke it out for the towers. Good tower placement is easier in longer maps, sw:bf for example.
I mainly play support. As a Zed (or other midlane assassin) are there certain supports you like or dislike seeing on your team? Awesome job with your content, it's really informative stuff!
I am able to read, I don't need to go to "a message board", whatever generic board that is, and make a post at your behest just to find out something I already know the answer to. Just because a majority of people believe something does not in fact make it true. It also doesn't refute anything I've said about OKC. I watch a lot of nba, I talk to plenty of people who share my opinion. Some generic concensus on "a message board" does not mean more than real informed opinions. As someone who can't see the hypocrisy in criticising the Clippers being an OKC fan, you are not someone with an informed opinion.You've spent all this thread talking down to people complaining about the referees, half of whom aren't even Clippers fans.
Well, the more complex you go, the easier it gets for the DM to twist it, so I would stick to something relatively simple.  I think pet dinosaurs are pretty cool, but I also just generally like dinosaurs so.. maybe wish for like a pet beholder or something.. er.. wait.. no, that's too dangerous.
Yeah I expect anything relating to this game to explode in terms of popularity and recognition once E3 rolls around. And I can't wait!! It's going to be fun welcoming all these young'uns into our community :) 
I feel they are synonymous. If you focus on your persona first though, you'll spend a lot of time doing so. If you work on joke writing, you'll not only get the habit of how to write a joke but throughout testing them out will naturally find what type of jokes fit you, thus...persona created.
I feel very lonely. I've been thru shit no one around me can relate to and get annoyed when I keep bringing it up because I've got to talk about it to feel better. But I'll just pretend to be happy and shove my problems in a box to feel when I'm alone.

shouldnt these police.... be solving real cases where real people are being harmed?          edit: noticed the police was pissed, the reporter was wasting his time
With yes means yes laws and crap like that it won't matter. She can withdraw consent at anytime for any reason. So even if she did sign your still fucked. Not to mention the fact that she could say you coerced her into a sexual act via the oral or anal check blocks. They hold all the cards and until there is true equality in the eyes of the law and society we are always walking a thin line.
Oh...well, then stir the pot!  I didn't catch the sarcastic haterade.  I was on board with 2 firsts and reluctantly Kendricks, but NEVER Fletcher Cox.  He's too valuable to the team.  Boykin I would love to part ways with.  Lets get something for a guy in a contract year who wants to start and will leave in FA anyway.
&gt; so, did you get laid anyway?&gt; If they still had a sticker on the door, I would go mad at them as much as politeness towards the girl allowed. They drew in my business, leaving me confident to accept bitcoin at the door with the sticker and then when the bill arrives, make me look like an idiot? Oh, how I would want them to regret that mistake!&gt; Trust me, to woman, it is just as cool to draw money from your bitcoin wallet. And don't you think it's amazing that you can live 100% on bitcoin now? Why NOT have a bitcoin debit card, there is no excuse. Use Bitwage to get paid.&gt; Hope she was moved enough to give you the happy ending afterwards&gt; Still get laid?Top minds, each and every one.
Heck, the only serious Russian incursion in Ukraine to date was 1,000 Russian soldiers in August that had the Ukrainian military in full retreat to Mariupol. You're replying to a guy who doesn't know what he's talking about at all. Throw 10,000 soldiers with some modern tanks and AA and the Ukrainian military will be chased back to Kiev as fast as the column can roll.
That's pretty much exactly what my pup does!  I love to see them take so much joy from such a small thing.  Dogs teach you that it really is the little things in life...
The Katamari Damacy OST is delightfully diverse and though the game's opening, too, *is amazing*, this particular track holds a special place in my heart.
This is what I fucking mean! Strasburg looks like a totally different pitcher inning to inning. That's what frustrates me, not that he struggles sometimes. He goes from absolutely dominant to unable to get an out.
One of my teachers was a hag, she dumped my backpack all over the floor while I went to the bathroom one time (I can't remember why, I think cause she thought I was lying about not having my homework or something), and I always got more homework then everyone else, my mom went ape shit at her, she also called two dark skinned boys in my class niggers while she was giving them a talking to for getting in trouble for something, after that she was forced to retire.
As a 5th grader two of my three instructors forced my parents to get me tested for several days because they thought my IQ was too low to be in regular classes. I did well, the person administrating the test guessed that I wasn't doing work cause I was bored. My parents kicked that out of me right there. I always wonder what would have happened to me if those two teachers would have gotten what they wanted, which essentially was just me not in their class cause I was hard to deal with.
I demo patios just like this all the time at work. We would start by cutting it into a few squares with a demo saw (only cuts about 4" deep) and then using a bobcat with forks to try and pry it up snapping the concrete. If that didn't work we would rent a jack hammer that attaches to an excavator. To be honest it sounds like hiring somebody with heavy duty equipment is your best bet. If the heights allow for it you can always spread an inch of sand over it and lay pavers/bricks/bluestone. Then just regrade the lawn around it with loam. If you want, take some pictures of the area it's in and I'll give you a better plan of attack.
I could maybe make the drive. I'm in the Tri-Cities, but my bro has been bugging me to make a daytrip your way.And tbh, I don't see there being many Bernie fans in my area...
In the real world I think most people would prefer to be casuals with girlfriends than no life hardcores. But the fans don't think about off-screen Kripp, the hardcore gamer with Pornhub on his most visited sites.
The past few nights, the battery has been at about 40% when I've gone to bed. I don't use the watch overnight, so I don't mind charging it. In terms of functionality outside of the gym, I don't think there's much of a comparison. 
Life is so much more interesting through your own eyes.Knowing that you are getting life with no distortion (or as little as possible) is great.Your balance is much better so do stuff! Now is when it is possible. there is lots of good evidence that those balance requiring things make your brain so much healthier.
Personally I think we should make a move, even if it is for a short term contract, for Lamarcus Aldridge. He has the potential to add a lot of size and skill to the frontline. His time in Portland is looking very questionable and coming to Toronto would give him a great chance to dominate in the more front court light eastern conference. He would be a great compliment to JV in the starting line up.
I was going to give you gold, then I realized I'd need gold to keep these nifty new styles. If someone gilds this comment then I'll gild /u/roj2323Or you could cut out the middle man and just gild them directly...probably a better idea anyways.
I have the same issue, I chatted with a lady at Xbox support and tried a few things that didn't work, she said they'd been getting reports of it and are working on a fix, figure if you try in a couple days you should be fine. I can give you the steps we tried if you wantEdit: the steps we tried had worked for some  ppl
Does that justify cussing about a kid? The teacher is drawing a paycheck, they did pick teaching as their career of choice. This is not something they were forced to do, and frustrated or not. Venting like that is not ok.
of course you have to give something to get something, that's why I just donated half a day's wages to the campaign... in the kickstarter and patreon era, people power is the way to go
&gt; "Oh, the deposit holds the car so we don't sell out to someone else while doing your paperwork"How would that even be possible?  Wouldn't the "someone else" also need to do paperwork?  How would someone else get the car without paperwork?
I only really use SwiftKey because of its dark theme (slate, I think). The prediction stuff is normally great, but I care about aesthetics just as much. 
Was [this the one you used](http://www.everydaycookingadventures.com/julia-childs-bearnaise-sauce/#sthash.bWMJdY7U.dpbs)?Should work well. Did you possibly reduce vinegar too much? Did you have enought tarragon?Final salt/pepper balance is very important. I get the seasoning 'nearly there' then add the tarragon, then season again.
&gt; It really is unfortunate that she's so into what she does and that results in her getting dumped on because of the history of "token females" in the gaming world.I'd say it's not just that but more that they're copying a particular show format which pretty much always has a very attractive female playing this exact same role. It is a shame though that these previous instances of women hired as 'token females' has made the whole role seem like its pandering.I've seen a few occasions where Meg has been more relaxed and less frantic in her presentation and hand movements, and I honestly think she'd make a decent presenter given the right show.Free Play isn't it though, at least not yet. I think they could definitely rework it in to something longer and calmer, with more interviews with RT members/exclusive content while one of the hosts plays a game or something since it's called "Free Play". Meg doing sit down interviews would probably work quite well.

As long as you go into it knowing it isn't his usual fare you'll be fine.I had issues connecting to the main character, so I didn't like this one. I found his other one better and read it several times, but I barely finished **Mr. Mercedes**.
I wouldn't spend the money on it for a grind machine or to have the FOTM. Even after adjustments and balances, though, the Calliope is going to be one of those things that some people just really, really want to have- rocket artillery is *rocket artillery*, regardless of cost or effectiveness.
It looked extremely sloppy, almost as if she started two weeks ago. But I think she may have been one the of the new signings to NXT from a week or two ago.
Pretty great patch, the randomized rewards are great, get some pretty nice things from it.The Calliope is nearly 10k eagles... Ridiculous. Haven't tried out those American TDs, look like fun.
Yeah, I would agree with that. Friendship had a place in the same way it does in real life. Teamwork and all that jazz. We can't channel our friendship into freakin' Falcon Punches.
not the same thing, per say, but could you imagine how r/nba would react if it existed back in the late 90s and this duncan kid had to be "the man" on a team that had robinson? sometimes i think the whole "following act" is a bit overblown. i'd like to believe that LMA (who has said that duncan is his idol) would love the chance to carry on the great big man tradition in san antonio. and the opportunity to play with kawhi is pretty appealing as well, along with pop being signed on for a few more years (and then messina most likely afterwards). but that also could be my bias as a spurs fan hoping he comes i guess. 
 Network, late-night, talk shows, can't be political or controversial. All they care about is ratings. The show will have no teeth, no balls, and it will suck
go play diablo 3, or go play path of exile if you really like the color 'brown' or like playing the story 3 times before you spend points or restart when you put the wrong skill point in. Ok you get the picture path of exile is bad, go play diablo 3.
As a project manager, this couldn't be more wrong.Sure, it'll delay production release a little bit... but that's better than staying 14 hours and coming in on weekends to find the problem, while getting chewed by management.
Those curtains she calls pants are too small!! They didn't even measure her for proper fitting pants. She probably needs to wear something 3 sizes larger. 
I say this as an Asian, but the restaurant on Gloucester Green isn't really date appropriate. Unless I'm thinking of another restaurant, that place is more like a Chinese cafeteria.The opium den is nice. I like Soho across the Worcester bridge and near the said business school. 
Huh. I despise the Hobbit films... yet my enjoyment of LOTR remains the same. It really is puzzling to me that people's enjoyment of past films can be that influenced by future films. 
So as the crow flies, its about 700km to vaguely the north of Scotland. The air speed of an owl is about 45km/h, so assuming ideal conditions, and no rests, its a 15-16 hour flight from London to Hogwarts. That seems like a good reason to me.
Haste and crit are very close stats, but while haste pulls ahead singletarget, crit is better in multitarget encounters and there is no known softcap (for either crit or haste).You have to deal with the long cast times for the start, but it gets better with gear, especially if you get the T17 2p bonus. Currently i have around 900 haste i think and my starfire casttime in the raid is 2,3 seconds.Just focus on getting items with Mastery and try to avoid getting versatility, the start is rough as a moonkin but it can only get better
Not to be too much of a homer, but might I suggest [these options for helping repair Baltimore?](http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/bal-volunteer-donation-opportunities-20150428-story.html#page=1)
Oooh, thanks for that. *Wood Wife* definitely sounds like something I'd love. I've never read any of her work written under Megan Lindholm (although, I recently picked up an anthology and was delighted to find a short by her included). I'll have to look for that as well. Oh, Mt. ToBeRead grows again... :)
If you really want to save money. Buy Oats. Make oatmeal. Enough for week worth of food. Takes 30 minutes to make and your good for breakfast for the entire week. I think i got a container that was like $5 on sale maybe? Prolly last me a month. Add honey and cinnamon. Eggs are super cheap too. $1.50 by me for 3 meals if I buy a dozen.
If the modder is your spouse I'm sure he or she will get you a free copy. More to the point nobody is claiming you have to get paid for everything you do, the argument is you should be able to charge if you want to. Which is true for the spouse example as well unless you are claiming that your spouse should be forced to work for you for free.If you dont think the mod is good enough to pay for you dont pay for it. Did you honestly think that the other side of this argument was you will now be forced to pay for every mod ever made? Again, nobody has claimed you are entitled to get money for something, what you are is entitled to be able to charge if you want to. 
I have to say I'm highly sceptical about all this but if you want to increase the performance you could increase the cell count of the battery pack to raise the operating voltage. That would be hard enough but then you would need to ensure the inverter would be able to handle that without letting the smoke escape. Then you would need to change a whole load of firmware for battery management and who knows what else. The cooling system would require a major upgrade too but that would be trivial compared to everything else. If they can pull this off I'll forgive them for what they have done to the front and rear bodywork.
I'm amazed how faggots like this completely ignore all the actual violence that niggers commit and instead blame themselves for violence without actually doing anything.What is the cause of this guilt? Brainwashing? Mental disorder? There is definitely something wrong with this man (if you can even call him a man)
I just don't know how to respond to "I think it does." Do you have any evidence? A difference in the place of articulation between /t, d/ and /k, g/ would be something I think would be discussed in the literature, but I have never seen it. And yet, I do have a lot of experience teaching undergraduates who are *convinced* they're doing something articulatory that they're not.
Nope. Packed him and sold him for 8. And he isn't worth that either. Isn't worth 5 mil either. His finishing is not worth 9.3 mil. And that's the most important aspect for a striker IMO.
I have scoliosis, which has greatly affected my hips. It's not apparent in my posture, but I've never found it easy to run (and never could understand how others manage it for such long periods of time.) The pain is constant. I'm not a man, but I still love feeling my heart race and muscles ache, being outside, and I'm rarely in a bad mood.Then some women are cunts, and it's all because they don't have the nerve for that mindset, or the drive to simply lose weight, despite a lack of health problems otherwise. That's actually just people. Some people are gutless.
Sorry I should have elaborated. I don't mind Arabs that come to America or practice Islam here. You are right in that they are extremely hard working. I just do not like that they commit genocide in the Middle East over a religion, while in doing so goes against that religion itself.
Well, you know how people are. Just cough up some numbers to make it seem legit and it's k.Our data is biased you say? HOW DARE YOU QUESTION OUR DATA! IT ARE FACT BECAUSE PEOPLE **DIED**!
Since it doesn't seem like you have a lot of gold I think it's better to pass on this. The prices are worse than what most gold sellers post them on the AH for and those two are amongst the least desired TCG mounts.

Sometimes I have to go for the fist bump. I am a nervous weirdo and my hands are often dripping after a match. But I let them know that I'm just gross, and not meaning to be rude or anything. Everyone so far has laughed and appreciated not being subjected to my sweaty palms.Someday I'll be cool though......
Hello sabishoikouen :-)It's really nice to hear from you. What is it you feel you want out from? What is the reason you feel that you're stupid or can't process things quickly?Why do you do all this translation too from the HK news? that must take quite a lot of time?
Definitely ghetts for me, there's not really a single song of his I play and generally don't rate his flow and bars. Sounds too much like his words are getting caught on the way out of his mouth it's quite disorientating
I'm not a lawyer but don't you have to declare your assets during a divorce? I assume lying on that declaration might be construed as contempt of court.  Surprised she didn't get some jail time too. 
I find myself wanting to agree. I don't think cashing in for a later time is a bad thing inherently, especially if someone is playing a face (who are supposed to play fair.)Cash in earlier in the night, declare that you'll be facing the champ in the main event. Or cash in on Raw, declaring that you'll be facing and/or adding yourself to the main event of the upcoming PPV.
You know I have like three of those left in my fridge. I wasn't crazy about them. But I also have a few of their stouts in my fridge too and they are CRAZY GOOD.
Yes, DanMachi is great. And pretty much every moment with Hestia makes me smile, haha. She's so fun!My personal favorite is Plastic Memories. What do you think of it?
Holy shit this is amazing.... Jettas are my favorite. I got a mk6 myself, not as stanced out, since I live in Virginia and stancing is hard here, but it's definitely ridin' low.
I honestly hate the pounce, but i feel its needed. I do think however there are some bugs with it. Some dont matter some do, like for example that vid shows the goliath pounce him but they both "Teleport" between them and facing a diff way. other times, i have been pounced while i was behind the monster. I sat there shooting him, saw him go into sneak mode, then he just pounced me and i ended up a few meters in front of him as he "Jumped" away from me. He did this in mid combat when it was me support and medic waiting for the trapper. That was stupid. 
Can anyone put a tuxedo to the one on the left and a wedding dress to the one on the right? I'll greatly appreciate the work and if you can put us in like a cool background even better.The reason is because I told her I wish we could marry our characters in game if I was a male character, but there's no option in the game. So I wanted to surprise her with an awesome picture of both of us marrying each other.Thanks to everyone!
Here's one for you, some making of from the Chopper movie :) It's SUUUUPER interesting! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt2io3NPrk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt2io3NPrk)
No sport has been able to deter cheaters with sufficient punitive punishment, it just doesn't work. It is a matter of removing the opportunity to be successful. How you thoroughly catch cheaters in minor chess tournaments, I have no idea....Technology allows methods to become ever more ingenious. Imagine a chess computer the size of a postage stamp, better than any human. Its not far away. One can easily imagine a method of communicating with this chip, say using your toes, and it delivering outputs via a micro speaker or by vibration.
Just because other people are paying that much doesn't make it reasonable. As long as you aren't taking out loans to pay for it or affording it by taking out loans for other expenses. Like you said, AirBnB isn't reliable. You should budget based on the worst case scenario.
The Damien Sandow segment of every show is going to be the segment I watch in stunned silence with my hands on my face and my eyes looking on in horror just at the annihilation of what was once the best part of the show.
If you or Kip think that the Titans only had the allotted 10 minutes to trade Mariota then you've got to be kidding. It's wasn't a shock at all that Tampa was going to take Winston.
In the second grade I got the same thing.Graduated from Caltech.And funny story about that: I went up to my guidance councilor to give her the good news about my being accepted in Caltech. (I had been accepted by their early acceptance program, meaning I knew in January that I was going.) And when I told her that I had been accepted, but before I could show her the letter, she told me to stop being stupid and applying for an impossible school--that I would be better off applying to Fresno State and then eventually maybe transferring to a University of California school--but not Berkeley because that's too hard to get into.I looked at her, showed her the letter, informed her that she had mis-heard--that I had been **accepted** and not just applied, then after she read the letter and looked up at me, I looked her in the eye and said "fuck you," and left. Never interacted with her after that.
Don't stress out, 8 weeks is a lot of time. I would say keep doing what you're doing. Finish U World then write another one, at that point really start focusing on what your weaknesses are and let the NBME's guide you. TBH I wrote one 11 weeks out from my exam and got a 213 before finishing U World and having made 1 pass of pathoma etc. Now that I'm done U World and done my incorrects I'm going to give it another go. I'm also 8 weeks out currently. UWorld is the key. Take your time with it and really try to learn all the information it presents. That's just my opinion
Generally it's more of a "clicking" upon being exposed to something or the idea of something, IIRC.  Although some people just seem to have always known since they were presexual children.Similar to how some trans* individuals seem to have known since they could talk as infants and others only realize it after being exposed to knowledge of other trans* people as adults.
"It's fine. Just a little...open." *He says with a shrug, glancing around the alleyway they were in. "Hence why I'm traveling around. Seeing the sights, and all that." *He says with a forced smile, wishing that his hood could hide his whole face and not just the top half.*
In singles I like using Slurpuff as a win condition:* Slurpuff @ Sitrus Berry* Ability: Unburden* Adamant 252 Atk / 4 Def / 252 Spd* Cotton Guard* Belly Drum* Drain Punch* Play RoughAfter setting up one cotton guard, non-STAB physical steel attacks rarely endanger it. If you can get two cotton guards and a belly drum, the game is basically over. Drain Punch keeps your HP up, and Unburden gives effective 486 speed as long as you don't get Whirlwinded out. This also means that if a Choice Scarf Imposter Ditto comes in, you will always go first, so your boosts won't get stolen from you.
Past 4 months "Mariota is Chips guy! Get out of here with your logic that he won't be picked" in every thread. Mariota goes to Titans "Fuck you guys it's not over yet! You're not right, even if it's a slim chance it could happen! GTFO of this thread!"
Wearing a long skirt =/= promoting religious violence.&gt;Why did you move to France?She is 15 so most likely born there.Just stop talking, you're only making yourself look stupid.
All of the above. I'd put them in one of my Etsy shops, promo them on my blog and social media, and have them out and about when I go vend. It's more a question of what I should paint.
I know they don't have a hole on the DL but passing on Leonard Williams seems like a whiff. Will the Raiders snap him up or trade down? (Or take Amari, I guess...)
&gt; Not that she does her job anyway, she is too busy grandstanding.Not that you have any evidence of this anyway, you're just spouting your vitriolic, uninformed opinion.
Pinterest is a website where people can post photos and pin them to "boards" much like tacking photos or ideas onto a cork board. That being said, Pinterest users are notorious for posting pictures that are aesthetically pleasing, yet difficult to do just from looking at a picture.It's very possible that you either look very aesthetically pleasing, picture quality that she'd post onto a board, or you have a really cool sense of style that would be difficult to replicate. My guess would be the first :)
For the longest time it was the most effective way to make white people feel uncomfortable. But now it's so over used it just has so little affect on people.  
I've got you beat by a wide margin, age-wise, and I also am easily the best looking, in the best shape, and the most confident I've been. No comparison to any other earlier time of my life.  It takes commitment to oneself, and work, but any RP man knows that.
I have a friend who is much better than me in basketball, but he's kind of weak mentally, so I spend most of my time covering him trying to get into his head. Wouldn't be surprised to see this happen to Giannis in the future. Strong emotions in this game. Disappointed to see Giannis play down to that level. He'll learn, though.
They should just give him a freakin' leap. It's like they really wanted to just give him Anhur's 3 but felt like they couldn't because then they would look lazy. 
I actually just got home as I've been either at work, or working on term papers all day. I made this post assuming it would be preemptive, though.I just checked, and I'm still at .16 with "BEING RELEASED SOON" in the bottom right corner of the main menu.
There was no loot nerf in OS, the chests always were once a day.  What killed it was making siege blueprints tradeable and taking the portal to OS out of EBG (due to about a million requests from players).
I think the elevators get a bad rap. It's better than looking at a loading screen. And there's always some squad banter or galactic news.Congrats on the plat, it's one of my favourites despite the multiple playthroughs needed.
it doesn't make sense. the joke is the top line introduces something, then the bottom line is like something funny that's also tight. its the wrong meme. verdict: not funny.
In order for something to be libel it has to be a published false statement that is damaging to a person's reputation. A picture of a person is not a "false statement."
There's also the question: which version of the original movies? Undoctored, fixed SFX, or one of the numerous attempts by Lucas to 'fix' what wasn't broken?
I remember reading something similar to this happening in Florida. Classifying somethingas illegal, but if someone did whatever it was they immediately fell into a new category and got away with it. 
The Imp trinket is a bit better than Scales for combat, but it won't make a ton of difference. The DST is great and you even have a socket, so keep that. What's hurting you a bit here is that they're 665/670 and Scales not being amazing for combat to start with.I'd have a look at http://shadowcraft.mmo-mumble.com/ and Ravenholdt.net. I'd also keep an eye on https://twitter.com/fierydemise, especially now that 6.2 is getting closer.
This is how desperate I am for Witness news!  "Oh cool...he's unpacking something.....now he's compiling it.  Oh the shader does a thing.  Something, something, if then statements.  Cool...."
Umm I see Borderlands 2 there, 98% and $40.. Civ 5:complete is 97% and $80, Civ 5 is 97% and $70, south part stick of truth is 97% and $33, talos principle is 97% and $40 and that's where I stopped looking having handily demonstrated that your title is absolutely false.
&gt; It exists on it's own in a world of anonymity where names are easily taken and easily discarded and inherently meaningless. No, it doesn't.  This is real life.  A real human being made that, and someone is attempting to minimize the benefit they can get from providing free entertainment.  There is absolutely nothing to be gained from stopping the creator of a work from being able to enjoy the benefits of making said work except giving 4chan pseudophilosophers the opportunity to circlejerk about the magic of "anonymity".
I first got into him because my old roommate was a big fan and kept telling me to check him out, I think I fell in love with his videos when I watched him play "Knock-knock"
Probably around 300+. Not sure since I slowly played my hunter to 30, then rush my Warlock and Titan to around 28~29.But got it last week during the weekly.Ironically I got it when a friend who took a break after playing since launch who has many more hours than me still hadn't gotten it yet. But they got it the next one.So there is hope that you may luck out.Edit: Long day in the office causes me to have brain fart in grammar. 
She is right. Keeping up with the flow of traffic is essential to safe driving.  Rule of thumb  I was taught is when 1 person blows by you, he's an asshole. Two is a coincidence.  Three means I'm the asshole. 
The voice is gone at least. I kind of like how there are some "tics" like the preposition and how he sat next to Axel to show development from his old gimmick. It was just the nine-year-old comeback style that bugged.
They're not exactly competent (Google "Rutgers ddos") but thanks for the help. There's a residential network for the dorms but there's no network I can connect to besides the one for laptops.  
Let me know if you need someone who works in rehab medicine =) Occupational therapist here, the profession nobody knows about but most hospital patients need. I'd be down to answer questions on how injury impacts sensation, movement, cognition, and daily activity.
I see rounds 1 to 4 going to Pacquiao, rounds 5 to 7 goes to Mayweather, 8 to 9 to Pacquiao knocking Mayweather down in one of them, 10 to Pacquiao, 11 to Floyd, 12 to Pacquiao. I predict **MY** scorecard to be 116-111 to Pacquiao with the rounds being really close.**3 Judges scores: 115-112, 115-112, 114-113 for Pacquiao***If there is no knock down, it could possibly end up as a draw with close rounds.*
I always take mine on an empty stomach and I try to take a magnesium supplement regularly as well (it helps with the potency/tolerance I believe). Make sure you're taking the correct dosage as well
It's not "hiding" it's the basic principal of equal protection under the law. If you're wondering why it wasn't brought up previously it's because homosexuality was seen as immoral by most people until we started getting more civilized and realized it wasn't hurting anyone. Same thing as the right to marry someone of a different race. That was "hidden" until the 50s.
Where do you live? I'm in Oklahoma and our natives seem to prefer crack and crystal over pot. It's also much cheaper than any weed that would have enough trichs to produce kief
i was just addressing the 3MB/EX pulls question as noone else had, although it is a very unbalanced deck, over a 3 match game with card control and having more higher cards than lower its a necessary tactic that works well. A lot of people use the word unbalanced here when talking about RTG decks when what they really mean is too many weak cards, having 14 great cards and 6 weak ones is unbalanced but shouldnt slow you down too much, whereas vice versa it will make a big difference as the few great ones drag the others into a higher level than they can beat far sooner, meaning far longer grinding +1s for lower cards (switching to uncommon method is usually better here with this kind of deck) so going back to my first reply, its better to do that to balance out the middle of the team without moving up as quick for balance as opposed to stretching your deck with 1 higher level card that wont help in EX/KOTR and makes it harder for the back end of your RTG deck
set your whitebalance using a white card and try to use a burst mode or sports mode to take a bunch of frames.. if one of your cameras has raw mode you can also edit it later 
If you got a note in your letter box saying your house was going to blow up on Monday, would you pack your shit or would you reply on the authorities to protect you?
&gt;The only time someone 'frames' another person is when they are both intimately involved in the crime.Do you honestly believe this? As far as you are aware, no one has ever been framed for a crime they had no involvement in?
Personally I would like to see Enforcer get Fast Swap like mechanic does. Because the pistols(beagle) are so good, and shotguns currently so buggy, being able to use my pistol as my main long range engagement gun has been a necessity. Reduced fall damage could disappear from all classes and no one would miss it, when you can pull your parachute ripcord 5 meters from the ground and never take any fall damage. The Rep perks need an overhaul over all 4 classes for sure, and I agree Enforcer isn't offering the team much currently with ammo being its only draw and mechanic taking its crown as the CQC king due to shoddy shotgun hit lag :( Give us a reason to play enforcer Visceral!
Nope. Extreme Rules 2012. Tables match for the IC title. Cody gave Show a dropkick as he (Show) was on the apron and he sold it by stepping on and breaking the table. 
&gt; Today I learned breaking the law is no big deal as long as it's a little law. Especially as a cop.Seems like a pretty general statement that wasn't made about any one state or police force. 
This must the weirdest place to put this, it will probably get removed. But we need to see this, I know all you guys love Japan, but this is seriously bad.
Let's close it out tonight! My heart can't take many more close games, but it's especially bad since I want us to win so badly vs such an unlikable team like Clips.
Know how we start? The immediate removal of the Max/Comp/Trim Comp cape.I maxed in 2011, continued for comp like two years ago and said fuck it because of quests.They are quite honestly the most cancerous pieces of content in this game. If you remember, social activities such as House Parties used to thrive. I frequented them all the time just to have fun in the dungeons. Once max/comp released that *entire* niche group died out. "xp waste" was never a mainstream thing, ever, until those capes came along. The entire focus of the RS community (at least the majority) has shifted from socializing and having fun, to grinding, gaining XP, gaining items, blah blah blah.What am I even saying it will never happen lol
&gt; has usb ports but don't need a dongle attached to the computerDoesnt exist.How did you fry ALL the usb ports on your motherboard???Maybe just buy something like this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA76H2GT1742&amp;cm_re=usb_pcie-_-9SIA76H2GT1742-_-Product
Space Gates have special things attached to them though. They don't have space gates in the Milky Way, at least none were shown in SG1 other than the supergates.
I didn't know about it. And since everyone is just acting like it's obvious instead of explaining it, I still don't understand how it works. You say "lots of people try to know about things that don't always directly effect them" which is what I'm trying to do right now but nobody will actually tell me how it works.
I'm just wondering if there's any way to change the way the reply button looks since I don't like it and I figured I'd ask if there are any tweaks which could change it, it works perfectly fine but I just think it looks terrible.
Your argument still stands, I personally wouldn't say one is inherently easier to read then the other but that's just my opinion, but as a note compilers like `gcc` will actually optimize `printf` statements that only print a single string along with a ending `\n` into `puts` statements for you.
Hey Everybody. I just found an Kurki and i want to go towards ZDPS Doc. what should i roll on my weapon?http://eu.battle.net/d3/de/profile/Demitrios-2931/hero/58828561
"I want a Wii U because Nintendo lets you have access to all of their old games!"It would sell itself. These are old games that everyone has played. Most Nintendo fans have experienced all of these games. Even have a paid membership or just through amiibos if they seek profit.. I would do it.
May I know the nationalities of you two? @burnt_wick and @ChicagoBoy2011 ? I'm from the MidWest and I live not far from Jeanette Lee's club in Indianapolis. I haven't met any Americans playing snooker...
Oh, I didn't see that bit. When I see a linked post, I usually think the post you were referring to is the 3rd post down (default for context button). Now I'm not sure what to think... 
Last year the only "stupid immature shit" he did was scream FHRITP. Everything else was constantly being brought up from his past because of the bullshit rape allegations. 
Just finished DS9. Trying to watch Voyager from start to finish now. Its not bad but its like staying at a party thats dying down and all of your friends have left.
By that logic, having sex with your relatives is more natural than worshiping Jesus.Are you trying to say shit got better when we started to worship Jesus?
Solid arguments from everyone in that thread imo. The fact that it can either really help you or really hurt you when you draw it is what has me hesitating. 
I dunno. That's a good question obviously. I consider it equal to fucking a severely mentally handicapped human. It's pretty despicable behavior. It doesn't feel like it is the same as a cold blooded rape of a human but it shouldn't be brushed off as "it's just a dumb animal. Who cares?"Lots of people are saying "it's ok to kill them and milk them but not fuck them?". Yeah, I can sort of identify with the hypocrisy but we are talking about the custom of eating to survive and that is far different than just fucking a goat cause you want to. They are two different conceptsMaybe I am just feeling a way that I was taught to feel? Maybe there is no difference in killing a goat and fucking one but I feel as if it is very different
&gt; Your anecdote proves nothing about food safety...Well if you want to go down that road.  Your outrage over slightly less tasty food doesn't really prove or mean anything either.  Other then you don't really seem to understand that frozen meat will remain safe to eat ***indefinitely.***  6 days, 6 weeks, 6 months, 6 years, when it comes to **safety** it's all the same.   Now if you want to talk about flavor and texture, that's a whole different conversation.   How dare they feed anything that doesn't taste great to **young children**!   
Yeah, AokiRemix, but you seem to be a fan of [a performer who pretends to be doing skilful things when he's not..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Sxfp_Cycvg).  So maybe your contribution to this conversation, while apt in its own way, isn't all that valuable.
Dunno if this is a thing in other parts of the us, but I (and other people i know) say "yeah, no" all the time. It works to kind of change the direction of the conversation. Like if I digress too much I'll say "but yeah, no I really liked it." Or something along those lines.
I think you need to have both of those for any of what they are planning to work. Daycare costs can be the cost of a mortgage for two kids, hell sometimes one kid.
I have to use the sarcasm tag. Sorry that came out way too aggressive. Believe me I know its a few loud-mouth cretins giving an entire sport a bad name.Sorry dude.
no, they are related in the fact that one platform (or set of platforms) got fucked over on each of them. what's wrong with his statement is him blaming PC gamers for overkill's shitty business practices and acting like they deserve a broken MK for it. 
Hold two separate award tickets on the route (award holds are 5 days) then book one of them. You should get the 10% within the hold period and at that point, pay for the second hold
1. I don't like crit reds anymore after the static shivv nerf. I think lifesteal quints are viable , I just personally dont take them.2. I feel like jungle yasuo could be viable, but it's just not possible in the tank meta we're in right now. And if you think support yasuo is bad, you should try out a kalista/yasuo bot lane. Its pretty nasty.3. I go a lot of AD because I like to trade very aggressively in the early game, and gain my lead off of that. A lot of people even in master/challenger don't expect Yasuo's level 2 damage with AD runes.4. I could see someone going Cutlass first, but I personally would never do it. I 100% always rush Static Shivv just because of the huge damage spike.5. Yeah, Yasuo is definitely a "tank buster" His ult just shreds through tanks. You should be able to 1v1 any tank at level 16.
You'd be surprised how abrupt some of the changes related to aging can seem. I feel like one day I woke up and bam, a huge vein across my boobs that I had never noticed before.I won't jump on the anti-OP bandwagon here but you may benefit from a session or two of couples therapy prior to starting to try for a baby so that you two can work to sort out the fact that you (I'm assuming) got married for reasons beyond the fact that you're both 10s and that your relationship will withstand the inevitable toll that time takes on all of us. I think you may also benefit from considering that do many things about pregnancy are really out of our control. It concerns me when you say that you will "only gain the minimum doctor recommended amount." This really sounds like you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Even the best of plans can be completely sidetracked by medical wmergencies, being put on bed rest, etc., and you should address those possibilities as well. Good luck. 
Definite starter potential there. Byron Jones is a super freak athlete, might take a bit of time to refine his skills. Peters is a big, physical, man corner, but will have to learn how to play off. Both could be get significant play time right away though.
God, same. And yes, I love them! They're so nice and they're magnetic too, which is fun because they snap together and the like. The blushes I have are Orgasm and Desire, and they're both so lovely. I'm so hesitant with blush which leaves me usually blush-less, though. I really wish I could just slather it on and show it's beauty.And I hear about Ruby Woo all the time. I'm thinking about getting it tbh but how much different is it from Russian Red, if you know? So many reds already...
Save states are the issue. You need deterministic character physics and efficient resimulation of all game entities (Stage effects, particles, audio).Time and moolah.Time and moolah they had.
Did anybody read [Gladwell's article](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/04/the-engineers-lament) in the latest new yorker? Like I'm usually not a huge fan of gladwell, but as an engineering / econ double from undergrad it made me think just how many of these issues apply equally to economists.&gt; To the engineer, a car sits somewhere on the gradient of acceptability. To the public, a car’s status is binary: it is either broken or working, flawed or functional.If you replaced a few words, this could just as well apply to the general public's perception of economic problems. Economists make policy recommendations fully conscious that there are tradeoffs involved with any policy. But the general public loves seizing on specific failures and crying foul at the whole system.I was kind of impressed that a general interest publication published a long form article that is actually sympathetic to the expert's point of view.

You will get crushed by pretty much everyone in PvP. 3 ADP will get you hit in every roll. And even if you manage to dodge an attack the 69% equip load will make it easy for the opponent to just backstab you after the roll. Also you chose a very slow main weapon that relies on poise while you don't have any.You have the range advantage but every half decent player will close the distance with 2-3 rolls and then you're screwed.It may be fun in theory but I doubt you will have much fun in praxis.
&gt; amount of peopleAgree with the sentiment, but can't resist jumping on the criticism train with you... I know, I know... I'm sorry...&gt; ~~amount~~ number of people
Yeah I read that one also. If it was a remote site like new housing area with little traffic for a couple hours I could see that but I'm too paranoid for that. I'd be worrying about it being hauled off or tipped over.  That would literally be a shitty situation!
It's realistic, though. Actual space programs don't engineer for optimal flight performance, they engineer for optimal cost performance. And the basic rule is "engines expensive, fuel cheap", leading to as much fuel as possible to be put atop an engine. Also, seeing a gigantic rocket slowly ascent from the pad just looks epic.For instance, the first stage (boosters included) of the Ariane 5 (GS variant) produces a thrust of 15,175 kN at liftoff with a liftoff mass of 777,000 kg. Liftoff TWR of 1.9. The core burns about 231 kg of fuel per second. After the boosters burn out after 140s, it has lost 546 tons in it's boosters, and 32.34 tons in it's core stage, leaving the total mass at 198.66 tons. Thrust goes down to 1,015 kN, bringing TWR down to a whopping 0.5. My rockets never fall into negative twr during ascent, so I lowered launch twr to adjust.
&gt; In Oregon, all an employer can legally say is that you worked for them for those dates, and I think whether they would how you again.That simply isn't true. Your employer may tell you this to explain why they have a policy of saying nothing more than what dates you worked. they may have such a policy to protect them from getting sued for libel or slander. But they retain a First Amendment right to say whatever they would like to about you it's simply that they choose not to do so for fear (probably ill-founded fear) of being sued.
When I was in middle school, 7th grade I think? It was PE and we were out on a field playing football and we just hear a bit of yelling from a nearby culdesac that led to the field , then BOOM BOOM BOOM. The coaches ran us inside and locked down the locker room. I went to school in a not so nice part of time. I have plenty of crazy stories about that place.
Lol..I don't even know what to say about that story, but it had a happy ending. That's good. But would you ask your six-year-old to try instead of yourself?
Europeans tend to have a "pure-bred" sort of look. This is changing now as there is increased immigration into European nations, but in the case of people whose families have been living in one country for hundreds of years, they tend to look very much like their countrymates. Americans tend to be mutts, mixed from all the people who immigrated to America over the years. Most white people are combinations of Irish, British, German, French, Italian, and a bunch of others they don't even know. If you look at them and try to guess their ancestry it will be pretty hard, since they look like a mix. TL;DR: If you can't tell where someone is from, they're American. If they're white and have a strong look that reminds you of people from a certain country, they're probably European. 
[M] I figured it'd be an appropriate response to a critical failure on a d100, huehuehue.[S] One of the most notable pieces was a New York Times article blasting the Chinese government for alleged hypocrisy-pointing out how several plutocrats who backed the Chinese Communist Party have been allowed to maintain or even enhance their personal fortunes.  It was in English, but a city as cosmopolitan as Shanghai would have significant numbers of foreign language speakers.
I went to a house party where a girl did that too, she fucked a few guys before she committed to staying naked and all the guys just put their clothes back on. She was not attractive at all, I kept thinking it was like that nightmare where you're naked giving a speech but for her it was real.
If anything, Superman makes Batman more necessary, because Batman is the only person who could devise a plan to actually take Superman out if he ever turned against mankind.
There is a difference though between punishing a criminal lightly and punishing an innocent person. I get much more angry at the latter since our system should be set up to not do that. Obviously punishing criminals lightly is a problem, but punishing the innocent is an even bigger problem.
Only they can truly reform Islam. IMO, they're are very convincing arguments that completely dismantle the Hadith literature. Hopefully then Islam will become a docile religion like Christianity. 
That "don't weigh me" thing is so dumb. Do these people not understand that a lot of medications prescribed are based on weight? The doctor can't just go "Ehhh, you look about 250," give them.a dosage based on that weight, and it ends of doing nothing because the person is actually 350. Or the opposite, doctor thinks they're heavier than they are and ends up killing them because they had way too high a dose of medication. 
Also, I just replaced my turn signal lenses too, I bought these and was pleased with the quality. just fyi  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Side-Corner-Parking-Light-Lens-Right-for-Volvo-240-86-93-/350577727715?fits=Year%3A1992|Make%3AVolvo&amp;hash=item51a00f98e3&amp;vxp=mtr 
I'm seeing this a lot on this sub "Can I not fix this known bad part?" If you want it to run properly you have to fix it, I don't know how bad it is bent but it must be pretty decent to eye it. If that axle is not spinning as designed it is going to be throwing weight around every revolution and causing more wear than you bargained for. It sucks, I give people bad news every single day, but its the cost of driving, and its random as all hell.
What's a good nature for a competitive Yveltal? I'm doing a run through Pokemon Y to catch myself an HP Ice Zapdos and I mind as well catch the other 3 Legendaries.. :/ What about Zygarde?Personally, I'm thinking of a Hasty/Naive nature for Yveltal, but let me know. Thanks!PS: Master Ball donations would be cool (or cheap ones *cough* PowerSaves people), lol.

Well, its a controller that seems to be for an NES gaming system. Judging by its appearance id say it has a D Pad for controlling movement, A and B buttons for actions, and turbo A and B buttons for performing them quickly. 
a company I worked for ran and SMS service mainly for server monitoring and such, but companies can and did use it for membership reminders and such.If you replied with *anything* you'd be placed on the opt out list. Searching over the opt out list for random curse words was always good for a laugh.
I think Amethyst getting taken out repeatedly says less about the relative strength of the monster and more about how headstrong Amethyst is.  I'm sure that if the monster went after Garnet or Pearl it would have a much harder time doing any kind of real damage.Another thing to consider is that it catches Amethyst by surprise just about every time.  When she actively goes and attacks it she holds her own until her body gives out and Garnet distracts her.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN, I GOT A HUNT 2 KIRIN TO LEVEL 140 AND GODDAMN, ITS LIKE THESE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME BEFORE, EATING EVERY ATTACK AND SPAMMING POTIONS LIKE ITS LOW RANK, AND COMPLETELY IGNORING KIRINS WEAK SPOT, MAKE THE QUEST TAKE FOREVER AND RISK CARTING EVERY 2 SECONDS. ITS NOT LIKE WAITING FOR OPENINGS IS HARD, PARTICULARLY AGAINST ELDER DRAGONS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PUNISH RECKLESSNESS LIKE NOTHING ELSE.
I'm honestly having a hard time coming up with an interpretation of that claim that's remotely controversial or surprising. Can you help me out? Are you asking me to explain why people *expect* college campuses to be safer, or why they are safer in fact?
I'll always upvote the Keyes loop, though I don't know if it's so much a tactic as it is strategic brilliance. Commander Keyes saw an opportunity and he took it, but I highly doubt you could ever recreate it.On a related note, I'm a fan of the time a young Preston Cole dropped an emergency beacon mid-battle with Insurrectionist forces and, as soon as the two ships' docking bays lined up, he fired a missile straight into their gut.There's also his last stand, wherein he literally destroyed an entire fleet by dumping a whole fuckton of nuclear bombs into a gas giant and briefly turning it into star. Shame it ### *killed him in the process*.
Probably because you're not as fierce a competitor as he is. When you're giving it your all, you tend to become pretty irritable, and even the slightest of things can get you to go off.
Ha, that's awesome! I run a derevi "creature tribal"... It has a whopping 54 creatures in it and plays similar to a sliver or elf deck.Everyone is afraid of derevi, but without winter orb or Stax she's not very oppressive at all and much more fun to play with/against. When people say derevi is a problem, I just show them this deck and say " Derevi's not the problem, Winter Orb is the problem!". http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/bantsploitation/
The largest province is the wasteland in Quebec and is, in terms of size on the map, about as tall as the distance between Athens and Danzig, and about as wide as the distance between Paris and Constantinople.The largest non-wasteland provinces is probably Kola, but that's only due to map distortions - IRL that territory is about the same size as Romania.
&gt;Are they secular opposition Yes and no. Southern Front is the most secular by far and I have strong doubts that some form of Sharia law won't be introduced because of the Sunni majority driving the revolution and how important Sharia is to the culture. Although Sharia law if introduced by the FSA wouldn't be anywhere close to what JAN would introduce. Still secularism is a very touchy thing in modern Arab states and is usually frowned upon, even by moderates. &gt;How separate are the fsa from the JaN coalition? They work together and support each other's interest, but ideologically they're different. However FSA has said "We are all Nusra" before. &gt;Are there Islamist brigades in in their forces? Yes&gt;And is that why this question is so complicated?This war is complicated

You know that the left is strongly divided, eh? At least rightwingers have the same values on average (family, church). On the left, you have SJWs who hate men, gays who hate bis and other gays, feminists that hate men (including trans men), trans who hate cis etc.You should just associate with reasonable people (including gay men who have no phobias). 
Wow, what a brilliant, well-thought out and fantastically-executed argument, with loads of information and background research to back up your claim./s :)
I know you already know it, but this is what happens when you stay with somebody who cheated on you.Also "i's" isn't a word. The word for that is "my." 
 I trust that film makers (especially high-budget features) won't waste money on films that aren't going to be watched by as many people as possible. They're very good at it by now. I can't imagine that they *don't* cater to the market as attitudes change over the years. I suppose it could be argued they're almost the perfect cultural barometer. If films are male-centric, then only a tiny majority of people seem to care, and they're not going to make any changes to the film industry.
How do you smoke these little balls? I keep seeing them on the sub and dont want to be caught in a more awkward than average situation with these someday
&gt;  i like shahzamSomeone not shitting all over ShahZaM on reddit.. that's a first. I don't know why he gets the consistent level of hate that he does honestly.
Doesn't madara say something like if you had aimed a little higher you would have killed me.. Or something like that. You can't have guy beat the "main" villain, that would be dumb when the show is about Team 7.Addition:Thats what I mean by plot. Eight gates guy was very capable of doing it but wasn't allowed to because the series was ending and Madara was the main villain at the time. It had to be like that, I'm not saying it was a problem like plot armor, but that's just how this stuff works. I would actually be kinda upset if madara killed naruto and sasuke and then guy sacrificed himself to end madara. Like seriously if that was the ending I would shed a few man tears for kakashi.

That's my issue with Hungry Dragon as well - it feels like more of a "get *more* ahead" sort of card. Now, I think those cards definitely have a place in the game, they just don't suit my preferred style of play.
When I was a child, I had a recurring dream where my parents were divorced. My Dad lived in a trailer. There was a monster that lived outside near his trailer. Whenever my sister and I would visit the trailer, the monster would come looking for us. Sometimes, I'd be stuck outside with the sky black and red flowers all around waiting for the monster to find me.
utapsweets really came through. they processed my initial request so quickly and when i mentioned that i was missing a few items, i received a speedy response and received said items without any issues or delay. they made this entire process pleasant and i couldn't be happier. thank you again! :)
I use to think it was odd at first until my two year old niece would kiss me goodbye and I made a big deal about her kissing me on the lips. My sister told me don't be such a fucking homo, she loves you, lol. There is an age when it gets inappropriate though and I started kissing her on the cheek and forehead at around five when I would drop her off for school. 
IF you are doing leg work that day that is a terrible idea...probably not  agreat idea for upperbody eaither, if you are doing tabattas right you shoudl be really drained...
It's not just race, it's gender too.Like when that female astronaut went crazy, Lisa Nowak. Many people were thinking how poorly it reflected on women, how women aren't fit to be astronauts, and related the whole issue to women instead of just her. If a male astronaut went crazy like that, no one would be using thinking that men shouldn't be astronauts.
&gt; Cynosural beacons have long been used as an in-space tribute to lost and missing comrades, most notably Imperium member Vile Rat.Couldn't have just said Goon? 
I just want to say this is a lot of fun watching the draft with you guys, except for that motherfucker that called me Toby.  It's almost like a game day thread.
Yeah good job on the edit. Be careful about which one you buy. They tend to need a lot of space and good airflow, perfect for an unfinished basement or attic. There is the possibility of ducting airflow through them though that raises the upfront costs but also helps by diverting cold air outside during the winter but inside during the summer. What models are you looking at?
Titans trade you their first round pick for your second and the condition that you start Tebow at quarterback all season, unless NFL signed doctors decide he's physically incapable.
You're mostly right. In New Testament Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and then in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman. THIS FLOWCHART IS A STRAW MAN.
To some extent, blaming the world can be ok. I blame the world for monopolized education. I would love to be in school right now, but don't have the large sum of money necessary and don't want to go into debt.
gosh, i guess i can't really defend my facetious remark.the stronger point is that harry dismissed muggles as not doing anything of interest in the 1200s, when they were certainly doing things of interest. they started putting clocks in european towns and keeping track of time. accurately navigating and mapping the seas with compasses and other cool sea navigation devices.oh, there's also the fact that half of the european population died under not very well understood conditions, soon after magic started to decline. worth further consideration!note: i am aware of a eurocentric bias here, but i support that with the idea that perhaps the decline in magic is specific to location. i don't remember exactly what knowledge declared 800 years ago as the timestamp, but i am certainly neglecting china and egypt and the middle east because i have little knowledge there. thought i know they had clocks thousands of years ago.
As a side note, I'm here in Emporia, KS spectating the tournament with /u/weatherstation, so we probably won't be very active online during the day, but you might see us in the gallery if you are watching the live coverage! :)
Btw, any tips on how I can make my game go better when trying to take over everything?  I try to conquer stuff but it always wants to bitch at me that I need cassus bellums or something.

It's not a "mainstream" thing though. It's never entered mainstream culture, you've never seen anyone saying it on the 5 o'clock news, and that makes all the difference here.Saying that someone's grandmother, who may very well have been a victim of discrimination herself, is in any way comparable to the sheer number of people you see repeating the phrases this article is talking about is a massive false equivalency.
I guess that's technically possible. But Correa is still in AA. He has get promoted to AAA, then continue to hit ridiculously for an extended period to even have a shot at being promoted. By then, we're after the All-Star break and Lowrie might be back, and who knows where the Astros will be record-wise? Correa seems to be one of those real talents where having that extra season of control down the line really makes a difference. There is a lot of talent in that organization. Just my opinion.
I'm just happy to know someone is sharing my frustration! I've gotten so used to reading the update before going to sleep, it's become routine. It's 2:30 am. I need to sleep. But... I... Cant... Deej! Come on buddy! Let me sleep :'(
That's definitely not true of Japan.  Middle schools  (≈12-15 yo) are not streamed. Senior High Schools (≈16-18 yo) have entrance exams for tech schools and academic schools  --  and I think it's a pretty good distinction actually.  If you want to do a trade, why study French?  Some of the elite senior high schools are very competitive to get into, but plenty aren't.  It also provides a pathway for poor but bright kids to get into a good university without a private education.
I can do any time tomorrow between 9am and 1pm EST. Unfortunately I'll be traveling for the rest of the weekend and don't know when I'll be able to get an internet connection.
Ya exactly, that's what i was getting at.  Which is why those meters are "felt" over common time signatures, cuz who wants to write or read in 3/3 or 3/5?  Haha so I guess OP should just subdivide a more common meter to get what he is looking for
The singing is better in this scene, but the singing wasn't bad to begin with - that's the problem. The singing is supposed to be bad in that scene, but in the Spanish version, it was fine. Not great singing, but not bad either.
&gt;I really enjoy reality TV, especially the kind where all the cameramen have to do is follow people around. No real plot, no plans, nothing extraordinary. Do you mean bs like this :http://www.kabeleins.de/tv/achtung-kontrolleAnd here something crazy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCveijvx_-E&amp;list=PL8WdbyA7d6JD-TwvqUlGcSYRopO_DciiDWell german TV is not so good. I think the only things that are good here are documentarys like Terra X, Quarks &amp; Co etc.
We should have kept Rod,  writing him off then was one of the biggest mistakes in spurs history.   He went on to have a better career than any spur at pg until parker. Instead we ran the only true second star to play next to Robinson,  in his prime, out of town.  We did it a second time with rodman. Rod, Willie Anderson, Elliott, Robinson, and maybe Rodman would have won a few chips. 
There is nothing wrong with people having children, in fact we need the population.One of the big problems is a lack of easy access to supermarkets because low income families often do not have cars. If they don't have easy access to public transport people often revert to buying less than nutricious food at the local corner store or chippy. It's also why when I was at school the porer kids were more likely to buy a pie from the tuck shop for lunch whereas the middle class kids tended to have packed lunches.

In addition to SkyUI, I would say Skyrim Unbound. It removes the really fucking long cart ride at the start, and you can drop in as just some random traveller in the world and go from there. It doesn't start the main story, it is just a sandbox. You can pretty much do everything as usual, but without the rails at the start.
&gt; Getting my ass kicked, being overwhelmed by the passive tree &amp; stats I didn't understand (charges for example), etc. It made me fall in love with PoE.If you're not a strong willed/hardcore player this would be incredibly discouraging, information isn't readily available and you have to go out of your way to understand how eg. charges work by looking to the wiki.I noticed the sort of tutorial when I first started on the beta client, I think this just needs to be expanded significantly through all of normal.Having Nessa guaranteed to have a ring would work, perhaps the quest description for it could mention she *might* have one to sell. Additionally it would be a good opportunity to basically explain vendor recipes with an iron ring and a blue gem.
I've got a baseball and hockey game both on, so only enough attention to spare for watching the website. A question for those of you watching, what's it like without the legion of Jets fans in attendance? 
Is really depends on the market and your current industry experience. For instance, if you have experience in the asset management industry and are a CPA in either New York, Boston or Kansas City you will be a highly sought after asset.

&gt; I don't see why anybody should make claims about things they know no one knows.Well, if it's the first step in a series of things that might lead to new knowledge (ie, a scientist making a hypothesis) then it's reasonable. But otherwise, I agree that people should be prepared to support their claims with evidence if they wish to be taken seriously.&gt;  A statement of belief is sufficient.Keep in mind that someone who says "I believe a god exists" *is* making a claim.

Or if your upload speed on your home network isn't stellar. I tried the Vita remote play from not-in-the-house, it's basically unusable for me. MAYBE if I was patient I could use it to log into Destiny and go buy shit from Xur on a weekend. But I wouldn't be able to actually play the game effectively.
I think it's largely just cultural now since a lot of these problems are fixable with computers now, but were the legitimate reasons it's become this way culturally. 
I wouldn't take or ask for a penny from him ever, especially because of that last part at the end about money = control. Even if he turns around and offers it to you, tell him something along the lines of "I don't need shit from you." I'm sorry you lost out on a parent helping you out when a normal parent would, and that a promise was broken, but I wouldn't pursue the matter. 
Congratulations.  Hope you have fun, although I would definitely make sure you have a plan to travel to at least a few other destinations than just Cairns.  Australia has lots of great places to visit.  Hire a car / van and drive down the east coast over a few weeks. Shouldn't cost too much. 
SEO optimization is including a lot of keywords in your title to make it more likely to show up when those words are searched. This isn't really that, since the title is explanatory, not a word dump.
My only advice is not to mess with any shit you don't know much about. Why would you /want/ to get into paranormal stuff? Like really, it most likely won't end up well for you.

So did Yacht Club Games work with Rare to include this secret level? I mean this is only a level on the Xbox One, and everyone is hoping for a Battletoads announcement this E3. Maybe this is a sign?
I dunno, I prefer a definitive answer to a complex problem. Especially if it can be said in a single sentence and reaffirms all my biases. It's a big cozy blanket of assuredness.  
Thanks for the input. This was my first track I recorded with a friend (the drummer) so I'll be sure to tell him someone liked his drumming. I'll definitely just record and practice and record and practice my singing. As far as tuning, I was really excited to finally be able to record (we live in the cold midwest and record in a barn) that it just slipped my mind. Also thanks for the compliment on the lyrics. It really affirms what I was iffy about. Just thanks in general, it means a lot that you listened. I liked your track insomnique by the way. I wish I could sing with that much confidence. I also Liked the instrumental progression of the guitar and drums with the organ sounds. I know it was a demo but the way the vocals were layered over the instrumental felt kind of flat, for lack of a better word.edit: I also really liked WAKING DEAD too. Also, The Only Song I Ever Wrote is fucking amazing.
If machines can provide for an easy living for everyone, so what if some people choose not to contribute materially to society.  I think many who don't just don't know how because their family and peer network all struggle at shitty, useless jobs, and they didn't have access to productive and creative people to learn from.  Many people would use free time to do awesome things because contributing creatively to the world is a basic human drive it seems to me.  Look at open source software and the hacker/maker crowd. If someone is too depressed to do anything productive, requiring them to eat less and evicting them won't help them.

That's just straight up mental illness on the mother's part, and probably a lot of mind-fuckery directed at her son to make him think this is in any way normal. They both need to get help.
IMO 25 mph is for a reason like a school zone. No way get pulled over. Doing the allowed min on a highway which I believe is 40 in a 70 could get you pulled over if causing traffic issues. I would guess be an easy ticket to get out of though. "So I am not allowed to go the posted speed limit?"

Interesting! This will be very very very important information actually. This was the resource I was using to determine if I could donate [link](http://www.fec.gov/ans/answers_general.shtml#Can_nonUS_citizens_contribute). I don't have a green card, so I think I am still considered a foreign national, despite being considered a permanent resident for tax purposes. I've always believed that a non-citizen could not vote, do you have any resources that state otherwise. I'm going to look into it too, specifically I'm in California. 
All the molten Rex weapons look pretty cool. The gunlance looks especially badass, but I currently need a rathalos ruby *and* a dire blastheart for it. Fuck that. 
At ng-conf, they stated that clearly that their strategy was to watch the traffic patterns for Angular.io (v2.0) and Angularjs.org (v1.x), and as the traffic shifted, it would determine when they start promoting 2.0 over 1.x. Those same analytics would also influence where resources get allocated, and how long v1.x is supported. That fits with the idea that Google is very driven by analytics.
The specific frame I linked was kind of tongue in cheek, I only linked it because it was also pink, but the thought behind it was sincere... if I had a frame prone to cracking that shit would be gone before I bothered to charge the battery. I've also had a boner for a hardtail sportster for a while, which is why that's probably how I'd go, but if you're willing to spend an extra ~$500 or whatever you could just get a replacement softail like frame. That said, I kinda dig the paint scheme, looks like 1992 to me.

I'm talking about all noise recently. For instance, some guy thinks that tampons and pads are not necessary for women and then there are the big topic issues of fat shaming and thin privilege. There's just a lot of "he said she said" flying around. I don't mean to call people out, but I can't help but feel we can get caught up in it all and not remember that being a woman is actually kind of awesome.

My mouse always used to hide under some furniture in my dorm room. I would routinely move it to get the mouse and put it in its cage for the night. Then one night I did that, and heard an awful scratching noise. It was *between* the two pieces of furniture instead of under one. I put it in my hand and watched the color fade from its eyes. I cried a lot. The thing is, mice are small, fragile and curious creatures. It's hard to keep them in one piece. You're not to blame.
Ah ok, I think he's smart for sure, but like I said I still don't consider him tough. People have gotten in his head before and that's why I don't consider him tough. I respect your opinion, and can understand where you're coming from.
Accept it? ACCEPT IT?! Lets draw parallel here and say that in your precious little PvE carebear circle, right before you get into a space station to unload your cargo the station up and disappears on you. Sure this may not happen every time, but maybe half the time the stations you fly to vanish and you have to seek out another. But here is the catch, the stations are never in the same place and are on the move.Then to top it all off, when you read the forums said stations are complaining that people keep docking in them and taking their money! Oh noes!You've created your perfect little world for you and your ilk, kindly keep your opinions the #@$% out of ours.
I think you're pretty cute already. I am definitely happy that you are trying to lose more weight only because being overweight is very unhealthy. I think your long hair is pretty hot, it is definitely coming back into style for a lot of men. If it gets long enough, try doing one of those sexy buns. I am female so I don't know if my opinion will help you much but I can definitely seeing you being stupid fucking hot once you lose some weight. As I said before, however, you are still cute to me now. Its all about the way you rock it and present yourself. Biggie Smalls was married to Faith Evans dude, all you gotta do is dream.
You're much too focused on the direct "hard skills" associated with most other fields.  Philosophy, for example, would tend to reinforce soft skills that translate easily to any other field....critical thought being one of the best examples.
Yeah, thats my point. You can spend about 200 bucks on a router that will get you damn close your full speed on wifi, and then you can stream your 4k 60fps porn when you are laying in bed.
My mom likes black licorice. Her taste buds are definitely non-functional as evidenced not only by the disgusting black licorice but also the insane amounts of garlic she's able to tolerate when she cooks things. She must not be a vampire though so that's good. 
If you are in massachusetts call the state office in charge of insurance. I have forgotten what its called, but you can find it on the mass.gov website. Mass has strong consumer protection laws and I'm pretty sure they can't drop you fro selling your house. If you are not in Mass, try whatever equivalent office your state has. 
I understand your point and my friend has raised this issue as well. I will be sure to keep it in mind.I am going to see how that works. I am about 10 min from my office and where I am working is pretty relaxed, so hopefully it will be doable. Thank you for the advice!
Reading your comment put a picture in my head... What if someone modded the game to turn either the main character or a companion into a Besalisk, with duel doublebladed laser swords?! I just picture running around as Krell hacking away at enemies. You would need so much additional animation to get it to work, but I think it would be fun.

I would say you could have a bad antenna cable or the connectors are not tightened, but more likely your antenna is not optimal for your situation.  Your antenna is indoor and Omnidirectional, which picks up signals in a 360 donut shape for about 10-12 miles at best, but most of your channels are from a single direction about 15-17 miles away. A better alternative is a Directional outdoor antenna, which picks up signal in a smaller lateral arc but with a longer reception area that accounts for signal reflection caused by obstructions.  Pointed at the SW at about 232 degrees,  a directional outdoor antenna on the roof or at about 20 feet height and with no obstruction from buildings or trees should pick up at least 13 channels, possibly 15.  
Well I'm seventeen, so my Pre-Raid rituals are a little less dicey. Take the usual piss, if needed the shit as well. I post on LFG, looking for a group. I gather my weapons from the extension or app, and then I crank up Spotify. Then I take my sixteen CapriSuns, snort a yard long line of crushed up Smarties, inject myself with a 1000ccs of pure Grape Kool-Aid, and call it good. All jokes aside, mine is pretty normal, the players just change every week.
Manipulating reviews to extort people is as old as reviews themselves. Claiming impropriety of reviewers because you received bad reviews is only minutes younger.Business owners have a clear conflict of interest when it comes to claims made against those who review them. Ethically speaking, you should be very suspect of their claims and take them with a huge tablespoon of salt.So to answer your question (sort of), the more that make the claim, the more likely someone would have some proof. So doesn't it make you wonder why so many businesses claim that Yelp has acted inappropriately but not a single one of them can offer up any shred of actual proof?
Congrats on graduation!Just living the dream here near Vancouver... Working mornings... Counting down to our annual Vegas vacation... Got my mom's 74th birthday, and a great aunts 94th birthday in May too...
"We girls are different.  We have to be pampered because we're delicate and refined." *scarfs down dog food*Wen's aging scene reminded me of Indiana Jones.  Only creepier.A lot of theme stuff has already been talked about, but let's not forget the first scene.  Spike is on the operating table having his fake eye put in before he jolts out of the memory.  He's obviously got some heavy stuff in his past that made him who he is.  [Spoiler] (/s "The fake eye is also mentioned in the same episode as his last bang to refer to his past.")
I would love to get Yoshi's New Island. Everyone says it's bad but I think I'd enjoy it. It definitely has cute going for it! Thanks for being such a great sport.
Nowhere in the Torah does it say there needs to be a physical or blood sacrifice to repent. There were also incense and flour sacrifices. Also I answered your question of "How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice?" There are other commandments we cannot perform due to our exile. Such as pilgrimage to the Temple for the festivals, many tithes, any many laws associated with ritual purity and impurity. Check out Leviticus 5:11-13 where it tells what to do if you can't afford birds for sacrifice. This clearly shows that a blood sacrifice is not needed.
Testing some things on the assassin. Playing with arcane strike (?). When progressing with normal gear (could have been a white katar), I 1 shot normal mephisto with a 3 charge arcane strike. Will see how it is higher lvl but low level scaling is pretty ridiculous. There aren't any synergies, maybe synergize with Mind Blast? I feel the damage won't be any good come hell.
&gt; He can make exactly the same kind of jokesHe literally cannot do that.  Late night shows are bland by default.  Politics is bad for ratings. 
It'd be hacky but you could probably do it in CSS using a combination of :after and/or nth type to place the lines there. Maybe like a 1px wide background placed in there.

Agreed. I'm really disappointed in him. As a guy with a temper I can relate, but he needs to keep it cool and in perspective in a situation like this. He may have got a short term emotional release, but it's going to cost his team and in the long run, it's going to eat at him as a personal failure. Hopefully he'll reflect on it and improve himself.
I have, and she acts as if everything is normal and she doesn't know what I'm talking about. The family issues were with her mother, so this is unrelated, but I figured if she wants move out now, she isn't going to want to live together in the future either. 
Not really. Just means that you don't have time to do it yourself! I'm sure you could if you had a hand with the app work. It takes a lot of effort to make an awesome app with a back end when you want to get it to market asap. 
[Death Note](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1535/Death_Note) would be the obvious one.[Fate/Zero](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero) is another one that fits this very well. [How to get into Fate](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/seriesfaq-fate).However my personal opinion is screw that and just watch Zero.
Does this benefit Portland in any way, in terms of the salary jump not happening yet, so maybe he'll make less than he would of had he signed a new contract a year or two from now, allowing us to pay other guys more? I have no idea how this shit works, just asking.
good stuff! I've been thinking to myself for a while that someone should start up a streetwear/supreme related podcast. if you decide to have guests on in the future hmu.ps: apple juice is aight
My thoughts exactly; I hadn't ever seen Italian gun camera footage.  You just can't compete with eight .50s with an assload of ammunition.  Of course, late-war German interceptors had an almost comical amount of firepower (4 x 30mm Mk 108s), but only carried ammunition for one pass against a bomber wing; they couldn't just go crazy like a Thunderbolt driver could.
Agreed, though the end of the article does mention 32GB and 64GB versions were upcoming (hopefully for not absurd prices). I just wish it didn't have capacitive buttons and a poor GPU.Edit: mistaken on the GPU, getting my phones mixed up.
A lot of this will technically fall under commercial use since you are providing a service.Check your area for SAR groups. Some of them might be doing this anyway whether they are allowed to or not.
Depends on the context. If you're doing like yardwork or construction or any other kind of outdoors-y, manual labor-type activity, I wouldn't think twice about someone wearing cargo pants.

I was hoping he'd go to Washington because I'm a Skins fan and because I have their draft collectible. Oh well, looks like it will be another similar OLB.
Yeah, that's bad. (At least for Bards, I'd imagine the same would be for Summoners).Bards should always keep their dots up if possible to maximize dps and have bloodletter recharge as much as possible. Occasionally they may fall off during a song or a mechanic, but they should go up asap.Also, there is a bug that if the dot doesn't appear under the boss health bar because there are too many dots, it won't reappear if it is refreshed before its cooldown.
This honestly *does* feel like she is excited in a history buff sort of way, the same way I was excited when I saw the Grand Canyon for the first time, just because the location has bad memories attached does not mean we have to be sad when we go, we all enjoy history in our own way. For example, slavery is shitty but I really want to learn all about it, why it was done, the benefits and negatives to early human slavery and all that.. does that make me racist or a piece of shit? No, it makes me someone excited to learn about human history.

I was single for so long that when I finally got back into a relationship, it was difficult to sleep with someone next to me. Didn't help that he wasn't used to sharing the bed either, and often curled up with my extra body pillow and blankets - thus giving me even less room and making his body like a thousand degrees so I couldn't get close to him. If I kicked off the blankets, he'd somehow get cold.  That relationship has since ended, and I'm dating someone new and I absolutely love sleeping next to him. He's the first person who I am comfortable being big spoon to. He does hog the bed a little, and I've woken up squished between him and my cat, but he talks in his sleep and it's absolutely adorable so I forgive him for sprawling out. It's also partially my fault for only having a double.
Because when he jumpscares you he suddenly turns into Pac-Man and he goes like: WAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKAWAKA All over your face
The document isn't illegal. Forcing OP to sign it likely is. WA allows an employee to pass up meal breaks and this form is encouraged by the labor board in that situation.
Besides Dylan, most of the hype surrounding these guys wears off very very quickly. I think Nat Wolff generated more buzz all across social media when he was being speculated than Asa Butterfield has which is kind of concerning.
I don't think you understand. Local currency in Germany is the Euro. For a 25 k USD prize pool you need to buy dollars. And since the euro lost a lot of value recently it's more expensive for Take to provide the prize pool compared to previous years.

What I love is the childish boy scout version of superman. The simple do good no matter the cost. The simple non judgmental.. non political hero who protects the weak. And never backs down from being that. All the power in the world, and he just wants be good.Superman makes me still cry like he did when I was a little boy. I wish he was real, to make so many bad things stop. I know we'll never have him, but we can try to be superman... Yeah I know this'll be down voted and people will bash on me no doubt. But superman is a hero to me.. 
Seriously! I was talking to my high school counselor about taking AP classes because I wanted to go to university. They told me no and that I should instead focus on getting out of high school, taking the easier classes, and getting an AA at JC/CC or going to a trade school. I decided to go over their head and asked the principal to allow me to take the courses. I passed all of them. I'm now finishing my fourth year at a UC and am staying a fifth to complete my second major. Anyone who tells me that I can't do something is someone who I don't want backing me. I want them to tell me it is hard, I'll probably fail and then help me lay down a course of action to succeed.

Israel consists, and SUBSISTS, on torture, murder, and terror!

Everyone knows who the beatles are. Maybe not really I was in 10th grade in 2009. During PE our teacher began singing here comes the sun and asked the class who sang it. I quickly said the beatles. Across The Universe really sparked my interest in the beatles as a 14 year old. 
Only 5 here. Two in Tulsa, once in Dallas, twice in Vegas.  I think he made two stops in Vegas the last tour, and while I could have gone, I elected to save the money (which came in handy later, due to unforeseen circumstances).  Of course, he didn't announce he wouldn't be touring for awhile until the END of the tour...had I known that at the beginning, I would have made more of an effort to go.
Amiibo: Little MacIn Box or Out of Box: doesn't matter to me in the slightestPackaging: again, doesn't matter at allReason: When amiibo were first announced, Little Mac was the first character I knew I absolutely had to have. I had no idea how many of the others I would get, and my amiibo are all OoB and I only have nine. Unfortunately, nearly all of wave 2 disappeared before I was even aware that they were available, and Little Mac hasn't become available since.EDIT: formatting
I go to Drexel. No one plays Dota, everyone plays League. Dunno how it that translates to the Temple population but tons of people go here for the game production program and Dota is still pretty much unknown so I don't know how much luck you'll have unless you're particularly inquisitive on campus. 
serious question here, arent they suppose to pay workers when the store is closed on a day it shouldn't/holiday? or is that depending on the policy of the store?

You are the one too far on the Hiko fangay wagon to use simple logic and avoid "dumbass statements". Cloud9 didn't listen to Hiko when he initially wanted to kick players, but that has obviously changed with the 2 roster changes made by the org. The more we learn from Hiko the more it becomees obvious Hiko wanted the org to be Hiko9 instead of Cloud9 and wants an org that basiccally gives him 100% freedom to pursue whatever opportunities come his way (sponsor wise/stream rev wise). I could be off with this, but for sure Hiko isn't ALL about winning. If he was he would team with the best players (Cloud9) despite w/e issues he has had with the org. At the end of the day Cloud9 sent these guys to every event and always had a bootcamp for them in a sick spot to ensure peak performance. Even if Cloud9 had some restrictions that seemed unfair to Hiko, it would not stop them from having the best chance at winning.
Doom.edit: the joke was he asked where duke nukem was from so I said Doom... Nobody seemed to understand and thought I was being serious about where the doom guy was from.

The biggest site I fully manage is standardised - I have a 90 page word document that goes into great detail about why it was designed a certain way, why certain hardware was chosen, the fine detail of the design and hardware.Most of the time I don't refer to the network diagrams or configs, I look at the design document and it becomes clear very quickly what should be happening.
I'm 22. My objective seems to be play games. I have a kinda profession, i am a computer engineer. But what i would really like to do is live off from playing games. Like the twitch people.   So yeah, my objective in life is be able to play and be able to life of it :p  If you haven't found yours, maybe it's because you haven't found that one thing that keeps moving you forward eh. Maybe love or some shenanigan. Good luck finding! 
whenever you are being praised, you assume it must be a set-upMy daughter's favorite was when my mom told her when she graduated from art school at barely 21, "I feel proud of you, but I don't know why."  You see an art degree is not worthy.  She went to one of the top 10 schools in the country on scholarship and won awards.  Even worse my daughter had to point out to me this was an N thing because I was so used to it.  Most of the time I tune my mom out.  My aunt told me recently the best night she spent with my mom she just ignored the words and let them wash over her with no content.  My aunt is great, she loves and accepts my mom, but lives very far away,

&gt; Pogba has had a few great long shots and performances but he hasn't consistently won matches for Juve, he hasn't consistently scored last minute winners, he hasn't won trophies due to his individual brilliance, he hasn't even had one season of great end product despite playing as the most attacking midfielder let alone 4 years of consistent end product.has any attacking mid ever done that?
I'd say something about missing the point of his character development, with him keeping the copying gimmick, but...... Well, it *is* WWE.But this is egregious even for them!

let's not sympathize with his frustrations that he's not getting fouls called, his team's getting fucking smacked, and 60% of the fans on his home turf are bulls fans; no, let's just make a dim, narrow-minded comment for some juicy reddit karma. 
This article leaves out several key pieces of information. First off, about half of those officers killed in the line of duty are accidental deaths, mostly traffic accident-related, not killed by another person. Second, as u/TopHatJohn points out, the numbers used for police killings of civilians is certainly higher in reality, as these are figures that departments self-report to the FBI and not all police departments participate. Finally, the article does state this, but it buries it and some people will only read the title, so it's worth noting that the black men killed by police is in addition to about 300 white men killed by police.Police brutality is a real issue, and shouldn't be seen as a liberal or conservative one either.
Most schools, while not having the best food, do not serve their students anything this bad. It may not be fresh, but it's usually some sort of soy meat that can't really go bad.

For the Fourth of July my family travels to southern Kentucky to go boating and they have a drive-in around there that we would go to. We saw the first Transformers there, which I have to say, really works well at the drive-in.
Let's not fool ourselves.We've always known cheating existed in this game. It's just not rampant because-good aimbots cost money. Free aimbots are 50% malware.-pgi has a strict no-mods policy with no grey zones, and we're not sure how successful they are at detecting an aimbot-a large percentage of players has spent money on this game. Being banned for a cheat and losing that investment makes most hesitant would-be cheaters retreat.
Great, another racist jerk who has probably only done 5 minutes of research on Islam, via sources that were probably against it, and considers himself to be an expert... Regardless of what I say, you'll continue to smirk and smear, so instead of wasting my time, I'll just give you a /pity :p
It depends. Everyone has pretty messed up thoughts to some degree, but as long as you don't act on them, it's fine. Unless they're causing you distress, in which case I would see someone.
Jobuii.  All great questions and important to consider when deciding to put money to work.  Instead of me writing an essay (I'm still at work and won't have time to until later this evening), it would help a great deal if you summarize your own answers to those first and I'll promise to provide you with my feedback and thoughts if anything is missing.  
I enjoy being sober because I enjoy my life. My friends are cool, my environment is good, my job pays decent. My health is good. My relationship is good. There are stressors, but nothing that compels me to need an escape so much that I need to abuse a substance to do it. A good experience with friends or husband is just as much of a release from stress.
Hate to break it to you, but that link is to BF4. Granted the dogfighting sucks in that game but I think he was thinking more along [these lines.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z5I8rsQQnk)
I never mentioned lag. Playing offline, in-person, with a training partner next to you who can instantly use his full range of communication (not just voice chat) is a superior learning environment. Especially when it's also a fun environment of sitting on a couch with your friend playing lots and lots of Smash Bros.
haha I definitely do pay the electricity bill! Usually all it takes is about 12 hours (sometimes even only 10), and I haven't noticed a big difference in the bill... maybe because it's on so low and the oven don't have to work as hard? 
I actually understand this, sometimes the most innoculous things don't cross someone until late adult stage. Just read up some AskReddit threads lik: "Reddit, what common fact evadade you until late teens/later"
Sounds like a goldmine from here.I personally don't even look at gender. If I like it and wear it, it's masculine by definition so far as I'm concerned and I won't bother expressing my disdain for the 'fresh' smell.Can't wait; I'll look forward to your post and thanks in advance.

So, the first thing you should do is eat right.   That means limit dining out.   Someone posted a bunch of links above.   I subscribed to those when I moved out.   It helped a lot.   I got leaner and lost a bit of fat.   Second thing is, invest in a gym membership.   You'll feel better as you exercise.   Never worry about if people are looking at you or anything.   Nobody will stare unless you act weird.   Just pretend they aren't there.   I had this problem.   It took a while for me to get passed it.   Focus only on you when you're there.   Think only about what you are doing.   Then just practice.   You'll get stronger, faster and have better endurance.   Just remember, baby steps.   I would look for better paying jobs too.   I worked for CVS for 7.5 years only to get paid at $11.  It's not worth it to work at a place that long for little pay.   
I'm not sure Airbnb is good idea.From what it sounds like, you want to create a better personal space and avoid distraction and I'm not sure hosting strangers from the internet is the best way. Couldn't you find an additional roommate that fit your lifestyle?
You know what's childish? You and you're faggotty little attitude. First of all, I love how you've said you "don't care" about a dozen times yet you're responding to everyone because you so clearly do. Second of all, how would you like it if I came to your shithole of a country and didn't bother adhering to any of your customs, or have no problem not paying people for their services. I bet you'd be bitching on Reddit about how rude American tourists are, yet you're  entitled Eurotrash brain makes you think it's okay to do whatever you feel like here in our country.
As long as we don't go so far as to make a reddit version of Clippywhich would be mildly horrifying.:-)It seems to be a combination of NP mode with the HTPPS. Something is going off the rails there.
I really am liking how happy Fowler is and how grateful he seems. Tears coming down the steps, and then prepares for the stage by building up that swag. 
It would be great if, after you ask a question ... your party fellows would not respond to your question with sarcasm and, instead, would give ME a chance to respond to the question that you asked me.This bill will provide a tax benefit for businesses that operate in a communist fashion.Tax cuts to any other businesses are not considered.This bill creates a large, federal bureaucracy to have its hand in these communized businesses.Now, you folks like to claim that you want LESS federal, centralized government ... but here you are creating a huge bureaucracy to manage the communized businesses.
If anyone gets hit by Glacier Bash, it's the tank's fault. If anyone gets hit by Glass Dance (bow cleave), it's their own damn fault unless it's been specifically stated that the tank will be positioning her away from the party for it. It takes no effort to dodge the bow though, so really just make sure you're behind Shiva for it. If you can't or don't want to put in even a **tiny** bit of effort to play the game, find a new hobby.
We got the QB who doesn't fit the system...I know there are plenty of differences we can go over between Vince Young and Mariota, but it just looks like then same situation.
&gt; It seems like a meaningless test, where pass/fail has no bearing on whether the characters or story is good.Do you think that a test is only meaningful if it assesses whether the characters and story are good?&gt;Well, you did say UNbalance instead of imbalance, so if that is not your meaning I recommend using the latter instead.When I search for a definition for unbalance, the first noun form definition that I get is:* a lack of symmetry, balance, or stability.This is what I mean: a lack of symmetry. When I search for imbalance, the first result that I get is:* lack of proportion or relation between corresponding things.This is also what I mean. Both words seem workable to me; why would you avoid "unbalance" in favor of "imbalance"?&gt;Passing or failing the Bechdel Test doesn't actually tell us if the representations are equal or not.Nor does it claim to. 
I hope for a return to sanity, but it will only happen when WW3 happens. I now pray for death and horror to be inflicted upon the world so that we shall be reminded about what is important.
Yes I believe we will..depending on the time jump between where this season ends and who survives I think mid season next year we will see the suit we know of
Motherfuckin' Bordello of Blood was my favorite Tales from the Crypt movie.  So amazingly shitty and amazing at the same time.  Like taking a bite out of a pancake and realizing its full of shit, but right before you throw up you have to admire the craftsmanship that went into stuffing a pancake full of shit and you not noticing until it was too late.
I'm not a big fan of the Q build- I don't think it has as much range/ isn't as useful in teamfights when you need to stay back from assassins as the W build, and it doesn't have as much sustained damage/can't kill tanks like the on-hit build.That said, I play a lot of ADC  in LoL, which is why I prefer on hit build anyway.
Had that happen the first time I tried too get to YZ-, I ended up stopping in stations on the way and setting my medical clone too that station. So I wouldn't have to make the 45 jumps again.
Exaggerated humor. We are emotional because this group hasn't released anything as a group for 3 years. Sure we might say things like C R Y I N G, and perhaps we could be crying, but most of the time it is just an exaggeration of our emotions.I hope you don't take EVERYTHING literally in life.
Yeah but my point is I might be the exception not the rule. I know that if I were playing hoping to get good drops it would be annoying as hell playing my heart out to only be shafted by the RNG while others get insane drops.
Wax if you dont like plucking until you can laser it. I wax mine I use the Venus (I think) diy wax strip things for legs. There's two types in the box, wide ones and thin ones.. I use the thin ones cause they're the perfect width for the space I want in my eyebrows and I cut it into like 4ths or 5ths so one strip will last me like 4 or 5 times... Its faster than plucking and slightly less painful I find.
&gt;lost in rd 2 in 2013 You know what the best part is?That would literally have been the greatest regular season and playoff run in the history of your franchise. There is no team less relevant than a Toronto team.
This article and the Metro one it links to are total fucking crap, with no detailed information whatsoever.  This is exactly what we *don't* need floating around polluting the internet when we have states fighting for legalization.  This is lazy at best, disinformation at worst.
I just got into paracord recently. Made a couple collars and love them.  I was looking into making a leash as well, but all the ones I've seen are very bulky.  I have a couple of small to medium small dogs and the paracord leashes are just too much.  Now I realize that whole comment probably doesn't help you much, it's more of my observation of paracord leashes so far.  All that being said, maybe weaving in a small pocket or something that you can stuff a few poop bags in for emergency.
They have marks and alualu as interior dlinemen so they don't really need williams.  What they need is a good pass rusher off the edge, and fowler fit the bill perfectly.
Brandon Schereff is the best linemen in this draft by a massive margin. Love to get him, but Williams is just as good as long as the Raiders dont shit on the parade. 
Actually, the pay gap is a mommy pay gap, not a women's pay gap.  Straight childless women don't have much of a gap as well.  It's just that if it's brought up that way, women will fight themselves to the death.
I also got profiled by my administration as a "Stoner" and they used a BS excuse to search my car... for water guns.Through a lot of BS and them overstepping legal boundaries, I ended up with a suspension, and the teacher I stayed with "talk to all my friends" and they said I was "angry" when in reality I'm legit like the least angry person, and my friends all agree. She also said I'm a bulldozer who forces my ideas upon people, but I was just tryna say my side of the story and she wouldn't even let me
Thank you.A business card is already bundled with the (I think it's SS-8 still haven't checked for sure lol) form I have mostly-ready for the IRS but never confirmed it was the right way to do this.And it says "manager" with my name and the store phone number and e-mail address.  I read the checklist the IRS has - I was something like 20/22 absolutely an employee.She did try to gaslight me about it, I told her I needed to research it further and she left it at that (probably because it shut me up)... but I believe talking to an authoritative source [like the IRS] is well within "research".  I really did give her a chance to give me the right paperwork.
Holy shit after seeing drogba these last few weeks, that scenario sounds like a goddamned nightmare. So perhaps a blessing in disguise. Lord knows we felt the luck in the CL the past few years

Yup, which is one reason why I was glad to learn they provided free two-factor authentication tokens. Too bad their implementation of two-factor makes it worthless.

"Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle."http://www.116pages.com/2015/03/the-miracle-of-forgiveness.html
Don't listen to anybody that tells you he can't win.  He's been winning elections that he "couldn't win" since he ran for mayor of Burlington VT in 1981. Go Bernie Go!

Of course, because as we all know corporate logos specifically designed to induce brand recognition and customer loyalty are *totally* not sigils. If they were sigils, they would probably have some kind of manifested effect given their extreme pervasiveness in our culture, like absurd multi-billion dollar cashflows and mindless consumerism - hell, maybe they would become so powerful that they could even influence governments, control the lives of thousands of individuals, or create economic chaos on such a massive scale that millions of people would be suddenly forced into poverty.Good thing that's totally not a real thing. By the way, check out this new iPhone I got...
So, wait, are parents like, required to teach their kids about videogame systems that were popular before they were born? Did our parents teach us about, like, early PAC-Man and shit? 
Oh god I have SO many stories. Where do I even start... the ones I immediately recall:* Back in college, a "friend" gave my roomies and I a German chocolate cake. After taking a few bites I wondered if GCC was normally a sour-sweet cake. Then realized what I thought was powdered sugar was mold spores. Later, "friend" told us that the cake had been sitting in his dorm room through all of spring break, and he'd given it as a joke, thinking we'd notice the mold.* Was washing white rice once, and wondered why some of the rice was squishy. Looked more closely, and realized I had writhing maggots in my hand.* When I was a child, my mom fried whole fish every so often. One time, I'd gotten halfway through the fish, to the underbelly, when I realized it was filled with worms. Couldn't eat seafood for weeks after.
New patch is alright. Still, Americans have a hell of a time beating ANYTHING with the shitty battle ratings / Matchmaker. I'm so tired of getting disabled in the first shot and then killed in the second shot. New TD's are "alright" since they have good guns, but no damn armor! I want a competitive damn tank for the Americans that I don't have to pray to the almighty War Thunder gods for a side shot. Hell, glorious all powerful ostwinds are killing my Shermans ffs!
This list is for f2p that are casual enough not to intend on members. Same reason I excluded maxing total level and combat level."Should only be done if you like the cosmetic aspect of it"There's also a prayer bonus, unless I'm wrong. I agree that it's still primarily a status symbol, though."Eh, neither are really that useful"Cremation is cost saving in f2p. Big bones + cremation is vastly more efficient than any other method without members. GH armor is just aesthetic for f2p except for the cape, which is by some measures better than the teamcapes and veteran capes most people use.
I'm working on fusing Veromos now. Just need to level up and awaken the fusion mons, and fuse the wind vamp. I'm so close!As for Giants, I can auto B5, and I've used a rep to unlock all the way up to B10. I'm not exactly where to start because they've all been unlocked though. I'll have to do some testing I suppose.Thanks!
I'm going to say that you're probably better off going Intel, as suggested in this thread, however it's true that the AMD processors score extremely well in BF4 benchmarks as BF4 is one of the few games that takes full advantage of them. Basically, if you only want to play BF4 then AMD is a good choice, but for other games it generally isn't. I'm not sure how things are for video editing.I personally went with the AMD FX-8350 for my gaming / audio engineering build, and I don't have any problems so far. I think the fact is that both Intel and AMD processors are very powerful these days and unlikely to limit you much compared to the GPU in most games. In Ableton Live doing multitrack recording I was actually limited by the hard drive read speed rather than CPU, and got a big SSD which really helped matters. Not sure whether this is an issue for video editing, but indeed an SSD could be a good idea.
Please impart more wisdom oh wise one.Seriously though you don't understand words or something? Learn some reading comprehension then get back to me 
Steelback got a lot of exposure. He played solid, but arguably he is the weakest link on the team and Rekkles is a better player. He seems like a top tier challenger team ADC and I hope he can find another team but it would be foolish not to take Rekkles (assuming that he is willing to make it work and everything, but objectively Rekkles seems like the better player)
So I have 8 GB of crucial Ballistix low profile ram in my computer right now.  Can I use the non low profile version of this with out something conflicting? The LP uses 1.35v and the normal one uses 1.5v. 
My great grandma had a weird  remedy for this. Take a bowl and put a piece of bread in it. Then cover the bread in milk and soak the toe in it. Sounds weird but she swore it took the infection out

This guy explains perfectly my indescribable feelings for the MLP CCG.Basically I just don't enjoy playing it. I gave it a shot, but it makes my head hurt with all the complexity.
I am assuming since he was talking to one of the girls, and got info one what was commonly on the notes, not only did they read it, they knew what was going on and continued going with it.
I am sexually active, but have only been with one person. We've both been tested. I've gotten a UTI twice before a few years ago but I didn't get a vaginal exam from that, they just checked my urine and gave me medication. I understand the importance of an exam now though, so i'll definitely call and make an appointment for next week. Better safe than sorry. 
Well I've heard in Kill La Kill that there was a charachter half American that was a giant. Unless that guy's family was from some unknown island that had giants. 
Loads of people swear by him but he does say a lot of stuff that never turns into anything concrete. It doesn't mean it's not true, just that he seems to report a lot of inconsequential stuff.

At least a handful of games don't warn you about exiting if you just saved the game. That's always nice.Really, if I just saved the game less than 10 seconds ago? It's because I'm trying to quit out. Take my word for it.
The previous info was work related about his next work site and where he'll be because he works out of town and buddy buddy chummin it up. It wasn't anything i felt i should be concerned about except that one part. "I think I'm going to bite the bullet and finally buy what I just text you about." His response was okay, and nothing else was said so I assume the conversation went to texting at that point. 
considering you're apparently twisted enough to ask such a auestion, it's likely that you probably already have this fucked up task covered........"no", in any case
This is great advice. My players will almost always move quite slowly through the story and it is up to me as their DM to help keep those storylines relevant and interesting to them. I do that by having a brief synopsis of the last sessions events at the beginning of each sit down (to remind everyone where we left off and important moments that occurred). I also will have present characters mention more about the story or pertinent info if we take too long to ensure that no matter what's actually happening in the party, they are reminded that the inhabitants of this world are interested in seeing the storyline get resolved too.
I'm there too. It's a shitty feeling and I hate not having an excuse for the way I feel sometimes because of it. I feel your pain. PM me if you want to talk.

At Auburn, the joke was Lim(GPA -&gt; 0) Engineering = Business.Oh the chuckles I had at that joke. Though, as a CS major, college really did jack-all to prep me for an actual job in CS. Somewhat off-topic though.

Thanks so much. I'm a massage therapist and get discounts on insurance. I called about the dental and it was a great deal unfortunately they don't have any places in the state I live in but they have it in the surrounding states but I'm not about to travel way out of my way. Thanks so much. I'll have to look into delta dental.

People who cut themselves are going through their own type of depression. And a personal hell. They know the consequences. They know the side eyes they'll get if others see the scars. Reminding them, and trying to shame them out of it is a terrible way of going about it. They are struggling, and the only way they feel any kind of escape is through self harm. Do you know how miserable that must be? Depression, mental illness, self harm aren't talked about enough, and when it is, it's just to alienate those who are suffering./rant

Don't. Its a bait and switch. One of the top threads on /r/lifeprotips is talking about this very issue.If you signed a contract then its signed. You don't owe them more than the contract you signed stated. If they have to take the vehicle back, then they are breaching the contract and are actionable for damages.Tell them that you will not sign a new contact unless the terms across the board are more favorable for you. As in, lower interest rates, lower monthly payments, fewer total payments and a discount on the purchase price of the car.If they are unwilling to meet those terms, then you are unwilling to sign. Tell them that they can not get a single penny more from you under any circumstances without taking you to court, and if they don't like it then you will see them in court.As long as you do not sign a new contract there is nothing they can do without making themselves look bad and possibly getting owned in court.

People do get mad over flu vaccine, and the people who don't get that vaccine are just as idiotic. The single correct thing you've said in your half-coherent post was that more people die annually from influenza. Easy fix - get the vaccine?Bandwagoning? I guess so. I do this for a living. This is what I care about, what I'm educated for, and the reason I'm currently 3000 miles away from my family at yet another conference to talk about and plan for these completely avoidable outbreaks. And it really sucks seeing people get sick and suffer, see our hospitals get stressed and resources wasted, see time and energy spent - all because some stupid dumbass thinks they don't need a simple vaccine that's proven to work.

I wouldn't call it the classic ovechkin shot. Usually he's left wide open, this time he was fully covered on the rush and holy smokes I can't believe how he managed to aim that laser beam so accurately. 
When a player is on the DL they don't take up a roster spot ( 25 on MLB roster). They had to option Montero to the minors to be under the 25 man limit after his start but instead landed on the DL. They had to rescind the option because a player only gets an x amount of options (3 I think) before you have to put them through waivers and other teams can place claims. 
I actually only bothered downvoting your first comment. And I didn't steal it -it's called content sharing. Y'know, 90% of what reddit is BASED on?

I think you probably know as much or more about anime production as I do. I am mostly familiar with Disney after reading the books I mentioned (and combing the Internet for anything I can find about animation in my spare time).I didn't really know that only Disney had the resources to do what they did. That's interesting. Do you think that was true even in all the clips you mentioned, or in much older anime? I suspect that newer anime probably got better equipment, but I don't know.

&gt;Also you completely ignore the other elements of what that causes, (like higher taxes for everyone (including those who dont have enough) Untrue, Universal healthcare option tends to be cheaper on taxpayers than private healthcare. However your suggestion that states should do this on their own would cause problems in tax codes, especially pertaining to the states who take more federal govt money than they pay in. You are also going to have to cite sources on single payer healthcare failing for first world countries. All scandanavian countries and our neighbors to the north are extremely successful with it.It would also not affect doctors nearly as much as you suggest. It would affect insurance brokers (useless middlemen), and big Pharma. Some doctors may receive pay cuts, and the option to be a privatized physician would still work although would become less profitable unless your customer base is people who can actually afford expensive medicine.
Yeah there's plenty of racism to go around in r/louisville among other things. Im glad I am somewhat insulated from hearing about stories like this because I know exactly what side most people would fall on around here, like they always do when our local sports heroes are accused of awful stuff like rape and abuse.
Fair enough--harsh but it's hard for me to directly refute anything you're saying except one part: I conceive that gender and sex are independent concepts--yet, normal sexual selection depends in some part on gender display. It's an issue I continue to learn more about. I just try to admit that I don't know everything. And I don't. 
When I'm on my motorcycle I'll more often than not pick up the offending item and throw it back through their window.

Had to laugh at the centrelink one.I have some distant rellos on Facebook, every so often there is a post about being 'ripped off' by centetlink or DoH.Funny thing is, all of their mates come on and it's like some kind of para-legal discssion on what forms to complete and what entitlements they can apply for etc.  If they spent 1/5th of that effort in an actual job, they would be going places.
I was going to test it out until it said that you probably shouldn't do it on your personal PC. I'm part of the program on the One, and part of me knows they're probably saying that to cover their ass. I can't be selfish with it though because unlike the One, I'm not the only one that uses the PC. I can wait a few months.

Well, actually doesn't matter what type of setup you have, the important thing is if you are happy with your setup :DI have an old Q8400 with 4GB DDR2 and a Sapphire 7870 and I like it very much, games run smooth on it with normally all in High/Ultra and it's a pretty cheap (and old) setup with a very good cost/performance.

"This guy's unbelievable. He's in the backfield all the time."Show 3 clips where no one blocks him. I surely hope he's in the backfield on those plays. 
No foul on the keeper - the attacker makes contact with the ball before the keeper had any control.For the second challenge, the attacking player has put his body in the way in order to shield the ball from an attacker, totally legal. Also I'd say that means no foul from the defender who has tried to go for the ball but been blocked off.So play advantage, I'd say.
Lots of folk feel similarly to how you do. I'd check out the community at restoringforeskin.org, which is super supportive and has great resources not only on non-surgical foreskin restoration, but also on dealing with dysphoria and emotional turmoil. 
For sure. We have a small local dairy community here. All family-owned and operated. Nice people in general from what I've encountered. I've seen some horrifying videos of the dairy industry with the same violations described here. It was always the large, factory-type farms that this went on. Lax hiring, disgruntled workers, and out-right psychos seem to be more of a problem there.  You have to imagine that a company that big cared as little for their employees as they did for the cattle.

Well only bands are being added and yeah there is Pitchfork, Melt and Longitude that same weekend but it would have been cool to have some more experimental electronic music at Camp. They also waited pretty long to start the booking process which I'm sure hindered things but the main booking for camp this year was by the dude who manages Big G so I'm not really expecting much interesting stuff to still come out. Regardless I'm going to camp for the Biscuits first and foremost so anything else I like is just icing. 
While Triumphs are designed and assembled in England's glorious bosom, the Midlands, and every Briton should do their patriotic duty and buy one of their fine products (proud Street Triple rider, here), part of me feels like it's almost *more British* to ride a Japanese bike anymore.

Whether it's a winner scene or not, it perfectly establishes Mike's character.  He throws himself headfirst into everything, fights as hard as he can, and probably tries way too hard for his own good.
I mean Chuck was going to side with the Grizzlies anyway.  After all the shit he's said there is no way he couldn't.Out of all the teams left in the playoffs, Memphis is a classic Charles Barkley team.  They play inside out with two big guys that can take you down low.If the Warriors jump on the Griz this series like I think they will, I am going to be really excited to see Chuck try and spin it so he doesn't look like a total jackass.  If it were Houston he could say that Dwight is soft and they don't run the right offense.  If it were LAC he could say that they play Blake too much on the perimeter and don't go to DeAndre enough.  With Memphis, he's going to have no excuses.  No team fits the "Charles Barkley Championship Mold" better than the Memphis Grizzlies.  He's been saying all year that's the type of team that will beat the Dubs in the playoffs.  If it doesn't happen, what is he going to say?

Too bad, you write it like ソ→L→ハ) but it also has [four different stroke orders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order#Stroke_order_per_polity) in Japan, the PRC, Taiwan, and traditional calligraphy...
&gt;  I'm so pissed off at myself and I feel so disgusting and stupid for allowing it to happen.Why?  Not really meant as a question to get you to talk further.  Anxiety is the thoughts and it is tough for us to go through unstable situations.  You don't need to talk about your situation - you need to realize its anxiety and let it run its course.  Know yourself - your goal is to find a stable life.  That means the man, his family, the friends, the job etc.  Settling down.  Stability is easier.  Find strong people.Take every opportunity to get towards that goal.  If he isn't ready to settle down then whats the problem?  Choose to be with him and take a chance or not.  Be upfront about what the relationship is and keep moving towards your goal of stability for your mental health.
The problem is that we waste a shit ton of money with a military designed to take on conventional standing armies when that's not the kind of battles they fight these days.  We conquered Iraq's standing military in days, and spent a decade fighting guerrillas.

I know you said you didn't want to co-wash but I've been alternating co-washing with regular washing (shampoo every 2 or 3 days and co-washing each day in between) and have found my ends like that a lot better than shampoo every day. I've been using organix/ogx shampoo and like them better than other things I've tried but I still haven't found one that I feel is perfect. I'm using the keratin one now but also liked the biotin/collagen one. When I co-wash I use mane n tail; it's popular and cheap and it works well enough but again I'll probably try one of the other popular options next.edit: had some extra words
Yeah I got an '04 BMW 325i for my first car and all my friends are like "omg how did you afford a BMW for your first car!" meanwhile I spent less than 8k on it.

Have some exams soon but I'll study for them. Not really stressed I like having exams even though I don't pass some.Finally got some pills for my body acne.Some girl I find cute started looking at me but for really long periods of times like, 8-10 seconds maybe even more. I'm really happy because that's a sign she might be interested. (Just to be clear we don't know each other, just our names).
This is what they do. Governments that rule by terror have to maintain an atmosphere of arbitrary violence to terrify the public into submission. For example, starvation. During the late 1990s, Kim Jong Il bought expensive MIG-29 jets from Khazakhistan even as he deprived  millions of North Korean families who had been deemed disloyal, starving entire families to death, one by one.

How did you actually react?In terms of my personality, I have no problem telling someone to fuck off, but unfortunately, I'm in a high-visibility profession with a lot of societal expectations around it, so I have to be polite to people. 
Hey I've been wanting to try Aventis. I have a 10ml (I think) of Tuscan leather I would be willing to trade. Only cost me like 30 tho so I would send you some money thru papal if you're interested. 
Honestly, I feel like there might be. When I adjusted the wheel, it didn't seem like it made much of a difference. Granted, I don't know which way is up or down on the thing. 
What angrysprinkles said. As long as there's reasoning behind a negative opinion, and it's not just whiny, I think it's fine. It can still start discussions and some criticism is healthy anyway.Personally, I like Yooka's design (though she could use an accessory) but not really Laylee's. I couldn't pinpoint why, but it's what OP said. It's cute, just a bit too dumb-looking to me.
Whenever we have an out in our game cases I put my deleted games in there until we get the other item back in stock. But I currently have like 9 waco bins filled with $20 and under video games sitting on my clearance section that aint moving at all. I probably have enough to fill a dump bin at least 2/3 that im fighting to do with management
However, what is the pixel depth? I know when I made my Pedestals, still have 3 to make &gt;.&gt; that my Pixels were actualy 4x4 on Photoshops depth, I have 72dpi when I make. So since I mapped based on in-game sprite sizes, perhaps there is a difference.I know another seemed to have much much higher quality pixel art, closer to Chrono Trigger Style sprite work but was also the same size so Pixel Depth is likely the cause.
You made the extraordinary claim, that we havent shown any cultural or internal development, so the onus is on you to provide extraordinary proof to support it. So what makes you feel that way about us? Because we arent good? Thats not good enough.
I just got to say that you are the most talented writer ever. Breaking bad could've just been "another TV show" but you and your team made it into one of the best TV shows in history. For that, I ask you to keep it legit. I hope the success doesn't change your mentality or talent.
This is not a good idea. You're losing $70/month on PMI, which is wasted money. What's the point in buying a house, if you have to rent out a bedroom or two to make ends meet? How do you know you'll be there for 5+ years? What happens if the roof collapses the day after you sign the closing papers?Continue to rent for a while longer, and save up a much larger down payment.
Instead of asking the guy who already captions two shows, why not start captioning other shows ourselves? If this guy captioned every show he was asked to caption, he wouldn't have any free time.
But booing during the error" only" would be better, then booing him during his at bat like cmon thats not gonna boost his confidence to help us comeback..
The most interesting fact to me was that Baron Rivendare doesn't double up deathrattles when they're executed, only when they're queued (he appeared mid-phase and didn't double up the following Ancestral Spirit deathrattles)EDIT: Actually, an outstanding question would be if a second minion died later in that phase, would Baron Rivendare double THOSE deathrattles.
Yeah, I find it funny that one of the best naps I ever took was in 29 Palms after we got done with our run and I crawled under the RSO vehicle and slept with my head on the dirt in 90+ degree weather.
You'll eventually conquer stairs.  Going up and down will become second nature and you'll do fine in time.  Me, I prefer inclines rather than stairs going up and the other way going down.  I look retarded when I walk down an incline and I can go down stairs really quick.Now, one thing I have tried time and time.... and time again with zero success is.... running up stairs.  I just can't do it.Don't worry, if you work your legs out properly and keep good posture, you'll be able to walk up to people in shorts and they won't notice your leg is gone.
Guys lets just ignore these. Ronaldo and Messi have been bestowed upon us by the great futbol gods. I love hating both of them because they're just so damn good lol
Nothing at the moment besides the currently airing shows.I'm also trying to figure out if I should continue with Kara no Kyoukai and Initial D or start something new. 
3 2hr long films sounds the most ideal to me, it would condense the story well enough and not be an overly long series.Ei Aoki I'm a bit mixed on, because while I LOVED Fate/Zero and KNK1, stuff like Aldnoah.Zero just left a bad taste in my mouth. But Takizawa Shinsuke I would be on board with 100%
I don't think there's anything wrong with Hooters. It's also not like these types of things are exclusive to women. There are male equivalents like Chip n' Dales.
&gt;That may temper the reality a bit, but if that was the point of the review then it is either poorly written or maliciously edited.To me, it tempers it a lot. Suddenly the statements about why women might do worse aren't *personal attacks* they're *academic arguments*. They might be arguments you or I would disagree with, but they're still relevant arguments.In any other context, such statements would be blatant sexism.But yes, the excerpts still put a bad light on the reviewer. Then again, there are a lot of ellipses in those excerpts, indicating a lot has been missed out, presumably to make the sexism clearer (which could result in creating the appearance of sexism where there is none).
Unless you're concerned she's going to cause a scene, invite her.  Spoiler: she probably won't even come.  Really, it sounds like her only fault is she doesn't really like you.  Big deal. 
I don't think an individual increment of a statistic is "a" data (singular), I think the overall percentage is "the" data. You could use "datum" for multiple statistics.     "the *data* from each one will be calculated separately, and the overall *datum* will then be averaged together..."
Hispanic immigrants come here by choice, yet their outcomes tend to be pretty different than Asians who come here by choice.  So I think we can toss out that variable.Although, as Ted Cruz recently pointed out, those Hispanic immigrants tend to be hardworking.  As Cruz said, you don't see Latino panhandlers.
I agree that an OW heavy game is a bit boring, though that's the precise reason I love Infantry OW - Unlike virtually any other class aside from Guardians, Infantry can push forward and still yield devastating OW. Having the option of Offensive OW is a lot more fun than eternal ambushes.Regardless - your squad comp sounds really interesting. I can certainly see it working well if you dedicate yourself to going hard or going home!
You're increasing awareness. How many comments in this thread say more or less, "I don't wanna cheat but can someone explain how this works?" Some of those people are gonna go use it. And some are gonna tell their friends.
There's no law/regulation covering that, if that's your question.  Meaning it is open to negotiation although the building might choose not to play.  Aside from pure greed it could be part of their way to force less affluent people to self screen themselves out.  If you do pay it, insist on a written receipt for your highly specific handwritten check because there's an off chance some low life is gouging you on the side.  And after the fact send a questioning letter to the highest level of building ownership you can identify.
The amano have really helped with the hair algae. Biggest tip I can offer is go with less light duration than you think you need and move up if necessary. It is easier to prevent algae than it is to get rid off it. Don't be afraid to yank out a badly infested plant and quarantine it. 
That's good to know.  My battery may have just hit the end of its life.  The laptop is a Dell, but I'm not sure what model.  ([It does *look* like this one, though.](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-15-6-Inch-Operating-Definition/dp/B003LNDMT4))
Yeah you can, and I do believe that moobot is what they have cause Ray/Tina set up the stream originally and I think RT are still using it the way they set it up.
As much as I hate you and envy your collection, I have to congratulate you! I can't imagine when I'll finally be able to say that I've gotten every vinyl Halo. You go, dude.

My shiba had a phase where he decided he didn't like to head this one direction on our apartment block. Was randomly fine with walking and then he suddenly decided it was terrifying. He refused to move, did a shiba scream and yelled and howled like I was torturing him and I was so embarrassed I took him home. He eventually got over it. Now he loves walks but I think they're rough at that age because they can't walk very far. Maybe they get scared you're going to take them on a long walk? I can't figure out shiba logic myself.
It's not worth it.  The only thing worth mentioning is that a rainy alleyway being watched by over by Woody Harrilson should absolutely be a Tekken stage.
He won't since sanders is running for the democrat nomination, we'll have a race between him and hillary, the winner will then go on to go up against the republican nominee- with the full backing of the democratic party.
I think it is completely ok to throw your own baby shower, create a registry and invite all your family and friends! Gifts are nice but even more - I think babies should be celebrated!!  Also, if you want to buy some of the bigger items yourself, you can go ahead and start. We purchased our own nursery furniture - crib, changing table, armoire, rug and we are planning to go shopping for a glider in the next few weeks. I might be in the minority here but I don't think anyone owes me anything so any gifts I receive are just for fun. I'm not relying on them. I am mostly looking forward to just celebrating!!!

&gt;"Leading experts in several fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The Report is edited by Professor John F. Helliwell, of the University of British Columbia and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; Lord Richard Layard, Director of the Well-Being Programme at LSE’s Centre for Economic Performance; and Professor Jeffrey D. Sachs, Director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, Director of the SDSN, and **Special Advisor to the UN Secretary General.**"I get what you're saying and stuff...your criticism is actually really solid and you said some of what I had in mind too. But the people who formulated this weren't complete idiots. They've got the experience and the credentials to back up what they're saying.

Dragging myself or I can't walk, if I am walking or running it's like I have lead shoes on and everything in slow motion, had this dream for some 15 years now.
In a sense I can agree with you. Weed can be dangerous. For example, it can be abused. A non experienced toker can smoke to much weed and get too high, and let's say that same toker were to operate a motor vehicle, well chances are he's probably going to crash that car. Like anything, it should be approached with caution I 100% agree. But overall, is marijuana honestly safe? Absolutely. Don't be an idiot about it. Smoke responsibly. It all depends on the person. I personally do not use heavily anymore simply because it isn't to me what it once was. But I'll be damned if I won't try to spread the word of this wonderful plant sent from God almighty. Stay easy dude I appreciate your reply! 
Yeah, I suppose it's  sore subject with a lot of non-religious people because they may not be religious because they had a bad experience. Still no reason to be rude. I used to go to the atheism subreddit a lot, but it started getting angry all the time and that's just annoying...Edit: Was it the CNN doc? I saw the last half of that...

You wrote a lot, but didn't really tell us anything about your situation.  You are in a job you feel should be filled by a TSgt and were given an additional duty, that again you feel should have been filled by someone of higher rank.  ok, the AF has downsized and a lot of us are doing a lot of work with fewer people, and if your an A1C, you shouldn't expect to be treated like a TSgt.  Not trying to bag on your rant, but tell us more about why you feel like you 'won't have a chance to do what you thought you could do?'
Ronaldo is ten times the fifa card messi is. But Im a messi fan not Ronaldo so when they were both 15 mil and extinct I ended up choosing messi. Ronaldo is just way too cheating. Messi isnt far behind though 
But the term 'monster' itself refers to an extreme to begin with, so I'd say someone who is purely evil to the absolute extreme as is so from birth is still more of a monster than someone who slowly becomes bad/evil (but not quite as evil) over the course of time.
No, when Doris Grau died in 1997 they retired the character out of respect like Phil Hartman's characters. When the Lunch Lady was brought back in 2006 she was named Dora and was voiced by Tress MacNeille.

To be honest, I don't feel the homeless man was discriminated against due to his gender. I think he was discriminated against because of his clothing and appearance. Sure, she was advantaged due to him doing that, but to be honest it was his choice. I'm not saying chivalry needs to die, but then women act like its for granted. **THAT** pisses me off.
If they don't... I don't even know. I hopefully they'll have some sort of way to transfer the profile or even just download a .txt file of your collection. 
This is why I don't understand why they wouldn't stockpile picks. That coach is going to be PISSED when he gets fired and the Titans still pick in the top 5 next year.
Lol its hilarious how apeshit men go at the idea of being taught normal rules of consent, but are fine with women being told at every available opportunity the usual crap that is used to blame them later.If you are not a rapist, you don't need the education, and we're not talking about you. Not everything is about you personally. Educating men about consent does not mean treating them like rapists. Jesus.
Honestly if it's school versus dating. I always choose my grades. Anyone unfortunate enough to mingle with me during one of those stressful times is usually cut off but at least I'm honest.If I'm not interested I just say so but sometimes to some people busy and not interested mean the same thing.
1. Some sensible people show up in the comments, which inflames her and her white knight boyfriend and it's pretty funny.2. For more euphoria, her blog is pinkchanelsuit.com 
How else would you have wanted the FTL neutrino thing to go? It was pretty well handled by the scientific community, I thought. Pretty much everybody kept a skeptical head on their shoulders while more effort was undertaken to study the phenomenon until it was clear what the error was. Like really. How the hell else should that have gone exactly?The only people I really heard saying "EINSTEIN WAS WRONG!!!" were those in the MSM that basically get everything somewhat wrong nearly all the time. Not ideal for science, not ideal for anybody.
Oh here's another...I wasn't allowed to listen to any music except Christian music by Christian artists...and the ban extended to techno, classical, instrumental, etc. I couldn't have it in the house or listen to it on headphones.

Nope no charging cables you have to buy it separately like it was on iPV3. requires a charging cable for the charger to work. and they are Authentics I Promise . P4U forgot to update packaging and take that tid bit out about the usb charging. the usb on the device is for data only.

I haven't had TV for almost 20 years, so all the TV I watch tends to be stuff that people already dig, long after they've been on the air. I think I watched "The Wire" only because I heard about the series finale on NPR and they were raving about it. The only time I think I've actually sat down in that time to watch a show live was the last season of Lost. I really got into it in the last season. 
I've said it once and I say it again: if she gets pregnant with her dead husband's baby that *will* be the absolute final straw for me.  If that doesn't happen, I'll hang on here until the end (probably) but if we go with that cliche... *ugh ugh ugh.*
Dark matter and dark energyThere is something out there that is exerting gravitational pull, but we can't detect it through any other means. You can't see it. It doesn't put off any radiation, or reflect radiation. There are no detectable particles. It's just there, and it's having an affect on the universe.

I have no idea what's up with that.I know! I mean I have my theory about what potentially happened with Marianne but we don't have any evidence of *anything* regarding her now.

Anything done on this patient will be under general anesthesia, but yeah, I know what you mean. Also, don't worry about it, if you have a roof over your head and don't live in your own filth, this kind of things don't happen.
I recently reported a worker for calling a customer stupid. The customer was not upset in any manner and was trying to let the worker know there was an issue on the floor. For me, that's actively hostile.
This is great, I absolutely love The Tool Library, such a useful service for $50/year. I've used it a handful of times for basic jobs in the last few months and had easily paid for itself.
As an engineer that designs power plants, (coal fired and now nuclear with some natural gas in there too), I will say that natural gas is going a very strong footing with lots of our work going to retrofitting coal plants to run on natural gas.I'm much more interested in the future of nuclear technologies but I would keep my money clear of yeshiva/westinghousenuclear and their new AP1000 modular designed reactors. The calculations supporting that thing are rubbish.

Dude he's just asking you if you've personally tried your MXE. That's a pretty easy way to tell if it's legit MXE or not. It might not be your cup of tea, but if I were a vendor, ~~I'd never sell anything to my customers that I haven't tried on myself first~~ EDIT: Perhaps not always a wise policy depending on what one sells; still it's the principle of the matter. More importantly, I'd be using independent lab to do purity testing every batch of every chemical before selling it.Such measures can and do save lives; and there have been far too many deaths that could have been prevented by simple due diligence. A Danish vendor and a kid in California died way back in like... 2011? because the vendor didn't bother to analytically test his product before selling it or trying it himself.I'm just saying dude, be careful, you know? For everyone's sake. What sort of analytical testing are you having performed on the sample? Just curious.
Since when? The original discrimination in X-Men comics was very openly based upon racial discrimination in a still-divided America. Charles and Eric are(were) pretty openly designed to represent MLK and Malcolm X in terms of their different ways of opposing the segregation and discrimination they experienced. There may have been some degree of influence from gay rights and backlash against homosexual members of society, but it was most definitely more of a racial issue in the 60s and 70s. 
I think people just aren't being as vocal with their support, but they still support her. I think it's because she wasn't doing so well in the beginning of the season, but then she had the redemption story line and turned it around. That's when people really got on board with Pearl. It's just that she's done well for the last few weeks, and it seemed like she was gaining momentum only for her to underperform last episode. I'm just hoping she turns it out next episode, so that last episode was just a one time thing and not a gradual downfall.

I guess all I need to figure out is if there is a blue / orange set coming off the front and leading to the back, splice them in if needs be.Thanks dude!EDIT - That's all it was. I just needed a new set of eyes to look at an issue I stared at for too long. Thanks /u/RealDealRio!
There are protesters.  These are not protesters, they're rioters.  The protesters are the ones forming a barricade to defend the police.   Being a protester means you are civil.  Not being civil makes you a rioter
Thanks. This is kind of what I was expecting, it just seems so redundant - why late to start collecting sub fees? I wouldn't be bothered but they send you a pre-order code in your email, and I just want to be 100% sure that this won't greenlist them for the current a realm reborn content. Anyways, I wound up putting a customer service ticket in so I can get the answer from the japanese mega-horse (savage)'s mouth. Thanks for taking the time to give your point of view, I appreciate it.
While what he said was untrue, the message was a good one. Unless you are going for a very serious major (ie engineering) a trade is an amazing way to make money.
I doubt it'll take that long, there's been a lot back and forth since GW2 was released and I bet they tried to avoid an expansion and see where Living Story led.It seems that they changed that route by the end of season 1, as things like precursor scavenger hunt and new legendaries that was meant to be revealed at the second Wintersday was postponed and withheld for the expansion instead.
That's what I thought too. Cartoon violence vs gritty violence does make a difference, and it was the latter that I was thinking of when I posted this thread.
Was what they said about PTR true?  I mean he seems like a nice guy, but apparently he threw a huge fit when he heard that it was a possibility that he was going to get cut from CLG.  Can anyone confirm this?
Did you go to school in Illinois? Because I had a math teacher and a computer science teacher do the same thing. They would constantly talk about girls and pretend like we had no idea what their "codes were". Hell one of the teachers asked a girl to get the "gay" out of his youngest son, who was a classmate of hers. Last I heard he has a very painful form of cancer. Did I mention this was all in front of students?
&gt;Yuck.  I'm sure Cheba Hut makes extraordinarily delicious food, **but how could anyone eat anything that came out of that location**.  Remember what was in that building before?  DISGUSTINGLY FILTHY!!
I have a phobia of dogs. I have it mostly under control now, but it was pretty bad when I was younger.   I used to have recurring nightmares about a doberman that would chase me around. But the doberman would glide around on it's hind legs, and would always pop out of hiding, like from under piles of toys. Whenever it caught me it would knock me to the ground and a word balloon saying "no" would pop up. I know it sounds stupid but I was terrified of that thing.   One day my mom told me to visualize myself standing up to the dog, and the nightmares stopped. That's also when I started lucid dreaming.
Hell, I enjoy watching the little guys and I'd be all up for it if I thought there were enough fighters for it. Problem is that we've seen there's not enough guys to run a real 125 division - we're like 2 years in and it still feels like it's just gotten started and we're scraping together title fights.
Realistically, most of the regular, reliable audio engineer gigs out there are for megachurches. Unless the congregation &gt;10k every sunday, they don't pay shit. You might score the odd recording gig or maybe doing the tech behind indie film scoring or folio work, but other than that there's not much regular work. Maybe a local TV station, but that will only be for their non-syndicated programming. 
Idk. Not all smokers smell like smoke or have their sorroundings smell like smoke. I also hate the smell. Especially when you walk into a house or car and just immediately smell cigarettes. If you smoke keep it away from others and hopefully have enough self respect to be sure the smell isn't everywhere that you linger. Of course your kids shouldn't suffer because of your smoking. A person who keeps the smoke away from their children of course already knows this BECAUSE they're keeping it away from their children. So making sure you blow the smoke outside the window and keep your children out of the room doesn't make you dumb. It makes you smart.
No, it's a pretty shitty strategy considering the lack of cover at the drop zone doesn't make up for dropship lasers, especially when mechs are being dropped out in the open.  Even so, it doesn't matter. If you want it changed, keep spamming it. Make people annoyed enough that it starts to affect the player base and make pgi act.
Seriously. Heart disease will weed them out. Like, if you wanna deny years of proven science and medicine, go ahead. But don't even bother going to the doctor

I never saw the movie, but I sure did play a lot of Mortal Kombat in the 90s.  This soundtrack was great when I worked as a product receiver at Whole Foods back in the day :)  It made me unpack quick!
Since he's bonded with the kitten, he probably would like a younger rabbit, but with puberty comes potential fights, so maybe bonding sooner is better than later as long as the kit is properly weaned and as long as the little one has a couple safe places to hide if things get rough. So to be clear I wasn't suggesting less than 8 wks., but adults and toddlers can get along surprisingly well. 
U-turn is the main draw early game, as it is an intensely powerful pivot. Late game it can sweep after walls have been weakened and priority or scarfers have been removed. I find a lot of people complain about M-Bee just because he is frail, when they don't even know how to use him properly. If the opponent has priority, you shouldn't be staying in.
You mentioned armor piercing weaponry, that could be interesting if special weapons variants are added back to the game. Perhaps an armor piercing cannon with less ammo and slower reload but can punch through really strong armor.
I think my main issue is that Pearl is a top 6 or 7ish queen talent wise, but she is getting a top 3 edit.A lot of it comes down to the sub noticing the edit and becoming disillusioned by it in face of the probability that more talented queens will be sacrificed in the coming weeks for Pearl to make top 3. It is just like last year. Was Adore an immensely talented and charismatic queen? Yes. But did producer manipulation help her to the top 3? It sure looked like it.
I can't believe people still sent understand that matchmaking for end game activities is an awful idea, all the reasons have already posted. IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO USE LFG OR 100. Should there be an in game solution? Would be great. But that's something that can't feasibly be added at this time. I'm not even sure the last gen systems could handle any more huge mechanic changes.

I thought desrow was trash talking quite a few players on today's show. I felt like none of it was deserved.It's pretty obvious why a lot of his relationships with other pro-gamers has come to a screeching halt. Anyways, I would like to see a showmatch
I have a scar on my left eyebrow. When I was 5 or so I was chasing my my little brother around our van. This van had sliding doors and my sister wasn't in a good mood. She slammed it open and nailed me right in the face. Perfect timing.
riven is not strong in the tank meta she gets rekt by cc and is also easily countered by armor (dont really know why but she has huge problems with high armor enemies not like other ad casters)and this is basically what every team hasriven is the same as master yi kata etc. if the enemy knows how to teamfight properly vs those they are gonna be useless
They could make it were the resistance was stronger or only applied to the one the spell was casted on. All aggroed units would receive a smaller or no resistance buff.

Don't do it, you're doing this for wrong reasons. Who becomes a monk for "a couple months?" It's not a spa.EDIT: To all those saying I don't know anything about him, I can read his post history. Tons of posts to the red pill subreddit and he seems obsessed with money, dumb whores and conservative ideologies. If he doesn't practice any of the tennants of buddhism in his day to day life whats the point of living as a monk? He will learn nothing and gain nothing but a cool story and nice facebook photos. I hope all you hipster fucks stay out of thailand.

I have a feeling that they'll encourage a healthy Len to try to get up to 28-30 MPG next season. He averaged 24 MPG in his starts this year, but if we look at *only* his post All-Star game stars, he averaged closer to 27 MPG. Hornacek gained some confidence in him as the season went on. 
Archmaester Gallard strode into the room briskly, his linen robes swishing.  "Mistress Alvey," Gallard said pleasantly, addressing the lady by her chosen pseudonym "I am so very sorry I kept you waiting, I hope Meryn was pleasant company, he does have a tendency to chew one's ear off," he said with a toothy grin. Toothy was an overstatement, more than half his teeth were gone.

That's camera period clothing. You can get some custom made garments or find websites that sell the specific period clothing you want. You may also want to check out places like renaissance fairs, civil war reenactments, etc.. Places like etsy might be worth a look as well. I can't imagine that such clothes will come cheap, though, unless you want to go for Halloween costume designs, but they're likely inaccurate and probably of poor quality. 
All classes get "a bunch of utilities". Mesmers get (at least) 4 Wells. On top of that, they get a new Shatter, and a very powerful exclusive boon.The bonus of 2handers are 3 more weapon skills, if you count the autoattack. And that's not always a good thing, as I already said. It's not like these new weapons are going to completely eclipse the old ones, and 1handers are more flexible.
Thank you for citing me! I will, at the very least I will open up my dropbox to redditors (i amybody wants to read like 300 pages of gmargin stuff lol).

Completely agree. But I still do think it's a parallel scenario - orgasm isn't quite the point OP should be going for here, what he should be focusing on is mutual reciprocation. It absolutely wouldn't be fair for her to engage in a particular activity that makes him feel good, whereas he doesn't do the same for her in return. Whether or not they orgasm from that, while relevant, is a little besides the point. OP may be able to orgasm normally with handjobs and PIV, but then again he might do so significantly better orally. What it comes down to is that he's not full-filling her needs adequately, despite promises to do so.
[Pointing out the obvious](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/32plim/hestia_going_mainstream/cqdgu7k) and [quality shitposting.](http://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/2wt9ho/take_a_picture_of_an_anime_character_and_add_some/cou0bkv) That's what I'm here for!
We give every host an IPX address, we don't use NAT because we'll never run out of IPs in our public /24 and we always use Standard ACLs as firewalls. Haha. Yea, I agree with you.
She's only trying to get his attention when other girls have his attention. That is just crappy. It's not sincere. If she really liked him, she would start flirting with him without other girls around. If that is her subtle way, it's not working for her. OP is clearly not psychic enough to get her clues.
They may be like the seasons, affected by magic. It could be the only way for Weirwoods to grow is by magic, or perhaps they never grew at all, and were with Westros since its creation, whatever that may have been.

Not being a medical doctor, or knowing what illness your mother makes this story quite worrying to me.  I have read of people treating themselves with [antibiotics they buy themselves online](http://knowledgeweighsnothing.com/fish-antibiotics-for-human-use-no-prescription-required/).  So I guess at the very last resort, with APS not being able to help, or anyone else, this is what I would try.
I should win because I live in a small town, The next "big town" is more than 3 hours away from me. I don't drive so I never get out of my small town. I live in a town FULL of nerds and college/university kids. There is NO such thing as getting something rare, because one of the many "collectors" go into stores and buy them out then put stuff on Kijiji to make a quick buck. So pick me because I can't ever hope to get them otherwise... without paying... a lot.
I don't take time away from my family to go to lodge to hear fart jokes. We make some funny clever jokes during the business portion, and it helps to break up the monotony. But if someone was farting on a candidate while waiting for the first degree, and everyone was OK with it, I would spend the next day looking for a new lodge. That's just not appropriate. 
If youre looking to buy shoot me an email Shawnharris@dominionlending.caImo the 3x gross looks "right" as in thats what id be comfortable with at current rates if i made that money. I have people come in all the time trying to buy at their max and i always tell them not to lol.

10 years in Internet Years is like 100 years in dog years. They had a hell of a run. In these modern times, if an **AA wants you shut down, they are going to shut you down. You have to have a squeaky clean system, process &amp; legal backing to make it. If any of the IP Agencies even think you aren't legit, it's all over for you. As long as there is a stream though, it can be intercepted and analog converted into an mp3. You may lose some quality, but hell... back in the old days we were happy with a cassette tape quality. 
I found it very distracting how everyone kept really enunciating "Vincent Van *GOFF*" throughout that episode. Maybe that's the right way to say it, and Americans are assholes for saying "Van Go", but it still seemed really weird every time.

Why is anybody having an issue with this? The punishment should be determined by what damage is done, not by who does the damage. If somebody breaks the law and that specific law has been valued at a certain amount; you pay that amount (whether that payment be time or money).The counter argument to this is akin to saying "two people want to buy an apple, but since the first person is much wealthier he should pay much more.. Because, you know, its unfair that person number 2 has less money and has to pay a larger percentage for the same thing". While the wealthy person may be able to pay the difference it would be unfitting to charge more based on that alone.

I am going to post it here for anyone who's never bothered. &gt;a person who believes that a particular race is superior to another.

One of my soldiers decided to lose his ach, ach cover, flc and pouches for the flc. Needless to say he had a very long day. Platoon fall in drills, squad leaders smoking the platoon because they(the squad leaders) lost accountability for their SI. Put on saturday cq because another team leader started whining to the psg. And just all around dumb army things. It was a good week.
It will be hard to find a place that is showing the fight for the regular cover charge.  It's a $99 PPV event. And bars are being charged by their capacity level. ..with some paying $10k just to host the fight. 
Spend some time in California Adventure. Disney pumped a ton of money and effort into Buena Vista Street and Cars Land, and it really shows.

There's 80 million families. Of those, 16 million consist of families where nobody works.SO and I are retired. We don't work. His mom is retired. She doesn't work. My sister is retired. She doesn't work. Four of my cousins are retired. They don't work. Not having a job doesn't mean that you're desperately searching for work and can't find it. It also doesn't mean that you're on welfare.
...because despite that, its still way further left than my tastes and historically is CPGB affiliated which immediately lowers my opinion of it significantly, as does its historical association with Soviet apologia even if that was in the past. Its "the West is obviously at fault" narrative with regards to any international issue pisses me off too, and they're anti-EU. These issues matter to me because compared to most voters I'm more concerned with foreign policy issues.Is it as harmful as the Daily Mail or an equivalently far on the political spectrum paper to the right? No. Does that make it a good paper in my view? Hell no.
Can only speak for Austin, but there are a number of really great trailers to hit up. Arlo's is good for post drink grub. It's outside of Cheer Up Charlie's (one of my favorite bars) and has a pretty damn good vegan bacon cheeseburger. Also, you're in Texas, so BBQ is a must. Try BBQ Revolution. Seriously. Jalepeno Mac N Cheeze. Oof. And tacos! You have to have tacos! Give The Vegan Nom a shot.EDIT: Apparently I suck at reading and you've already got BBQ Revolution covered. So I'll throw in some bar suggestions to make up for it! White Horse is pretty good and usually has an awesome two-stepping band playing, as is Shangri-La, Liberty and Jackalope (it's one of the few places on Dirty Sixth I'm willing to visit). 
It's more like the beta is on a completely new server for the time being.   You won't have to reroll toons but instead will get a full respec for your guys.   Your builds and gear may need changes is all.

Just because you stay operating doesn't mean your business model is successful. A successful business model involves being able to adequately compensate your employees. 
Was on a school trip to some cottage place to do some Geo work, our class is female (hot) teacher, 2 girls and me. It was a huge trip with other schools in our federation, so anyway, we go, get to this old house, pretty neat, me and a mate from another school get put into the smallest room possible...being the tallest people in about 50 students.So, we have to walk heads tilted. Anyway, go for a shower, light goes off, fucking sensor is behind the shower door, get out, get the sensor working, finish up, go outside trying to dry up as the shower is just a mess. Walk out, teacher comes to walk in, go to run and jump under bed covers, hit head on wooden beam and fall on the floor nude. So, that was interesting. But, she was hot, so there's that. Hopefully she doesn't browse reddit. 
I used to fake it, but the eyes are the key to the brain. You can glean pieces of information about a person by looking into their eyes. Plus the eyes are the best looking part of the face. Fight the urge to look away. I do it every time I talk to somebody even though it feels awkward.
As I understand it, sort of, yes. It'd actually be a little more like you're reaching out, grabbing the fabric of reality, and using that to push yourself about.Which is quite literally what the EmDrive seems to do. You're just using a machine to do it instead of your hand.So imagine you reach out in a given direction, grab onto nothing (and something) in the air (but not the air itself), and push off of it. If that makes any kind of sense.

&gt; Was the van driver african american? If so its an extremely important detail since whites and white cops seem to be the current target of much of the outrage.There was an interview with an African American woman who is a relative of the van driver.  She claimed Gray was injured by the arresting officers, and was afraid that her relative would be unjustly blamed for the man's death.A black police officer charged, and ambiguous evidence might be the best recipe for reducing racial tension if there is a protracted trial..Of course, the Truth is always preferred.
Yeah, everyone said Kendrick got him on that track, but Pusha was too much. "Gem star razor and a dinner plate, arm and hammer in a mason jar thats my dinner date"
If only Clinkz had some sort of damaging skill that did extra damage to catapults. And if he had some sort of attack speed skill which could synergise really well with that damage skill, that'd be unbelievable. We can only dream of a another skill that would let him kill a high HP creep, like a mega creep, to give him ludicuous amounts of damage and HP to tank a creep wave.
Most of those pics show Black Canary doing the cry with a lot more panache. The actress just opened her mouth and because she didn't actually scream while portraying it, the whole thing came across rather blank and awkward. The lack of sound wave effects and/or wind blowing her hair didn't help either.
Well Canada is somewhat referred as a environmental villian, he obviously hasnt destroyed it but his choices as leader are destroying it and hes doing nothing about it.
It's mainly because "ape" is a term that has a long history prior to the discovery that human beings are more closely related to chimps than chimps are to orangutans (both of which are apes, with no controversy associated).  I typically refer to human beings as apes, personally, but the definition used by society at large (including the scientifically literate public who accept evolution) only includes non-human hominoids.
Encase in Ice should be pretty self explanatory. Stubborn Denial vs Edict effects and Wrath effects such as Foul-Tongue Invocation, Crackling Doom, End Hostilties, Crux of Fate, etc. Aqueous Form vs decks that clog the board up such as Abzan Aggro/Midrange, Temur, and some R/G aggro variants. Ordeal of Heliod vs fast aggro such as RDW or Atarka Red. I also like it in Abzan Aggro but some dont. Disdainful Stroke vs decks running lots of 4CMC or more such as R/G devotion, Abzan Control, and Esper/U.B Control. Treasure Cruise vs decks that try to grind out the game such as Esper/U.B, Abzan Control, or Sultai Whip. Not sure about the Island. 
The onions will get incredibly sweet on their own.I make SMOG all the time (Steak, Mushrooms, Onions, Gruyere) and if you're patient with the onions, the balsamic doesn't take away from the sweetness at all. I add a splash of worcestershire sauce along with my vinegar.  It still tastes like I dumped a pile of sugar into the mess, but it was all natural onion the whole time.Adding sugar only increases the likelihood of burning, and the calories.  Really it's only appropriate if you're taking a shortcut because you don't have time to fully caramelize the onions on their own.  If you're cooking them for an hour? Skip the sugar.
I found that the best way is to actually use specific examples even if you have to make them up. Use specific names and then create situations that would favor your argument.I'm not really the kind of person knowledgeable to judge someone else's essay but I did get a 11 on my essay using specific examples.

Um, ok.  I think you're under the impression that we enforce the "circle of trust" in that region.  The gulf is crowded, straights moreso.  When I was over there prior to the Iraq invasion (aka high tensions and combat readiness) we had ships and planes constantly inside our bubble, and never did a thing about it.  They wont now, either.Also, thats the first time I've ever heard it called "circle of trust" :/

Do you know she wouldn't let you pay?My boyfriend and I pay back and forth. I'll pay for the first date, he pays for the second. I'll get the movie tickets and he'll buy the snacks or cheap dinner after. It's ruder to not listen to someone's wishes than it is to not pay for them. 
Hoosier used as a derogatory term. Most of the country knows of the word, and that it pertains to Indiana, but around here it's a mild way of saying trailer trash.
Is nostalgia seriously blinding us so much that we're remembering the worst parts of BC2 as amazing? Medic trains were horrible. They basically made any encounter into a mini Operation Metro.
You must be talking about bulletproof coffee.  It's supposed to be a brain booster, and appetite suppressant.  I've made it a few times, and it's really smooth, not oily at all.  2T  coconut oil2T  unsalted butter2Cups coffeeBlend like the devil's on your tail.  
no, but as a fellow 20 year old i can say that was just an insanely stupid play and he would have fucked over the bulls (and himself honestly) so bad if dunleavy got hurt there (which he totally could have, his entire ribcage was exposed on that hit)
Modding wasn't paid to begin with, so I'd be baffled at those who decided to dedicate so many hours to it with the purpose of hoping to be monetarily compensated for it. Would be really weird to not realize that they should have chosen a different area to try and sell their work/skills as opposed to one that isn't monetized.That's like someone who wants to be paid for playing sports joining an amateur league and being surprised they aren't getting paid. They obviously won't, since they didn't pursue the leagues where income is actually expected.
Can we stop the bullshit about higher min wage is bad and we're taxed too much?Denmark literally pays people 20+ dollars an hour has free education free healthcare and a higher standard of living than we do.Our tax burden is like 32% to their 38%, it's just getting beyond old.A single payer system is cheaper than what we have in every way possible.
I hope the boos get louder and louder until no one can hear anything that awful man says and they have to abort and get someone else to make the announcements. 
I don't think so? I'm not entirely sure. I check her all over every week. And it's our garden so I know there's no pesticides or anything harsh that could harm her. I have to keep a close eye on her though, because she's fast when she wants to be. You might have an easier time with a BP. Mine just sort of lied there.
Everyone should be able to survive the suicide mission regardless of romance if you play it right. And so long as you don't lock in romance with Jack *in ME3* (me2 doesn't matter) you can still romance Liara in ME3. 
I guess I didn't see Samaritan's actions as calculated and deliberate.  I saw them as impulsive and reckless.  As soon as it was online it went to work hunting the poi team.  It did the bidding of its human agents without question while the machine took time to learn.  While I call it impulsive, I don't mean to say it's any less intelligent.  I think that the sense of tact and focus just comes from extreme intelligence it possesses innately. And I think the parallel was supposed to be subtle but accessible.  Elias isn't a perfect representation of the machine, while Dominic isn't a mirror of Samaritan.  The relationship between them however, is much more closer the ASI godhood dynamicand of course just my opinion
I like the bit you said about the scourge tracing back to Queen Yahrnam's bad blood. Very interesting point you make there, and I feel like it could be true
The concensus among Christian moderates seems to be that God did this to provide a missionary opportunity.  Fundamentals are blaming gay marriage and Obama.   Meanwhile Hindu fundamentalists are saying that it was caused by Nepalese leaders eating meat.
ಠ益ಠ I am gonna destroy that dark beast once I am free. Wait, I think the story ends before I am even free.Anyway, I look forward to the story and keep up the good work.
I worked at an alternative school (where all the kids who were too bad for public school went) for a year where I learned so many ways on how not to be a teacher. Here is my worst story:A group of students always went to the bathroom immediately after lunch every day. One day another student asked why they always did that and my colleague replied "Because they're gay! They have to finish their circle-jerk before class!"I was stunned speechless by that one. Another good one from that school was the science teacher telling a kid he looked like a transvestite. 
I think the earlier point was that someone said Javaris may have gotten someone to take the test for him and then another person replied with "no way dude is smart because he got a 3.5 gpa so he must have gotten that 1400 SAT". I just said it doesn't have to be the case and essentially, it is possible that Javaris got someone to take it for him.
Off topic but I rolled for the first time last night into this morning and skateboarded around town all night with my friends it was really cool not what I expected very subtle it didn't have the life changing feeling acid had for me
Cable may have gone down in the recent years, but it is still vastly larger than any streaming service. Also people used your second argument before it was even on ESPN. What happened is a lot of people got interested and watched it.
If your RDA came with replacement o-rings, I would try putting those on. I had a similar issue with my Dark Horse clone. Switched the o-rings for the included spares, and now it's wonderful.
That's insane. I dropped from 2500 to where I am today mainly because all I was finding was m1.  Will probably drop to gold at some point to check it out. 
Could you please remind me how she unknowingly thanked Locke? Also, I can't remember, but did Locke and Juliet ever share any screen time?Great answer, by the way. 
I enjoyed Mario Golf for the GBC.  While it is not World Tour, if you are looking for a good game, then there are at least a few options.  However, there is only one Animal Crossing for the 3DS from what I can remember.
I believe this refers to the Post-52 Multiverse. He says that Multiverse-2 was their last big meal - they are currently ripping it to shreds. At the same time, Convergence and Secret Wars are doing away with each of their universe's concepts of multiverses. 
Because I'm just not attracted to them, physically or romantically or both... I have lots of friends/acquaintances, many of which are of the sex I am attracted to. Is it a "what gives?" situation that I don't want to fuck any of them? 
The silver goes over the top of the blue pretty well. But the red is much darker on top of the blue and the gold is really thin and will need many coats to not appear green. So I'll probably end up carefully masking off everything that wont be blue before laying that color down.
Damn, Texans fans on twitter are already falling over themselves because "Now everyone else in the Division has a franchise QB". Lets ignore the fact that Bortles wasn't very good, and Mariota has proven absolutely nothing right now.
But those AD Annie though.Jokes aside, I always hated Annie with that high attack range. How the hell can a child toss a flaming pebble farther than most bullets fired in this game?
They're not as rare as you'd think. Compared to the amount of animals, their numbers are few. But there's at least 1 in every section of the jail. Problem is, as soon as other groids catch wind of it, they pretty much disown that person.
Texans fan here. Congratulations on starting to build up a great D-line. I am kind of hapoy Leonard is out of our division. Should be a sexy D ya'll have. 
Anyone who says i don't want you to do something without that effecting them is the biggest problem in our society. Or those people that say dont smoke weed but they are smoking crack.

It's not that you focus on magic pen, but Kennen's kit often requires him to be more in the middle of the fight. Using auto-attacks for w passive, using e, and especially ult, Kennen is often closer than most mages and less safe. Hence why defensive items are generally more rushed.Zhonya's Hourglass is a must-have, and gives him more armor, and gives him more effective HP with health. Rylai's is also good on him to get many procs, and gives him higher effective HP coupled with Zhonya's. Haunting Guise is strong because it gives him more health (not just magic pen) and if coupled with Rylai's can be strong for kiting and damaging both the backline and the frontline. Abyssal gives more 'magic pen' (technically magic resistance reduction), but also makes it easier for him to survive.It's not that magic pen is so important to Kennen, it's that Kennen can play more like a frontline than most mages and typically builds more health and resistances, rather than large AP items.
The sad thing is that the Sparrow's work is really needed in a war torn land, and if she'd use her influence to steer them away from violence it could have been a true force of good for the realm.But Cersei wouldn't be Cersei if she didn't touch something and turned it to ashes.
I don't read/post in /r/news often, but I'm thinking it's frequented by Fox-News-watching types, hence the downvotes and denial of reality. I posted something similar earlier. Basically saying that even in the outlandlish scenario that the mayor is malicious, she wouldn't have admitted to it. People in this subreddit seem to project their idiocy onto others.
What it might be is that there's a list of "default" subreddits that everyone is subscribed to from the get-go (e.g. /r/funny, /r/TwoXChromosomes). If you don't want to see those, you can go to the subreddit page and unsubscribe from the ones you don't like.
I like how bright your colors are! You're doing great with blending, the one in the lower left of the painting has a really interesting shading in his face that is very eye catching. 
You are using your confirmation bias and avoiding asking a larger group of people who are fans of neither team. You are avoiding it for a reason. We both know what will happen. Thanks! When you stop avoiding me let me know! I would love to see the results. PS are you 12? Honestly how do you not know what a message board is? Hell reddit is one. 
Bats go after mosquito's as a last resort or an opportunistic  snack. They have too little return on energy to be a major food source. They like things like moths much much better
No shame. You showed better judgment as a brewer by dumping beer you know wasn't up to snuff. It would have been way worse to pawn it off on friends etc. and pretend it was awesome.
I'm a little bit old school.. but i really believe in Chalk :) not to be funny.. but until they get a handle on calculus pictures are just pretty..I think teachers underestimate the power of their students watching them create the mathematical images in real time.

See, I like that, because I can at least understand Vince's logic here:  he got over doing imitations, so he should be the move-copy character you always see in fighting games.It's not working, but  there's plenty of good ideas that just didn't work once they got in the ring. Which is much more than I can say of fundamentally insane ideas, like trying to get Roman over by feuding him with Big Show.
Surprisingly, yes! In the consensual yet unexpected sense as the one perpetrating the crime. To be honest, I wouldn't mind even the whole breaking in part of it, either. Done safely and with a severe level of forethought. IE: 'breaking glass' to get in, when it's done with a key but have a small thin sheet of pane glass and a hammer over a basket type setup. For that initial, 'What the shit', reaction. Then just. Let it go from there........And you gotta have the proper burglary kit. Well for this situation anyways. Can't very well let the lady home alone make a lot of noise or stir up shit. In the end I figure the only thing that would be 'taken', is a lot of time, and probably a hard cider after the deed was done. ... Then a bowl of popcorn, some aftercare and fuck yes netflix.

Did you look here? https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/4.8Well, the first official preview of 4.8 is not released yet, so maybe they'll still add it.It's really annoying because the changes for ovr linux support are apparently relatively small: https://github.com/3dluvr/UnrealEngine/commits/4.7-linux-ovr
I haven't been yet and I'm still saving up for a trip but Thailand is well known for the abundance and quality of tropical fruits like durian, mangosteen, jackfruit, mango, rambutan, lychee, bananas, etc. Should be easy as well to find plenty of rice based dishes that are vegan. Not sure if people surf there but there's plenty of ocean coastline so I would imagine there's good surfing somewhere.
I thought it was pretty relevant since Chip and Belichick are pretty close... Hell Ozzie Newsome gets my vote for the best GM in the league. I was honestly just mentioning another coach/GM, would have mentioned Belichick regardless of which team he was coaching. ^^^^Except ^^^^for ^^^^the ^^^^Steelers... ^^^^I ^^^^fucking ^^^^hate ^^^^the ^^^^Steelers...
I would choose the plane crash scene (The one with Walt in his pink sweater) which ties the black and white scenes together.I also think the Fly episode as a whole is fun to analyze. I believe the fly is supposed to represent Walt's guilt. To me it explains his irrational behavior in the episode.
Right now, I have a bubblegum that is so spot on it makes me grind my teeth while I vape it.  Tho my regular all day is a mix of berries (heavy on the raspberry) and vanilla creams.  Good call on the locked up at work!  
What I have found from playing 300+ games of Uther is that most of these people just need a little direction. Ping the map when you want them to do something, ask them to group up, etc. Other than that, just do your best to shield and heal them even when they go full retard.
From my experience, to find a job in a relatively specific area like that you would want to supplement your education with an internship. If you can't find an internship, you would want to supplement with your own projects geared toward that.  There should be a web development and a database class. I took the database class, it will give you a very solid understanding of databases to get you started. Can't speak about the web dev. class with certainty but I think they cover javascript and php and get into jquery. 
Marcus Smith, Trading Foles for an injury prone QB Bradford, at the same time giving away picks, Tebow and not getting Mariotta. Chip is really not a good personnel guy.

I am (happily) not a lawyer, so I'm not aware of the finer points of contract law.  Their counter offer may very well be what pushes this from shady to illegal.  I don't know.That said, I probably would have walked out if they tried to change the deal after it was agreed upon, too.
Are you trying to remove it from within manjaro or are you using a live cd? Explain the situation a little better. Why are you removing manjaro? Edit: as in are you looking to install something else. 
Brunhilda - a steatoda, otherwise known as one of the dreaded, but in reality harmless, false widows.  The media has created a witch hunt to make themselves relevant.  The spider's bite could hurt like the dickens, but ultimately wouldn't cause any permanent harm.  It's unlikely to bite in the first place.
I dont see a gut. I see a barrel chest and rib cage. I suppose its possible he's overweight, but my girl has the exact same body shape and she's in no way overweight.
Awesome, thanks everybody! I like having buddies over for BBQ's and to watch UFC/Fight Nights. We regularly play stuff like Street Fighter or Mortal Combat which are a blast, hoping some 4 player local games will be even more fun :) I'll certainly take a look and try out the suggestions so far. 
My 7th grade english teacher told the principal that I was a nigger lover because I defended my reading of "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" for a book report project.  I was sitting right next to the principal's office door and heard her say it clearly.  
Kudos to you, MycTyson. I really like the fact that this sub focuses on mushroom cultivation in a higher level sense. It is obvious that almost all the players on here are familiar with actives and are not ashamed about it, but nonetheless I find the discretion and restraint exercised on this sub to be commendable. There are so many people who have much to contribute out there, but would never fit in or even want to be part of /r/shroomers or the Shroomery for instance. I guess I'm saying that there is a unique overlap between both communities here and that is what makes this sub special. Still learning so I don't post much, but I've been lurking and really enjoying all the content so far.
I've been paying monthly since premium launched (or maybe a month or two in?) rather than yearly simply because I want them to take more of my money. We recently picked up a second subscription for the house too. The quality and integrity of the work they do should be rewarded. 
Be careful not to get caught up on any one girl. This girl is taken. I know local comicons have "geek speed dating", and it sounds like that aligns with your interests.In short: put yourself out there and try to meet people who have similar interests. Meeting new friends (guys) will help your confidence and self image.
This is my issue. I feel like everyone who voted for it are missing out on what was one of the best aspects of RuneScape: Bank sales and Forum Trading. The joy of finding someone to buy your wares and/or finding someone selling what you want is underappreciated here.
Yeah i remember that. Man watching those guys age in the ring just hits home the reality of growing old. They used to be so athletic, Undertaker was athletic far longer though.
Been a little over half a year and I've only just broken even on the expenses this year. :P I'm still quite a bit in the hole from my tools and material purchases last year.
Do you plan on never aging, or just relying on plastic surgery to maintain the physical status quo? Your body will change, your breasts will sag, you will get wrinkles and crow's feet. Best-case scenario is your breasts have sagged because you're providing nourishment for your child, and the lines on your face will be laugh lines instead of frown lines. I, too, worry about your attitude towards your body and relationship affecting your child.
Thanks everyone for the comments and the help! Your willingness to give me some insight about the game and enthusiasm is great! I'm going to jump in and enjoy the game like all of you have. Thanks for being an awesome community. 
Received 6 emails for shipment received. These were shipped out Monday so they probably received it either yesterday or today. 5 ZTE Valet and 1 Alcatel C1 (not sure why they didn't receive the 2nd Alcatel C1 as I shipped all 7 on the same day). These 6 devices are brand new condition (Valets are reconditioned) and there's absolutely nothing is wrong with any of them. I better get the full amount of these (I highly doubt I will).Also, the 5 ZTE Source that I shipped last week has no update yet.
[](/twiponder) Fore some reason I think that J. K. Rowling would write a good MLP episode, even though I do not think she is that good of a writer. But she knows how to write for young people and make it entertaining to the adults too, and also her books share some morals with the show, so that could be interesting.
I'm watching her video where she explains it and damn she wears SO MUCH BLUSH. The island look fits her better.Also, how is making a living out of horse racing blue collar and not no collar?
I mean...it certainly would be very weird to see a Halo character in Smash.But, if they could make a really good moveset and make him fit as much as possible...I wouldn't mind too much.
&gt;On a brighter note, I think these stories make us better people. All the humility and shame, breaks down your ego, you know?No, I dont think so.  Maybe yr exp. of those differs from my exp. of those, but for me, they just reaffirm and reinforce my engagement w/ the fearful distortion of life I constantly find myself uncontrollably constructing.  and i just try to hide from it, but attempts at hiding have been accounted for, in my construction, and counter measures have been designed.So no, i don't think negativity coming from yr own system of entrapment can lead to growth.  but i might b misinterpreing yr words.
All of Hawaii is beautiful and much of it "lush," but we're the only "Garden Isle!" Our east and north sides are the most green and the south and west the most brown (as are all of the islands due to the prevailing NE trade winds). Not sure why- possibly our mountains rise more steeply from the coast causing immediate orographic lift and reaching the dew point more rapidly as compared with the Big Isle or Maui where the lift may be more gradual? Being at a slightly more northern latitude causing more mixing of warm and cold air? Having its high point in the center of the island so that we receive rail coming from every direction? Combination of all of the above? Doesn't really matter too much to me as I look out of my classroom window (Kapaa High School) and see the bright sunny sky and the waves off in the distance. All I know for sure is that I'm grateful to call Kauai home for the last 20 years and hope to for 20 more! Aloha!
I totally agree. It's time to switch counselors for sure.  I promise you, no feels or ill will, will be had by anybody.  This is a very common thing to happen at a methadone clinic. :)
I think Moonkins have the most fun on any fight with more than one target. Bethilac was probably my favourite, and Ryolith wouldn't allow me to be below top DPS.
I started thinking the Jags were gonna do something stupid and draft a WR. I'm glad they went with Fowler, I think it's a great pick. He's gonna be really good in a couple years.
You don't spend 25mil for someone with potential and nothing else. I dont' think we expected him to be Hazard level in his first season, but no one spends 25mil for a youngish player who can't even nail down a starting spot. We wouldn't pay 25mil for Towsend and he's english.Lamela's the kind of player who could find his feet and really capture his potential in the space of a season, but the chances of that are pretty slim and like /u/straplessbrad said, if we get something in the vicinity of 20mil for him you gotta take that. It's effectively giving us an insurance policy on that transfer.
&gt;Ah but now you dropped solely, you are saying something different now. Work your shit out.You aren't comprehending. Solely not being the only 'trait' in the law, but solely meaning that an employer can't fire you "solely" because of your sexual orientation (along with other protected immutable traits). &gt;I'm bisexual and currently dating a guy and if anything it affected work more when I was dating a female.Cool. http://www.bna.com/lgbt-minorities-face-high-unemployment-job-discrimination-low-wages-study-finds/&gt;So the US passed straight/white/majority discrimination laws?You don't seem to be understanding this point. It adds sexual orientation as a protected class (in certain respects). Heterosexuality is a sexual orientation. &gt;See the problem here is "cause of action". What is that? What does that entail?It entitles you to file a legal complaint. It will be dropped if it has no merit and you will be charged a lot of money in attorney and filing fees. 
I don't believe in the Sub/Ob division of "reality."That division is, itself, "subjective."I will say this: a normal person will have an empathetic burst of 'ill-ease' when witnessing something that we would call 'bad.' People who do not have this sympathetic reaction are 'psychopaths' and do not count as human cognitively. Even a psychopath knows when they've done something wrong. They simply don't feel bad about it. Which is what makes them inhuman.You *know* when you've done something bad. Everyone knows.I don't buy this pure logic "I'z totes Vulcanz" bullshit.
SMS is better than nothing but I'd rather have something based on crypto rather than "trusted" channels like SMS. It's possible (difficult, but possible) to eavesdrop on SMS.
For real. I didn't really follow him, I'll be honest. I heard all the talk about deflected passes and shit. About 10 of the 18 were thrown directly into the gut of a zone defender.
Update: VLC for iOS handles .m3u files well, so as a temporary fix, using .m3us works for me :DActually I feel like this needs further explanation.  So if I have files file1.ogg, file2.ogg, and file3.ogg, I would also have something like an oggplaylist.m3u, which contains literally the following    file1.ogg    file3.ogg    file2.oggWhen I point my VLC for iOS under Network Stream to http://192.168.0.50:8080/oggplaylist.m3u, VLC for iOS plays, in sequence, file1.ogg, file3.ogg, then file2.ogg
The story and characters will differ completely and supposedly even the versions will play differently from a tactics standpoint.  So that's quite different than Pokemon.  Plus, everything confirmed is true for Japan only till proven otherwise since they are getting it much earlier than everyone else.  
All he said was that people should have a good standard of living. Everyone except sadists agrees that everyone should have good standard of living. The only question is how to achieve it.
Decent if you're still in the experimenting phase, where you don't know what kind of look you want to commit to. However it's a poor investment in the long run. 1 or 2 pairs of nice pants is much smarter than having to rebuy some $25 pairs over and over again. Never been a massive fan of fast fashion chains since there's little to no innovation. Its just watered down version of whatever's trendy. imo you can't be anti-PacSun but still be a fan of H&amp;M or Uniqlo.

He was phenomenal in that series. He shut down Ovi and Backstrom and essentially forced the caps to rely on third and fourth line scoring to get it done. He (and Halak) were pretty much the only two players keeps the Islanders alive in game seven. His stock is super high in my book

Seriously, I genuinely don't understand these people that get rid of their pets after they have kids. My parents had a cat before they had me. That cat was POSSESSIVE of me, sat on top of my stroller, and loved me. And of course my parents taught me not to be abusive toward her because... that's a good life lesson? These people utterly baffle me.
This change is going to be with us for a while, you don't want to half ass it.I think we should just make Australia change their flag, we had ours first.
Well... she's  just the opinion of one chick out of half the population. Some chicks like it, some chicks don't. It's gonna be 50/50 any way you try and swing it. 
Well, from my perspective, the larger priority isn't so much balance in representation, but whether this is what people want. Even if the result is an imbalance in media, I'd have to argue that it seems women are getting what they want more often than not, so I don't really see a problem.Besides that, regardless of whether the aggregate pass/fail results for the test show anything useful, I was originally posting from a technical perspective to show that maybe the design of the test could use a little work.
I have the Terpz brand enail.  Loving it for the $250 or whatever it cost.  If you don't mind analog you can get the 710whip for $150 or so.  I had that too, but digital was nice so I sold it. 
What would you consider low end in this situation? I'ved noticed pretty much all bikes in the ~$500 range have "lower end" (I guess?) suntour forks. So are you pretty much saying you shouldn't buy a bike unless you're spending closer to $1000 on itNot trying to sound like a jerk/idiot...it's a legit question.
In WWE's Music DVD from a few years ago Jim Johnston said that Rock's theme has always been nearly the same from rocky Maivia all the way to his current, it's just been changed to sound a bit differently.
You kind of come off as a lone wolf. What kind of shit do you like to do that a potential love interest can partake in? You can even put some clichés as a conversation starter. For example, "I've been to country X. While there i saw (insert tourist attraction). It was amazing! I'd really like to visit country Y some day in order to see (insert tourist attraction here)" then when someone reads your profile they have something to connect with. 
That's the thing, when it comes to Anti-SJ and the different forms it takes, they've done nothing but prove they're just trying to justify literally anything they do. "True" Justice? "True" Equality? Men's Rights? Ethics in Journalism? All a crock of shit. All they really care about it being pseudo-edgy shitheels and justifying/trivializing it afterwards.
I bought a Sandisc 32gb class 10 card last year for my S4, and it worked for like a month. Then it was unusable, not even being read by my PC. I just sent it back to be replaced, as that has been a common problem. I just bought a 64gb sammy class 10 card for $22, and it's been working good for my S4. Just stick with a Sammy card.
&gt; He doesn't fit the traditional boxes of boy or girl.Couldn't be because those traditonal boxes are ever-shifting, socially enforced bullshit though right? 
what a coincidence - bought the cicada bundle last saturday, PUG basic'ed the X-5 and the 2A, and mastered the 3M.  I'v been on a HUGE LPL kick the last few weeks, leveled the urbie with a pair and did pretty well so figured dual LPL + ECM would be killerhttp://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab#i=36&amp;l=613d3551dd940ddb004a868cbd8b61662be03571  i'm blown away - she smokes everything in sight[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/rBcQ9g0.jpg?1)
&gt; Even Harry Potter book fans bitched about every divergence in each of the Harry Potter movies.The HP fandom is the only one I've seen that was a bad about differences (and as whiny about it) as the ASOIAF community, which is saying something because that one was composed primarily of children and adolescents.

To add to this, our biggest problem today is that we very rarely discuss issues across ideological lines. Words like "socialism," "conservatism," "capitalism," "libertarian," etc. mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Theoretically that's a great thing when it comes to policy discussions because it allows us to tackle problems from a variety of perspectives. Sadly we often view politics as the battle of ideologies rather than attempts to solve problems together. Ideologies are big, abstract, and general things. All too often we get lost in considering what policy is socialist or conservative or whatnot instead of actually looking of the policy is going to fix the problem in an effective manner. Yes, you can and should work from a set of principles, but all too often we forget that our aim is solutions, and we hold the principles we do because we think they will lead to the best solutions.
Raiders aren't gonna let Cooper slide especially with Carr at QB, that will be a deadly combination. Williams will probably go to the Skins and I doubt anyone is gonna trade up for a RB in this draft.
Cant post jag code. And if you did it would expire by the time any turk got around to it.And i was thinking keep bank locked, just have them power lvl wc or mining or something :PNot something Id do, its a terrible idea, but I was just curious.
Again, there's nothing confirmed that we offered them anything...just a bunch of rumor and heresy. I don't think Chip would be that stupid to offer those trades...he even said he wasn't that stupid explicitly, and yet still the rumors abounded.
I can't tell if you are joking or not.  If you are joking, then I would say "haha yeah, NGE is totally ripping off of FMA."  If you are not, then I should correct you because NGE came out almost 10 years before FMA, so I don't think it NGE could reference something that hadn't even come out yet.  Also, that symbol is called "The Tree of Life" and is a Hebrew symbol as described [here on the Evageeks Wiki](http://wiki.evageeks.org/Tree_of_Life), so it is actually a reference to a real thing.
Wait, what about a family protection act? If human beings are acting like loud fucks it shouldn't matter how old they are, loud is loud (and kid loud is ESPECIALLY loud.)
Oob is the ultimate prodigy. He has the strength of Majin Boo with no training whatsoever, far suppressing anyone's potential. FRIEZA was a prodigy of his own, who also had no training, relying on pure natural talent instead, had the strength of a Super Saiyan, and with little training was able to stand toe to toe with ascended God form Goku. Oob, being an order of magnitude more powerful than prime Namek saga Frieza, is on a whole new tier of potential compared to Frieza.
Titan vs. LC: I really don't believe in Snakeskin. It seems like if Titan bans out Tyr (which they probably will) he's going to really struggle in lane especially against someone like Confrey.C9 vs. Denial: I'd be very surprised if this game didn't go 2-0 in C9's favor. Apparently they've been on a grind since not making it to LAN, and since Denial doesn't even have anywhere close to the amount of practice working as a team as C9 does I think it's going to be a pretty clear victory.
Lol, I know that. I wasn't talking about the fee. I'm well aware HR 4 can do some HR 7 quests, if not most of them. I'm also aware of the refund once you cancel quests. Its not the money that bothers me. Its the people buying the second quest literally right after I buy the initial quest, which in MY experience at least, is usually what hunters go on, in a sprt of first come first serve manner. That is of the lobby leader isn't already buying them, as per ettiquete, their lobby, they choose the quest.
I was *really* hoping for mainhand focus, where the mesmer summons illusionary weapons to strike with instead of striking with real ones.I suppose *another* offhand is fine too...
I hear you, but it can still be a little exasperating when you first start reading contemporary research papers. Sure, it might be simple for the ten people on earth who work in the area that the paper is aimed at, but as an undergrad trying to grind through it...It's something you get used to I guess. 
How do you give him that gr8 theme but drop the gimmick so hard. The mocking would probably be nice occasionally but not like how they're using it already.
well i guess thats the thing. I dont low ball, like i said, im not pros like you guys. if the deal is there i take it. i might ask for 5-10 dollars off for the psychology of it but i never undercut by over 30%.secondly, I update the ad so I can have proof that I am a safe seller. I always post "please search for my posts" and it puts people at ease. I've found it to ease the nerves of people.
First few picks are most of the time...it's about to start going to shit soon.  Leo will go 4, then who knows tbh I really hope Chicago doesn't get Cooper.  Ugh I'd be pissed.  And I hope white busts if they get him.  But if they're smart, they'll go defense

No, your chances of getting in are still the same as before. Nobody can predict whether your waiver goes through or not, you just have to wait it out. Edit.Just out of curiosity what is the waiver for?
Alright, are you free to play right now? ^-^and another thing... what's something feasable to tell him? I really can't make up good lies. It isn't my skill.
20, Male, England, university student. Started watching about six weeks ago (from the beginning on Netflix) as it had been sitting in my Netflix list for months and after a recommendation from a friend. Originally put it on the list because I really really like Donald Glover.
BMJ has said that there is a lot of typos in this edition, but it features a much better layout and has relevant page numbers listed to things. A V3.3.1 will be coming out later this or next week.
How is this a matter of greed?  An oversight by the Council perhaps, but are you really suggesting that the Council, Chorus and the ISPs all sat down in some sort of shadowy board room and decided to fuck with the poor and elderly by providing them with a high-end product that many people would willingly pay extra for?
lol, its cause you made it sound like you have zaiross and zeratu :PI am on the same boat as you, got my Verad and was crying, i dont even have a Jamire, so maybe a shitter boat ha.
We aren't getting a new era in DLC, if it was something they could do in the month and a half it takes to put out a map pack don't you think they'd have just done it by launch?Maybe planets from the new movies, but even then I'd rather they not blow all the dlc on the new movie so we actually have something to look forward to when the new Era battlefront gets released with the whole trilogies worth of battles.My money is on Yavin, and Lothal as DLC planets

Holy shit, that was some awesome writing. Somebody get an animator, artists, musicians, voice actors, audio engineers and editors because we are going places with this kid. [Here comes the money, baby!](https://youtu.be/McDXSxH3Sx8?t=48s).
having read the book twice and watched the movie a number of times, it does it plenty of justice and the book gave me the same treatment as the movie did. I can understand not liking it at first because there was so much in the book I wanted to be in the film, (going to vegas, hawaii, etc.) but repeat viewings made me realize it's bound to become a cult classic in the future.
Yeah, we've all been there, either on the firing or the receiving end of the ballista...the first time I got summoned for Pursuer, I was shot within a couple seconds.
Thanks for your input! I have been reflecting on my study habits between my different classes recently and I know that I should have done more practice problems throughout the term - especially since there was little to no homework formally assigned in the two courses that I didn't do too great in. I kinda wish that I knew this at the beginning of the year, but I guess that was part of the first year learning process :)
Nah, it's just people learning from mistakes, nothing wrong with thatYes we should forgive Steam and give it its right praises, but we should *not forget* what was donePlus, what's wrong with putting eggs into more than just one basket? A basket that's even DRM free 
I know that. But that doesn't change the fact that he was very raw and didn't get that much interest from other big time programs. He barely played as a freshman and had to be developed 
Yeah that makes sense. Thanks for your help . I have an MBUS front sight so it seems kinda silly to me now to get an FSB just for the bayonet lug that I probably wont ever use. 
I'm not a teacher, but this happened to another student I know in my economics class. We were all working on our worksheets, then, out of the blue, my teachers ask the girl "are you a cutter? Is that why you wear long sleeves?" It was so offensive and uncalled for. Many students began to defend her and he shrugged it off as if it had no impact. 
The problem is by having a 100% cap, but allowing everyone to constantly gain ATB it goes from free-flowing attack as you get ATB into 'rounds' ordered by your speed.As a mechanic the way it's implemented is really braindead.  It'd be a lot better if it figured out who is next, how long it would take them, and then everyone else gets their speed * that amount of time.  If someone else is at 100%, nobody gains anything.
In Ontario salaried employees are legally required to be paid for overtime or get it in lieu (based on the equivalent hourly rate of what the job contract hours/week is) unless they are managers or certain professions. I've had a few salaried jobs and I have always gotten overtime pay (and it's 1.5 after a certain number of hours). 
That would be because it would be all about turning your respective countries into so much radioactive black glass. You do great with your geopolitical bullying until the threat of a big firework is known. 
My department has hired from it before. I've gotten about 3 messages from recruiters a year since I've started working and using it.Your mileage will vary depending on what you can put on it.   Recruiters are looking for people with a skill set for their client. If you don't have that skill you won't get messages.  It's not a tool  for people without experience
That seems unlikely to me. Do you have a source?If the minimum accuracy of the barge's GPS is 3m and the accuracy of the stage's landing is ~10m that means it could easily be off by 13m in any direction. It seems likely that the barge and rocket ping each other to get a much more accurate relative location. Such systems are cheap (off the shelf) and lightweight.
Before the French flag joke shows up: a Japanese guy could just draw a red dot in the middle of the flag and claim the Moon for Japan. Then the US would have to drop an atomic bomb on the moon to get it back I suppose. 
I think he re-signs in Detroit, but those aren't bullshit reasons. I mean, connections are a huge part of getting any job. Doubly so in hockey. And Nicholson and Babcock absolutely have a connection. Hell, that's a huge reason Chiarelli is in Edmonton after 9 days of unemployment. And wasn't a small part of the St. Louis trade because he needed to spend time with his dying mother in Connecticut? Nobody thinks it's conclusive, but it's far from a horseshit reason.
Actually, the ancestors of the Greenlandic Inuit, the Thule, arrived in Greenland well after the Vikings. The  Viking discovery of Greenland occurred in  AD 986 and the Thule migrated into Greenland about 300 years later, around AD 1300. However, the now extinct Palaeo-Eskimos arrived in Greenland around 2500 BC. They disappeared from across the Arctic around AD 1000 as they were displaced by the Inuit.Edit: grammar
Agree on the diversity point whole heartedly. I just cannot wrap my head around how anybody can say they are a wrestling fan and actually WATCH LU more than one episode and then say LU doesnt work for them. I'd like to hear your reasoning. 
When you said "deep voice" I knew exactly who you were talking about!  Budapest popped up on a playlist I subscribe to and I really liked it.  Turns out he was opening for a show I already had tickets to, and when he walked out I thought it was the sound check guy because I was expecting a 30 year old bearded hipster.
Confessions:- I initially hated Robin and Lucina because 'Who even cares about Fire Emblem'. I quickly took that back after watching a Let's Play on it and playing as Robin and Lucina- I also initially hated Palutena because of her 'god powers' I assumed she was gonna be OP and broken beyond belief. I also took that back after watching Chuggaa's Let's Play of KI:U. And by Chapter 8 of his videos I really regretted hating her.- I didn't think Pac Man would be interesting until I played him- I actually like using Final Smashes- I actually don't think Dark Pit being a carbon copy of Pit is a bad thing since it's actually canonical
When they thought Iranians would support their cult. When they had to pay foreigners to attend their rallies. When they had to conjure bullshit claims about Iran's nuclear program to remain relevant to the US and Israel.
It's not selfish. That's the number one reason I will vote for presidential candidates. I don't agree with any of their policies in general, but I would like my life to get better at least.
Mortal kombat is still on the simple end of fighting games, at least mechanically. Games like guilty gear have characters with more special moves than MK characters have strings, Marvel vs capcom expects you to learn 3 characters and how they work together. look at this system list http://www.dustloop.com/wiki/index.php?title=Guilty_Gear_Xrd_-SIGN-  Guilty gear is a game where you can cancel any move at any time with a single button, this greats A LOT of depth. And once you've gotten that deep Mk is shallow in comparison, but i feel the varations make up for that. People have been playing fighting games for a long time, and a lot of skill transfer over. My years of street fighter made me a intermedait smash bros player the second I grabbed the controller, so for some people getting it down isn't as hard because of years of dealing with similar things.

Holy crap, you remind me of how I played on my first 1CC: really aggressive stages 1 and 2. You're a bit worse at getting to the POC, but a crapload better at bombing. You missed some great POC opportunities in Stages 2 and 4, but at that point it wasn't essential to your survival, so it really doesn't matter. Also, on Misdirection, you didn't have to stay on one side, but switching sides hasn't worked for me lately, so I suppose you found the better tactic for now. Good job on Remilia, though.If you're anything like me (which I highly suspect), PCB will be somewhat easy, IN will be about the same, (let's ignore PoFV), and MoF will be really easy, and you'll get stuck on SA. That's how it went down for me.
Grill marks make sense on a steak cooked on an open grill e.g. charcoal, but if you're using a pan ditch the fake grill pan and sear in a regular pan. This way you maximize the delicious maillard reaction.
I get to the park about an hour early for our shift every day, just so I can sit alone in the stadium and watch workouts, so I've had a few. I had a chat with Tommy Hunter while we watched Chris Davis smash BP homers the other day, and ran into Rick Dempsey on his way to the booth on another. This is my first year with the team, so I plan to have many more!
Or go for an LLM, or a doctorate in your useless undergrad degree. You might never get out of debt, but people will have to call you doctor. technically.
I dont think the Rangers will move Talbot until the deadline or possibly hold onto him until he hits UFA. They're contending and are in no hurry to get rid of Lundqvist's insurance. If possible I'd like to get both. 
If I was at the game, I likely would have boo'd.  I would have thought twice about it later, but it's pretty tough not to be pissed off at Wilmer right now for fucking us over in such a critical game against our rival.
I'll definitely see if I can get the car inspected by a local mechanic, hopefully the dealer will allow me to do so. Also thanks for the advice and I'm sure I'll love owning one, ill post again if I do end up buying the car
just recently moved to Burlington, VT where Sanders began his political career as mayor, and he is hailed as a god around here. really cool progressive guy though. 
My older brother committed suicide two months before yours. I've only had two dreams about him; in the first, it was Christmas exactly like when I was a kid. The excitement waking me up at 4am just to look at presents for four hours until my parents woke, the smells, the snow lightly falling. My big brother was standing in front of the Christmas tree with an emerald dress (imagine the Queen's dress in the Silver Chair, BBC version). In the second dream, he had faked his death to get out of student loans and had come back to see me. It was a terrible mixture of fury directed at him for faking suicide and the most incredible relief I have ever felt. I have yet to dream about my little brother's suicide (3/9/14). 
I mean, there's clearly contact there, but also a bit of flopping. It's the playoffs, it gets chippy. Should've been called as a foul. It's blatant players are getting under each other's skin all series. It's unnecessary and should be punished, but it's playoff basketball. I just think the whole tackling a player into the first row at home is exponentially worse.  
After Calgary gets hammered by Anaheim I suspect Anaheim fans will look [like this](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/de/de0d49c2382968aae63704bfdd8ee19ffdc60d4173bfd320a569d16c23229f50.jpg) when trying to get people to hop in the bandwagon 
I pick 33. Old enough to know better, but young enough not to care. And I like to bet my age in roulette and that was still on the board. I would have moved out of phoenix earlier, but generally prefer not to want to change decisions because it is all a series of events that lead to my life now and it ain't so bad. 
I let my mouse free roam around the End Table and couch arm; he would normally not be able to go anywhere from there except this time I had forgotten I had a blanket up against the side and he crawled down. Just don't be stupid like me; keep your rats barricaded, even though it's super satisfying to have them be so tame they won't run away :c
Right. In a certain sense they are *infinitely* different; velocity is not really the "natural" way to parameterize reference frames, which is done with something called the *boost parameter*. The boost parameter to get to c is infinity, and the boost parameter to get to 0.999 999 999 999 999 999 999 9951c is a boost parameter of a little over 27. The time dilation factor is 3.1 x 10^(11).Yes, it is at rest in its own reference frame, as anything is. And photons do not have reference frames, because there's no frame in which they are at rest. The math for viewing things in rest frames breaks down when you try to apply it to things moving at the speed of light.
I know I should be used to it by now, and I shouldn't feel so offended by it but I still get irrationally pissed off when waitstaff try to give me English menus and suchWent to a sushi place last night, the woman working there led me to the seat, and then reached over and turned the iPad ordering thing into English... I then instantly sat down and turned it back to Japanese. I knew she was going to change it too. I know she's just trying to be helpful, but it still pisses me off every time.EDIT: Also, there was a vibrator behind my bike in my apartment's bike parking lot. I'm not even mad, just wondering what the hell was going on in the bike parking lot. 
Probably depends on where you live but in the U.S. it's the freedom to walk, or drive, or hang out without being hassled by the police. Generational benefits also grant both income and a better chance for a good education. On the other side of the coin, we bleed when cut, cry when hurt and sometimes are able to look deeper into other cultures and see their struggles.
Caring happensIt just doesEgo is forced into anUnsustainable positionLike a cornered animalAll conceptualizations witheredPutrefiedNot solvingNot dissolvingAnythingEverAnd then(Which is another nameFor now)Love happensIt just doesDon´t beat yourself too hard. I avidly follow Mooji´s every step also (I hesitated [ego] to even answer woo since I seem to be in a sort of lurker period, but well), and the ego is there even on sages. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ew4ysq53mI) could both prove and ´unprove´ that Mooji has and has not ego, kinda like they used the bible to both justify and deny slavery.But (like he himself says) I will keep quiet about these things with the ´uninitiated´. ´You´ may accept the truth that there is ego even on saints, ´others´ may accept the truth that you get to a point where there is no ego. They are concepts, allowed by love. TLDR; Love is the answer to everything. 
Haha that's funny. The only things we have come up with is Kevin Bacon, Nathanial Bacon, Alexander Hamlet, Piggy Smalls, or Swaggy Pig. None are that great... 
"Yo...Bruce...Ima let you finish... But first... My gal Beyoncé had the BEST dick out there!  She was doin this fo' longer AND fo' bettah!"All kidding aside, I went from supreme hate to mild distaste due to his support of Jenner.  In fact, if he didn't have such an ugly ego, I think I'd really like Kanye; I just cannot get past a man who believes no one is capable of giving him constructive criticism on his music or recently, his poor choice in business ventures...
5/5 won phoebe in an auction. Mayor was very polite. Would trade with again. [Proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdoptMyVillager/comments/33xxt4/au_phoebe/)
Some additional thoughts:1. Electrics.  If you have children, consider upgrading your electrics.  This gets you an 'RCA' box which trips instantly if there's any current leak to ground.  You might also need a new electrical wire if you want to install an electric oven.  This can cost around £1000.2. Will you want new carpets?  Or at least clean the existing ones?  You can rent a wet vacuum for £50, or get someone else to do it for £100+.  Worth sorting out before you put all the heavy furniture down!3. Upgrade to double glazing?4. Replace the old water tank etc with a combi boiler?
Do you wanna know what cured my crippling gender dysphoria, which was so bad I craved death daily? I'll give you a hint: it starts with 't' and ends in 'ransitioning'.
Thanks, brother. I'm such a huge fan of TDWP, and so I just like to support their stuff whenever possible. I just happened to have bought the vinyl earlier that night because I saw it on their merch table, and I am one of those guys who just sits and waits for the crowd to disperse so I don't have to deal with all of the people leaving, so I was just sitting there waiting and saw Mike come out, so I went for it!He really is such a cool guy. We talked for a moment about living in Japan, he said he wants to do more gigs out there, which I think would be awesome!Oh, and if you were wondering, I had him sign it on the flipped side, not the side you'd play the record on haha
Looks like the Jacksonville Faguars won't be scoring any points for another season. I'll be looking forward to playing whichever defense plays them on my fantasy team YET AGAIN.
The source video posted above doesn't show his face or seem to confirm he is actually alive (his voice could be dubbed), but it is even more disgusting than the gif so you should check it out.
No. Then the reviewer could point to specific claims not backed by facts. In no way can they malign the authors by suggesting that their gender is somehow impacting on how they interpreted the data and that the best recourse would be to bring some men on to help.
Fight was an exhibition between [Ali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali) and a young [Michael Dokes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dokes). Here's the full fight, including a short interview with Ali at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxljffDkH5k
Not sure what this means. All I want to know is if the watch serves as the receiver and takes data directly from the gray thing stuck to your side. I would actually hope that the watch end was open to competition and could be any number of watches. What exactly are you saying this means? Do you still have to have the dexcom receiver with you all the time, or can you go around with just a watch and the transmitter? This is what I want to get a clear picture of. I don't care who I pay as long as I get a watch with no other junk required except the transmitter and sensor stuck to/in my side.
Pompey has been my biggest disappointment, he's struggling hard at the plate, and has made some crucial errors in the field. I don't think we will be a successful team if he's up all year.
Not that he said it was a, but what's so bad about a sleeve as a goal? They're expensive, time-consuming, and usually take some thought. Edit: Spelling
If you're playing hungry dragon without a semi-sure way of dealing with up to 3 health, you're just hoping that you get lucky.  Imo, it's a poor play to play hungry dragon by itself unless you're very ahead or very behind.
i also like that about FH. but one of the things i like about AHs videos is that they are so long. i have basically stopped watching TV because i get plenty of entertainment from AH. there are still a few shows i enjoy, but RT/AH has taken over the majority of my media consumption, and i am happy about that.
Alright, so we appear to have hit a dead end. We're going to start making a video that will summarise everything we presently know in a few days. It'll probably be posted in 1-3 weeks. This one won't be a text update because we understand how boring they can get. We're also going to try to analyse the last two videos as much as possible. Thanks for your patience in this matter, we're hoping something good comes up soon.
&gt; Real condolences are private and are delivered in person or over a phone call, even a text message is acceptable.I have family that lives over 4000 miles away. It would be extremely costly for them to travel all the way here for my funeral, were I to die today. Posting a message of condolence on Facebook would unite them with the rest of my grieving family and show that they are still a part of the family even though they are far away.Also, I have friends that live some hundreds of miles away that I have not seen in years. I may not have their parents' numbers, if I've even met them, but I still may wish to express my condolences without going to the funeral.Don't you think it would be rude if everyone kept scrolling after someone posted that their loved one had died? It would seem to the person maintaining the FB page that their loved one had been lonely and friendless.
Confirming mage works wellI did this and my chugga died turn 3. Ended up winning by duplicating mirror image twice. I didn't even draw ooze, water elemental! Thanks man!
I totally get and agree with your point but the lion example was taken way further than it needed to be. If the kid's walking to his friend's house (as he should be able to) and he gets nabbed by a lion, that's a much more comparable example to what we're talking about here. Most women who are gang raped by strangers on the street weren't walking 2 miles to get water for their families - they were just walking to a friend's house, or to work, or some other innocuous activity that anybody should expect to be able to do without being gang raped.
Great thing about the Conda is you can get these type of results almost anywhere in the Galaxy.  I have 21LY jump loaded with 452 and routinely hit 600K per stop.  I have moved around alot as I pull out as soon as the market drops below 550K per stop.  Thrudd's and TradeDangerously will provide enough potential runs too stay in the 6M+ per hour range with no problems.
I should say 80-100 is the goal for the first 8 or so months, rather than recruiting huge amounts on the first day of a campaign. As with any focus in XCOM it's affected by the research tree I'm pursuing and how quickly I expand to other continents. Generally I'll camp one continent with 4 or 5 interceptors for a long time, and strictly focus research on beam and aerospace, with minimal foundry projects and usually 2 SHIVs to help carry squads.
Is your use of comedians in your casts a habit or a preference? Bill Burr may be one of the best in the business at the moment, and I'd love to hear why you find them worth the dramatic roles you've written for them. Thanks!
Funny enough, I snapped this photo a month or so ago when our landlord wash was swapping out the machine for a different model.  Though, I do like that this post is sending people to go look at their machines.

2004,  My favorite movie ever, Eurotrip, came out.  The aviator, The life aquatic with steve zissou, the incredibles, team america:world police, sky captain and the world of tomorrow, harold and kumar go to white castle, and so many other great movies came out that year.
Marriage isn't a religious institution, that'd the fallacy with the gay marriage argument. If marriage were a religious institution then it wouldn't be seen across such a wide array of cultures. 
I could write volumes on these issues but they would fall upon ears that have been conditioned not to listen. :(It boils down to:Until Joe Average loses all their consumer junk (I.E. their "investment" in the system), and liberties, there will be no uprising.When that time arrives it will be far too late.Generation by generation they increment stronger controls in your lives, lessen your "freedom", change what you eat into garbage unfit for consumption, etc ad infinitum.I'm shocked by what people are willing to accept today and you will be shocked by what your children will accept.The most unfortunate part is that those in control have patience and long term planning, they have played this game for centuries, and they know, proven by history, what they can and cannot do to their cattle.  :(
There isn't one simple answer to this. inconsistency can have a lot of reasons. Couple of pointers: * Look at your demo's and have a close look, don't look at your highlights. Look at the whole demo and take it slow, look at your actions and decisions. Have a look at the information that you got. * Crosshair placement. This is very very important, just in case you have not seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mvXfnY8wU), do watch it. This  should help you an insane amount. * [Corners &amp; perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk) * Play more! Really, if you aren't playing well - do not lose motivating. Just keep it up. 
And that is what they are for, all I mean is that people should learn to defend their lives without a gun as it wont always be there or practical to use. And I just firmly believe that if a situation doesn't need a gun involved by no means should one be introduced, don't get me wrong I am also a firm believer in CCW sometimes i just wonder if there shouldn't be a more rigorous training for getting out of situations without ever needed your weapon before you can be licensed to carry.   
OK, the Squire Classic Vibe is actually a good guitar? I see this everywhere but..... Just..... SQUIRE!! they have one at my local shop for 370, should I pick it up?
&gt;That's the exact same excuse for morality fundies claim. Morality has been around much longer then religion, but religion claims it started with them....and we bring religion into it.
I'm not seeing any either, apart from the paint sets with bundled brushes.It's possible that they are revamping them yet again, although they seem to do it every two years.  Maybe they had to switch brush manufacturers again?
I hope it's what speeds he says he gets. For me, I have 300/20. It sometimes dips but I'm not getting throttled by Time Warner. Hell, I even torrented (not pirated) a super mario galaxy disc image for emulation and got no throttle from them.
depends how it manifests. if it's in the form of increased fondness/physical intimacy with me, generally ok/flattered. if it's antagonistic, it is a turnoff.
I have small scars on my arms, chest, and upper back mostly. It's almost all self inflicted, something I very recently found out is called Trichotillomania. I do it mostly if i see an irregular mark or spot, nervousness, and because it strangely feels good to pick my skin and scabs/cuts.
I'd suggest interesting, not good. His points are food for thought, whether to delve further into it, or to try and disprove them. But good … I'd like an example?Edit: Reddit. Where the bigotry runs so deep you get down voted for calmly asking someone to elaborate.

It would have been really cool to get him but I am glad we didn't end up shipping multiple picks and Fletcher Cox. If the Titans really did turn down that reported offer than that is crazy but I think it's for the best we didn't give all that up.

If it details the post 1613 name then it certainly does use Londonderry. If you want the map to use Doire then you should also object to just about every one of the counties shown for Ireland as they are post Norman inventions.
I have wavered between the grey and the color.  In the end, when the hype has faded away and colors can be chosen at leisure, what will remain but those who chose to not press when tempted.
Just want to point out that the alpha have been out for quite a while now. I got my invite about a month ago or so, and they've been going on for a few months before that as well.
Yep.  And that dissapointment is what people get for hopping on the blind-ass hype-train.  Don't know why people chose to believe in that shit and actually put their expectations on it in the first place :/

Yeah. I want to know if you select the Lightning Rune and make your whirlwind deal Lightning Damage, will Skull grasp increase this whirlwind damage to 700%+ Weapon Damage as Lightning, and thus will CoE then buff up the weapon damage as lightning portion during COE: Lightning rotation, while also buffing Dust Devils during the COE: Physical rotation. If it worked that way, I think it would be a decent synergy to get as much use out of COE as possible.So this setup:Whirlwind: Lightning  ( Dust Devils : Physical )Rend : ColdOverpower : Fire So that *Something* is *always* being buffed by CoE instead of how most barbs run it, only getting burst 1/3 of the time by relying on Physical.
Wow your life sounds amazing.  I legit had a smile reading through this post.  Thank you for your advice.  It's funny because I've read an article today and it had the quote, "not all who wander are lost."  I think it's a fulfilling thing to move from career to career since people do change and their dreams change as well.  I wish I can make the most of life like you have.  Stay awesome and thanks again : )EDIT: The article I read was about a woman who quit her 90k paying job to scoop ice cream in an island and she's thinking about doing other things in life.  I thought this relevance was pretty cool.  She seemed super happy as well : )

Tap water where I currently live tastes like metal. It also turns the tub and toilet reddish brown. Filtering helps but it does taste different to bottled. The best water I've had though was from a tap in Scotland.
Just made my first political donation ever. $35. isn't much, but it'll help. I'm sure I'll make another for him down the road. So goddamn tired of billionaires having all the sway.  
I've had panama red awhile back. I actually was trying to buy wholesale from them for months, and they never replied to my emails, and then finally said they were going under. Here are my thoughts: * I do think they used white vinegar.  * Scotch bonnets and habaneros would both work, but scotch bonnets would actually be closer I think. * You are correct, I think they use ground yellow mustard seed, not prepared mustard. I'd suggest using a lot.Also, two sauces you might consider as replacements are Howler Monkey Red (nearly the same ingredients), and Lotties, which is a Barbados Style mustardy hot sauce (which I actually prefer over panama red, but thats just me).Good luck!
I think he meant people make under 30k a year(USD). I agree with his main point. Go to college, major in something employable and spend less than you earn. Everyone(Mentally handicapped aside) in the USA can go to college. If you wernt lucky enough to get a scholarship, than working during the day and taking classes at night to pay for school. Or take out student loans (which the ONLY requirements to get is be a citizen and be a student) if your confident enough that you will be able to pay  them back in a normal time period. Also the average yearly salary for the bottom 10% is 12,154(Source: NY times), you would make more working full time at McDonald's. It does seem like a choice to be in the bottom 10%. Maybe a choice they are not aware they are making, but a choice none the less. Also if you wanted to convince woody of something John Oliver is not the way. He thinks he just talks about problems and offers no solution. 
Start at zero and work your way up vs start out high and slowly slide down.  However you forget that women can also create their own worth like a man can.  No it doesn't work out to sexual attractiveness as well, but women can create worth in their lives.  I'd say the true disadvantage is the developmental loss that comes from starting out on an easy level.  Men run the gauntlet and are told from day one that they will only be worth what they achieve.  But women don't start getting this message until later in life when there's less chance to grow in that crucible of doubt.

I planned on running stock until I learned notifications were broken and there's no support for LED notifications. You gotta pick up your phone to check for notifications because most of the time it either won't notify you or the notification sound is so low you can't hear it. I flashed Chroma and its just like being stock except notifications work like they're supposed to and you have total control over the LED. Not to mention you can also see the battery percentage without having to install another app. Not sure why these basic functions were taken away but they were. Chroma adds everything back so Im sticking with it. 
It's not that easy for non white people. I'll link here soon but there is a study they sent out 4 ( exactly the same )applications 2 with obviously white male and female names and 2 with obviously black male and female names. The white names got 400% more call backs.Please do not act like they can just overcome this vast adversity. Also they are imprisoned more often, given harsher sentences for the same crime. There schools aren't up to par. They don't have the helping hands from parents that whites do, partly to do with the high incarceration rates.http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324432004578304463789858002http://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minoritieshttp://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/06/05/when-to-punish-a-young-offender-and-when-to-rehabilitate/the-race-factor-in-trying-juveniles-as-adultshttp://www.npr.org/blogs/codeswitch/2014/03/21/292456211/black-preschoolers-far-more-likely-to-be-suspended

Well there are obvious risks associated that hes bringing up.ESL can simply "starve" leagues out of competition. This isn't a problem for right now, its more money for teams currently.The issue is down the road. They've raised the gap by raising themselves up so high that all their competition has either relegated to lower-skill teams or folded altogether. Then ESL, with what is nearly a monopoly, implement policies and other things that generate a lot more revenue for ESL that would be practices otherwise avoided. Like hypothetically, what if you had to buy a season pass to watch CSGO, instead of freely on twitch? A monopoly could actually make that happen really quick.He brings up a completely valid point.

good luck paying for 500 mods that cost 5$ each, some of them just a few lines of script or a couple of days modelling,  and thats per game,  and the publisher is getting nearly 50% of that money for doing absolutely nothing ( it even decentivises them to finish their games ) 
Greece. The workers have democratic control over who they vote for to lead them, they vote for a leader, and that leader is in control of the industries they work for. You can't possibly suggest that socialism is when all of the workers democratically vote for every decisions ever made by every industry. That is completely implausible. They also vote for their Union leaders, their government at all levels, etc. Greece is a perfect representation of socialism. And it's a complete failure. A welfare-state is just synonymous with socialism, it's the entire point of socialism; Everyone is treated the same under socialism, regardless of their skill level, work ability, health, etc.
I'm not sure how you haven't figured this out but yes you can fully mirror your iOS devices image to the TV with Apple TV (some apps like HBO go do but support this but there's and app on Apple TV for that). You can mirror an exact display of your Mac (2011 or later) as well and even use it as a second display with you mac running 10.9 or later.
Edit: Nothing bad was said, but what he did was. Once told by a person that worked at a school for kids with special needs. Substitute teacher was caught holding a severely autistic student against the lockers by his throat. This was after the student was having a negative behavior and the substitute tried to roughly pull him off the floor. The sub? Slap on the wrist. Why? Former district aministrator. Parents? Had their wishes granted because the district wanted to avoid being sued.
The mod will get the same amount of battery life (plus minus a couple percent to account for board efficiency at different input voltages) with the cells in parallel or series. Remember that while the mAh stays the same, the Wh (total power) we draw from the cells is doubled when they're in series (due to the voltage doubling).
Final Fantasy IV, the PSP version. I'm kinda stuck though, I think I might be under-levelled or something. And it's weird, Final Fantasy IV for the GBA is one of my childhood games. I beat it multiple times back in the day, yet here I am struggling to get through Sylph Cave despite the fact my team's at about level 42 average. I've just been grinding like a crazy person recently. But those fucking Malboros will be the death of me....And on console, I've been playing Earthbound. That's a pretty cool game. I just haven't touched it in about a week, which is a bad habit of mine: put a book/video game/TV show down then never touch it again forever. It's a great game, but I guess it's my ADD in effect.After I beat Earthbound, I'm probably gonna start the Persona series for the first time ever, so I'm hoping that'll be good (I'm starting with Persona 3 FES).

is it a vanilla installation, or are you using dsfix? try disabling it if you have it, to see if the issue depends on some dsfix settings; I don't know what you've set in the setting panel for your graphics card but I've never seen this issue, whether the gpu settings were modified or not?
What would I do in that situation? Follow the drop caller and win the match. It may be dishonourable but it does not breach ToS and is a valid tactic. Of course the enemy team is free to call you dezgra.Any kind of sabotage would be a worse act and potentially breach ToS.Personally, I would only use this tactic if I thought there was no other way of winning. I always prefer to go for 48 kills.
It only takes one girl to do that to have a lasting impact on a guy. Guys tend to take life lessons to heart, especially with emotions and feeling vulnerable. 
Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from the Old Testament. It happens in the New Testament too. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman. THIS FLOWCHART IS A STRAW MAN.
It's so subtle but it really changed peoples view.  Gore had made it a signature move almost to try and throw people off their talking points.  A single light hearted nod completely shut him down, and made people think less of him.GWB's campaign team were very good.  They managed to make Al Gore seem unfit for office despite having been a solid VP for years, and John Kerry seem like he didn't care about serviceman despite the fact he *actually served in Vietnam*.
Everything you have said is extremely accurate, they only thing I could add about these two bikes is the madone is being reworked and 2.5 is essentially a 2014 as the frame is identical to last years. I would absolutely pick the Emonda over the madone for that reason. Last fun fact Emonda Madone and Domane are all anagrams of each other.
Their story line in the book is what caused me too stop reading. It wasn't poorly written or anything but I just couldn't get engaged.   I mean there is this huge world, dozens of established characters, story lines and families, but let's introduce another one, with a new group of people that you have zero attachment to, and follow their religious and political battles for a woke
The line art looks good form what I can tell.As far as the painting portion, I'd focus on your values a bit more. (Separating the darks from the lights) Right now, his eye is kind of getting lost in the dark spot on his fur.You're also using a very soft brush, which is making the fur look out of focus. I'd start working with a harder brush.
I'm glad you're not getting hate for this. People need to understand that saying that you're less impaired driving high than drunk doesn't mean you're promoting driving high, its just pretty much a fact at this point
I don't know because they were scaled by level and you are supposed to be a lower level for owb plus i thought it was better playing owb first because you have no clue who christine or elijah are and you can read elijah's journal. It was far more interesting to me especially after finding the communist camp where elijah was.  Plus by the way just finished dead money on hardcore mode 2 days ago and already beat hearts and owb.. Hardcore mode is so much better
People have a love/hate relationship with Chuck. While Shaq seems like a cool guy in general, when he commentates he gets worked up when they take shots at him.
My god. Am I the only one whose sick of these fucking goggles? I remember back in high school they had us put on "drunk goggles". Pretty much everyone just fucking goofed off with them. It was nowhere near being close to drunk, and theres noway on earth there going to show you what the world looks like while your high, because state of mind is a massive part of that. Sorry for the rant, but it just pisses me off to no end for some reason.
If you want good US banter, the closest I've found to a US Top Gear at UK Top Gear ~~quality~~ fun is old episodes of [Roadkill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EkWEjTBZ9Y).By "old," I mean episodes before they got bought by Dodge. Hopefully being "powered by Dodge" doesn't make the show suck, but I can only recommend pre-Dodge episodes.

So is this *just* the Sharks' bracket? That's pretty damn impressive, all things considering there were only 281 groups/people ahead of us and all that means is they predicted numGames differently.I honestly think the odds are good we ace round too, as well. TBL/MTL is the only iffy matchup in my eyes though upsets are always possible.

No they are not introduced to just "sex" early - they're introduced to unhealthy and outright malignant images, attitudes, and portrayals of sex within the toxic society. If children are introduced to healthy concepts of sex younger, and aren't shamed for playing house or doctor with their friends, they should learn to develop their own healthy sexual identities and would be able to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy sex much earlier in life.

Democrats voting against Hillary for a third party in the presidential election  is the reason republicans control the congress?  Explain that logic please. When President Obama was elected he had 59 democrats or independents that caucus with democrats  in congress. There are now 46, what does this have to do with third party presidential politics?  The irony is without third party politics there would be no Hillary at all. She would be as relevant as Eleanor Mondale.  Bill Clinton became president because of the very strong third party candidate taking 19% of the vote in 1992, the great majority from Bush 41.Vote count was Clinton 44.9 million Bush 39.1 million Perot 19.7 million. Never mind Hillary without a third party we would have never even had a Bill Clinton Presidency.

smoke weed everyday 🎶haha seriously, it's medicinal.  helps with the pain and lets me relax.  my emotions get really crazy too, so what I do is take a couple of nights to myself, get all the yummy treats I want, smoke a bowl and watch some of my favorite movies.  some of the movies need to be sad/dramatic ones so I can cry and rage and direct all of my pent-up emotions towards those scenes.I feel **so** much better after that.
Planned parenthood also offers contraceptives but you immediately conclude from the image that the "girls night out" (implying casual sex, presumably) results in an unwanted pregnancy. You're making my point for me.Clearly the people laughing at the Chinese restaurant next to the cat clinic find racial stereotypes funny. I hope I don't need to explain that one to you.
The fact that this article tries to highlight this woman's  affiliation to Satanism and then connect it with abortion is to me a petty clear example of an agenda against abortion. Double speak... Anti abortionists are the loud minority and this kind of nonsense does not help.
I keep all my ships at one station.   When I buy one that's not there,  I just buy a cheap sidewinder to get to the buying station,  sell it and buy my new ship.   The loss on a sidewinder is hardly notable.

Could we say "human directed" or something? "Non-natural" is such a strong claim, and requires distinguishing between natural and unnatural causes which is always a bear.
Gamestop did do preorders for wave 4, they were in store only on April 2nd. According to them, they sold out of all of their wave 4 stock during that event, so it's unlikely any more will be put up.
I think they couldn't have a funeral.  The decision to let Dempsey out of his contract happened somewhat abruptly, not leaving time to coordinate all the necessary actors to make a believable satifying funeral.  Shonda was stuck in this regard.  Can't please the fans by skipping the funeral.  Can't please them by giving him a funeral without Cristina, Addison, Taye Diggs, Derek's mom, all four sisters, and Thatcher.

I asked them to be quiet because people were trying to sleep, and, of course, they shout back things like "come make us fa****." So I looked at the scenario, 5 guys vs me, and I didn't let my pride get in the way of things. Went back into my house and they were gone in 5 minutes or less. I think if it hadn't been for the situational awareness and humbling of bjj, i would have done something monumentally stupid. 
You wouldn't let your child participate in a practice that teaches proper tackling form? Just because they have some kinesiology based scientists there taking readings doesn't mean this is any different than normal practice. We did helmetless practices all the time back in peewee and high school football. With all due respect you don't know what you're talking about and I'm not sure if you read the article. Trolling or not you're misguided 
I like using my Baymax most. I try to get it activated as often as possible so I don't bother to wait for fever. It blows up random objects on screen, so I wait until I have at least two bubbles before activating - it targets bubbles with its skills and they give more points that blown up Tsums do 8)
Obvously it's not mathematically, but realistically picking up and becoming a &gt;100k a year player is literally less than 99.99% of this sub, who at least know something about poker. It's just not the avenue to success it used to be. 
What they did is they made Level 2 Cache Shared between 2 cores, you have 8 fully funcional, 100% cores where 4 eat off of the other 4's cache, which kinda slows memory performance on die, but isn't too too bad. There are 8 fully loaded cores, capable of each handling their own thread (unlike hyperthreaded cores), but, the thread takes longer to render. Around 1.5 Intel cycles = 2- 2.3 AMD cycles depending on generation.
/u/20150501 is /u/20141220 you fuckin noob. You hardly know anything about this subreddit and you're making all kinds of claims without knowing shit about either users. It has been proven without a doubt that /u/20150501 is /u/20141220. A dozen other people have already asked him questions that he correctly answered.
Looking at the original Modern Masters, on Channelfireball, there are 5 cards that cost more than $50 (non-foil): Goyf, Sword of Fire and Ice, Vendillion Clique, Cryptic Command, and Dark Confidant. These are the ones that would trigger people to drop, I think.Of those 5, Sword is a disgusting bomb, Clique and Cryptic are very good, Goyf is fine and Bob is unplayable.Is that distribution better than the distribution of the rest of the rares? There's a bunch of Blood Moons, Glimmervoids, and Chalices in there to chill with Bob in the unplayable section (I counted 13 cards that I thought were clearly worse, just about 1 in 5) and a bunch of others are playable but still worse than a Goyf. So I think I rather add those five rares to my pool of potential opens than take them away, so even if I had to return the cards after the GP I'd still choose a preregistered pool.
https://gyazo.com/c17ce20cf65c585f78af2b889ef8edb9This is my current team. When i am able to get my 3rd 7* I want to know if i should just replace MAxwell with Kira or should I replace Rosetta with Colt/Kurt 7*? Whats the benefit of either choice?
```$app-&gt;bind('Foo', function() {     return new Foo(new BarImpl('foo'), new BarImpl('bar'));});```I should note there are probably 3-4 ways to accomplish any of these "levels" you have presented me with. I'm just offering a pretty simple one for each.I'm not doing anymore levels. Laravel is love, Laravel is life.
Weird, I have had no bugs. You made a Square-Enix account? When you open the app, you have to press デイリーポイントGET.If you press アイテム交換 on the bottom bar, it should tell you how many points you have.
To summarize their thoughts on "Allies of Al-Qaida in Syria":  Any group fighting with any national pride is to be foughtThis includes : "Islamic groups" fighting for an "islamic emirate""Islamic groups with secular/nationalist allies""secular groups allied with islamic"and "secular fighting for secular"  ..Basically everyone but them. (Also: Kinda hypocritical seeing as they wish to be a state and have "wilayats" that have names). If I missed anything dumbing it down go ahead and let me know. Still feeling disgusted after reading that, internet points for trying.
haha , guess how my hlr died while doing demon wall,  so SMN dies instantly to puddles on the floor, drg get repelled off the side, then hlr is standing at the back hard raising the smn , then gets repelled hits the back then off the side.
Aw, did we miss your whisky porn post?[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Whiskyporn/comments/34803w/i_am_officially_out_of_room/) to the thread for posterity.  
The problem with that diagnosis, as I see it, is that Borderline personality disorder can cause problems with personal identity. If they also had Narcissistic personality disorder, they would be obsessed with the person they don't even know that they are. 
So happy Calista is a power. I wonder, Wolfe gave his powers to her, as she could absorb them like he could, so does that mean Christian can get his powers out of her now?
The optimal place is always to take off from the Mun when it is closest to Kerbin, and burn as much as fast as you can until your periapsis at Kerbin really slows down.  Then wait until you are at apoapsis around Kerbin, and burn there to drop your final periapsis to ~30-35 km in Kerbin's atmosphere.This method takes advantage of the Oberth effect, for maximum efficiency.  Also, make sure you orbit counter-clockwise (west -&gt; east).
It's often said that Miles was a better bandleader than soloist. But he was still a great soloist who created a new sound and took the trumpet in a completely different direction, away from the prevailing clean sound of Armstrong/Eldridge/Gillespie. Personally, I think Coltrane &amp; Pete Cosey were perhaps the only two soloists who overshadowed Miles. 
I suppose I should have expanded. My discomfort comes from the moral dimension. I don't feel comfortable playing the part of an army that was involved in such atrocities as the Wehrmacht was. I like playing allies partly because the USF fit my play style well, but also because it makes me feel like I'm on the right side. If that makes sense?I also started playing allies as I heard it was more of a challenge, but that's rather evened out now.

Floresta de Tijuca is the largest urban jungle/rainforest/forest in the world. And the crazy thing is that it's man made. It used to be a coffee plantation and then 100 years ago it was replanted as a forest. 
Its like... your speaking.. LOGIC.This was a system that had a small chance IF done right and was giving 100% honesty. The chance was blown and maybe wont ever have that chance again after the backlash. Some warranted some Not. 
I can't tell if you're trolling or not, so I'm going to assume you're being serious.In science, the word "theory" means something very specific. It doesn't mean the same thing as "educated guess".A scientific theory is a fallible hypothetical model that has been thoroughly tested and has yet to be disproved, wherein fallible means it is something that *can* be tested, and model means a set of reproducible patterns by which we understand a certain phenomenon and which can be used to make predictions about similar phenomenon.God and the mythology surrounding Him is a hypothesis only, and it is an infallible hypothesis, meaning it cannot be tested against evidence. One can make a claim that He exists, for example, and never have the possibility of being proven wrong or right about it.I could go on if you wish. But maybe you have more specific questions now?
Saying episode III is better than VI is not a stretch at all. At least with III Lucas knew how to end it, where as in VI they just throw a big blanket over everything, tell the audience to close their eyes and be in awe at the happy teddy bear celebration music at the end. Other than that, yes, IV and V are amazing, and I and II are horrible.
Problem is, you can't compare ice with whatever Pica's golem is made of. I personally think that One Piece NEEDS another timeskip. What's the sense of 19 year old becoming strongest being on the planet and king of the pirates?
ItI'm watching less content myself. But my point is that it's impossible to talk about how the company is going to die at their current rate without knowing what kind of financial shape the company is in overall. It's not like we're getting hints of them being in trouble like massive layoffs. In fact we're getting hints that point in the opposite direction, last week Burnie was talking about how the employee count is going to get up to (I believe) around 120 because of projects they'll be working on later this year. That doesn't exactly sound like a company that's freaking out.
look likes it's probably at fair value now,but probably investors will buy here at the dip so momentum up will create more resistance to down trendsneed to check competition , moat, honest management... ?i would probably won't buy it
that's almost impossible unless you are wealthy..... they give everyone money.... there are also private student loans you can do. I didn't qualify as an unemployed student but my parents were able to take out loans for school on my behalf. I came from a no-money family and my parents didn't send me. went to a small private college... I got loans all the way through.  I don't accept your excuses.... get to school. if it's graduate there is NP excuse... they give out graduate loans like we can pay them back one day!
I'm actually pretty amazed that after a cold boot, I can get into Skyrim or Dishonored in about 7 seconds, from clicking "play" to interacting with the character in a loaded level. And that's loading it off spinning disk. I can't imagine how they can load skyrim faster than my chromebook boots.
Fuckin Yomi. I have a max skilled U&amp;Y and can't get my hands on a Yomi. A full size Sun Quan would be great too, I have a mini and he does the job but the awakenings on the real deal are just too good. 
Can't get used to the new ward mechanic so far (them only coming in packs of 1). I buy one pack and only notice I've got just 1 ward when the courier arrives. 
Idk, I only read New 52 so I can guarantee you that Batman couldn't get hit by a random thug unless he was surrounded at all sides, and even then it's doubtful.
Have you looked into learning GML? It's actually pretty easy to pick up on. There are tons of tutorials from folks like Tom Francis on YouTube and others that will help you out tremendously. D&amp;D can only take you so far until you need to know some code. Plus it's so much more customize-able.
Unfortunately, the moment you mention CCTV/public surveillance you get the knee-jerk suggestion that this will turn us into a police state/Big Brother system. Maybe if people stopped being such asses to one another, we wouldn't have to set up cameras. 
"I don't think that's true, Mr. Huckabee. The laws and freedoms of this country made you governor of Arkansas, even though God clearly made you an idiot."
No. Bashed patches only merge the levelled lists etc that are already there. The dragonborn items arent actually set up to appear in Skyrim at all, they have to be added with a mod. It also adds some other things like Brand Shei will sell dragonborn stuff, and there being an actual useable shrine at the shrine of azura etc
There is nothing malicious behind what I am saying.  When I deal with people and real life stuff I keep to myself as well, but when discussing a comic book movie?  Thats just being super uptight in my opinion, but to each their own.  I will pay to watch this movie in theatres thus supporting its production I think i'm allowed to critique it.  Comic book heroes have IMPROVED this last decade because of fan backlash over the garbage we used to get.  i.e. No way we get a rated R Deadpool movie if it weren't for fans shitting on The Wolverine's Deadpool. 
But in Europe people don't care about nudity so there is no need for shower curtains. I have been to countless shower rooms in many european countries and most of them look like this: http://jurahaus.ch/tl_files/jurahaus/gallery/haus_annexe/Duschraum%20Damen.jpg 
Where do you live? Is it hot or cold? Really shouldn't be an issue, however depending on the temp difference from car to when you bring it into the house, i would not turn it on for an hour or so to ensure any condensation has evaporated. I believe there is a min and max temp for many parts though, but as long as we're not talking Arizona desert or the Arctic it should be ok. 
I heard a teacher ask a student why they ran away from home.   The phrasing was "I understand that you ran away recently and that is why you were absent so long.  What is so bad at your home that you had to leave?  Your life can't be THAT bad." Turns out kids older adopted brother molested him for years and his step-father abused him.  The whole family was a mess.  Seeing them at teacher conference was always a... treat.   The kid attempted suicide a few weeks later.  He had it pretty rough already.    
I feel like we could pretty easily feed/cloth/house/vaccinate every human on this little rock... if only we would put the right resources into the right places instead of everyone squabbling over 2000 year old arguments and an ever-shortening supply of limited resources (of which we could easily become independent of, if, again, we applied our resources properly).
Levi jeans are way too short for me. Especially the bootcut, I suppose because the curviness of my thighs takes up all the fabric. I buy 37" jeans from Buckle or Alloy (highly prefer buckle) and tailor the waist myself. It's the only way. 
Please note that /u/7693385781711 is referring to a moral right to know your grades, not a legal right.  The University will not release your grades to anyone unless you grant them permission to.In any case, I agree with the sentiment here - I don't think you are ready for university.  Your actions have consequences and it is unfortunate that you are only recognizing this now after it is too late.  People can help you, but no one will hold your hand.  If the situation is as dire as you describe, you'll probably be forced to leave UBC.  I would perhaps suggest taking a year or so off to work a minimum wage part time job to motivate yourself a bit - because that's where you'll likely end up for the rest of your life if you continue on this path.
I was completely kidding, why u have to hate lounge as I love it better than reddit, lounge can have a ridiculous price but that's cause the player base on there is 100x bigger than reddit. I get more offers on lounge than here, but with that being said I have a lot of love for this subreddit. This subreddit had some used better than lounge as good deals usually go to the hot page where they are more likely to see.
25% is not awful though, you're really overreacting. I made about 5% on the dota 2 items I worked on and made a killing off them. A good mod project that deserves to be bought would make the developer a lot of money even at 25%Also the money Bethesda made pays for the work they did on 1.0 release, but they've continued to support the game long after. They don't deserve at least 30% of mod money? 
I think all of these outfits are cute. I don't mind the visible socks with the sneakers, though I guess it's more ideal to have the clean lines of no socks/no-show socks (I have never worn no-show socks so I don't really know how practical they are...I tend to just not wear socks if I don't want them to show but I think I'm in a minority there).I think the black boots look great with the jeans rolled up, and, in the outfits with the coats, I prefer the boots to the sneakers.I love that jumpsuit with the white t shirt underneath.
I know, none taken at all! And sorry if I gave you the 101, I just read some other comments and somehow assumed that you were new to them as well. My bad.
No.  If she doesn't want to she should just come out and say directly.Open and honest communication are the foundation of any relationship that's going to last and be mutually satisfying.
Oh God, this was my first thought too !My dad was dealing before I was born and he would sometimes disappear for days, and my mom would have to shoo off the people knocking at their door when he wasn't there. And they kept coming back basically every 2-3 hours until he got back. Must've been terrible.
I had a dope dream last night. Usually i wake up tired and grumpyBut I got some bags from my buddy in the dream and did not do them yet and was instantly elated and was abruptly awoken and that elation carried over into my morning even though I didn't actually cop. That rise in dopamine must be real. So dope dreams don't have to be all bad. Previous they all were but this one was different. Maybe because I woke before getting to use. I think that must be why telling myself that I'm going to cop tomorrow or its on the way and other mental tricks seem to work sometimes. Weed is amazing because it helps just say fuck it about emotional stress.
Doesn't take 2 weeks to drink all of it. Damn i love me some fresh squeezed oj. I mean freesh freesh. edit: Like before you even cut it open, before its even a tree.. That freeesh. 
Imagine if you could just put in a cd or download something from the devs and then just play it with no drm or service that needs to update ever, and doesn't have people that can make retarded decisions like making something that used to be free, paid.Nah, it'd never work.
Went to a conference (I think, could have been just traveling for work)...Got to the hotel and took a shower, got dried and for some reason just lay on the bed naked (not something I usually do)...All of a sudden door opens and guy starts coming in, he hears/sees me trying to cover up and walks out again...I get on the phone to the front desk and say what the fuck...The front desk had given him same room and identical keys. I got two free nights in the hotel.
No, it's not that.I have co-ords to the planet but I wouldn't know where it was underground, since it was a while ago and on a different version. Oh well, thanks anyway :D
IDK man when I was choked out in BJJ it would have been conforting to awake to an african dude giving me the equivalent of an over aggressive high school handjob 
Next year is my last year. I've always been passionate about fitness and biology, so it was naturally for me to go into dietetics. -So far, I've learned little about nutrition that I didn't already know-Biochem is the hardest course of the program IMO-I spend alot of time worrying about matching to a DI-Being a guy, I feel like I can't be myself without doing something offensive to females-Being black, I feel like I stick out too much, instructors personally email me when I miss class-While nutrition was always something I was interested and involved with, If the Army didn't pay for my tuition, I'm positive that I wouldn't have chose this as a career field.I wasn't from the wealthiest family, so the average salary is still desirable to me.. But the DI you're required to complete is whats contributing to my uncertainty 
He didn't say he's experiencing it for the first time, he simply said that was his experience when he first played.  He could have played it back in 2008 for all we know.  It's a shit post, trading nostalgia for karma.

It's in his wikipedia page:'Cooper had very slowly become desensitized to the violence he was witnessing around him; the horrors of the Rwandan Genocide became trivial: "I would see a dozen bodies and think, you know, it's a dozen, it's not so bad." One particular incident, however, snapped him out of it:On the side of the road [Cooper] came across five bodies that had been in the sun for several days. The skin of a woman's hand was peeling off like a glove. Revealing macabre fascination, Cooper whipped out his disposable camera and took a closeup photograph for his personal album. As he did, someone took a photo of him. Later that person showed Cooper the photo, saying, "You need to take a look at what you were doing." "And that's when I realized I've got to stop, [...] I've got to report on some state fairs or a beauty pageant or something, to just, like, remind myself of some perspective."'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper
After partially filling out the form on the website, I started to get bad juju's. Rightly so. After looking in to it, apparently Lending Tree fancies selling your information to companies that perform unauthorized credit checks. I'm hoping that I had yet to fill out enough information to make this possible. Thanks for the advice, but no thanks.
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BKk2FFMqJFP8Ylz1HDnNx_O_dP_qlyuAg6yOsfTbPhU/edit?usp=sharing), the stats I gained from the previous event listed were suggested by nobreop, I asked him at the time because he's the tech mod.
I haven't watched streams; frankly I don't want to because I want to play the game completely fresh like I'm playing Xenoblade right now. I knew zero about the game coming in and the experience has blown me away so farRegardless; even if it's not running 60fps, but it's running a solid consistent &gt;30, that's amazing. Nice to know me seeing a few super silky Gifs is real gameplay!So pumped for the NA release!
Tangential question, because I always enjoy leaning more about professions: as a hiring manager (or what have you) how is it that one would have the necessary skills to recognize talent, professionalism, and quality in fields that diverse? You did you it's changed over your career, but I can't imagine you have a background in all those fields. I'm not saying that is necessary to make the right call (obviously it isn't), I just know as a layperson, I'd feel out of my depth trying to hire someone for a field I've never worked in, or wasn't educated for.

It's actually better for you to drink room temperature water as ice water actually slows down your digestive system. I started drinking room temp water when I started vandwelling and now I can't start ice in my drinks unless it's tea or a soda.
He is obviously using the term ironically. See **"**these**"**?Also, since this is /r/dataisbeautiful, can people please not fuck with the scale of a % axis to make difference seem smaller/larger than they are? A % axis should always be 100%.
Lou said he'd trade his pick as well. Say we package Phil to the Devils for their first rounder and more, and then move up one to 5th.We could have 2 of Strome/Marner/Hanifin. Nice.
Except the last 2 sentences are meaningless because even your Jesus didn't say it.  The reason it was put in there was purely to convert pagans, nothing more. Anyone looking at in objectively can see that. That is why people at times refer to it as Paulianity sometimes, because he made up crap, said it was the holy spirit, then wham, no more following the old laws.Also even when Leviticus calls things abomination, it doesn't mean what you think it does. It context of Leviticus abomination= against tradition. Additional, Leviticus was to show why Jews are different from the gentiles and many of the laws were to create that separation. Cultures in the area, religious rituals included priests and what would be considered homosexual acts, hence why it was in there. Put on top of that, Jews were in exile when the OT came about and wanted to ensure their numbers would grow. 
Bro, when the whole paper is in size 12 Times New Roman, make your periods, commas, apostrophes, question marks, exclamation marks, *every piece of punctuation,* size 14. It'll add more artificial length than you think.

Well funny thing is that Australia started their journey into the fibre world with the last government who were going to roll out FTTP to 93% of the population (rest would be satellite). Then, the new government has come in and tossed all that out the window and going with a "mixed" technology mix where its a lucky dip of HFC, FTTN, Wireless and FTTP. We had our chance and blew it!
Exactly!  Just remember this isn't new. The Detlev Bronk thing started around 10 to 15 years ago. He used to start screaming "Don't fucking bring that name up on the show" every time Howard brought it up. I think he found this guy on Wikipedia and that where the bit started. No way he could keep a Wikipedia page going for this many years. 
You could plan for ten minutes of alone time with your spouse. You'll want that anyways on the day of even if it seems unnecessary during planning. Go makeout behind a tree then bring it on back.
First things first how could you forget about [pole guy?](https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xaf1/t31.0-8/c0.0.851.315/p851x315/135125_469626799727359_909392863_o.jpg).Moving on, it is very possible that like you said most men and women (I doubt Suki and her group are the only Kyoshi warriors that were trained in the 100 years of the war) just up and left in order to fight for the earth kingdom, but i doubt that they just got upset with the war and decided against it, but rather they lost contact with the Earth Kingdom (i really think that the EK communication system was a mess seeing, that the highest general´s weren´t even updated on the situation, while there is a random town that sends people to the war front to be led by who?).After not hearing anything they decided that the safest course of action would be to claim neutrality in case the Fire Nation had conquered the Earth Kingdom. At least that´s my theory.
I dont find oliver that funny as his humor is more about yelling at the camera about a small tangent. I agree that Colbert is funny as hes witty. I could write oliver jokes as the connections he make are obvious (in terms of things to yell about)

I'm not convinced it would be a valuable experience because it might noy be something I could share with humanity. And if whatever I discovered would benefit only me, I don't know that is a desirable goal. . I would prefer all humanity benefits from the experience of the journey. How would humanity be enlarged by waving goodbye to travellers they would never hear from again?
Yeah, I don't like how this article reifies the model minority myth. It presents Asian-Americans as this monolithic group that is super-successful, which is just untrue.I kinda understand the sentiment behind the article, but since it buys into the very problematic premises of the model minority myth (all Asians are the same, all Asians do well, there are no problems in the Asian-American community, Asians don't face racism because they're so successful, etc.), I can't say I support this strategy.
I don't  think it is,rng is just being rng with me. I have full sets of nats and mara and found tons of other rare things  but not a simple plan. Last season it fell really  quick  for me. I honestly havent found many recipies this season as it is.
I have that inkling too, but I'm sure the media will portray her as a juggernaut as she goes on to steal the farce piece of theatre that is the primaries.
hello reginaldtato- this was a stock div that went ex on april 27th which means the price at close of business april 24th was adjusted by the stock div 565.06-(0.0027455*565.06) so on the the 27th it opened at 563.50862777 +/- any after hour trading. You probably didn't notice this but your shares were trading ex div until today, the pay date, where you received the stock which your broker then sold because (im guessing) it was a fractional share.
This is not the idea, for sure. It's ridiculous. How are consumers supposed to install this chip into their electronics? How can that ever compete with mining operations in Iceland?
Yeah, so you stay alive because of wk's aghs, and I guess when you die it improperly says it was reincarnation that damaged you since there is no other icon to fit 
WPF here after all these years. It's a dual-display media playback kiosk application. WPF video playback isn't ultra reliable, so the video player is a WinForms application hosting AxWindowsMediaPlayer. The two executables are separate processes and communicate with each other over NetMQ.

It costs them absolutely nothing to spit out bullshit and on the off chance it happens they can be all "SEE DELUSIONAL BLAZER FANS LOLZ" instead of actually understanding the situation.                However, there is most definitely a chance he will leave and its higher than a lot of blazer fans seem to think imo.
MLS is a very top heavy league (in terms of earnings). The disparity between average wage and the wage of the average player will be much larger in MLS.
Interesting, thank you! I've recently been introduced to liquid lipsticks and will probably purchase another in the future.  I went to Sephora thinking I'd get the Kat Von D ones since everyone seems to rave about them but none of the colors seemed remotely okay on me.  I wanted something to wear to my wedding, but I'm not sure I'd be interested in any of those colors even otherwise.I ended up going with the MUFE Aqua Rouge ones and they are drying but I've been really impressed by their lasting power.  I'm interested to try out the Hourglass ones now though.
Everything you do is rape.  Rape for breakfast.  Rape for lunch.  Driving to work is rape because the car never consented to you penetrating it with your body.  You should probably stop all the raping.
LEO's need to be held to a higher standard when they act criminally. In my area, we recently had a couple jail employees arrested for having sex with an inmate, among other things. The first gal was sentenced to 50 months prison and the second hasn't been sentenced yet. I'll attach the story....but, point being - when you are in a position of trust and you break that trust, the penalty needs to be harsher than it would be for the average person. http://www.kptv.com/story/28108918/washington-county-jail-employee-pleads-guilty-to-sexual-misconduct-with-an-inmate

&gt;I love how someone on the thread thinks a single bitcoin will be worth 5 million dollars. Fiat dollars are doomed. My math - using $0/BTC as a rate - gives $0 in value. Can someone point out if this is right? Perhaps dividing by $0 will give a better indication of value
First off, for much of those five acts he was already Bec Noir.Second, Jack is not a main character. He is behind a lot, but he doesn't really get that much screentime, and much less than Karkat does.I wouldn't call him a side character, but I wouldn't call him a main character either.
Give the writers some credit. They've made practically the entire cast (recurring and limited appearances) out of nothing. And the characters are so full of depth. I doubt they're going to be molding everyone into a pre-determined adaptation.
Ears between shoulders, you should look at your thumbs/wrist area. As you progress you will be able to look anywhere will still holding the handstand, heck you can even start a conversation.

I am all for making mobs more difficult, but only as in game difficulty increases. Instead of giving the mobs more health at higher levels, give them more advanced mechanics.

I would pass on both Mariota and Winston. If you can't even be bothered to show up for the draft why would anyone think they're going to show up on game day?
There was a fruit like this in the Ice Hunter filler arc I'm pretty sure (or was it called Lovely Land arc, I can't remember). There was a pretty neat fight but it seemed kinda bs how Luffy won.
She started Google's Associate Product Manager program, dumbfuck. Google Drive, Google Maps, these things came about as a result of that program.I'll bet you a kidney you couldn't even tell me who "the boss" of Google at the time was.
Skiing and scuba diving. Respectively one thing I stopped doing because I got too big and one thing I've never started because of my weight. I also want to dress more fashionably, this Admiral in the Old Navy is retiring, I want to be the Oligarch of the Banana Republic instead. Oh, and looking forward to some other small things like living longer, avoiding diabetes and heart disease and spending lots of fun, active time with my daughter and not being a sweaty unhealthy disappointment. On the shoe topic I was trending towards slip on shoes because bending down to tie laces was a chore. I'm not even 40, so that is sad, though I'm already feeling more fit, flexible, and am embracing my lacing like a champ.

Honestly I don't find the new black cleaver to be that good on AD carries at all. 3K gold for 40 AD is extremely inefficient. You will be setting your build back by a lot... BF sword gives more AD and is half the cost. So I doubt its good on the likes of lucian, graves, sivir, jinx, kog, vayne.Ad carries I would consider cleaver to be ok on: Corki, Ezreal, Ashe (pre rework), Kalista.Its good on Kalista because she can build Bork -&gt; Runaans -&gt; Cleaver, with you proc'ing the armor pen on runaans bolts, and you still do damage. Its good on Corki/Ezreal because missiles/q will apply cleaver. Ashe because low CD arrow.However, ADs depend on having IE, AS item, LW for damage, and 3K gold is too big to just use on 40 AD and CDR + phage utility.Also please please please don't go cdr boots on lucian, they were ok last season but now you really want to be playing him like an actual adc. You will do more damage with AS boots, and you shouldn't be using e off cooldown anyway
providing basic advice isn't always victim blaming. If he said "men, don't walk down Dodgy St after midnight because it's a common location for assults or roberies" there would be zero outrageIf he said "there was been a spate of home invasions of late, so make sure you lock you doors", there woulds be zero outrage.Providing basic advice on precautions to take to avoid dangerous situations is not victim blaming. It sucks that these precautions may need to be taken, but that doesn't mean it's outrageous to suggest them
It's Tribalism. Very deeply ingrained in human nature due to humans being organized as small tribes for millions of years. The "us versus them" mentality is not going away any time soon. 
As I see it, people love zombies because they can connect or relate with them more then other enemies. Zombies are created by man being greedy and ignorant, while most enemies are created by nature, magic, fantasy, etc.  Most enemies have many special abilities but zombies have very few, which people can relate to.  A zombie wants to kill and eat you, just like most enemies, but zombies also can infect you will their virus and turn you into one of them.  By killing a zombie not only are you happy that it died instead of you, you are happier it didn't turn you into a zombie.  To be killed by an enemy is a bad thing, even to have it lay eggs in you is bad too but having the enemy make you roam the earth until you die, killing any living thing along the way, even possibly your loved ones is the worst.  When you kill a zombie you are telling yourself that its a good thing, that you are helping to end the spread of the virus, even though you know in the back of your mind its hopeless.

I've tried the higher end setups. The headphones made far more of a difference than the source did. Tried several songs on both FLAC and Google Play Music's 320Kbps MP3 and was unable to hear the difference. You said yourself, that the difference is negligible, if not nonexistent. I'm not going to fill up my phone's storage of music and pay hundreds more than what Spotify costs me

Morally, almost everyone's life is priceless. Realistically, a person's life is only worth as much as what we believe they can give to society and their net worth.
No one  seems to be giving you hair parting options so if you feel like trying it you could go with a side part, but that's entirely up to you. I don't think you should wear makeup until/unless it's something you want to do. I don't understand this subreddit. I mean, people give a lot of gravity to what others think about them, and I can see how it would be tempting to ask, but not everyone finds the same things attractive. Different people find beauty in different things. I mean, I think big noses are attractive and a lot of people seem to think that a big nose is a bad thing. It really just depends and you'll never get a definitive answer from a group of people.

Sucks if your cash gets caught on a bulk buy though :/ Real deal I think the gov keeps hands off for the most part bc this shit is keeping USPS afloat!  Without DNM packs theyd lose a chunk of volume.  
I think that's a bit disingenuous. A Turkish German would describe themselves as Turkish if they were talking to a white German who could trace their ancestry back to a village in Hessen for the past three hundred years. But I've met Turks who have German citizenship outside of Germany and they have described themselves as Germans. Which they are. It's like when I am talking to another British person I say I am a Yorkshire folk. When I am talking to another European I describe myself as British and when I talk to someone from outside of Europe I describe myself as European. 
oh yeah my biggest qualm about ganking with him is that I actually have to walk up to the target and reserve Q for when the target starts to run away :(
I disagree, Steel and DaZed are a lot older and influenced Swags decisions. I think Swags personality is more susceptible to suggestion because of his age, and his older teammates knew that when they asked him to throw.

Does SHE want a larger diamond though? This is something you need to ask her. I was really clear with my now husband (then fiance) that I did NOT want a big ring. I know he thinks I am worth it, and I know he would have gotten me a bigger one if I had asked, but in my mind, I did not want the pressure of carrying $6K on my finger all the time. What if I dropped it? What if I got mugged? I would probably have only worn it for special occasions. Plus, I have tiny fingers (wear a 3.25 size ring) so a larger diamond would have not really been the look that I was going for. I got a cool custom ring with a 0.5 carat flawless diamond and am much happier about it. On the other hand, if she likes big diamonds, then you have to decide whether you want to go for it or not. Either way, get it appraised and insured!
As someone who didn't play much Wow, Rythian's explanations of the original bosses and the raids are fantastic. And I love seeing him nerd out over all the awesome little details. Although I'm a little sad he didn't get to see Nefarion's reaction to playing Deathwing.

I don't know the psychologist and I don't know the kid however we need to stop pretending (the system as a whole) that college should be for everyone and that you will come out of it better - there are many underrepresented higher education options, like trade schools which will allow you to become successful in a different type of environment.

I went onto your website and downloaded the bot again and now it is working perfectly. Do I have to re-download the bot every time there is an update? Now the only problem seems to be that xmod is not auto searching? What do you think?
The thing is, though, many people with gender dysphoria have brain structures corresponding to the gender they identify as.Also, as far as I have observed, the only "treatment" for gender dysphoria is transition. Every attempt I've ever seen to force someone with dysphoria to conform with the gender they were assigned ended poorly.
This atrocity is why when, in the corporate world, I hear people in management talking about "drinking the kool aid" in meetings - I interrupt them, bluntly tell them I had an uncle who died in Jonestown and I don't appreciate the kool aid comment as that's where it stems from.   It embarrasses them and they never know I'm telling a bold faced lie.

make sure you're holding the reinforcement material in your hand when you hit the chest. If one of the item disappears, you did it right.Also, if you use the Name Layer Set Default Group command (/nlsdg &lt;groupName&gt;) it sets that group as your default group. After that, you only have to type /ctr to reinforce and it'll automatically reinforce to that group every time until you change default group.

With the 2A I would try 1LL and 5xML with an xl300. This is still one of my favourite mechs/builds. Tips:When you are running from enemy's, turn your torso 90 degrees and look at the ground. This positions the huge dummy arm at the rear of your mech. Fire and relocate lots.Use the fast torso twist to roll as much damage to your arms.Oddly I've found playing with arm lock improves torso response. Enjoy!
I'm a college student studying to be a biologist here. We don't think we know everything. We form a hypothesis, test the experiment, and look to see if the data supported our hypothesis. We find out we were wrong all the time. That's why we run experiments. We don't assume we were correct, we go out to find evidence.

&gt;Being evil isn't the defining quality of being a monster.Being a monster or a monstrosity by definition refers to extremes though. I'd say a pure evil person is more of a monster than a human being that struggles with moral dilemmas in ever episode.

You can make spells that fortify Magicka while dealing damage - effectively casting for free. So yeah, destruction is pretty useful. Always annoyed me how slowly ranged spells move, though.
Yes.  But who needs a stage 4 item on their main that doesn't already have one?  If you are planning to get a stage 6 item next patch, it is *extremely* likely that you have already gotten your stage 4 item.  The only people that will still need the 1-4 upgrade items will be alts or possibly people switching mains, which is my whole point.Just because it is still *technically* necessary doesn't make it relevant or a good choice.  They have relegated the barn to providing the prior tier's materials.  Anyone bothering with current progression will have no use for it.

I was living with my best friend and her family who had owned a lodge (at this point though, there were no guests). I had just been broken up and was finding it really hard to get back on my feet. My best mate had a crush on one of the staff and she made this very known. In reality, he really liked me and we were always flirting in private and really helped me get over by breakup. One night drunk I ended up sleeping with him in front of the fireplace, in the living room of the lodge. Her little sister walked in and shit hit the fan after that. All I could think was that I was absolutely fucked. I got slapped by the mum and got a black eye in the end and my friend never forgave me, but she forgave him in an instant which still pisses me off. 
warshits are still on limited access beta, not everyone who wants to be playing has ability to play.3-8k is a huge spread, lets say 5.5k, so to reach warplanes level you will need to drop 5k players. you think that is going to happen overnight?
Coulson is alive, the HYDRA take over resulted in Coulson building his own SHIELD (which Nick Fury showed up and gave his blessing), and Skye is the Inhuman Quake.Oh, and the reason the Avengers start off the movie going to a HYDRA base is because Coulson suggested Maria Hill send them there.That's all you need to know.
They're not making the engine 29% more efficient, they're just making it more powerful and stating that it won't eat into the range, most probably because they assume most users won't be using the additional power so much that it will noticeably impact the range.

Your recent post: "I pay my bills, go to work, act responsible, and only play in the bath with one rubber ducky."Sounds like you're deep in the matrix to me.
But you understand he has anxiety right? Logically he shouldn't care what other shoppers think but it doesn't work like that.Edit: And it's surprising that he's being downvoted for expressing that fear. He opened up about his anxiety and is asking for help and he's being downvoted? This subreddit is weird sometimes.
He would be matched with players of the same level has him, if the player base would be bigger. So at some point (hopefully), that won't even be an issue.But if S2 can figure out a good Karma system, I think it would be really beneficial.
If either transaction was closed with a title company insuring the sale, you can make a claim to the title company for payment. You can tell if there was a title company involved because the deed should show the name of the escrow or title company used on the deed when it was recorded at the sale.
Aw, thank you! That was a really nice thing to say, and it cheered me up. (I have the flu for the first time ever and have been feeling sorry for myself all day):)
The frustrating part is when I tell my friends to jump with a Titan across and they reply "that's impossible". Tell them to tap the jump button twice without any delay and they don't understand. They do it wrong and blame the game while I'm sitting here thinking how I got myself in this mess.
Death is not the same as stopping you from progressing. It's why they made the Bible give you flight for a room so if you fly over and swap it out you aren't just trapped.
&gt;would you go as far as saying its immoral to accept money in a manner such as this?I'd say yes. This allows candidates to increase their budgets by changing their views to match those who have the capacity to donate more. It's marketing, not politics.But given today's system, I think it's necessary to flub on morality a bit to restore the system to proper working order. It may be the only way...
Not true. A lot of people do it for the stress relieving properties of the nicotine. Having a smoke after a long day at work was and is still a rather common thing.

I'm not sure if it's the somewhat tortured language and non-punctuation of your post, but from what I gather, just about none of it adds up to even being relevant in this post. Care to maybe rephrase much more carefully?
Well the difference was that you might have thought yourself superior in some topics, but you at least were intelligent enough to recognize that you would look like an idiot if you tried to push that narrative onto someone.Meaning that deep down you knew that you weren't really that great. You just felt other people had bad taste.The guy in the post lacks any social skills, and any actual intelligence. You can tell because he doesn't mention anything that would make him really seem smart. He just goes on and on about how he's above people. Anyone who has to go on and on about that is probably not where they want to be.
In Blender, go to file-&gt;user preferences-&gt;add-ons and check the 3D print toolbox.    On the right hand side, select the scene tab, which looks like the sphere and cylinder under a light, between the world tab and render layers tab. On this change units from 'none' to 'imperial'.    To add holes to the basic shape, the easiest way is to create the shape, then create a cylinder as a new object, and use the BOOLEAN function to subtract one from the other to give the holes.

Well, we had to write tables (you know, the ones people make in MS Excel, except it was in our notebooks) for Geography homework. And let me tell you, there was a lot of stuff we had to try to compress in there. Wasn't easy...And you know what I did? I just scanned and printed the pages from the book instead of making it.And the teacher actually approved of it! I love my printer, haha.

My guess is that they didn't like the ARTS system, which is understandable. It's more or less MMO combat.I heard that once Xenoblade X is out there's going to be an optional download of textures and other resources so that the game could load and run faster. GTA5 did the same thing, did it not? If the low FPS really makes that much of an impact on your enjoyment of the game, it might be a necessity.
I'm 21. I doubt things have changed that much in 3 years. When a student was a shit they got failed. No one complained. Parents asked why they failed you showed them the fact they did 0 work. Stop over exaggerating things. Shit's the same as it's always been, you just hear about the bad stuff more since everyone has a camera on them and there's websites made for this type of stuff.

The us is only 14-15 trillion in debt. What could possibly go wrong? That bubble is bursting someday, and when it does.....i will be first in line
I absolutely love Ghibli cover albums! There's a variety of them including Music Box cover albums, English cover albums, and of course the Jazz cover album that you showed us. Thanks for sharing!
in 8th or 9th grade this creepy situation unfolded. I was in my history class and the rest of the students in here are of the same age. The male history teacher pulls out his cellphone at some point, and this girl who sits near his desk says "ew thats a fat one." The teacher responds by saying "Thanks, so is the phone" *wink*
I'm at the aircrew schoolhouse on Lackland and the word from the TACP students right now is that ROMAD's are being phased out and most if not all TACP students that graduate from the Medina schoolhouse will qualify as a JTAC in-pipeline. The first Medina class started 3ish weeks ago, word is the instructors are basically making shit up as they go.
I actually posted this with that in mind. I was curious as to whether there was any overlap between what people find attractive now and what was found attractive back then.
I've asked else in this thread, but question: I get that I need to print at the correct temperature, should I purchase an accurate thermal gun to verify that the temperature is correct, or can I pretty much safely assume the temperature I set in Cura will be the temp. I get? 
Yeah, he makes a good product... and if he was making good games that he didn't want to, I'm a little stoked to see what he'll do with a new project he's passionate about. ... maybe he'll pick up The Last Guardian!
The purpose isn't to genuinely fool anyone as to what you're doing, it's to avoid being hassled by the cops or getting a ticket.  In a lot of places, it does exactly that.So, no, the bag doesn't defeat its own purpose.
How do you avoid the disappearing player glitch?Is this where you have 10 players on pitch during setup phase and cannot move a reserve player onto the field?Frustrating!
No stencils used! I free handed it. I actually made the lines crooked where it says my name. I put my name there to distract from the accident, but it actually worked out for the better! 
Toast bread of your choice, spread avocado on each with a fork, add some sea salt (bonus points if it is pink), add ground pepper, drizzle with olive oil and devour.  This has been my go to snack for months.  I might try the egg suggestion soon however.
I veer slightly more towards the scientific edge of things, too, which is why I take a more cognitive approach in my work, but something I love about applied psych is that it has that "art and science" mix going on--empirically supported interventions that still rely on interpersonal effectiveness and intuition to really "work." My dad was a particle physicist, and I was always incredibly in awe of the work he did because I struggled to wrap my head around quantum physics at all. When I decided to go the route of the psychotherapist I wasn't sure what he would think--he was totally supportive and was behind me all the way. Bottom line, I think people (if they have the resources) should do what fits best with them. 
Fucking lol, idiot line. Hey guys, remember when we all agreed that the reds would probably be douchebags? Well, we were right. We also agreed that they have good reason to be and are the top level of button society, and can't help but look down on the plebes underneath them. Deal with it. 
&gt; My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI. Pretty much this. It's the sort of pseudo-scientific simplification that's easy to digest so it gets repeated to the point of drowning out more complex analysis.Fun Fact: In addition to being designed originally for a fairly homogeneous European population the BMI was not originally meant to convey information about individuals, it was only meant as a heuristic tool for statistical analysis.
a 20 year payout of 1.3 million dollars is gonna be $65K a year, so it's not like she can go out and really spend too much beyond her means. Obviously she could get a nice house (depending on local prices, I don't know Florida that well) on a 20 year interest only mortgage that she wouldn't be able to afford otherwise and that might be a giveaway, but she wouldn't be buying too much beyond what your average middle manager at a large company could afford.
While I am 100% on board, just like everyone else, I find it slightly worrisome none of the top comments are curious about his potential running mates.  The White House is a rough place that appears to really take its toll. As awesome as Bernie is, he is much older then average presidents. Should the stress get the better of our beloved Bernie who is in succession?
I think you misunderstood what I said. When you give them context at all they most often lose their humor. They only really work when they come up "naturally" in the course of discussion. 
Straight from the article (but conveniently added to the end):&gt; Note that the analysis does not include logistics, amortized capital expenses, overhead, R&amp;D, software, IP licensing and other costs.The cost of _manufacturing_ a device is not even remotely a fair comparison for how "screwed" a customer got. 
While i agree its not broken pounce is not without bugs. But what your saying makes no sense. Your trying to apply real life mechanics to a game logic. He is trying to say that the game mechanic isnt working how it should. While i disagree with him and think he got pounced because he was going to get pounced your argument makes no sense. 
In my family, such events have led to factions/permanent camps.  Those of us who are welcoming and open continue to hang out - and frankly, avoid the others.It's not like it's something you can solve by yourselves or address with a PR campaign.As everyone else is saying - their loss.  Definitely block and unfriend IMMEDIATELY and don't look back.Life is better that way.  
Ultimate nes remix would be nice. I never got to experience those type of games before and it would be awesome to play bits of them in my n3ds. Thanks for doing the giveaway man.
[Sure, here you go](http://imgur.com/QeFHUi1)Sometimes I switch it up with Life Steal rather than Soul Rip, but other than that this is what I usually run. I'll admit I'm not the best, but I do have really good rounds sometimes, and it's because of the skills and attributes of the Warlock class rather than me being awesome, heh.
Being that you like pasta and bread, here is an idea. Buy organic wheat berries (which is what they use to make flour). Soak them over night and make them into a porridge the next morning. That is your starter.Now put some wheat berries in a flat glass baking pan. Add water up to the top of the "berries". They will start to sprout and dry out. Add water twice a day until the berries are two or three times their original size. Make porridge from the sprouted wheat berries and/or put them on other food you eat. This is your intermediate step.Do the above but continue watering them until a green shoot starts growing. This is called wheat grass. Saute the sprouted wheat grass with onions or potatoes. Voila, you have learned to eat and like greens!
Forget the haters. Yes, they are probably a tad overcooked compared to what the co called experts say is correct, but I would still shove them in my piehole with a shiteating grin on my face. 
Late to the party, but one of my elderly white teachers called a black student a "dirty cotton picker" in frustration. Needless to say that didn't go so well.
there are guides in the KSP wiki I'm fairly sure, but I would follow any advice for planes in NEAR/FAR now that the stock aero has a good portion of NEAR/FAR code in it.  The basic premise of it looking "plane-like" (especially now that 1.0 has better aerodynamics), with the normal control surfaces (ailerons, rudder, elevators).  You also need to look at the Centre of Mass vs Centre of Lift.  CoL should be just to the rear of CoM for a good plane - I normally aim so the middle of the CoL bubble is aligned with the rear of the CoM bubble.  But try further forward and further back and see what works.Aero characteristics will also change based on speed and altitude (air density).  So a plane that works well at sea level doing 200m/s may not work well at 15km doing 800m/s.You also want something pretty stable if you are doing a suborbital hop like that..  it's a fairly steep re-entry.
I think everybody suffers from it, to a degree. People want to know that their tastes are good. But, there's a fine line between that, and feeling like you *shouldn't* like something because some random tastemakers say you shouldn't, for whatever reason.    I mean, half the responses here so far are legitimate talents that are labelled as... something. 
I think Jameis was told to stay home since Roger Goodell didn't want to shake hands and take pictures with him because of his past.  I think they also told Mariota to stay home since to squash the controversy of the #1 pick not being there.
Aren't we going to be close enough that it will have some consequences here on earth? Most noticeably that it'll blow a portion of out atmosphere off (this is what I've heard anyway). 
Well, fusions are pretty much never generic. Only one I can think of is First of the Dragons. And fusions need poly or something to summon. The idea is that decks that can summon fusion monsters can only summon a limited number of fusion monsters. Where's XYZ and Synchro decks can pretty much summon every monster. 
yeah it is pretty lucky i guess =) obviously i'd want to get things done as fast as i could but i would do anything for the safety of the fish first and foremost =). the only reason i chose these specific damsels instead of like yellow tails is because (at least from all the research i've done so far and people i've asked) are extremely docile and are not like any other species of damsels at all i know that the flame angel can get aggressive if not added last and that orchid dottybacks are one of the most peaceful dottyback but can be aggresive towards things in their territory but the rest (only saying from what i've heard were relatively peaceful) have you had any of them or heard any bad things about any of these fish? thanks =)
My personal experience from using crossfire(7770s before going to a single 7970) is that when it works, yeah 7950-7970 performance(I did my crossfire when BF3 was popular and had no hassles). Once you enter a game that either is iffy or you have to manually make it work yourself then it gets tiresome. Did I enjoy my Crossfire experience? Heck yeah. Would I do it again? No, I'm unfortunately not a fan of the minor nuisances that can potentially come with it.I'm quite positive that /r/hardware has people who ended up loving it, having a distaste of it, or ending up in between.
I agree.. Outside of turn 1 it isn't really that great. However, without e tele access, I feel like it is better because it's even more difficult to open with a combo. DS can help mitigate that 
[I currently enjoy New Belgium's Ranger Beer](http://www.newbelgium.com/beer/detail.aspx?id=c35e8a3e-0a8c-404d-8b74-b03fe3e90c44&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=Hygiene&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_content=Ranger&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwpYeqBRDOwq2DrLCB-UcSJAASIYLjXsgARWGLWkWKNvkfaZ0EWzHD5SWvDR1CW8OMohv0DhoCFfXw_wcB). Great IPA flavor and it's 187 cals per bottle. Plus at 6.5% it's not the strongest but it definetly packs a stronger punch than say Bud Light which is somewhere around 4%. Also those light beers are around 100 cals but taste like shit and I feel like you have to drink twice as much too get drunk. I much prefer getting something with flavor but keeping it under 200 cals per bottle/can. Ballast Point Sculpin IPA is phenomenal also but at 210 cals per I start to get a little guilty.  
steelbeck earned that spot. Rekkles can go suck a dick, it was his choice to leave, and now he goes crawling back like an injured little cub who made the mistake of not listening to his mother.
hmm that's true.  Thanks for the advice.  I've got it to the point where my closest approach is 3.1 km, so hopefully I can get to there and then maneuver to close the gap...here goes nothing...
Came here to say *Network*. Then *The Godfather Part II*. Since both of those have been taken, I'll throw out *Lincoln*, which is a bad film that is saved by an absolutely spectacular cast.
I love Earth Burger in north SA, especially the bbq and the fish less filet. They are the same people that run Green. Beware both are closed on Saturdays. It's really really really good. BBQ revolution in Austin I thought was just OK..maybe I had it on a bad day. In Austin I LOVE the Vegan Nom taco truck. 
Lone Druid bear can now solo towers, Nature's Prophet treant damage buff and new aghs, new Boots of Travel can teleport to heroes, high ground some what easier to push... and some other stuff, I think. Doesn't really have anything to do with comeback gold but yeah.
I go to metal shows, but I know OF shows can be quite rowdy. Now, that said, Earl's pretty chill, as is his music, but the crowd will most likely be OF peeps.If you're weary about a rowdy crowd, or moshing, just stand either 13-15 heads back from the stage, or cram yourself up against it. There's usually pretty good etiquette about moshing, so if you're outside the pit you shouldn't get crammed in. If you're concerned about falling/getting pummelled, it's also good etiquette for people to create space and help you up so you're not trampled.Though, most of this is learned from metal shows, where etiquette is necessary because shit gets crazy.If this isn't what you're asking at all and just want to know about buying tickets, fuck, I don't know. GL. :D

That's also just long term bankruptcy. It's not "forgiven". It balloons up and then you pay taxes on it. 20 years is going to bring about some interesting economic times. 
There was a time when I got so worked up over football that when I was asked not to yell when watching a game with my grandma I burst a blood vessel in my eye. I don't get that worked up about football anymore, I just try and enjoy it.
If looks are the only thing you are worried about you have made it the most important thing. I don't think you need to be punished for not having to worry about child care costs or insurance either but when the economics and other real life logistics are taken care of it lets us worry about other things. You are choosing to worry about this particular topic. I think for example because I am a pediatric nurse and I know the multitude of unplanned things that can happen in childhood I would worry about other things and that is driven by the particular slice of live I spend a lot of time in. It is natural because you are a 10/10 as described by your husband you focus on looks. We react to the particular things that shape our direct experience.

Sure, don't read the verses I cite, I won't read what you cite. I read the Torah in Hebrew, have you? Because God's covenant with Adam isn't a legal one like with Moses pertaining to specific things.
video yes, repair notes no (I just found them when I got my own 2612 because I'm a geek). Although I am interested in taking on watch repair or design as a hobby. 
&gt; He was, once again, seeing what he wanted. But Bruce died. Period.I don't agree.  At the end of the movie, you see Bruce with Selina Kyle.  We, as members of the audience, know that Bruce and Selina ended up making up and becoming allies towards the end of the film.  But all Alfred knew of her was that she was the thief at the beginning of the movie.  The majority of that relationship building occurs *after* he's left Wayne Manor.  Alfred would have no way of knowing at the end of the movie that Bruce is likely with Selina; as far as he knows they last saw each other when she ran off at the beginning of the film.  So we know that Alfred is seeing reality, since he's seeing something he couldn't have predicted.  
I'd use a tung oil finish, not straight tung oil but anything to protect the wood. On my walnut and maple wrist rest I used Arm-R-Seal to seal it, which is a wipe-on oil based poly-urethane.
I always felt that's what gave the original Terminator movies their charm. They embraced the paradox. In T1, Conner himself is a paradox. In T2 SKynet is the paradox. I kinda wished they had done something deeper with it, but instead things just seemed to get sillier and sillier.
I've been in the Seagate camp since I have 4 out of 4 going strong, and a bunch of failed WD laptop drives.One external Seagate from 2009 did stop working with usb, but I took it out of the case and put it in my desktop and it's been good for 3 years.I might diversify in the future so I don't get too biased in any direction.
Honestly, the policy that Jagex has for updating on Mondays does lead to bugs snaking their way into the content.As a glitcher, I look forward to every Monday *because* of the possibility of glitches being born/reborn from the updates. Even now, there are some interesting things you can do with the recent updates to Legendary Pets that could have been avoided had there been more time to test and smooth over the problems.
Yes, I feel like that quite often. I like but also hate being alone, I like it because I am not forced to have fun according to other peoples standards but at the same time I hate it because I feel left out and as if I am missing out on life. (M, 20)
Engineering Physics with a minor in Computer Science. And as for your stats, I know math isn't always for everyone, but do you really think you're putting as much effort in as you should? I've lied to myself about things like that too.
"She's like the wind"- Patrick Swayze Before FH and were engaged we were hanging out with a group of friends and talking about weddings and first dances and he jokingly said that if we get married that should be our dance song. I said "ok!" And it's just kinda stuck. I think it's pretty silly and that's ok because I'm thinking if I'm laughing, hopefully I won't cry because just thinking about first dances makes me tear up! 
My friends kid brother used to do that, the cats refused to use the litter box afterwards and were left outside because of it. Cats aren't like people that can share a toilet with strangers. 
Holy shit, I was in the same boat.I was told by my psychologist that I should just give up and see if I could get a job because it would be 'easier'. We moved a few months after that and I got into community college (thanks to a great charter) at 16, AA in Anthropology at 18.
I definitely remember a lot of the regulars and feel like you can see distinct characteristics that come through in limited ways based on their humor, writing style, and positions on various issues. There are certainly those I've come to like and some I don't, just like any group. It's also fun to notice SRD regulars in other places and vice-versa. I especially like it when I see people commenting in SRD that I just sort of thought of as "above" this kind of subreddit
Allowed... no.Required... yes.My grandfather was in charge of an army base during WW2... yeah, it was wartime, but if you were caught on base without a loaded weapon, you were in for it.
Every effects heavy movie, because CGI gets dated quickly.Most superhero movies, because either the world will get sick of them or the bar will be raised so high that current ones can't compete (Spiderman and X Men were awesome when the came out. In 2008 the game changed and they don't really hold up).The Harry Potter movies, on account of the first two already seeming so dated (and I love most of the movies in that series).Juno, but I think the general consensus is already that it's aged poorly.
They're somewhat related in mechanism of action, so it's definitely possible benzos can cause this.But yeah, ambien seems to cause these waking blackouts more from what I heard!
Right. Christian justification for homophobia hardly comes from the Old Testament. It happens in the New Testament. In Romans 1, Paul says gay people deserve death and in 1st Corinthians 12 he defines marriage as between one man and one woman.
Thanks.A few more quick questions if you don't mind:Whats your skill order? Is it true you're not supposed to level up your ult?I played against a chaac and I got ripped :( is it a hard matchup or do I just suck?Also, last question, do you feel like baka falls off late game? I think the true damage is not as potent after a while and hunters seem to do more dmg to me than I do to them.

Kettlebell swings will reduce fat and add muscle to your ass. I won't promise it will make it smaller, but I will promise it will make it more shapely. 
I used to have that happen quite a bit back when I used an ego.  Best method is just to use a pair of pliers (needle nose works best if available) and twist it off. You might break apart the atomizer but chances are it needs replaced anyways if you're not getting any vapor.
Sports fans react hysterically and cry when their favorite team wins, and no one bats an eye. So why is it surprising when music fans react the same way when their favorite groups release new music? Fans are emotionally attached to their favorite teams/groups/shows, etc. This level of emotional attachment isn't limited to K-Pop. 
Sometimes with C25K, you need to go back a step or two while your body recovers. A couple things I've learned about running (severe asthmatic here), listen to your body and don't worry if you have to repeat an earlier stage a few times before you progress to the next stage.C25K is a great program but it doesn't always take into account things like asthma, weight, etc. When I tried it, I got stuck at week 3 for about 3 weeks before I was able to progress. The important thing is stick to it.
I just do not get this. Put the prices higher or pay your staff better, you know? I should not be expected to leave a fucking tip for poor service so businesses can get out of paying their employees properly. That goes against the very definition and purpose of tips.
False... more often than not, score ups are the superior cards to go with...The only time I would use a PL over a scorer is if the PL has a 250 stat advantage over the scorer...The numbers can be broken down, but someone already did that a while ago... it was potential pts vs actual pts (or something like that)
He was awarded the pigasus award 3 times for endorsing quackery. The only person to win it 2 years in a row, and the only person with 3 wins.He supports things such as renkei (energy therapy) and faith healing, and continued to win the award for continuing to believe in magic and miracles.He heavily promoted green coffee bean's as a wait loss "miracle". The company that made the beans got hit with a 3.5 million dollar fine for false medical claims.
I would say that institutions and structures matter a huge deal, and that changing the institutions that black people in America interface with would make big differences.So for instance, Pinker points to the modern nation state's monopoly on legitimate force as a major factor.  Changing that circumstance around people will change their behavior without changing their nature.  And making the use of police power less racist would I think result in great improvements in the economic conditions of black Americans, without changing their nature, just their circumstances.But just telling them to work harder doesn't change those institutions or structures, and is pointless.
I've never taken one under those circumstances. Only during "wtf my period is 9 days later than it has ever been in my life, and I have sex pretty consistently, sooo... shit?" kind of circumstances.

Its happened to me three times in 10 years of running. Luckily I was out in the sticks every time it happened but one time I was wearing a white under armour top, white shorts, black compression legging and white socks. I chose to use the shorts to wipe because I had a long way to run back and my feet wouldve been ruined running with no socks. It was a good choice.
What you gotta do is hold open the door 2/4th of way so the first fat person will have to open the door wider to get thru making them now the holder of the door then the group will follow suit. You make your way inside once you're not the door holder and you will still get a thank you.

I'm fairly new, just hit 30 on ACN and haven't got a job yet; is there a better way to manage or track dots? The tiny green numbers aren't good enough for me
I used to run on very little sleep, like an hour or two. I would supplement with red bulls and sugary drinks. Eventually I exhausted myself to the point of collapse, which was accelerated by having mono, a lymph-node infection and a sinus infection. Imagine being exhausted, but not being able to lay down because there is so much sinus pressure that you feel as if your head will explode. My lymph-nodes were swollen and I was delirious with exhaustion to the point of hallucinating. I was pissing blood and was jaundiced... Fun times.
I have actually. Amiibo got me into wanting to try more games as a whole ever since launch. Why buy characters for a game you've never played or never intend to play? (Fire Emblem aside, Sorry I just hate turn based RPGS) I think Amiibo has made me more open to trying much more things.
I think she was confused by the incredibly strange arguments Rand Paul was making. Did you see her eyes go "WTF?!?" when he started equating "the right to healthcare" with actual slavery.
This isn't fair.  Like at all.The Empire absolutely steamrolls the U.S.  RA3 takes place in the 1980s, and the factions all have tech far more advanced than anything IRL 1980s had.  No nuking Japan?  Give America 100 nukes and it wouldn't even come close.  WW2 America doesn't have ICBMs, so it would rely on B-29s to deliver the atom bombs.  These 100 B-29s will make it exactly three miles out into the open ocean before they get obliterated by Sea Wings or Rocket Angels or Jet Tengus or Striker VXs or ANYTHING.Even the tiny Tsunami Tank carries a rapid-fire 88 mm APDS gun, completely outclassing pretty much all the American tanks, while a King Oni could simply stomp its way across an entire American city unopposed.  Mecha/Jet Tengus alone can establish complete air-superiority.  Forget Shogun Battleships, just a mixture of Naginatas, Yaris, and Sea/Air Wings could do the trick.
It was so fast I wasn't entirely sure it was in.  The commentators on HNIC barely reacted and seemed unsure whether it was a goal and on top of that there was very little reaction from the crowd.Was kinda weird.

I think there was real, very legitimate interest on our side - Titans just didn't take the deal. I think the Titans are the reason why Mariota isn't in Philly right now, not because we didn't pony up enough.At any rate my reaction was "Whew".
If you don't mind giving "just money", giving him paysafecards gives him the option to use those all at once to buy a gem pack, while offering you the option of buying (and thus gifting) them separately.
I doubt they checked people for dual citizenships. I have a friend from South Africa who became an American citizen last year but his family is originally from the Netherlands. So the rioters would just let him pass through?
I'm a patient phone owner. I've got my current phone (which is my first Android smartphone) for over 3 years now. I'm getting frustrated with it however and I'm already saving money for something new. the fact that I don't buy my phones from my operator helps with controlling the itch. I'm a student and I don't earn any money, so I can't afford the latest and greatest every half a year. 
Paladin I feel is an obvious choice, you can play around with stuff like they showed in class challenge with buffs on dragonkin sorcerer, you have consort, now corruptor is out, lots of pally options.  Priest is also looking pretty promising, I have so much stuff I want to try this is my FAVORITE time new meta is unsettled, going to see a lot of cool new stuff! but also a lot of face hunter to punish experimenters ;)
Sure seems this way. In general I myself wouldn't want kids unless I found a suitable partner that really made me feel safe having them. That's the part that I think will keep me from having any.
*80, and I had forgotten about the pen.... The 5% per 10% missing isn't that much (10 bonus damage per 10% at 200 power). Still, hou yi's buff only works on one God at a time, whereas xballer's lasts as long as he can sustain it and chains his aa's to other enemies
Meh my experience as a former Best Buy employee (might not be the same for everyone else) was that the advertised laptop might not be there, but they always had 2 other models (from other brands) with the same CPU, HDD etc. at the same price, always in stock. I'm no BBY shill by any means knowing the way they treat their employees, but my understanding was they lost $25 on every laptop under ~$500 dollars anyway (making their money back by selling you overpriced services, cables, accessories, etc.).
I really think the 400 cr is too low for firing a weapon at an unwanted target.  I like the idea of being friendly/allied with the faction means the security forces share the scan information, or if they are actively firing on the target then it is shared with everyone in the area.  That would fix this issue and also makes sense in the universe.
Haha - I thought that too.I am a big, angry looking foreigner so I guess the meek and mild local that tried to reserve their table with a tissue packet didn't confront me...Thanks for the tissues too...
Ok i know there is mo cure for it. That was more of a hyperbole than anything. I was just saying that signing a board wouldnt do anything for the cause

Mariota, cause fuck our last three first round picks.. lets make it 4The same la'el collins that's been taken out of almost all big boards?Our plan was BPA and i think we followed it pretty well, while also finding guys who can make immediate impact.

Hi there, thanks for keeping us in the loop.Thank you, also, for being proactive and invested in your daughters healthcare. That may seem odd, but not everyone is like that- unfortunately.Regarding your two questions: there isn't much more information that can be provided. -CBC is a sensitive test. There are factors that can skew results. In this particular instance, there's no way to know *what* could have caused altered results, if anything at all.-As far as maybe concerning, no one can (should) answer that here. 
Like /u/Drumada says, there are several times where he can only go on because someone bursts in with miracle evidence or the prosecution just allows it.Examples:[1-4](#s cross examining a parrot would never fly under any circumstances whatsoever).[3-3](#s Gumshoe saves the day with the exact evidence Phoenix needs after he stalls for a ton of time).I'm sure there are more, I just can't think of them right now.Edit: Thanks to /u/JesusMonroe for correcting me on the cases.

So the flowchart then becomes:Would you, or have you, eaten a rare steak or accepted a blood transfusion?Would you or have you had sexual intercourse outside of marriage or been remarried?Would you support laws enforcing the above on everyone in your country, regardless of whether they share your faith?If no to any of the above, shut up about gay marriage. Correct?
Oh Tampa. There's a reason you're the Bucs. What a mess. Start scouting freshmen on College now for the next Bucs QB. Downvote away pirate flag bros. 
_Can_ is the fun word here. Do I want to trust that the fucker who shot up a couple kids _can_ change, and his good behavior shows he's ready to be a valuable part of society again? No. No I do not.
If you have actual forensic/criminal activity which you haven't yet disclosed to a professional, which may be construed as immediately threatening the safety of yourself or others, psychologists and psychiatrists are legally mandated to take note and in some cases inform the authorities. If this is post-hoc after the fact counselling you want, there are a few good psychologists/psychiatrists who specialise in forensic case management. Whether you can see them as an off the street consultation is another matter. Your Psychology Clinic is a good bet, i have clients with long criminal histories currently ah,  sort of involved in stuff, who see them and have no problems.
You know, I've never had bad food poisoning from a Taco Bell, but one of the worst food poisoning episodes, not the worst mind you, was from a higher-end restaurant. The worst episode was from an IHop. it came out from BOTH ends that time.

Haha I told him to make a review on this same thread. I think I'm liking the way yours is put together more, honestly. His doesn't sound that good, even though it may be better then FT clones.
I think people don't like that quote because of the implication that their "best" is something actually worth putting up with their "worst" for, but the stereotype for people who use the quote itself is that this isn't the case.
it's not incorrect really, it's just what he thinks and you disagree. he isn't even saying there is anything wrong with it. it's a much more open minded statement than yours.
I just looked at the status website today, and it looks like they 'received 4 more phones today. They were appraised at $17-18, which is what I sent them in for, since they wouldn't turn on. They will probably send out the GCs for them at ~4am like they did last week.
I'm not a hateful person, nor do I fit into the "not weird" category, but for god's sake, put a little bit of effort into how you look, and people will treat you so much better. I get it, it's stupid, and vain, and shallow, and nobody cares in the grand scheme of things, but it just makes focusing in class and getting good grades so much easier.

Defense of Apartheid versus a racist communist party. White people benefited from racism?Did they benefit from the Barbary coast you overwrought fool.
Oh I get what you're saying. It do, if you wanna be anal about it, I am talking about indie sidescrollers. Happy? I wanna explain what Im trying to say, but srsly, I just have no time to explain myself to a hipster. 
It really isn't when you think about how much people are like you. You probably hang around people that are in peak physical condition so it seems like BMI is a broken system. We e in reality BMI could apply correctly to most people. Although it's much easier to tell if someone is obese or just muscular with pictures IMO. 
That's too bad, but at least you have some friends who watch anime! I have a few too, but our tastes don't *perfectly overlap*, if you know what I mean. They're not as into it as I am, which is probably better for me honestly, keeping me from getting too obsessed. It does make it a bit harder to talk about though.If you go to a gym, that also might have the same effect as working out with your friends. Too bad you have to pay.
I'm 20. I grew up in the ghetto. I know how it goes. People like him take jabs at other people over the most trivial things because they can't formulate any type of substantial argument, and when you call them out on their bullshit, they won't ever admit they're wrong.Either way though, there's no excuse for acting like a criminal. He knows what he's doing 
This whole article is beautiful.&gt; Roselyn Michelle Roberts, a 43-year-old grandmother, faced two charges of fourth-degree theft and burglary. The court heard that Roberts suffered from manic depression and earned around $60 a week babysitting her grandchild. The state’s attorney argued for a $50,000 bail. Judge Owens revised the figure to $100,000 citing two pending cases against her and a record of eight prior convictions.A few more people like Judge Owens there and Baltimore might stand a chance.&gt; Inmates appeared before Judge Flynn Owens from the Baltimore City Detention Center via videolink. They routinely requested via their public defenders for bail figures to be lowered. Often this was denied and in some cases bail figures put forward by the state’s attorney were increased by Judge Owens.
I feel like people who spew this type of rhetoric are people who've never been to the ghetto or lived there. I grew up there, went to shitty zoned schools, but worked my ass off in school and went to college. People in the same area/school had the same opportunities as me, they decided that the government will take care of them like it does their parents, so they drop out of high school. When they're working shit jobs with no future they decide to blame society for failing them. 
Do you drive while high or around children?  If not, then you are not on my radar.  Keep it in your home.  If I find it, you will go to jail.  Do you deserve to go to prison?  That is up to the courts.  You know as well as I do what the law states.  I just enforce it.
I feel like with this build his early-mid power is almost the same but his late becomes very very strong. The squishies die anyway but he can also kill tanks really fast which are the biggest problem and because of the 40% cdr the enemy won't be able to get to lucian because he can almost dash 24/7
Very valid point. I think most view it as helping a life, instead of choosing who to help. Who is not to say the child they would have adopted isn't fine and well now? I guess we'll never know. What we do know is EJ is a great person regardless.
[](#su-flair-rosequartz) I think the true purpose of this show is to see how many qualifiers we can get to precede the word "gem" and still understand what we're talking about.
My understanding was that the credit unions' insurance was a sort of self-provided insurance - from the group of credit unions itself - so that is more risky if you consider that one credit union failing likely means that others will be failing or in trouble as well.
&gt;"I don't really need 13 rounds."Famous last words...A single 9mm round weighs less than 0.42 ounces, so you're trying to save a total of less than 3 oz by cutting your capacity in half? Jesus, that's fucking retarded.

Unlike some of my brethren I'll acknowledge that Dunleavy is sneaky dirty so I get being frustrated, but "he's young" is hardly an excuse. Most people have learned not to act that way long before they turn 20. 
I still play Marth because nobody else is as interesting to play. Also, Marth has bad approach options. He has to sign contracts with his aerials(all of them are unsafe on shield), grabs are very bleh and he doesn't have followups, and dash attack is next to pointless. Honestly Mr.E is the only thing keeping me from switching mains.
Yes your comment exactly. They didn't have it worse they had it *different*. Even if they feel they did better compared to their own childhoods it really doesn't excuse anything...
I'm white, and it is now my goal in life to adopt an asian baby and name it a stereotypically black name.  Something with a "qua" at the end sounds fitting.

Since this is a recent thing, has he shown any other behavioural changes? Changes in sleeping or eating habits? Inability to control himself or regulate emotion? Any other signs that mental illness could be developing? Could *he* be lying about something and projecting his own dishonesty on to you? I know this may be hard to think about, but could he possibly be having an affair? I don't know how many posts on this sub has started out like this one and end with the person finding out their SO was cheating. I'm not saying that's definitely the case but it, unfortunately, is a possibility.If you want to continue this relationship, he needs to see someone about his mistrust. Relationship counseling also would help work through whatever issues he seems to be having with not trusting you. If it is related to mental illness and not a guilty conscience, he really needs to see a medical doctor to diagnose and manage whatever is happening.

they were gonna make a clothing group and i asked to help in the building of their old homestore. I said it was abit small and some unhelpful "HR" banned me. I was unbanned and accidently caused a giantic forum raid on the group so i guess they closed down and tried to make another homestore but apparently now its a cafe, I tell them a suggestion to stop using free models and it's a ban. Yeah they're not going well with the supermarket thing either
While me being a nutritionist i have learned that the body does not want to store fat. Storing excess calories as fat actually takes another step making the body spend energy to turn the excess calories into fat. And a big reason as to why people gain the weight back is because they set goals and when they achieve the goals they go back to their old normal eating habits, forgetting about the diet. 
Laughed when I realized this makes Sierra a literal barrel racer, then even harder seeing them try to execute the strategy. It looked ridiculous, and Rodney wasn't even moving forward.

I've been in a sexless, loveless marriage for 12 years and I wish I could just die. I have ptsd from being raped as a teenager. I have suffered many breakdowns. Quit driving, quit working. I've become a complete shut in. I've just now starting driving again. I want to leave my husband, but I have no where to go. I'm outta state and my parents are both deceased.
I'm German but I love Heineken right out of the barrel. I haven't tried so much different beers. When you know some good I can get here in Germany, tell me!
Not a damn thing! I knitted her a throw and she uses it as a cover on her couch cushion so her dog can lay on it. I knitted her a set of dishcloths &amp; a hand towel in her favorite yellow with her favorite animal (owl) &amp; she keeps complaining that they're not very good potholders (no matter how many times I tell her they're not potholders). I told her she was getting no more knitting from me because she hurt my feelings and she said I was too sensitive, that Happy (her dog) loves the throw and I should be flattered....that her dog...loves the throw I lovingly knitted for her.
Well this means no patch for next week for sure, else the hot fix wouldn't been neccessary :/(btw bug still works in try mode but is fixed for the other modes)
No, they are free. There is the option to spend money to buy them if you don't want to farm up ip. It's the same exact way League's champions are. You can buy with ip or rp.
If I remember my patch notes correctly, the offset times were intentionally introduced when they made night darker once. The idea being if for whatever reason you don't like the current time of day on your continent, you can hop to one of the others.

I use a G13. It's not only great for gaming, but using the macro's in situations like programming is also handy.

It depends on techniques employed. Also, you should look into some of the current AI research. I would be surprised if we don't have a true self improving, superhuman intelligent AI in my lifetime. We don't need 'Human' like intelligence, just something that can solve problems. We're already very nearly there. Imagine something that could solve physics problems as well as Einstein. Only one genius typically emerges per generation of man. Imagine we made one intelligence as smart at problem solving as Einstein. Already, we have a mind that can access all the information on the 'net, and never sleeps, never rests, just chugs away, like a concept engine, thinking about physics. Now make 1000 of them, put them in a room and have them work together, 24/7. Now make one for every problem humanity needs a solution for. That's not the kind of intelligence you're going to have a conversation with, but it would literally change the world over night. Every night. 
I'm sure our generation had its share of trashy, disrespectful little fucks, but because we didn't have the ability to record anything, anywhere, anytime we can't really do a legit comparison.
Sheesh, I feel like I'm going to be drinking smoothies all day and then eating oreos/sweet chili heat doritos in between just to get my calories up.On paper having to eat thousands of calories sounds pretty awesome, but no one ever tells you that eating will become an absolute chore.
here's the story:I altered the greninja page and then some how inspect element became a thing on this sub.All the other posts of inspect element got more upvotes even though they were either bad or good.I am suprised an idea I had now made Inspect Element a thing even though I didn't want it to be the new spongebob.
Unless its craft beer then No way.  Drink German beers.  Seeing as they actually have a law on what ingredients go into beer.  I prefer my beer without fish bladder or insect based Dyes to get the colour right.  
real talk tho, DAE feel like ru is being more bitchy now when talking to da queens in the werqroom? I feel like she doesn't care about the queens at all. Someone who listened to a podcast once even commented here RU DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THE QUEENS NAMES!I feel like I care more about them than Ru. I totally stalk Pearl's instagram everyday and am BFFs with Violet on twitter.I feel like I could be a better judge than ru tbh
What does scale test mean exactly? There's already buildings and features. Do you think they have that much more planned? This is the community map project right? Key word being "community"This map is in need of some serious help. We need to throw some serious ideas and concepts out there before it's too late and DICE settles on some recycled buildings and huts randomly scattered around the jungle and calls it done.I'll up vote any post that enriches the map.
That was intentional. Some problems have neat but arbitrary effects that would otherwise not be used. If in construction a problem feels like a good to choice to put in, even if the deck itself is unable to solve it, then go for it.

Not even fence posts the fences themselves.And then when you see them disappear and you shoot through it, I dont think the shot actually connects. I once shot a fence, it crumbled and revealed a tank behind it. No lions, nothing.Like does the shell really lose that much power by hitting what is essentially an iron stick?

How would you merge them? If they were all 26 dollars then the equation would be y=26xIf they were all half off it would be y=26x/2 or y=13x but the y's aren't equal.
I don't think most of these people making judgements have the experience to understand the difference between a pointed weapon and a weapon held at the side. The difference in immediate threat is huge, no human can react in the time it takes to pull a trigger, it's impossible. I'm as angry with unjustified police shootings and brutality as the next guy, but we must recognize there are times when a shooting is justified. A person pointing a weapon is one of those times regardless of intentions; no one can read that person's mind. I read you as saying a casually held weapon is a situation where calm and talking may be an option, but a leveled weapon is a situation requiring action. I don't think anyone familiar with guns would argue this with you. 
Job advertisements don't really mean much, especially since most companies have one advertisement (e.g. new grad developer) expecting to hire hundreds of employees.
Hi, Flint!We try to avoid hard numbers in our sub. Such things as population statistics aren't really present in the ASOIAF literature, and we try to avoid mechanics in favor of storytelling.  That being said, as the only player in House Flint, you are free to establish the leader of Flint's Finger. We ask that players be courteous and try to leave room for future players who could be interested in the role. The best way to do that is to keep things as vague as possible. Thanks!

Definitely this.  I got spoiled when I first started drinking coffee because my dad would import beans from Costa Rica, and I would drink that brew black.  Then I'd get a Starbucks coffee black and just be like "Blegh, this needs cream to actually taste good".  I've recently switched to tea, but I still enjoy good coffee.

I suppose with metal being ever more plentiful as it tends to be, less people are going into key and up trading. For example, I can't nowadays since I don't spend a cent, whereas I used to be able to work in keys.
Damn, that's quite a lot of sources.The funny thing is that this has inspired some of the most thought-out debate I've seen in a while on this subreddit. Sure, it illustrates the positive and negative viewpoints, but a discovery this radical may spark a new interest in astrophysics and more.
It can be really hard for many to open up to friends and family about being vegan, especially when in your teens. Always keep in mind that as you get older these social stigmas are not nearly as harsh, and the longer you go along with your lifestyle the more confident and knowledgeable you will be. So dealing with criticism and judgment becomes easier and easier, and most families eventually will come to understand you once you have shown a commitment and have remained healthy and positive. Avoid preaching to them until they accept it, or ever.That being said, I don't like the coming out comparison. Originally coming from a small town where pretty much every person fished lobster, I understand the social problems that come with being veg. (Although I was vegetarian at the time, not vegan.) But the experience of coming out as gay just has more gravity to it. I understand the analogy you are making but I would not put them in the same category.
May 1 is the same here. "Tag der Arbeit" in Germany. (Calling it labour day and then you don't even have to work... lovin' it)I've tried but it seems it's one of those that will try to make you cry as much as possible. ...and I'm not really into feels and crying.

Maybe its just me, but her combat style seems a bit sluggish and heavy-handed compared to how I imagined her fighting in the books. Especially since her main advantages as a swordsman are her speed and agility given her smaller build. Also, I'm a bit disappointed with the way they've implemented her blink ability as a replacement for her dodging normally. Especially given the fact that she was trained to fight like witchers, and is capable of executing all of the same maneuvers as Geralt.
It always strikes me as weird when companies don't actually release information on their official website, but instead uses only social media.  Call me old fashioned, but seeing the patch notes on their official website instead of a Facebook post feels much more professional.

They introduced Ra's Al Ghul, and purposefully pushed Batman away from the POW BAM ZONK that the Adam West show popularized, wanting to tell stories more in line with the earliest Batman comics from 1939, which were darker (if not very refined.)Part of this was having people who grew up reading Batman for the first time working on the book as writer and artist, as prior to that point we had folks from a previous generation who hadn't experienced these characters as fans. As a consequence, the comics started to be aimed at an older audience, and the maturity level rose. Edit: Please see /u/GirlGargoyle post for the followup to how Dark Knight Returns changed Batman's perception.
I don't think it works like that. The ones who stayed were the ones who didn't have a problem to begin with. If you don't have a problem, you don't have to endure anything. But now the situation changed completely for the ones who stayed, so they should have a problem now. But it's solved by declaring that they're now motivated by proving themselves to the teacher, which is the exact opposite of what they did before.
Whoa there son, no hero ever _removes_ code from an Enterprise codebase. If they wanted _less_ code, they'd work in an ML or a Lisp. You only work in Java if you want to froth out out hundreds of lines per feature.
Yep, I've done all that. Put my stash into e-liquid-recipies, and checked out what others were making with those flavors. Also made my second order (the imgur link at the bottom of my post) based on what others have made in monthly recipe and clone threads. Guess I just wanted to reach out in another avenue :)
This is [Simpson's Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) at play as the statistics were looked at as a whole. Inequities will now been introduced all over campus. The question that has to be addressed is - is this disparity due to gender or area of expertise?The Faculty Union has a legal duty to this fight this initiative.

Just uploaded our follow up where we watched Alien. It was my friends' first time seeing it: http://gottawatchwhat.com/?p=65Would appreciate any feedback. Thanks!
i agree that there's too much content. I have 5gb a month on my internet and it's free data from 12-5 AM. I have five hours in the middle of the night to watch or download content to watch later. I really had to cut down on everything i watched in the past and mainly stick to achievement hunter, as their long videos give me the msot bang for my buck, os to speak. 
I barely remember anything outside of school before 9th grade. My life is still mundane but damn there is nothing in my memory from those younger times.
You do have some pretty good points! I guess it just comes down to preference! I like the whole sloppy street fighter/lunatic gimmick and performing style. But that's just me!
Mostly because a lot of the people who want 'talk' about racism really just want to lecture us without any kind of two-way dialogue at all?And really, the Good Men Project? That's a cookbook, my friend.
I'd say the Redeemer is more a Russian gunship (troop transport and firepower in one)http://i.imgur.com/vyVcsvS.jpgAnd the mustang is more thethe Camero line, sporty, family and a pickup version for the explorer.http://imgur.com/tMKEtHtActually scrap that just go with the actual mustang line up itself. Obviously what they were going for.
I have ADHD and grade school was pretty rough for me performance wise and my 3rd grade teacher wrote on a report of my performance that it was a shame I couldn't be lobotomized to make my life easier.
This is the correct answer.  They probably won't be looking to get rid of any other cheap players either, but theoretically anyone else could get lumped into a package deal.
yes, even though i try to strategically place seeds to pop a new group up. it takes way too damn long for them to spawn, then run back into the fight. it's almost like you're useless for the 2 seconds it takes to re-spawn them and have them hitting the enemy again. on top of that, seeds take a ton of energy, so unless you're CP (which seems extra bad now, since you're 90% reliant on munions), you're very limited on how much seed spam you can do.
definitely gonna check these things out! Just got back from the grocery store with some low salt/butter popcorn and some random raw veggies. Definitely will check out the berries idea. Love me some smoothies anyway if they dont work so well as muchies lol! Thanks!
And these same people who tell us to check our privilege are... what? American? Have an education? That either they have the ability to obtain through parent finances, their own ability to have a job, or through government/scholarship assistance? It's just so... Projective. They don't even realize that they have the very same privilege as the people they "attack".
&gt; "Nurses didnt want to open the box, and instead called the Missouri Department of Conservation to.have an agent come analyze the snake."If something is out of your scope of practice, then you contact someone who can help. They did what needed to be done. 
Had that happen in a farm party the other day. The WHM somehow pulled hate right before Akh Morn was about to be cast but the PLD snapped it back just in time for all of us to see Bahamut face the party but cast Akh Morn out his ass on the tanks....goood times
And while there's no way to quantify it, it seems like a whole bunch of potential live-ball turnovers have bounced right back to the Bulls. Not sure if that's luck or something else is going on (overeagerness to get out on the break?).
I want to be that guy who points out that without a squeezer, you're just spreading blood around with more water. But I won't be that guy here. Cool rig.edit: if you have any photos of the actual rig you should post them to https://www.facebook.com/griprigs
Yup, nobody in my family wears seat belts, hell they won't even let me put it on because apparently I don't trust them, hell I don't trust you, that's why I don't want to die!
Actually, the definition of "eradicated" in this context does not mean that the zero people catch the disease:&gt; Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Example: measles, poliomyelitis.[source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm)So, without vaccinations, the disease can reestablish itself.
I was at a party with adults and there were some teachers there. I heard a lot of this sort of stuff. The one I remember is the football coach that talked about a specific player that he said would end up nowhere because he's your basic thug and has absolutely no respect for his coaches.... The guy ended up in the NFL a few years later and has 2 Super Bowl Rings....Can't say I blame the teacher because I actually agreed with him at the time. 
Youll need to provision to configure the interfaces ahead of time, otherwise it is not required. Op, only power off the switches to add stack power cables. If the device is not in use, building it on the fly while powered up works fine. Your configs are stored in flash somewhere im pretty sure. Regardless, config, prioritize and then stack and it'll come right up.
Because the MTA is run by a bunch of greedy dumbfucks.Edit: ok that's not entirely fair for me to say. I did buy my monthly LIRR ticket at one of the machine kiosks using my Watch. 
Some games are programmed to or have the option to limit background usage. In league of legends for example, you can get 300 fps while playing, but as soon as you alt tab out the fps will go down to about 17.
We are a small minority of the overall population (about 3-5%), so you have to make special efforts to find your own kind. The best place to meet LGBT people is in organizations or places that cater to LGBT people. Your school may have a Gay Straight Alliance (GSA) or LGBT student group. Check your school's student directory, ask a school counselor, or check the organization listing on the school web site. Go early to meetings and stay after so you will have a chance to meet people and make new friends. You can do the same in the larger community, once you find a LGBT newspaper or organization, it may lead you to other LGBT community resources, groups, or events. Does your community have a pride event? The organization that puts this on might have a website that links to others. Community theater is also often something that LGBT people are associated with.
Yeah, definitely want trying to imply that Nico is better! Boris is excellent. Nico is much younger though, and if he leaves Portland I think we can mold him 
I love AirBnb, primarily because it allows me to live like a local. Plus, you can actually get some pretty nice places for a decent price. You do have to book at least a few days in advance, but if you want the best chance of getting a booking last minute, look for the ones that are instant reservation.
What is on the test, and at what are the qualifications for passing? Who decides these qualifications? What is the protocol with registered voters, does everyone need to reregister to vote and then take the test? How is the test proctored? Can you retake the test if you fail? Are states allowed to make their own versions of the test, or is it completely administered by the federal government?If people don't have a computer, how do they access these online resources? And yes, a lot of people in our country do not have access to a computer with internet. Look, I know you have good intentions with your idea but quite frankly, it is completely ignorant to think that any good could come of it. It would discriminate against the poor immensely and I can pretty much guarantee you no one on either side of the aisle would EVER support something like this.
I'm looking at my third Zodiac and I just can't muster the energy to click the box next to Wanderer's Palace for that first item.It probably wouldn't even be hard.  But.  
There's been a couple of good grocery list posts in the past, you may find some good answers there:http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/18sekp/bodies_are_made_in_the_kitchen_post_your_typical/http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hmyys/what_does_your_grocery_list_look_like/http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2n9hd5/healthy_meal_plans_that_have_grocery_lists/
Well, I said they are gougers because I've never been charged cover at Oar House before. But if it is the "damn" part you are concerned with, and you actually thought I was condemning them to eternal suffering in the fiery pits of hell, then sorry for the hyperbole. 
I've been in that projection booth; I used to work at PSC, though not in the IMAX department.  It's the same booth, though it looks practically empty without the giant platters for spooling the big filmstrips.  You can also look into the booth between shows; there's a window to the outside of the dome (but still inside the building, roughly opposite the bathrooms).   It has blackout curtains that close the window off during the shows. 
They maximize supination so it targets short head more effectively than a normal curl.  In fact if I had to choose only 1 bicep exercise, concentration curls would be it.  But if you fatigue the forearm flexors AND do concentration curls you can really kill the short head.&gt;I'm not sure if you were trying to come across as kind of funny but when providing ideas maybe ditch the condescending shit. I was trying to be funny.  I'm in no position in life to be condescending to anyone.

First off, congratulations to both of you for recognizing how intense having a baby is and how much work has to go into it. Secondly, it is completely normal to desire a child. Around your age and we aren't planning on trying for quite a few more years yet but I still feel a little sad every time my period comes because of a serious case of recurring, What Ifs. Make your baby bucket list, start saving and make you the best person you can in the time you have before your whole world changes.
It happens to all of us... lol.  I remember a few years ago, a similar thing happened to me.I was still living at home, doing everything out of just my small bedroom.  I'd go to the auctions and always tease my parents when leaving that I spent $1000's or bought tons of huge items... Then, one day I actually did buy 6-7000 NOS radio tubes and my parents laughed it off.  Needless to say, they weren't laughing when I got home that night with every inch of space in my car packed full of radio tubes... Yup, I've got my own place now! 
The thread from earlier this morning, it was created at a pretty EU friendly time and full of people mad at NA for leeching EU talent. I checked it again a few hours later and suddenly it's full of people pointing out that T8 is still all NA.It was a pretty weird thread tbh...
I've always been told, if it's a long fight, or if the healer/s mp goes below half (especially for WHM's) then click on Ballad. If you've got a coupla mages, click on Foe's. If you've got more melee/ranged, Paeon is good in downtimes between phases as it means it refreshes everyone when you group up 
"For the NFL draft, I want to make sure I look like a guy who sells ice cream at Disneyland."I get that this is not about fashion, but really:  Who the fuck told you to go out in public in that get up?
Im pretty sure they know exactly what's going on, they just feel uncomfortable about it. Unfortunately for them however they can't really say they practice what they preach.
oh i kinda addressed this with the guy above you in the thread but i dont do it to get back at them... thats kinda a plus. i do it to have proof that I am a dependable and safe seller.  on craigslist, nerves are a deal killer
Honestly, I feel like the ECW fans set a precedent in awesome and original chanting that made or broke wrestlers that's now been taken up by the entitled dudebros of today's society who chant stuff to be obnoxious and put themselves over while claiming the ECW fans were worse than they are.That only goes for the worst case "we are awesome" types of chanters though, not all of them.
Not in the ones I mentioned.  You might also note that as recently as the 70s Law Enforcement and State Guardsmen had the authority to shoot looters on sight. So, yeah, it did happen in the past, but only sporadically.  There has been a radical change in this country since then and law enforcement is prosecuted for suppressing riots rather than the looters who perpetrate them.
"jackanape" I believe that was the slur your teacher heaped on that student in order to embarrass him. Terrible when a person hates their job so much that he/she inflicts emotional pain on others who have no agency. 
Think about it, people. This could actually happen... If we could get organized and have a MAJOR online campaign for Bernie - and I'm talking everywhere, major news networks, facebook/twitter/whatever - it might be enough to get him elected. This era is now basically defined by the Internet, and it could very well be the first time it influences an election in a significant way.
Reasonably large dog, although perfectly normal sized considering breed; standing on an elevated platform next to a short looking guy with a questionable beard.
You know how there are those charts where they take your age and say "Oh, you're only 93 jupiter days old!" Are there any planets where earth's age would only be a couple thousand years old? 
With Ramsay you could say his passion and desire to become a real Bolton drove him to do those things. He wants to impress his father, Roose so he is loyal and traditional in the Bolton way. In their family, he has earned the right to become a Bolton and heir. 
Just take a couple Sundays and look at some open houses around where you are looking.  It always helps to get a sense of the market and what various price points are for other homes.  Knowing what other homes are selling for makes you a better judge of your own property's value. 
No, I'm not kidding.  The garage is unattended, so there's nothing stopping thieves from working in isolation throughout the day.  It's at least 10 minutes of walking through some dangerous intersections for pedestrians to the market, and it will seem like longer than 10 minutes in the winter.  Plus it's now one of the most expensive garages downtown for hourly rates.

Own both of Ike's games &amp; would love to have his Amiibo pictured next to his games. Would be also nice to put WFT in great and funny locals for pics.
I think that really depends on the GPA you have. If you have a 3.0 GPA then passing the exam will be more important. If you have a 4.0 GPA then that's a different story. It also depends on the school you go to. I don't go to a target school and passing the level 1 exam gives me a huge leg up on the students at my university. Passing the level 1 exam at my school is worth more than a 4.0 GPA. It's unfortunate, but at the same time it has its benefits
Regardless, it reduces their "two-factor" authentication to single-factor. I can access my account with only information I know. Two factor means any two of (something you are, something you have, something you know).
No , you're wrong, this stuff isn't happening, I saw so on Reddit, everyone has assured me this kind of stuff is bs mainstream media and is definitely not happening. Cause there's no black racism, just white people being judgemental.
EB Games is a successful company that was bought by GameStop. As part of the merger, many EB Games store locations were closed or converted to GameStop brand stores. However, some U.S. locations are still branded under EB Games. Also, the EB Games name is still used extensively overseas in countries like Australia where it is the largest national video game store. 
1 in 5 seniors will die within the first year after suffering a broken hip. Weight bearing activities will not only increase bone density but will also increase balance and coordination to reduce the risk of falls. This is no joke!
Yes, it feels wrong, but I'm having a hard time coming up with a reason why the hiker shouldn't have to pay.  After all, I get a bill when an ambulance has to take me to the hospital.  Why is a chopper rescue any different?
&gt;I think American/western culture kind of glorifies "mean" jokes -- that is, jokes at a person's expense. So many sitcoms have a punch line making a fool out of somebody or putting somebody down.Interesting, as I've read that all comedy by definition requires SOMEONE to suffer. This is why comedy show protagonists tend to be dicks or otherwise not very nice people, so you laugh when they inevitably get screwed over.
I didn't need clarification. I saw it instantly. I have quirks like this too. When I play League of Legends as an ADC, I will do laps of the tribush by clicking in every corner. Every game.
You are using so-called smart quotes instead of regular quotes.Delete the quote characters and type them yourself.Well, the good news is that you fixed your character encoding problem. The first screenshot shows UTF-8 displayed as ISO-8859-1.
That's Cool. Yeah I just finished the book. So my afternoon is going to the library to return this one and get the next one. I really like the series so far. The writing style and the depth of characters is great.
The CBS Sports Draft Trackers gives instant grades. A C- for Mariota. This is ridiculous. Let him play a snap before he gets a bad grade. Also he asked "Why?" Why? They need a QB. I recognize that Washington/STL has made trading dowm from 2 a major sexy opportunity, but the idea that Tennesee should pass on a QB as a no-brainer is excessive. 
I couldn't say I blamed him.  I would have probably have fallen apart too.  I think the relationship would have worked out great if they started it a few seasons back.  It would some more variety with couples on Voyager.
Might've enjoyed the experience? I know 100k is no joke, but maybe it bears repeating that the University isn't a degree factory. One might choose to go to a more expensive school for a whole variety of reasons, and future employment prospects and/or the ability to be pretentious with your new 'brand-name' degree aren't necessarily among them. (Regardless of what Reddit would have you believe, seeing as the Ivy Leagues typically get twisted to fit this narrative).But I don't know her or her situation so I really have no say in this conversation.   
Correlation doesn't prove causation (obligatory Reddit defensive statement), but [this image](http://www.motherjones.com/files/Lead_Crime_325.gif) is interesting.
I suppose those are entry level jobs as legal workers at companies, or consultancy positions in law firms. There's plenty of those but it's very hard to grow from there. Trying to make it as a lawyer is high risk high reward, and a lot more interesting.
You greatly overestimate how seriously faculty would take this. They likely complained, but I wouldn't be surprised if no one believed them and they were punished for pressing it...
The EC stack becomes more effective? I wouldn't think so you usually build up a tolerance to the caffeine but my best advice to you would be to try out what you think will help avoid the adrenal fatigue and adjust as time goes by 
You are not giving the money to the government to hold. You are giving money so the government can give that money to the current old people. Then when you are old, hopefully, there will be enough young people working and paying social security for the government to give their money to you.Edit: referring specifically to social security here.
Very bad mistake, as we have seen the most Egoist ADC's have had very poor results in general; Chaox, Rekkles, Forgiven and Doublelift. Keep steelback or prepare to lose 1st place at EU.Idk why Fnatic members or staff is stupid enough to take him back....
This episode was Sensational! Best episode because it introduced best girl xD I pretty much knew penny was a robot from the first encounter. I had my doubts until the next episode. Also I wasn't expecting Blake to be former white fang. 
Do you think there's even a chance that people will threaten you, kick you out, beat you up, disown you, potentially kill you for being vegan? Seriously? Are you joking right now?
I know!  WTF!  In my high school, we have to write 1000-1500 word essays every week.  That's what we're used to.  So you can imagine why my brother had trouble with a limit of 300.
I would suggest at least changing the price so that players can purchase the chroma packs with a $5 purchase rather than being forced to buy $10 and have a bunch of unwanted RP.
Your correction is accepted. My primary statement was that it exhibits, if not volition, than a surprisingly good simulacrum of volition, and fixes itself in whatever it determines to be an inert state relative to the Nearby Thing. On the Helicarrier, it was probably picking up on Thor's own frame of reference, as it still 'belonged' to Thor. Or he might have given it the explicit instruction to do so, or something. 
You're quite right- songs and genes flowing to and fro across the Irish Sea for 6+ millenia. Songs like the 'Wild Rover' about the struggle between sobriety and drink are close to a celtic (small c) heart. Another close example, is N. Irish trad 'Carrickfergus'."i'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober.A handsome rover from town to town.Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered.Come all you young men and lay me down."
I have a 12x12 craft case that I use to carry all my stuff around in. It's not the most casual thing to carry around, but I can keep each project in its own case for easy storage. 
Well that's still pretty cool! I love going to the movies but my family doesn't go very often anymore and my boyfriend isn't a fan of going. I hope you enjoy it:)
Pierce is my favorite American in the last century. My grandfather with whom I have a close relationship is very similar to Pierce in appearance, sound of voice, could pass for him in a recording. Listening to him feels like a family member
You asked for help about women *liking* you. It's a common mistake of young dudes to get hung up on a certain girl. If you are, that's a very good reason why a new girl wouldn't like you; you want someone else more than her.
Well, obviously, the midwife's office wasn't like *certain* they were going to go into labor. That isn't the whole basis of their business. And they definitely don't have an established policy for their other patients. No. Naaaah... that'd be like responsible and shit. Wouldn't want you to feel valued as their patient. /s I'm sorry those bitches made you miss out on your lemonade. 
I'd like to hang out with Will Smith. I think he'd be a super cool dude. I don't know anything about him, but I'd drink a couple beers with that guy. Just sit together, drink a few beers, maybe talk about stuff. Just cool, Will Smith stuff. 
If you are going for 353 make sure your physics and math are the right level. I know a few hopefully apprentices that are stuck trying to upgrade their marks while working as groundsmen.
Is it not a good paddle? Not sure what you mean. Edit: I'm thinking you're talking about the sticker on the blue paddle. That's my friend's haha. He bought it on the way at academy and I guess forgot to remove the sticker. 
I didn't mean to insinuate that Joel should be given up on at all, I agree with you that it's unfair to expect such so quickly. Just that thus far he hasn't been as good on Arsenal as he was playing with worse teams against top notch opposition.
I bought a kite just like that, but the wind snapped the sails off. I guess it was a cheaper version. Seeing this makes me wonder about the greatness I missed out on when mine broke. :(
Duuuude, I know you probably dont think it, but pop that Scooby Doo game in. That game is absolutely top notch. Some wonky controls, but ill be damned if that wasnt one of my favorite games.

I started thinking the Jags were gonna do something stupid and draft a WR. I'm glad they went with Fowler, I think it's a great pick. He's gonna be really good in a couple years.
Several bike manufacturers have had to make recalls in the past because if Suntour's shitty quality (assurance?).    Unless OP is a flyweight, stay well clear of them.
Weapons will get rebalanced but it won't fix anything. There will always be a top 5 weapons. Eventually Thorn and TLW will fall out of favor and people will move onto the next big thing. Then people will complain about that and reminisce about the days of Thorn and TLW being good.The cycle of nerfs and buffs is very predictable.
I have a question with superscripts, and the two links didn't seem to discuss it. Is it possible to have a superscripted expression in parenthesis? For example, if you want to have exp(x(x+2))\*y^2 in exponent form, it becomes e^(x(x+2))\*y^2, and I can't seem to be able to use backslash to ignore the inside parenthesis. Right now I'm using spaces to prevent that with e^x(x+2) *y^2, but it looks odd to me.Also, I really like the subscript option, I see it used all the times.
I think the fit is small. I tried a L on which is my stealth jacket size and it was at least a size too small. It probably has to do with the lining but such a size gap is surprising. 
Oh...wish I had some wine...but forget to get some at the store.  I rarely drink...but this is one of those evenings.  I am so wound up I need to chill  :)
People are so pissed at this pick in here. The fact is that if you don't have a franchise QB then your biggest need is a franchise QB. If they didn't feel that Mett was their guy then they needed to move on regardless.
Generally, if a girl posts about wanting friends, she will get a ton of messages from guys and it can be difficult to consistently delete the creepy ones or find the ones that are interesting enough to keep talking to. I can count on my hand the number of friends I have from online that I consistently talk to (considering the high amt at the start, it's a very small %). I'm not sure what type of friend your looking for, but people's time might be utilized differently or people honestly just forget and are bored. Also, I hate when people put in little effort into a convo (both irl and online). 
Shoutout to the NFL Network for bucking the trend of only comparing players if they are the same race. Compared Winston to Matty Ice, Mariota to Kaep and Fowler to Kerrigan. 
I had a friend like this in college. She weighed close to 400 lbs and her room was disgusting and smelling like rotten menstrual pads. She was so gross she didn't even have a roommate after the first few weeks of school. We could never figure if she got moved out due to the mess, if she was buried somewhere in the litter of the room, or if my buddy ate her or what... Anyway. There's not much helping someone like this. Anything you say is taken as very hurtful criticism and will just cause them to cling harder to their source of comfort which is food and filth. Your best bet is to try to be a supportive friend. If you really want her to clean up for sanitary reasons, get her out and somewhere else long enough that she'll notice the filth and smell when she comes back. It might help. Otherwise just telling her will get you nowhere. She does not care. She lives in it and likes it.
Dude I totally thought Watch Dogs was Sleeping Dogs and I was like 'I loved Sleeping Dogs why wouldn't anyone want a sequel?'Watch Dogs was so nothing that my brain thinks it never happened.
I can't see it right now but both circled are face off wins and the color on the first chart is home vs away faceoff wins while the second chart is win vs loss. Make sense?
Yeah that's right, it closes once you enter, but run back up to it and just hang around and kill stuff from up there.  Like I said, the knights don't run up there and thralls come up very slowly one at a time so you can pick stuff off real easy.  It only get's a little sketchy when the ogre spawns, because at that point, mobs start spawning right by those doors that you'll be hanging out at.  So either move to the underground spot for ogre or just watch your back for them spawning around you.  I tend to just hang around by the door the whole time and when ogre spawns I just rocket/snipe him really quickly before the other mobs spawn.  Cheers!

This might single out a few people, but I feel like these examples need to be shared.  I apologize to those effected by this.I know of a female programmer that was harassed by several people about how her boyfriend did the coding for her.  I've also heard of another female that applied and was asked questions about her relationship status instead of questions about the position.  Other females have left due to harassment of some kind.  I haven't seen it, but I've heard stories about the CEO also being involved in some of this.I know not every female there has to deal with it, especially those that have some form of relationship with other people in the office, but enough have that it seems like an issue that needs to be addressed.
And I'm the guy who bought both sets off effectiveduck and I have the same impressions. The thick ones seem much nicer. Haven't used them much yet, though.
I don't really know, I was really hyped but the team's got really bad. I just want to get the Hellcat because I love fast tanks and that style of play.
www.codeacademy.org is great for learning basic syntax.www.learnpythonthehardway.org is also a great resource to learn python(make sure to take the crash course[It's in the appendix] on using terminal if you don't know how to use it/what it is)there's also www.learnrubythehardway.org for ruby.
Thank you. I really am trying to look at it that way, but I've always had this complex of sorts. My mom is a fitness trainer, my sisters are little twigs and I'm always hiding during family functions so the camera doesn't catch me. I'm dreading being the center of attention and not feeling comfortable with myself. I honestly think I might need to see a doctor. I suffer from ovarian cysts and now that I think about it I have been gaining and struggling to lose weight ever since my first cyst ruptured. Being a woman isn't  always fun :/
In Akame Ga Kill [I wish almost everybody didn't die. I think Mine, Leon, Lubb, and Tatsumi should have started alive because they all had something go live for. I'm okay with Bulat's and Sheele's death because it have the team something to really fight for. P.S. Leone's death wasn't needed and pisses me off.] (/spoiler)
I just can't come anywhere near understanding why a kid halfway done with college thinks he has any goddamn standing to criticize someone else's career. I can at least understand the STEM supremacy coming from people actually working in STEM even though it's incorrect and fuckin' annoying, but how far up your own ass do you have to be to be a *student* who just stridently declares the livelihoods of the vast majority of humanity to be bullshit.
A majority of the people in my house right now are over 15 y/o, and we genuinely enjoy *certain* cartoons, like Star Wars Clone Wars. But if my dad walks in to to see us watching it, he says "you guys are too old to be watching cartoons, turn this off now", and he says this every time. Man I really hope he doesn't look at my profile on Netflix with all the anime I watch
I am too and I think it's fucking barbaric. The medical benefits are pretty dubious, and there are risks involved with the procedure. The stress on the child is measurable.  Just because you don't consciously remember the pain today doesn't mean you should subject other tiny humans, fresh to this world, to unnecessary surgical procedures.
I've done this before. If you run your filter now it will probably ruin it. I would just drain the tank almost all the way and then fill it up really slowly. Put a plate or Tupperware lid on the bottom and pour the water on that instead of straight into the substrate. It should be a LOT clearer then and then it should be okay to run your filter.

Walmart had "Plumbing issues" in multiple states, including stores in California and Florida, at the same time.  That must be one big pipe to cause the same issue simultaneously at multiple stores 3000 miles away.
Semen does contain trace amounts of chlorine, IIRC.So it makes sense that some people would be more sensitive to the smell and some people's semen composition would have the chlorine component be dominant in the olfactory bouquet.

When you run a solo, you have to have everything be something that that character &amp; player can do. Second, it makes it had on you running NPCs because you have to fill in the gaps where other players may banter back and forthLastly, the player is on their own....no healing spells or resurrection type stuff. Try to make the threat something other than loosing hit points. 
Polite means that you can offer to treat, but if she says no, then accept that and move on. Polite doesn't mean offering to treat and then getting resentful if the other person doesn't take you up on it.It's seriously not a big deal. Focus on getting to know each other, rather than dwelling on who spent $2.00 on a slush.
Good points.  If these are fly-by-night operations couldn't they do something similar to what credit card companies do to merchants with less than ideal credit?  That is they hold the money for a set amount of time.  When I owned an ISP back in the late 90's I believe we had a hold of 2 months on our money.  I've heard some companies had a hold of 6 or more.

I support the PSA. Social democrats are not socialists and should therefore not espouse their beliefs or who they support here. That is for their subreddit, not ours. If they'd like to take us up in debate, there are subreddits for that but not this one.As for Bernie Sanders: he is an imperialist and a capitalist. No socialist should support him.
I'm from New Brunswick and a friend has a cottage on lake digdeguash about an hour away from you.  We`ve spent a lot of weekends there  and have had a pretty similar experience just once...  A few of the more tipsy people decided it was a good time to for a stroll right around sun down.  The few of us who stayed behind heard one of them yell something not too far off and then heard a scream that made my hair stand on end.  A few of us ran off in the direction of the scream only to find them all up the road a bit staggering back towards us.  guess it might just be that whole area.  
i largely agree with you, but I think you underestimate the synergy between plaza and minion and overestimate advisor minion. Plaza Minion lets you accrue coins without losing cards. Also, Plaza Minion lets you play your 1 of Swindler, even if you end up tossing the hand it is in. Also given the distinct lack of trashing on this board, it lets you do SOMETHING with the coppers in your deck, instead of chucking them to minion continuously. Conversely, what does advisor get you, you get to discard extra coppers/estates when you Minion? Why? 
I don't see how he didn't know what reverse image searching is. And after a brief stint in IT and hearing IT stories, I would not at all be surprised if a successful hedge fund manager were unfamiliar with reverse image search. And thought every search engine was "The Google".

Eh, its about half and half from what I see, and a lot of people making comments about Hideyoshi, which is kinda weird, I mean, I like Hideyoshi to but It's not really relevant.

Not trying to beat up your post but: Quincey is only 29.  Ericsson is 31.  Franzen barely played all year and could be close to retirement or buyout with how bad that injury was.  Sheahan Nyquist Tatar are not in their prime yet.  Sheahan doesn't even get a lot of ice time currently.  My point is more to the fact that we have never replaced Lids, while Dats and Zett are well past their prime.  They can still play the game exceptionally, but not at the level of a Seguin or Kane (on their best days).  I think there will be a lot less explosive activity in the coming years, and players will more likely just fade out and other players moved up.

Not only that but Warren for VP isn't a great idea, she's better causing a ruckus where she is. VP are essentially lame ducks with no punch. Besides, depending how this election goes, she could theoretical run in 2020 or 2024. She'd have MUCH more weight behind her then, regardless of who takes the White House in 2016. 
I run it on a mono bug team with sticky web so I can have 4 attacks. Protect is safer, but with Monotype you can run into a type that completely walls all your options so it is really nice to have that 4th move. Don't us 4 moves unless you have sticky web or something similar, though.
Ugh, of course. Yep, the band is snug, probably on par with most 30s I've tried.Okay then, the TLBCs might work! The bands on the 2 32As aren't much that looser than the 30Bs fyi. Their sizing is so odd.
I guess I consider using the orbit map to plot your path is basically making your own maneuvers in your head.  Without using the orbit map at all it would be pretty tough.

I agree, the price of everything won't raise by 1 dollar for every dollar increase in the minimum wage. But it doesn't have to. Think about all the different products people buy. If 100 products raise their prices by 1 cent for every dollar that the minimum wage goes up, that's effectively a 1 to 1 ratio.What if 1000 products raise their prices by 1 cent?
Oh my god you are just consistently a terrible person. If you choose to inflict suffering on an innocent animal and then suffer the consequences of your actions, I'm super fucking fine with that.

Are you talking in terms of the US? Because if so you could not be any more wrong. This question is both touchy and has a ton of variables with where OP lives/ wants to carry the knife at, age, ect. For example, if you want to buy a knife here in WA, USA all you need to do is go to any REI or Big Sporting Goods store, show them your ID so they know you're of age and to run background checks quickly to know they aren't selling to a criminal, then hand over the money. Done. I know this because that is how I got mine. Now, before you do that you need to look up the carrying laws of course of your location (aforementioned) as well as anything like blade length and such.If you're not talking in terms of the US, please state that as i'm sure other places may have stricter/ looser rules when it comes to knifes and noting your location will help a lot.

How is that selfish or fucked up? If the issue is important to you, seems fair to prioritize it. Far better than people who vote for a candidate because the other wants to give equal rights to gay couples, etc...
Pick someone who is confident to be your shotcaller and follow what they say to do (if they're your best player, that's ideal). A bad call followed through by the whole team is better than a good call that only half the team follows. One person needs to be the decision-maker on what your team is going to do next (push mid tower vs baron after an ace, etc.).
I don't think planning for therapy to fail is a very healthy way to enter it, and I am sure that talking with a therapist first would better help him understand if the marriage is worth saving and if it's possible. I agree with most your advice and know it is well intentioned, but I think it is really dangerous to flippantly throw out advice for divorce mid-paragraph. If he wants to try therapy, I see no reason to poison the well.
No, synopses; -is pluralizes to -es, -us pluralizes to -i (see parenthesis/parentheses, cactus/cacti).Except for octopus. Octopus can validly become octopodes and, as such, should always be called octopodes.

That's a limitation of directx, and each of those installs quite possibly could be installing something different. It's not unusual for a big AAA game to get a distinct version sort-of-on-top-of DirectX, and the only way to know is to run the official installer.
I think you should wait until we've moved to /r/freefolk (if we end up doing that) and then once we've moved, maybe change the description for the subreddit to "Welcome to the true North! This is a community for the people who DO NOT KNEEL!! A place free of rules, where everyone is welcome!" Or something like that?And then you can message them, make it clear that we don't have any policy on piracy (and link to the other subreddits that are like that). And if they still say no to that: then ha. Fuck it. We do not kneel.I really love this subreddit just because the conversations are so much smaller (in a good way) and I'm not forced to use spoiler tags or use clickbait in titles. It's like a breath of huge fresh air, y'know?Either way: again, keep it up!

A computer-to-brain interface that can eventually, piece by piece, start replacing the biological brain with a computer hardware version, much like the Ship of Theseus:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_TheseusI'd like to hook such a device up to my brain, and gradually start becoming a cyborg- until my fragile, mortal, biological brain is phased out, and my consciousness is completely contained in a far more durable container.Then I'd like to continue existing for billions of years.
I don't know.  I live close to one and except for the components (1/4th of the store) and the very small electronics area (1/16th) it's a very boring place than it used to be.  Fry's stores are much better in my opinion though I still don't shop there anymore.
Wages won't rise unless there is a labor supply problem. Until there is a trend of American players leaving to play abroad, there won't be a problem with supply. Your comment reads as if you believe that increased salary improves players. That's not very likely. Frankly, the CBA pay rises have more to do with expanded opportunities within the US, and with the public relations issues surrounding labor disputes. 
I just took a 4 hour mandated defensive driving course for my county job..

What they're doing isn't a sterile process. Besides that even in other surgeries the only people gowned up are those who are involved in the actual hands on process.

Just what I observed.

Nukes are the main ingredient that makes ICBMs threatening. According to "international media", Pakistan's potential political instability means that they have all sorts of "interests" in exerting overt and covert "influences" to keep a submissive government in power.Nobody cares about conventional long range missiles. Making orbit-capable rockets doesn't mean they have what it takes to deliver nuclear payload accurately and safely(without blowing up in atmosphere) at high reentry speeds.

&gt; it's absolutely fine if the murderer is the state? Killing a murderer after they received due process and years of appeals is murder? It's a simple example of justice. An eye for an eye - you kill someone, you deserve to die yourself. &gt; On top of that, the aim of the criminal justice system should, ultimately, be to reduce crime rates. It has been proven, time and time again, that the death penalty does not deter people from crime.Execute a criminal and there is one less criminal and no chance of recidivism. Whereas you have millions of people in US jails, which hasn't deterred crime either. Meanwhile they continue to commit crimes and violence against other prisoners while in jail.I don't think the death penalty is necessary because it deters crime however. I just think it is the right outcome for the worst murderers. We can certainly address the underlying social issues that lead to crime, but I have no problem keeping the death penalty as well.
Dev response to a comment of mine a year ago:http://www.reddit.com/r/CivClicker/comments/233roo/mills_are_they_worth_it/cgtgx73Summary: Assuming 100% human population, food production is multiplied by (1 + mills/200), so every subsequent mill increases food production linearly, and this makes a smaller change to as a part of the total. Basically, buy them when they're cheap, but don't spend a long time saving up to buy them. If your running a zombie empire, mills are useless.

Soup, lots of soup. And make sure the vegetables are chopped into small pieces and cooked until soft. Chewing is going to be hell for a week, so food that you can simply swallow is the best.
Again I am aware that there was predatory lending, but to not inform yourself on a 600000 dollar decision, that seems like ignorance. Much of the problem was the banks giving out loans they know couldn't be payed back. The other portion was someone with an income of 4200 a month taking out a mortgage they could barely afford with a low interest rate, let alone after it spiked after 5 years. Don't place blame all on one party. Both were wrong.
Well they are wizards. You can't risk them showing up in 1000 years inside a lich's husk, their phylactery tucked safely away in another plane of existence, and cheating at card games.

Create my own narrative? I'm going by the narrative in the techraptor article. The very one in this post. And, actually, I have read the official announcement, and it contains nothing that contradicts this article.Could the article be wrong? Sure. If it turns out that it is, I will adjust my opinion. Until that happens, though, this is still a bad thing and I will discuss it as such.
Grim patron spawned its own archetype. Emperor T is practically broken. Blackwing tech is a 3 mana 3/5 and Corruptor is a 5 mana 5/4 deal 3 damage if you play enough dragons. But yea, you're probably right.

If it's a FWB situation, chances are you might not be his only "friend." The thing is with FWB is when you want some, or visa versa, you call them up. If, perhaps, this is his first FWB situation, then he might be shy asking for something so intimate. Therefore, call him up and maybe hint that you need a little something.

Yeah pretty much every gas water heater is more cost effective than any electric, hybrid or otherwise. If gas isnt an option, however, hybrid will beat out any standard electric and will pay itself off over it's lifetime, as long as the installation requirements are met.
I don't agree with that. Control is a larger player count, no team revives and self reviving. Playing solo isn't an issue. Have you watched the gameplay from the stream of ToO? Basically the only way back into the game is through your team reviving you which requires heaps of communication around where the enemy is that they might not be able to see etc. TL;DR ToO - communication is essentials. Normal Crucible, it's not.
Actually, that may work out better for you.  They said they couldn't price match because the purchase hadn't been charged on mine (Visa). If it had they would have credited to me.Instead she said I could either price match AFTER it ships, wait and hope they correct it at the time of shipping or cancel and reorder.I was afraid the price may go back up and I'd lose the $50 so I cancelled and reordered.

&gt;  revealed that Sweden was implementing a Feminist film grading system which, for as much as I can tell, is just seeing if a film passes the Bechdel Test and not much else.I agree that's badly applied.&gt; "this is a movie about a situation were mainly men were involved, and we are okay with this".A conundrum in a bunch of circles. Like where historical accuracy is a requirement. I mean do you include racist language that would have been common in history? Do you show black men as slaves?The only thing that I object to is when the "history" argument is applied to fantasy.
Edit: You can go fuck yourself. Moving such a thing upstairs is dangerous and could've broken or fucked-up your back. Have some friends, or at least acquaintances around to help.

I definitely like the designs, but they feel just a little plain to me. Feels like a random piece of clothing would really complete the N64 mascot feel they're going for. Boots for the lizard, some goggles for the bat, maybe a scarf or something. Still, I like them. They got the general feel just right. 
Precisely. And it's also easier to make statements like those you have, essentially poking, than it is to evaluate a different perspective. I have a midterm tomorrow, in lieu of responding to that enormous, semi-organized wall of text, I think I will study. Abdicating reddit for a while is probably a better use of my time than trying to calmly crusade against people who are wrong on the internet. Have a rad day though. 
Feel you. I love good coffee, and seeing people think that one needs some absurd concoction of fat/cream and sugar is what constitutes one is fucking infuriating. 
Overachieving demonstrates commitment, because overachieving takes *time*; however, commitment is not always demonstrated by overachieving.If you don't get that, I can't help you.

You'd be amazed the American beers you can find around Europe. Amsterdam gets Three Floyds pretty regularly. Last year Copenhagen Beer Celebration had Westbrook Mexican Cake, Parabola, Boneyard Hop Venom and Notorious, Surly Pentagram, Funky Buddha Passionfruit Berliner Weisse, *Double Barrel Hunahpu* and even *BAVDL*. Obviously that was a special occasion, but Western Europe and particularly Scandinavia are seeing really impressive American representation these days, thanks in large part to the relationships that exist between their breweries (especially Mikkeller) and ours.
NOOOOOOOOO :'(  Fuck you greedy record companies!!!! I bought your fucking albums after I discovered them on Grooveshark!! I'll never buy an album again after this!
He loves that spot. He can keep an eye on all the comings and goings in the neighborhood from that perch. He'll sleep there occasionally but his preferred nap spot is on an ottoman.Thanks again for all the kind words and upvotes!
A combination of AA/Smart Recovery, this site, counseling (I need A LOT).  I'm also blessed to have a married couple in my life who are closer to me than anyone I know and who will talk to me anytime I need them.  They are done with me if I start again, and I can't imagine my life without them.  We also recently lost a friend to alcohol-related suicide, and I was there to see their pain, and I can't do that to them, I just can't.  I also have a handful of people in recovery who are a phone call away.  Basically I plan on committing time to one of some of the above on a daily basis, and I plan on pledging to not drink each morning.  I'm also going to start exercising and exploring the old hobbies I had, like writing and playing my guitar.  I think most importantly, this episode taught me I want to live and be a better person, and this is the only way to do it.  
tie bombers with extra munitions greatly increases the amount of expendable firepower for it for only 2 points. whether or not they will be more viable in tournament play i have no idea but having a bomber with the potential for 4 assault missiles makes tie swarms seem extremely easy to deal with.
I get the feeling everyone's heart is in the right place, they are trying to do what they think is honoring the franchise, but are still messing it up anyway. :(
I watch it every year, this feels excruciatingly worse than normal.  Usually when the picks are in they cut their bullshit short and then pick up.  I don't remember the picks being made and ignored for 10 minutes so they can get in every segment.
There was a link a while back but apparently roundabouts are the new way to deal with an intersection that's a little weird otherwise. And it's also supposed to help with traffic flow. 
sunshine would be nice. we did it all winter up here in Canada some days were as cold as -40 with the windchill. the cold wasn't the worst part it was the wind, the last farm i did was 3 months long and it was right in the middle of a wind tunnel. we had some untorqued panels blow off in the wind a few times that shit would kill or cripple you if it hit you. i did a bit of work in the fall it wasnt so bad just the mud was unbearable mid shin at all times had to wear a rain suit.just curious but did you just sling panels? 
Been playing Destiny which has been my go to game for past couple months. One thing that sucks tho is House of Wolves Dlc comes out the same day as the Witcher 3. I'll be having my hands full all summer. My hype level is high for the witcher 3 and I have to agree, These 19 days are going to be long. I would recommend checking out the Metro Redux games or Bloodborne, good games to keep you until the Witcher.

As long as fruit and veggies is basically a garnish to venison bacon I think I'm ok. If you're in MN check out something called "Randy's candy" at Mannys downtown. Inch and a half inch thick bacon basted in a honey mix for 4 hours. 
Hmm not normal no. It's common to put a little surgicel in some high-risk extraction sites but it normally dissolves by itself.  Why don't you ask the dentist who put it in why it hasn't dissolved and why there is so much of it? 
its not about honor, its about scaring the enemy. For like 500 years after Rome was actually a threat no one dared to attack them except internal civil wars and then eventually the Huns
We as a society need to reexamine how we treat drug addiction.  To see it just as a moral failure and try to use incarceration as a way to prevent it hasn't worked.  I'd rather see people addicted but alive and functional than dead or jailed.

I cash in as soon as I have enough for a 5 buck card. Then around the 20th of each month I start to save up for the discounted 25 buck amazon card. Almost to 2200 Swagbucks. Planning on cashing out tomorrow, and when I get my card I'll be getting myself an iPad mini 2 from amazon and then I'll be saving up for a Hot Toys Captain America collectible figure. 
yes, and that is why they can shoot well beyond 500. It wasn't a problem, it was by design because for a trauma gun it doesn't matter if CO2 is hot or cold, if it shoots 450 or 550. It's purpose to fuck you up without killing you.
So far, i usually got 'nearly' decked out with constant soul charging but considering the fast pace of games with the strides, pretty much you don't even need to worry for deck-out as long as you consistently dish out some damage with the stride.
This is a jumbled mess of a post...You are cocky when you wrestle, and wanto to keep that heat IF you become a heel?  So does that mean you wrestle as a face?  Then you are probably doing it wrong.Be in character while you are performing, and not when you aren't, it's pretty simple really....
Like /u/10-13 alluded to, look at one of those posters with hundreds of names of "young black men killed by the police," Google their stories and you'll see the vast majority are, to reasonable people, clear cut shootings.
See, I'm kind of weird, I just don't notice graphics much ever. So naturally it doesn't even occur to me to consider things like that, but I know they matter to other people. It's a good thing you pointed it out, I don't mind. I know I get blinders to how other people might think of things.
In accordance with the customary law of the Huanca people of Peru, this can only be settled with a jaguar duel. Both your parents and your teacher must choose a jaguar champion; the jaguars will fight to the death. The losing party must pay compensation in seashells and will then be sacrificed in the name of Pachamama.
Mr. PM, Sir, making it illegal to criticize one country in this world is NUTS. Additionally, what is up with the way you keep appointing judges? NOT COOL. Finally, have you not observed what is happening to the USA with their PATRIOT ACT? Do not do that to us!Do better, please.  I cannot support this stuff with my votes.
Haha me too!! Just woke up and it's day 5. Falling asleep is a bit of a struggle it takes me like 2 hours but I'm getting there! One thing that sucks though is I have found that I'm excluding myself from almost every social gathering (I get invited to do something basically daily), this is because most of my friends are habitual smokers and the best way to not smoke is not have it in the house nor be around it :/ Any one got some advice?
/u/ADirtyFuckingLiar is being very truthful. 96 will be Korean built, and the pup upgrade is often all that you'll need to get the guitar sounding great. 57's are awesome in my opinion
Welp.  There it is.  I'm relieved all the speculation for what we've known for a bit now is all over.I'm happy Lovie and Licht made the pick.  I was half-scared Lovie might go on stage and announce that God is angry at Jameis so they're picking Mariota instead.But to be a cynic, we've never had a franchise QB, so I'm not expecting much.  It just doesn't feel like we *should*  have a franchise QB (it's legitimately difficult for me to imagine), and Jameis seems like a fairly high bust candidate.  And it makes me sick that those are my thoughts I just don't really expect anything from the Bucs at this point.I'll be delighted if he turns into anything near the potential he has though.  And hopefully that's what happens.  :)
You're absolutely right.  Studies using implicit bias tests show that minorities do harbor racist feelings, though perhaps not to the same extent as whites.The problem is that our society was built on white=good and black=bad.  It is something that people internalize very early on, even as children.If you're interested in reading more, I suggest looking up the doll study.

Another throw away episode.  So much potential with the moms.  Evidently we had to include the other cast members in some inane tripe.  I'm really disappointed with whats happened to this show.
Think you mean [this one](http://shirtoid.com/6506/the-madness-of-mission-6/), and in case you didn't know, it's supposed to be a reference to Pac Man.

We hit him in the 2nd inning.  We haven't really made any contact since.deGrom isn't giving up much, but Span had a just foul home run, Zimmerman's sac fly was almost out, and this inning led off with a warning track out.  I wouldn't say they're not hitting him at all, and he's already at 82 pitches.
Mike's comment was horrible, and it doesn't get a free pass. That said, it wasn't quite at the level some of the things others have said (misogynistic or otherwise). Also, he's been shown as a stand-up guy since then (see: last week's episode) while Rodney, Dan, etc. have continued their streak of being awful.
that happened to my dad in law school. He simply couldn't stay awake during Tax Law, and the teahcher passed him on the proviso that he never practice tax law. He ended the semester with a D--, the teacher actually went in and wrote the second "-" in by hand, as the printing system only did single minuses. 25ish years later, he is still not a tax lawyer.
I mean, it's kind of weird. When I'm driving for delivery, I'm getting payed to do it and it's in a fairly small area with easy roads and few unexpected frustrations. It's not as boring as sitting around in the restaurant waiting for tables to bus, and I can listen to music or NPR so I actually really enjoy my job.In pretty much every other context though, driving just feels like a really annoying chore. Plus I don't like being forced to stay sober when I go out to have fun just because I have to drive home at the end of the night. I can't wait until cars can drive themselves. 
no just idiotic.  Do you report every single crime you see? Do you try to intervene and make an arrest every time you see or hear about something illegal taking place? The police are employees of the government that are specifically tasked with enforcing the law and should be expected to do this in every single case of the matter, even if it involves fellow police officers. Regular everyday citizens, to a certain extent, are not.
Tbh I'm not really sure what the difference is lol. I think Ruby Woo is a bit more drying and it has the retromatte finish. But it also seems like the RR color is a bit deeper.

I know Malcolm said someone (can't remember who) asked him who Madeline was, and if it was an ex-girlfriend.Honestly, it's pretty obvious that Enil Edam is Madeline backwards, especially if you're staring at the name all day.
So don't fucking buy it. What part of this don't you get? The situation solves itself if what you say is true. I don't think you're right though. I think people will actually enjoy these and good for them and good for Riot for putting em out.
I read the whole article and all seemed normal until he used the word invite instead of increase one's risk. This man just used the wrong word. Read the article and tell me if I am crazy.
People who call us a dumpster fire that year ignore how much Noel was improving. We'd have made the tournament and maybe even the Sweet 16 with him healthy.
People said the same thing about Bryan Danielson. People said the same thing about CM Punk. People said the same thing about Cactus Jack. Sometimes, cream just rises. 
Ecoboost mustang.  It's underrated.  With just a tune they are pushing low 12s 1/4 miles.  I feel when the RS and the market has more time to innovate, these cars will become beasts .  I'm just not a fan of mustangs.  If I had another chance to but a car again, id still go with a ST though.  Until rs comes our and releases a price, no other car is as all around good as the st IMO. 
I never said that being rich doesn't make problems easier or that having more resources at your disposal isn't useful. As I mentioned in my first sentence of paragraph 2. However I think you have literally provided me with the perfect example of my point. Money didn't make your life awesome as you stated with your dysfunctional family problems. Sure you can more comfortably aleviate those problems with money, but it doesn't mean that because you have that money you are happy or doing perfectly awesome with your life. This is my point and that alone. All the other bizzare stances of how money is helpful (like if your poor and have no money types of scenarios) are not relevent. I'm literally saying just because you have racks of cash doesn't mean your life is good.So now let me quote your demeanor in my conclusion&gt; Think about that. Let it sink in. Now you still think your point is valid??Hopefully your money can get you some closer reading skills.
For a while, I had similar occasional dreams about a friend/ex of mine who died—for the first couple of years after he passed the dreams were always sad and occasionally scary. But for the past year or so, whenever I dream about him (once every few months or so) it's usually been a nice dream where we just get to talk and be together and I usually wake up feeling both happy and sad. I like to think he's watching over me, and forgives me for not being the greatest friend the last few years of his life. =\
People laugh when I bought the Wave parts separator. But it's so goddamn handy.Or if you got one of those furoku grade models, I know the 00 series has one, they have a part separator in them. Same thing with the Mega Size models.
&gt; No one is shifting goalposts, you're just saying humans should never eat meat or use any products made from animalsWoooow, what a gigantic leap in logic. From my standpoint on we need to stop subsidizing factory farms to suddenly now nobody is allowed to use or eat meat at all? What the hell are you smoking and where can I get some?&gt;Wut?It's called a typo. Replace "is" with "if", it's really not that confusing if you actually think.
OP didn't ask anyone to judge the love of Subway. I, too, wish I could recreate my favorite Subway sandwich at home. Realistically, I don't want sandwiches often enough to use the veggies before they go bad, so I continue to succumb. 
That's very true. And I have seen people with thousands on their accounts get banned, those are the most satisfying for me. I just hope they keep updating these cheat detections. They're definitely on the right track!
Ya I changed my mind on that, after looking at the actual programs. If one is a Bachelor of Music, and the other is a Bachelor of **Science**, then your job prospects are actually way different. I would be willing to take the debt on for the Bachelor of Science, which is what UM offers. Go with UM if it's a B.S.
I tend towards going for best price:performance.  But, as someone who has his machine running 24/7 unless AMD can take some major strides in power consumption compared to their current offerings it just isn't an option.
The debates work in a way similar to what you did, but I would suggest adding more length. There are counter arguments and long speeches in each of them.
My dad had one of these, as well as the Dycam Model 1. I remember playing with the Dycam and never being able to get anything close to a decent picture out of It, just strange black and white blurs with super high contrast. Then one day he brought th Mavica home. Holy shit. It seemed so futuristic. I was awestruck. You could snap shots with this thing, pop the 3.5" into the drive, and BOOM, fucking pictures on the computer. I think that was my first glimpse of the idea that technology would revolutionize the world we live in, and that there was more to computers than video games. While that camera is laughable compared to modern standards, it will always hold a special place in my memory for the glimpse it gave of the bigger picture of the world to come.

For edges I use a fabric adhesive I found in the glue section of Jo-Ann's ([Aleene's Stop Fraying](http://www.amazon.com/Aleenes-15629-Stop-Fraying-4oz/dp/B00114RDVI)). I trail a little bit around the edges, and it dries clear fairly quickly. You don't need a lot, so it only takes up 1-2 squares per edge on your Aida. I've also used masking tape, but it usually leaves a residue on my fabric.

Honestly, CC and time warner have good service/speeds, it's just their price thats shitty. They really gouge for their expenses, especially if they layer data caps on top of that.
http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/scions-cycles-redux/That's my preferred list. I have an older one (just "Scion's Cycles") that included all 5 from a cycle. I really like scion because you can tutor out dragons, and it just so happens that the best dragons are also in symmetrical cycles. There are a lot of cycles in that list, and the other cards in them are worth looking at. I know someone linked the list of cycles through m10, which was one of my resources while building. Hope this helps!If you want to do gods instead of dragons, Karona is pretty good.

Yes, because TV writers are infallible. Are you saying that the characters are exactly the same as Martin's or that the ending can't possibly be affected by the characters being different?
i would definitely go back and watch from the beginning. there was a huge controversy over one of the early episodes where the typical comments were things like:* WTF UNSUB* why would you do that? you were off to a good start, but i'm not watching anymore unless you undo what you did.* wow, i can't believe that happened. * WTF UNSUB* Zisteau just ruined his own series and he's only X episodes in.* WTF UNSUB

It's my understanding that the way Cacique does their sizing, it goes DDD, then F. In US sizing, DDD = UK E, so F being Cacique's next cup size is theoretically equivalent to the UK F. Thus, if you're confident about the fit of your Cacique size you would be a 38F in UK size too, allowing for differences in different models. You can look up the measurements of bras that interest you on Bratabase.
This has been discussed quite a bit over the last week and a half. There is one side that believes that since it is dialogue from Return of the Jedi, it doesn't mean anything in this context. It's what he says in RotJ, it's what he says in the trailer. I would argue, however, that there is plenty of dialogue in the Star Wars saga that they could use, and Mark Hamill is a super talented voice actor, the use of that particular dialogue has some meaning. I'd like to think that Luke is still in communication with Anakin's spirit. Only 231 days until we find out for sure.
Show Jorah is a better all around person than book jorah, initially because the actor was just that good, and then they started writing toward that character.
Yeah, but what KIND of misbehavior his mom wouldn't consider a "bannable" offense is what interested me - I have no idea of the answer to that question... so I asked.  If I don't know the answer to that question, asking seems reasonable to me.
This is pretty much how I've understood it as well -- when there first began a massive influx of American/UK women ordering from EM, there was no real warning around that the bras ran wicked tight, and that you should size up 1-2 bands from your UK size. Eventually word got out about the bands running small, and it was really common practice up until recently to suggest sizing up a band or two for women wanting to try Ewa for the first time. I have to say that I've purchased over half the bras she put out in 2014 (I feel guilty admitting that, lol. A good portion of them were re-homed!), and I find most of them to run TTS.
Funnily enough, I took it in primary school. My teacher was the mother of a few of my schoolmates. All she ever taught us, though, was numbers and days of the week.Btw, I'm in Australia.
They were so peaceful they didn't even need the wheel or written language, one finger across the throat was enough for them. The universal sign for peace my friend. 
I kind of wish they had a few submarines loaded with torpedos.  They're based in the Netherlands by the way so it would be the Dutch government that has to look the other way. 
I'm a sucker for blue diamond habanero barbeque almonds. I portion them out into 1oz servings and snack on those.Other nuts are great too. Such as macadamias.I keep cheese sticks in the fridge at work as well! 
You summed up my thoughts about the vets. I totally felt that with this "veteran" mentality that they just went out there and did what they were known for instead of really pushing themselves. Our team needs to be like 65% young dudes and 35% vets instead of like 80% vet and 20% young.
Goodell really is arrogant. His only purpose tonight is to stand there, smile and announce picks. There's only 10 minutes in between each pick, he can stand behind a curtain waiting. He has his own minions who can coach specific players to do whatever. Screw Goodell
I once had a professor in culinary school draw a cock and balls on the board when showing how to use cucumbers as a garnish.  The whole class quietly giggled but he was older and didn't pick up on it. Near the end of his drawing and explanation he cut the end off the cucumber/dick and half the class groaned and the other half laughed outright. The professor stopped and looked as the drawing for a second and then he laughed too.

Great photo! Maybe this is a silly question but I've often noticed the majority of craters seem to be circular in shape. Why aren't craters sometimes elliptical given that at least some impacts must be at a glancing angle.
Ultimate frisbee is no in anyway shape or form enough of a workout for you lower body. You said you can run full sprint as fast as your buddy whom squats everyday. I think that is just great.With that said I have the perfect experiment for you. Do squats at a perfectly reasonable weight tomorrow morning.Then challenge your buddy to a sprint the very next morning. I guarantee you that you will have a great time.
Honestly, it comes down to trust. If you want to be in a relationship with her, you need to be able to trust that she can go to these parties and nothing will happen. If she wants to go to the parties anyway despite knowing how you feel about them, that probably tells you something about how she prioritizes the relationship.
&gt; just like some CongressmenWith the difference being that Iran is not a democracy and Supreme Leader is also a coomander of all of their military, especially Revolutionary Guards
They are weight I will never use. I would rather have a 2 door with a huge trunk than a 2 door 5 seater.I commute 80-90 minutes on some very technical mountain roads, any weight saved will be nice. 
Most bonuses and stock grants I've seen are a percentage of salary so they grow with each other until you get a promotion, when the percentages may change again.
Ugh, I hate that Prime Directive crap so much.  Yeah, what great achievements and contributions to galactic society dead people make.  What amazing pieces of art and technology.
Totally Topical Tivo Trivia Time Today is my favorite bit, but unfortunately, since Doug Benson doesn't come on anymore, it seems like they won't ever play it again.My least favorite has to be Hobo Power. No one ever scores above a 35, even though the scale is 1-to-100. I don't get what Adam is expecting. They are also disgusting and most likely fake.
In a subreddit filled with depressing topics about riots, corruption, etc. It is always nice to have a story about an old man punching a bear in the face.
&gt; requires a balaced 9v chargerNo. It *contains* a 9v balance charger, and requires a 1-2amp 9v power supply.[Link to Yihi board specs](http://www.varitube.com/YiHi-9V-Balancing-Charger-Board_p_179.html)iirc, the IPV4 docs say 2A, but the board specs say 1A, and the charge rates indicate that 1A would work, although getting a 2A power supply would be playing it safe.
More than 1% of people in north america believe that. Probably more than 5% of the world still believes that if you include extremely religious people of certain affiliations and poor people with no education. Chances are there are people you know/have met that believe that.But they wouldn't say ''revolves'' they would say spins.
Which is why I said there would be two was of donating. You are absolutely correct on your end. So I will have direct links to those charities. And if anyone donates toward me to get the whole twitch alerts notification I will be putting that money toward the charity as well. I will donate all the money on stream so everyone knows I am not a scam.
I wake up and every single person has disappeared.I walk through the streets, I hear animals trapped in their empty apartments and houses... I end up trying to take care of all of them but watch them all die.Worst dream ever, been having it since I was 6.
It's weird, I've always been very pro death penalty for certain crimes but as I'm growing closer to God it saddens me more. I think I'm starting to lean in the other direction.This article broke my heart man, he didn't kill or rape anyone so I just don't understand.
The very fact that you mentioned "captions" had me hopeful for a fleeting moment. Then I realized you were just talking about something other than CC... :(
The patch has been out all of a few hours, 10 million people play this game and I'll bet you a majority of them don't read the patch notes, what do you expect? That Sniper never gets picked again? He'll still get played a ton in low level pubs where he already destroyed before the buffs in 6.83. 
Another, hopefully related question. Why is it that we cannot create a box, fully reflective on the inside, capable of bouncing back light indefinitely?Imagine a box lined with mirrors and a source of light on the inside, which is turned on for just a second and then shut down.
Well you could also add time pressure to a TBS game. Just cap the turn limit so that as you increase in blob size the game becomes more difficult to manage. Its both interesting game play and a real life factor that limited empires.
Thanks for the feedback. The highest resolution I could find in the nvidia settings drop down was 1920x1080 and the xrandr command gave me a "cannot find mode 2560x1080" response. No dice so far, but I definitely appreciate the help.
A more likely scenario for early interstellar travel is that it will be a one way trip. If you do plan on returning you could analyze your surroundings to determine your position relative to the solar system. 
Hornqvist was playing with a broken rib. He still played fucking awesome, though, because he's not human but rather a ball of pure hockey energy and determination. So basically 3/5 of the core JR named was injured. Sid and Flower did all they could. 
I have been irrationally angered by Suits and there unwillingness to show the whisky they are drinking.I know that Macallan got a foot hold in America by promoting their whisky with stars. Community and Joel Mchale where friends with Macallan on twitter.
Nope, even if it causes damage. In fact, sometimes damage is the *aim* of satire. Libel is false statements *that a reasonable person would perceive to be true* and cause damage. Satire is statements that no reasonable person would think are true."My neighbor fucks children and stomps on kittens, chortling."  No one thinks that's true."My neighbor fudges his taxes a little bit sometimes."  That's totally believable.
I was thinking that he knew about Dan's advantage, but then I was trying to figure out how he learned that info as he doesn't really chat with Tyler/Carolyn... and I doubt Dan would have told him. 
Very good point. I know when I've seen a story about some white guys committing a heinous crime, upon hearing they were very poor I immediately jumped down to blaming it on their economic level. If they were mentally unstable I saw that as a reflection of all people with mental disorders or issues. It's such an unconscious process, humans are built to thinking very differently about people who are different than them.
I tried to explain that to people but most people don't understand. I'm fortunate in a sense that I live alone because I make sure I keep no junk food in the house
Frankly, I feel that "unplugging" means exactly losing your delusions about society, especially the ideals imprinted on us by vested interests like Disney. If you still feel that way - that things "should be" some other way - then you haven't unplugged.
Some are.  Some of us struggle along.  Some guys are really good at it, too, although most choose to steer clear of emotional stuff even if they know how to handle it.I am not very talented at the social stuff, but I've improved over the years with practice and observation.  Every time I notice a particularly deft social interaction, I stop to work through the "math" myself to see why it worked so well and how the other person knew what to do.  You can do the same.  Knowing that there is room for improvement is step one.
She sounds like a toxic person, and her keeping from your bank account is illegal. If it's in your name, you just need to go to the bank with ID and withdraw the money and put it in an account she doesn't have access to.
It's actually not photoshopped. I thought so too. The cat does this all the time apparently. If you look at the tail you can see it's not photoshopped in.
If you think about it it's actually pretty impressive and rare to press the button right when it hits 60 because nobody has any idea when that is going to happen. 
The technology of your childhood was replaced with better technology? Better whine and shitpost about how nostalgic you are and how nothing will ever be as good.
Wood will work for herbs and soft spices but odors will linger.  Granite handles everything and cleans up nice.  A heavy pestle also means less pounding, thus fewer flying peppercorns.
Nahhh Naaaa naahaa nahh, I can't you over the fact that your students are growing up to be more proficient English speakers than Dutch, due to the linguistic mastery English has over the world.
No its racist to target property based upon the race of the owner regardless of whether you are targeting them for protection or looting. When I say protect them all you protect them as much as you do other properties. You clearly can't protect all property but if you let race be a deciding factor it is racist. 
I'm a big RoosterTeeth fan. The only other Twitch I follow is Grifballhub (although I don't actually play the game). I'm a big pokemon fan, and I've been meaning to get a 3ds so I can play all generation in hard copies ( meaning non-emulated, although I do use an emulator at the moment).
I just had this dicussion with my 15 yo daughter. Wanted to get her thoughts after reading some stories about TransG kids in different schools. She said she doesn't care at all. The bathrooms all have stalls, so who cares? The locker room is a different story, but she thought the person could use the 'handicapped' shower where there is a curtain, so no one would have to see a dingaling. I personally think that the major issue is women are brought up to be so modest, and it can be a challenge to realize when someone is a perv or legit Trans. True pervs (especially teen boys) would go to great lengths to see some teen TnA in the locker room. 
Alright, so I'm a very hard worker and can sit focused and get a lot of work done quickly, like looking at raw data. Can hold my own but not the most social person. Analyst?
I loved Pearl's redesign from the start, and I think Garnet and Amethyst's are alright so far. I think it just takes a bit of getting used to, but these are definitely redesigns meant to be seen after a fair amount of character development.(Their original designs were meant to telegraph their personalities and introduce people to the characters easily, it seems like. These new ones are just cute outfits that'll look nice long-term.)
It wouldn't be too hard for them to allow users to set their own, but stylish and/greasemonkey are special suited to do this. Arguably, RES is already pretty bloated and could be replaced with a simpler greasemonkey script.

Champ or colcannon. So mashed potatoes w/ either chopped green onions or kale, swimming in butter.Or I carve a potato into a shot glass and drink whiskey out of it.
When did we pass an amendment which held that government employees have a constitutional right to be incentivized to break the law? Because I must have missed it.Further I missed when government organizations were barred from firing anyone unless that person was successfully convicted of committing a felony. There is probable cause that these people broke the law, that's good enough to fire someone, there is no requirement to be able to defend yourself prior to your firing. The municipality can simply hold that there is nothing the person can say to defend themselves of the alleged breach of conduct and that their employment is terminated.

&gt; Baylor played Kansas State last yearThis actually fits my point very well.  That was just about the best matchup you could have asked for in that week and it still wasn't enough of a bump to put Baylor in.This is exactly why I'm a proponent of the Big12 title game. If all of the games had been moved back a week and Baylor played KState for a second time, that would have given them a bigger bump.It also would have helped their strength of schedule by adding another quality opponent, even if they had already played once. 
Oh shit I could totally see that happening. Let's see, she disappeared 'weeks' after the funeral. So they could say that she found out she was pregnant the day she left and freaked out and ran away.
The problem is that when your entire argument relies entirely on the skill level of sheep, SHEEP for gods sake. I mean seriously if sheep is the missing link that separates your team from victory or humiliating failure, then no you are not a good team.
If a duplicate, then I'd hit the gym with myself, do a full routine, and correct whatever errors we find in my form. Repeat every Tuesday.Then GAINZ!!!!!Also, it would be fun to introduce him to everyone as my twin, &amp; make jokes the whole while. Workout, pick up dudes.
Own that shit!    If you can stay "normal" for any amount of time, you might just find her that grooves on you!   Keep all that bullshit self effacing shit to yourself always and Own yourself! !
I've been slacking like crazy on anime this past month. I've been watching Gintama but haven't watched a single episode in almost three weeks. I started Durarara!! about a week ago yet haven't touched it since then.I don't know what my dealio is.
I downloaded a huge collection of anime vector wallpapers [like this](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/127/f/d/saber___fate_stay_night_minimal_wallpaper_by_micah_halter-d7hjim4.png). I just have them rotating every 30 minutes. Pretty minimalistic and don't think a non-anime watcher would think much about it.
This is just the plan to plan the planning of the plan to plan the plan to get the public involved in the plan to plan the plan for public planned involvement in 2016.No wonder it take so long to get a project completed! How about we cut out some of the planning to plan plans and actually DO something.

This part?&gt; Expanded Office add-in capabilities—With Excel for iPad support for add-ins, developers can reach over 100M additional Office users. Word and PowerPoint for iPad are coming soon.Sure seems like it. I bet there won't be universal support, it's already pretty limited. I only use it to pull up sheets in meetings, doing any editing on an ipad is torture. The interface is just bad for working with spreadsheets no matter the app.
I haven't gotten mine yet, but I've seen some unboxings so I know what's coming. The s/p shakers are cute and even though I won't end up using them (I use grinders) I'll still put them up somewhere. I'm sure I'll dig the CD. The shirt on the other hand, while I am a fan of KH, I never really wanted a shirt for it so I'm pretty meh about that. I love that treasure chest dangler, but I'm not the least bit excited or interested in the magazine or the skylander. Figures my first month on would be a little underwhelming.6/10EDIT: After finally receiving my arcade block yesterday, I'm dropping my rating to a 5/10 just for the shipping issues. Still love the shakers and the dangler, diggin the CD, still meh about the shirt and magazine, but at least the Skylander I got was some kind of partially robotic dragon (Drobot), so that turned out better than expected. Looking forward to May's block and hoping that since the 25th is a monday this time around, shipping won't get so screwed up.
&gt;Edit: A lot of you fine gentleman are probably wondering "app? pornhub has an app? This sounds difficult and complicated to install." yeah they do (or so I've heard). Go to the mobile site, click the three orange bars in the top left-hand corner and at the top of the drop down you will see a link for the download (not that I would know).&gt; &gt;Android users: go into your phone's settings, select "security (or equivalent)" and enable "Install apps from unknown sources." Go back and download the APK. Happy Fapping! If you want to rename the app use your launcher, or a file explorer and if you are rooted you can change the icon itself  (Nova Launcher is what i used). If you wanna change the icon you can use a file explorer with an archive viewer (FX is what i used), open the apk, and replace the file "Pornhub_2.4.2.apk/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png" with something else.&gt;&gt;iPhone: You will need to Jailbreak your phone if you want any non-appstore app (lel).&gt;
Don't look at it that way! Maybe your comic primarily attracts readers with integrity and a conscience. Would Bill Watterson be disappointed if nobody made those idiotic truck window decals of Calvin pissing?
Sorry, what I meant was, the platypuses alive today never evolved.  Their genetic counterparts split off from them and became new species, but the platypus alive today have been the same for millions of years.  The environment those particular platypus are in was perfect for them, and they thrived there without having to change.
You guys just going to start your own FC? I would be willing to transfer to Hyperian in a week or two, as I'll have to transfer both mine &amp; my husbands characters. I will more then likely be playing a healer class, and him a ninja or monk. Just keep me updated on what's going on, it would be cool to have some friends going into this new expansion. 
The article isn't great, but if you listen to David's story you'll find that is entirely the fault of the newspaper. David makes no personal claims about being "cured" (I saw him speak tonight) - that is just tabloid sensationalism. He has a much more subtle view of the whole situation (a view which doesn't include miracle "cures", or even the word "cure" at all), from what I can gather.
In my opinion, people that deny having biases are just hiding them, and reviewers that try to manually remove their own biases end up with reviews that are more boring and emotionless. I like his reviews, even though I know there's whole genres of games we'd never see eye-to-eye on. 
Did you have custom cushions made? My jet has a chaise lounge near the bar and while it LOOKED good, I found it unbearable to lay on for more than 16 hours at a time. I had to bring it down in Qatar (can you imagine?!) and got my chef to find someone to make some modifications and reupholster it in a nearby village. It's far from perfect, the peacock feather and cashmere stuffing they filled the cushion with will need replacing before summer, but it's much better now than whatever garbage they put in it at Boeing. I should have listened to my friend and gotten a Bombardier Global Express. 
I had a guy pay me $40 to write 2 lines of code because he didn't know how to do it. Mutator and an accessor in java.&gt;int getScore() { return score; }&gt;setScore(int s) { score = s; }However doesn't beat OPs guy of not knowing how to set a variable. To my guys defense he was majoring in Mathematics and not compSci
I agree. I had my tissues ready, cuddly warm blanket and my childhood teddy bear all ready to grieve and come to terms with this. Still a lot of time left to the episode though, who knows what shonda has planned. 
I... Really don't think coffee is on the same level as sex. Ask /r/deadbedrooms.I've already been a month without sex because of surgery. :( I feel castrated and depressed. I really want this to be over very soon. I miss being a sexual creature.I'm going to try switching pills and giving it some time. I just hate that this problem has taken everything from me and my partner.

I stopped spending money on Lol when they screwed me and my legacy skins  :(I was an addict, too. Every paycheck I'd make sure to put some rp on with the goal of having 1 skin per champ. Good skins, too. Never again Riot. Path of Exile gets most of my cosmetic money now.
Is that the date you preordered?If so then it makes perfect sense. It is saying the item is on hold for you until it releases from 4/3(your preorder date).
It does for a while, until the next blow. But that's life, I guess. It's not easy. Sometimes we are meant to learn the hard lessons. Sometimes we get a break. Mostly in my life, for the past ten years, I've been suffering terribly. So it has not gotten much better for me, but I'm still here... Hoping. Hanging on. 
It was a bit freaky when it happened, odd the 2nd time and 3rd time fun but at 20.00 for 50 rounds 2 round burst is not worth it lol. I will have to take it apart and see what is going on and worst case get a new fire control group for it. Thanks for the link.

Sadly most of his story is in Paragon Lost. Something I never herd of until about 3 months ago. After seeing it I finally "got" james, I still think he is an idiot... but he is also a Bro.
I mean even the football associations of both countries have the word FOOTBALL in them. It's nothing at all like "Major League Soccer". I duno what the guy above is smoking. 
While this is supporting evidence, the post doesn't say that the game mechanics make it impossible. Making legacy items out of items that have variable mod rolls modified is a GGG policy, not a technical limitation. GGG could easily write a script to go through each item and scale the rerolled mod appropriately. They just don't think that additional downtime and disappointed players would be worth it.
It's actually not, if you use blink strike on a regular basis. Just depends on your build. Personally I roll heavy INT, but I know a couple others who are equally fanatic about DISC and STR, respectively.
honestly the pictures do nothing. sure the shaders are nice but I want to see more of the actual BUILD, not just what your comp can handle in terms of looks.
Ask him what spring is in the gun, because 75 feet is pretty terrible for a field gun. You should take a look at the hop assembly, clean the barrel and hop unit, and check if there is actually a nub in the hop arm
Finishing Nichijou here too! (Well, I'm actually halfway there, but it won't take my much to finish it now that I have 4 days of free time). High five~
I'm not a teacher but I do remember there being a big issue in the 9th grade where a teacher called a black female student wearing a head wrap "Aunt Jemima" to her face.
Because China obeys *zero* international laws, which is commonly known and proven. If you haven't seen that yet you live in a bubble.I take serious issues with many countries, as many Western as not, but China.... Wow.... One of the countries with the least sense of honor of *any* nation on the planet.
My girl didn't hesitate to eat. I fed Monday with my sling, just to see if she would. (Got her Thursday)  I know Dubias are bad about burrowing so I removed legs and stuck it on its back. The mount of substrate she built up and rings the top of her burrow is layered thick with web. The texture is almost like cotton- the roach couldn't get away. Left it alone for about 30 minutes- roach was gone- three hours later the bolus was kicked beyond her wall. 
Interesting. I tend to think that everyone faces reincarnation in the long-run, but that there is an intermediate period in which they can pursue whichever afterlife they may be drawn to, whether it's haunting the Earth, entering the halls of their gods or their ancestors, or maybe even exploring oblivion.

I was in the second grade, the male teacher made constant sexual innuendos about us girls. This bred a really weird atmosphere amongst the kids.  I remember some of the male students looking over the stalls when we would use the bathroom. The teacher made me feel really ashamed when I told him about it. Looking back on it as an adult, I'm pretty he was grooming us.

I want to work for Marvel.This requires a popular indie comic.This requires good art.I lack such skills.Therefore, I must get an artist to work with.Good artist are usually busy and not willing to take a leap of faith with a no-name wannabe.Therefore, my purpose in life is to get enough renown on teh interwebz to be able to get a good artist, who then helps make a good (web?)comic, get popular enough for Marvel to notice, and hope they like.
Just finished listening. Very well made pilot episode. I'll definitely be listening to future episodes since it seems like I have similar taste in streetwear items. Keep up the good work!
I think I stopped just before the last patch, and have kept on an eye on reddit also my only assumption was about cheats, and that's a pretty solid assumption. The friend who still plays also keeps me informed. Last time I was talking to him and was thinking about logging in he was certain one of our bases was being raided by ESPers, and I trust his assessment. The problem with ESPers they're always a click away from some other BS cheat. So ya, no thanks, and GG I guess.
if you're even considering taking the fall i think it's not for you. these routes are just bolted for the mistakes and improbabilities of life in such that not everyone has to commit to life vs. death and the "hardest" sections of the climb. but trust that you **can die** on a runout slab.

He also wrote, directed, and starred in a movie called ***The Apostle*** which was quite good.  (The same's true of ***Angelo My Love*** and ***Assassination Tango***, but I haven't seen either of those.)
They don't. It is only the religious people that claim that science claim that it is the ultimate truth. Scientists never claims that.And science can't be the ultimate truth because they use models. And models are simplified versions of reality to make it easier to predict how a chemical or space craft will react. E.g. Newtons model and Einsteins model don't contradict each other. They complete each other. Newtons model is less accurate than Einsteins models but it is way easier to calculate and gets the job done for most space crafts. That is why it is used, Einsteins models would take supercomputers and too much time to calculate the space craft orbit. 
Yeah, how ridiculous was that? Lily can't connect with her actual children, but she somehow has enough maternal instinct to take pity on a pregnant woman?? HUH?

ActBlue is totally legit. Look them up on the FEC. They are by far the largest source of funds for progressive candidates. And if you go to Bernie's website to donate, you'll see that he's linking directly to ActBlue. Let's help him become the next president of the United States!
Finland has long standing ties to Russia and is linguistically and culturally tied to the nation. If they had've lost the winter war they'd be clumped in with Estonia as soviet spoils, and known as eastern europe. I'm not attempting to sidetrack you by any means. 
If someone's willing to learn a new language, cross an ocean, bust their ass, *and* take a smaller paycheck than you, then they deserve that job and you do not.
This is really hilarious.What are the two TTS voices being used from acapela-group?I think I figured one of them out as "WillBadGuy", but the other more derpy one I have no clue.Took me a while to realize these weren't real people reading them out.
Yeah, I found those about an hour ago.  Three, I think.  One of them just has a codex entry and some weird shit in it that one of your characters will comment on. I made the mistake of buying every weapon, upgrade, and armor blueprint the dwarf merchant had instead of just the Tier 2 stuff.  With all the chests around town, I should be able to make up for such a stupid mistake in short order by farming gold.  I know it's a dirty exploit, but I don't want to get somewhere with some sweet-ass loot and not be able to afford it because I had a brain fart. Also, I wasted an Inquisition point on Rare stocks, thinking that merchants would have better shit, but all I got was 10 each of a bunch of Tier 1 crafting items.  I was not a happy camper. 
Don't break the mirror. Have you ever heard about leaving the genie in the bottle? It's pretty much it, the mirror might be restraining it and you might release the thing by breaking it.
Opps, meant to say "entry into pc gaming" since it could max out a ton of games and will help them ease into pc gaming. Been spending too much time on pc part picker. But anyway, I think $600-800 is the sweet spot for price:performance when it comes to a gaming pc, especially since the OP wants to play Witcher 3. That's not to say you can't build a good pc for $450-550, hell a $300 used parts pc can hold it's own pretty well.
To be fair, there's a difference between perfectly safe, albeit possibly bland food kept in a freezer and meat stored outside in the open air for 2 years that's covered in old crusty mold and the remnants of insect activity.    However once I saw that the inside was perfectly fine.   I did share some with another neighbor who has kids and at least one of the kids liked it.   That kid will eat things even I am sqeamish about though.
No, you are simply wrong - if someone on my team grabs that point, and the other team is smart, that point will forever remain ours even when we don't want it any more, and thus the game is fucked.  Go back to gaystation.  I play on multiple xbox accounts, too.  We both have better things to do than argue on the internet, and it's my group, so I get to decide who I want and don't want on my team.  Also, 9/10 times I make this post, we win 19 out of 20 games
Two things: I've met plenty of non-self respecting humans, and also PLENTY that don't think before they open their mouths.So, usual percentage chance of "That happened", but it's certainly within the realm of reason. 
Totally depends on the circumstances of the situation. If a stranger grabs someone off the street and rapes them, yeah, that's an abnormal, psychopathic person. But with the definition of rape being what it is, the lines are much more grey. Plenty of "normal" people have committed rape, just like plenty of "normal" people have committed murder. It's not just psychos that are raping and killing people - it's "normal" people too, and that's what's scary.
many times I actually can't stay. I'm always friendly and helpful, but most gigs I have to duck out. With that being said, I usually don't play the stacked band shows much anymore. 
I can't upvote this enough. I feel if it should be a criminal offense if you falsify rape accusations. In fact, I think they should suffer the same consequences the accused were to face. That's justice.
omg.  i wnna go there.omg.  the glass city ive been dreaming for solid months about ?do you like japandroids? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zblsh5LpzBo
So you blame the crimes of a select group of people on all Muslims? The Catholic church, and even the Salvation army all abused children in the hundreds, if not thousands. Yet I don't call for the deportation of all Catholics.
another thing, I've been nova. this is so not true, it's just wishful thinking. novas don't usually have up to standard gamesense and DEFINITELY do not have good aim. if they had either, they would be out of nova. Try to get better instead of saying "oh I have gamesense but bad aim" or "oh I have good aim and has gamsense" because the contrary evidence is your rank.I don't mean to be condescending but I used to think this way and it didn't get me anywhere.
Darts always stack, applying multiple armor repairs and extending the heal duration (not amount per second).Armor repair may seem useless, but wait until you get vaccinate (lv20). That gives 4% armor per heal, or 6% if you also use armament. You can repair more armor than you lose from trash zeds.
Can you help me find any kind of technical notes or anything about "fake" double escapements? I'm actually curious how a second escapement can be added as a decorative complication without adding any actual mechanical benefit - is it riding on a clutch or something?
All well and good to think that, but according to the law, someone "under the influence of alcohol" is incapable of giving consent. Sooo a drunk tryst can quickly become rape charges if your partner decides retroactively that you raped him or her -regardless of how drunk the people involved were.
Here's 25.2505-2T(a)(3):&gt;Identity of last deceased spouse unchanged by subsequent marriage or divorce. A decedent is the last deceased spouse (as defined in §20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter) of a surviving spouse even if, on the date of the surviving spouse’s taxable gift, the surviving spouse is married to another (then-living) individual. If a surviving spouse marries again and that marriage ends in divorce or an annulment, the subsequent death of the divorced spouse does not end the status of the prior deceased spouse as the last deceased spouse of the surviving spouse. The divorced spouse, not being married to the surviving spouse at death, is not the last deceased spouse as that term is defined in §20.2010-1T(d)(5) of this chapter.Maybe I misunderstood your question, but Spouse-1 dies, ya get their DSUE and get to use it until Spouse-2 kicks the bucket, at which point Spouse-1 DSUE is eliminated since now Spouse-2 is the last deceased spouse.
Holy shit, I just realised NIS America released the uncut Animax version of the Cardcaptor Sakura dub from seven years ago last year!And Crunchyroll can't friggin show it in the UK. Fuck.
&gt;How did you know they were German Roaches?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_cockroachThey have a very distinctive look and size from asian and american roaches. They multiply like crazy, and when an actual infestation is in a home they are in every nook and cranny.
Just to share.I went to my grandmother's funeral 39 years ago and I can remember not understanding what all the fuss was about. We had been very close; she taught me to play cards when I was quite young and we would spend hours playing canasta, while she chain smoked cigarettes and drank cold coffee (not iced coffee but black coffee that was room temperature). At that time aspergers was not on anyone's radar and even autism was not a term used by the general public. For decades I wondered why my reaction was so different from everyone else's and now I know I was not a bad grandchild I was simply different from the rest of my family. Over the years I have experienced more losses and some have affected me more than others but none to the extent that NTs seem to be affected. You are not broken, nor are you alone. You are unique. 
If I remember correctly, they actually thought they would give him fake ears and paint whiskers on them. If I also remember correctly, I really enjoyed the beer I drank after reading those comments.
Well your internal organs can give out and die while you're still alive, is it possible that this could happen with large patches of skin? Not just on the surface like most dead skin, but down to the meat?

I lose a lot of time because I live in the dorm (people are pretty loud and I can't get a single.)Hence, I only get to sleep for 6 hrs or less. That why I am getting an apartment. The difference between a dorm and an apartment is only 12K per year, so I think I can pay it by part time jobs and savings. 
I always figured he was like Solid Snake, except he disguises himself as a truck rather than a cardboard box — which is a lot more practical for moving about when you're in disguise.
I don't even know what to do at this point! It was right before work so I didn't have time to ice it like I'm seeing all over the internet....I threw on cover up (that didn't help at all) and it's still burning 10 hours later.
I used to work at taco bell for about two years and the employees are always getting yelled at if they don't put the right amount which is two scoops or one. It's not always the employees fault. 
Well, actually not. For something to be a theory, it has to be testable or measurable. It must be an objective* phenomenon.That isn't to say that a scientific theory can't be proven incorrect, however it does mean that they have evidence to back up what they're saying. God, Dieties and most "mythic" elements of any religion are, but their own nature, a subjective phenomenon. As such they cannot possibly be measured. That's not to say that God or another religions primary diety isn't sitting in a literal Heaven, or whatever one might believe.The important part is His (or Her, or Its) existence cannot be measured in any way. So, it's inaccurate to say "a theory of God." Theories, by definition, are proven fact until proven otherwise. Rather it would be better to say "a hypothesis of God."
I do not know her at all and have no ties to her or anyone she knows.  He has an important job that requires site surveying. If I was snooping I would have gone through his phone without asking. I did not have any intention of snooping which is why I asked him instead. It was left open for me to see sorry not sorry.
And Thorn. It's so funny when we all spawn in. Here is what the enemy team is composed of: 3 TLW and 2 Thorns or: 2 Thorns, 2 TLW, 2 Red Death's. Am I the only one who doesn't use an exotic primary in the Crucible?
Everything you said is basically what I said. I said I continue to tip the way I do because they're not getting paid nearly minimum wage. I said that things should change and they should get paid a livable wage. I didn't accuse anything you said of having a socio-economic agenda. All I said is that they need to paid more and that I was tipping because they're not, although I think there should be change. 
I wasn't sure about this because I don't catalog a lot of alternate formats, so I went to my easy, go-to source of info for this type of thing: https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/007motio.html   It looks like motion picture refers to analog filmstrips versus videorecording (i.e. DVDs, VHS, etc., as outlined here: https://www.oclc.org/bibformats/en/0xx/007video.html). DVDs would be videorecording, not motion picture, though.  Edit: It's unclear whether 8mm film &amp; Super 8 films fit in one or the other, to be honest.
That's a load of wisdom. I just don't know of any keyboards that fit my particularly long list of requirements. I haven't found a cherry MX blue keyboard with a black outside and the vibrant green lighting yet. I need a few macro keys on it and that's it. Its almost impossible to find any like that though.
Michael Kelly had his contract terminated by "mutual consent" in January or February. I read that the management staff disliked his attitude and his behaviour on social media (wanking over Celtic). 
&gt; You think the top 10% of Asian men have an issue getting women?I'm sure top 10% of any men are slaying it. But fair comparisons can only be made within same weight classes. Who do you think have an easier time, top 10% Asian men, or top 10% white men? what about mid 50% Asian men vs mid 50% white men?You may have thrived, but there is still no denying the playing field was/is uneven.
I hate how politically correct things are these days. You can't even say black paint anymore. You have to say "Tyrone, would you please paint the fence" 
&gt; I hired a private investigator to conduct a risk assessment of Ms. Quinn, her lover Alex Lifschitz, and Daily Kos intern Margaret Pless."See, Zoe Quinn lied. I actually hired a PI to follow *three* people!"
&gt; pretending there is another realityThat's not what I'm talking about though. Just because reality isn't perfect, doesn't mean that the people who have authority shouldn't make a effort to make it better.
That's another thing I don't understand. It seems like when I watch Glory, those guys are able to move super fast even though they don't really cross their legs and seem to mostly "slide". How the hell do they do that?
There are 93 seconds in this video, in that time frame, I wonder how many camera shutters you can here. Almost like he meant to miss the shots, on the other hand Italian made loafers aren't exactly Air Jordans.

I very, *very* rarely work more than 8.5 hrs in a given day (and refuse to work on weekends, unless we're in a situation where an SLA could be jeopardized), and I've received increases in compensation during every review that I've participated in. If you're boss is worth his salt, he'll care way more about the quality of the work you're doing, rather than the amount of hours you put in.That being said; if you deserve the raise, then you deserve the raise. Amounts are relative; your boss will probably need to work with a budget, which was probably set in Q4 of 2014 and approved by your company's board (if applicable). It's not unreasonable to expect a bump in your compensation every year, provided that you're doing good work.
You're missing the votes-"no"-on-surrender-trolling.  I'm not talking about the "never surrender - there's always a chance to win" argument.  I'm talking about the fuckwad troll who does everything you mentioned but won't let you surrender while he moves back and forth inside the base dropping a few dozen useless mines.
Read the manga, watch Brotherhood. The original just isn't that great after a while because they caught up to the manga and had to make up their own ending. 
Return him to the way he was? Sure: divine interventionHe is bringing baggage from a previous relationship into yours. This is a very selfish thing to do, and is often the beginning of the end for any type of relationship, be is professional or romanticIf you have baggage, deal with it before you start a new relationship
Oh, see, for games it's definitely a curve for me.In an FPS, sober, I'm pretty good depending on the game.2 beers in, I am God.  Slaughtering the entire enemy team and feeling good about it.4 beers in, I'm down a few places...still slaughtering many enemies...only now I'm taunting and telling them I'm drunk while I beat them down.6 beers in, I'm in the corner of the map dicking around and generally being zero assistance to the team.

Or alternitively , Drilling for oil will cost more than you can sell it for, and since alternatives exist there is now a price ceiling. (you can't sell fuel for a petrol powered car for more money than it costs to charge an equivalent electric car and remain competitive.)  
Really hope someone makes a reddit thread showing instructions on how to do this, or make a simple tool to do it easily or something that reaches front page..

No they can't - no male tarantula will molt after getting emboli. The tibial hooks are only for the mating procedure itself to lift the female.(Although there are very rare reports of mature males, that molted again, even some who molted 2 times, but those are sick molting defects and they can't mate anymore afterwards as the emboli molt too, but then are defective) 
If not that, then what exactly is the state-of-the-art for popcorn popping *en masse*?  Perhaps something like [the last scene in "Real Genius,"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rthHSISkM7A) I suppose. 
I think the two are the same, in that the result is your run being over. Either way, if you block yourself in you can just quit and start in at the same room. That would untrap you.
I miss irishflow... :-( She put out some of the hottest, classy, artistic pics on the net of gorgeous shoes and her AMAZING derrière!

That's very true.  And I think that also reflects how Samaritan went to work for Greer without taking the time to understand him and it's other agents.  Harold took a lot of time with the machine to teach it about humanity.  Samaritan is far superior in certain aspects, but it doesn't possess that "wisdom" for lack of a better term.  It's incredibly intelligent and capable, and it is trying to play this game on the same level as a machine that has been doing it for years.
That idea displayed on the graph seems being noncontroversial. There are lot of douches out there trying to take your money, so if you get a bad vibe from some resource move on.I like Pickup Podcast and Tom Leykis Show as a podcast. PP focuses a lot on basic social skills and making positive changes in your social network. TL gives you a cold **dark** reality of the nature of dating.

Well I am not wealthy my parents might be.  My dad is a doctor but because I have siblings he could only pay for 13K a year.  Not nearly enough for what I am paying.  And I would not put the loan on my parents as I am the one who wants to be a doctor not my parents.

This:      i= str.find_first_of("*", i)finds the first position of an asterisk in the string starting at offset in the string of `i`. This:      string::nposis a special value that indicates that character(s) that find_first_of was searching for cannot be found.So this:      while (string::npos != (i= str.find_first_of("*", i)))says loop as long as an asterisk can be found.Note that to be portable (or even to work), this:      int i = 0;should really be:      std::string::size_type i = 0;

Great movie. I was told by a friend that in the original writings of the script that when danny died derrick actually went back and joined the movement. Anyone else ever hear that of know of it being true?
that happened to me in 6th grade. mrs nestor said those exact same words to me. i laughed like it was some joke that i was in on, like me and her were buddies and that was our inside joke or something, it wasn't. another time she accused me of cutting my own hair in front of the class, and only stopped when i said that i must just have ugly hair.
No, the vet said just give her wet food. I found a kind that is not a solid lump of wet can-shaped food. It comes in plastic cups and is very liquidy with small chunks of meat. She seems to do okay with that. But I did buy a bag of Merrick kibble that has itty bitty pieces. My elder cat likes that, so Lana can also try that if she gets brave enough. Apparently, cats can learn to eat piece-by-piece and throw it to the back of their throats to just swallow.I feel so sad for her. I just hope this is a fix for her troubles. 20% of cats still require medication and frequent vet visits for life after full extraction. She's only two and a half.
The player probably dropped the .money at the ATM.  He is either just wealthy and gave away 100 dollars in game money or used a trainer to give himself unlimited cash.Spend it as fast as possible and store expensive cars in garages.  The devs usually wipe the money but leave the items.
Ok let me try again and explain to you.First he punches MCW  right in front of Giannis and then he tries to do the same thing on Giannis and punch him hence why Giannis got pissed off and retaliated like that.So do we agree that dunleavy started all this shit up or not ?
Probably 2-3 weeks before you can plant tomatoes outside in a bed. But if you use large pots, you probably could just cover them with something if it get too cold at night &amp; get an early start. you might want to get starts for toms or peppers. But seed is fine for greens, cukes, herbs, beans, squash, etc. Seeds are easy. Just make sure they are planted at the proper depth.

Thank you for the honest advice!We got married for many other reasons, this is the only part I'm worried about a baby changing! But counselling can never be a bad thing, IMO, and I'm sure DH would be up for it.
Don't follow these things closely, but it may be that Pearl fans have been a bit quiet recently (and, yes, maybe a bit disappointed by her last performance) while the Katya and Trixie fans have been out in full force, hoping that their trash talking will somehow influence the results of a program that was recorded months ago. I myself find ludicrous (yes, LUDICROUS) the claim that there should have been a double elimination a la Honey and Vivian. First, because there is no comparison between them in terms of which one was worse (it was Honey and Vivian). Second, neither Honey nor Vivian had shown they had the potential to go all the way to the end when Ru eliminated both of them. The same cannot be said of Pearl, who has won TWO challenges, and shows remarkable skills for someone who has been doing drag for one year. Will she win season 7? Most likely, no. But the relish with which people are trashing her now is … ridiculous. 
In one of my 7th grade classes my teacher pointed out the fresh period stain on a girls skirt as she went up to the board. She ran out of the classroom.Edit: doesn't really meet the criteria of the post, but it was messed up.
China invaded them back in '79, pulled out after a while. If they really wanted to, they could, but it would be messy.The Chinese aren't interested in the Vietnamese mainland though; so an invasion wouldn't be necessary. They want to islands off the coast, in the South China sea. There's oil and natural gas there, and it would give them control over some of the world's busiest shipping lanes.
I understand it can be done, but yoga is not my priority - I will progress slower, absolutely, as I will with everything because I have no focus, and I'm totally okay with that. If I did yoga 6x/wk without fail, it would mean skipping the time I have to clean my apartment or spend time with my boyfriend, or skipping my gym sessioms, and that wouldn't be conducive to overall life-balance.
Go to an alternative school. Every teacher says things that if you heard, youd probably find it a bit odd.For instance, An eenglish teacher once told a student do his dishes, and proceeding to call him her bitch. Not a big deal to us at all.
But does the stun go off before the monster attacks, just like the bomb explosion? If that is the case, the monster loses two attacks instead of one. Fairy's bar is full, bomb goes off, then stuns. Fairy would have gotten an attack but doesn't, is stunned, 0% atk bar. Bar fills to 100%, fairy loses turn, stun clears. That's two lost attacks instead of one.  I don't have a bomber, but does the unit get an attack immediately after the bomb goes off or is it immediately stunned?
I'm looking at them right now and they look exactly the same. Only thing I'm worried about is that the 23 on the back are different sizes. No idea if that has anything to do with the creasing on the back or anything.
I hate these kinds of channels whenever you type anything  on youtube related to bollywood its always these crappy suggestions "hot mms leak","hot scene kiss" and the comments are filled with horny teens writing pathetic crap or pretentious assholes talking about indian culture or telling its a publicity stunt
Not to use it, no. If you want to use the cloud sync service to get the photos on your mobile device and have them update on your desktop, it's $10/mo. 
I'll take the inverse of this question. What is a fetish you saw in porn and didn't realize you had?Sexually submissive. I am laid back and that's all I thought it was.No. When a guy gets assertive with me, I get majorly turned on and my brain shuts the hell down. I exist to please him and make him feel good. Almost any fetish he enjoys, I will automatically enjoy, because it turns him on. (no to scat and blood, thank you).It kinda scares me a bit. I'm worried I'll get into a situation that will go too far and I'll keep submitting. I'm not sure where my limits are, frankly, with the exception of the aforementioned scat / blood.
Lol all children are different. You can't just generalize whether hitting works or doesn't. In my situation is was my mom trying to keep 4 boys from tearing up the neighborhood, so I think she had to do what she had to do. And when I say hitting I'm not talking about abuse, just enough to get the point across. If anything, it was the fear of getting my ass kicked that kept me on my best behavior, which subsequently kept my parents from having to discipline me; so spanking your kids or whatever is more to show them that they can't get away with everything, and there's consequences to their actions, and I personally think it's formed me into a fine gentleman if I do say so myself. 
I think it just depends... like guys wearing their pants at their knees where you can see their boxers looks pretty silly ... but also I guess if it is a guy I'm attracted to it's a different story. 
It depends on a number of things:- how nice your bike is.- how good your lock is (not all U locks are equally good)- where you lock it (somewhere high-traffic is better)- how long it's locked there and what time of dayI have locked my $1400 bike up all over town with a Kryptonite u-lock and never had it stolen (7 years of heavy commuting).  I have had stuff stolen off of my bike though (lights, mirrors).  Always run the U lock through your wheel and your frame and the rack.  I think it also helps if your bike doesn't look flashy.
This is gonna be awesome.  I think people are overlooking the fact that you'll be able to do a bunch of stuff on your PC while playing Xbox games.  Best of both worlds IMO.
Can we talk about the character development this Dave has been through? As in the fact that he's actually being sincere about his feelings right now? The thing he has basically never did ever until he spent 3 years on a meteor cuddled up with an alien watching rom-coms?
All except Vulcan ult (Since it goes much farther than the ruler) and Hou Yi's Ricochet since they removed the charge up. Why? It's just what I'm use to/comfortable with and I want to be as efficient as possible when casting.
My understanding is that the mono-eye has superior long-range resolution capabilities at the cost of depth perception; in the context of the Zeon's original mobile suit development, this design choice made sense as mobile suits were primarily expected to be engaging Federation warships that provided huge passive sensor returns even at range. Federation fighters had such inferior manuverability compared to Zakus that the mobile suits' pilots could rely on their secondary sensors to guide them, so there was no impetus to upgrade.The Federation's mobile suits, on the other hand, were built from the ground up to engage other mobile suits. Here depth perception and predictive accuracy became dominant requirements, and in that context the compound sensor design is superior to the mono-eye.
At the request of /u/brettins I'm going to do these some more. The next one I'm doing, at his request, is graphene.Many of the sources came from Wikipedia, but I then read through most of these sources to verify that they actually contained the information I was looking for.
No doubt. But they are just dumb. With all the players we promised them they could have actually been someone. I'm really glad we still have cox and the salt will pass lol 
Twitch chat really helped out.  I'll be putting up the conclusion to the run in the coming days, although it'll be tough without the eyes and ears nearby to help me out.
I was right there last week, I remember the row of buildings on the left and the church on the right.  I took a boat tour of the canals.  Sadly, I could only spend an afternoon there.  
I can see you now. "Oh, guy I used to work with and sort of knew, I can't live without... that stuff you used to do! I miss your... stuff and I really liked your... Native American tattoos? Woe is me!"
All of the countries who are pushing for it and signed onto that effort certainly seem to think its Free Trade.  Yes, TPP is more intellectual property oriented than past efforts have been, but it is *still* an expansion of Free Trade.  That makes it worthy of abandonment and rejection.  
for the record, I've read Underwater Light, which I didn't realize was slash until it was too late to drop it... I mean, it was definitely really good, and the harry/draco pairing was fairly believable, it just wasnt my cup of tea.
Bring a lighter into the building. My department alone contains probably 100 gallons of some of the most flammable and explosive solvents you can get your hands on. The building gets evacuated if you so much as break a bottle.
Transistor did this and I actually really liked it. It sucked me in right away.I can definitely understand why some (most) people wouldn't like it though.
Thanks man!  I was curious to see how much editing latitude there was with current camera raw files.  I poked around all the ones you posted in bridge.  Looks like it's pretty good for a camera phone.Still much nosier than dedicated large sensor cameras, but none of those are integrated into existing phones (except maybe the CM1).  I'd say those ISO 50 shots you took are about as good noise wise as ISO 200 on an Olympus E-PL2.
This doesn't sound offense to me either way. If the facts are factual, that's it. People need to stop being butthurt by true numbers. No progress will be made until one side stops getting butthurt about the numbers and the other side stops getting butthurt when the numbers side wants to talk about the historical precedence for those numbers. 
Maybe you should tell that to the people who run the Iditarod they don't have control over their dogs. Dogs have this amazing ability to respond to commands. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the concept of training or how training works, but a well trained dog can be right next to you or 100 feet away, and when you give a command, the dog responds. 
Honestly I thought this was just something you see in movies or on TV I didn't realize it actually happens. You know what I mean you hear of 'chop shops' and that kind of thing. Sorry OP. :-(
The original comment was saying that the gif looked bad, /u/how_is_this_relevant (who shall be referred to as OP) was saying that he disagreed in a comedic fashion by implying that the original commentor had meant to type "glorious"; however, they accidentally mispelled it, writing "bad" instead.OP is an epic memer.
I was thinking about this, but I believe the major factor in hiring people for manager positions is experience. I don't have any. So I feel like I would be wasting my time if I were to apply to another retail place for the same position. 
I just treat it like arena's in wow. I got to 2.3k rating by not back pedalling ever, you just turn and run/walk at full speed, rather than slower by back-pedalling. No one in arena's backpedals in wow, not even the pro's.    In smite, I can turn my mouse pretty fast, and run at full speed then turn around again quite hastily if needed, which is fine for assassin junglers, who I mainly play. I can see where you're coming from when referring to hunters / adc's. Back-pedalling can be fine to shoot and step back. I guess that's just my play style though.   If I do ever need to play adc's I pick neith/ullr, who have escapes.And as for LoL, I mean using QWE is easier, as it lets me hit my binds faster.
No. I ordered them from subispeed.com Actually ordered them before I had the car because I heard they were on back order everywhere. Ended up getting them in a week so they sat on my floor for like a month and half before my car got delivered Haha. 
My time to shine, if late.From the ages of around 10 to, well, a few years ago (around 21), I have dreams of various men standing outside of my window, staring at me. They are never in the house, they are always outside my window, looking in. It's never the same man nor is it always a HUMAN man, sometimes it is a demon or a shadowy figure. Sometimes they attempt to break in, sometimes they attempt to run, sometimes they just stare no matter how much I yell or try to get them to go away. Depending on the man, I either am paralyzed in fear or run after them, ready to kick some fucking ass.Lately, I haven't had one of those dreams. Instead, I've been having a lot of dreams of ghosts or demons haunting my house but I can't see them, so I get mad and tell them to come out and fight me. Can't show fear, after all.

What do you mean? I'm going to take a swing in the dark and guess you're asking why people build Haunting Guise/Sorc Shoes or Abyssal/Sorc Shoes and that is because most ranged champs have 30 base MR so you can deal true damage.
That makes me happy. I'm super busy until Tuesday, after which I should be able to participate in most RPs. The more ops that take place after Monday the better.

That's how Danial Craig plays Bond; rough, aggressive, a brawler. His Bond is when an immovable violent object meets a powerful, monolithic force. Hardy would play it the same way, if not more rough and more aggressive. Now that I think about it, I agree with you. He's probably too thuggish for it. 
Brienne doesn't have the benefit of us readers of us knowing the real Stannis. She's never even met the guy, the one thing she knows about him is that he was behind Renly's death.

I know. It really is about jobs. In more rural communities the jobs just aren't there the same - it's not cheap to truck stuff out of more remote locations.  Because of this, jobs are super centralized. The jobs where you can earn the most are in big cities, and population density is bonkers in these cities, so lots of people have to commute. This drives prices up like you wouldn't believe!
What type of BOA card is it? Cash Rewards? At 14.99, it's def wise to transfer the balance on there even with the 3% transaction fee. The amount of interest you'd be saving outweighs the fee and 14.99 as a go to rate is not bad. Probably the same APR you currently have for your purchases. I'm a CSR at the Bank, hope that helps.
1. So far it has 3 gyms and a boss as well as some post-demo stuff2. I'm fairly sure You can battle against people, I don't do it at all though3. Green Download link on the side4. The game is a work in progress, next update should have another 3 gyms. As well although it has only 3 gyms it has roughly 20 hours of gameplay currently and it is tons of fun!

I'm actually eating one of mine this very minute.  Braunschweiger, aka liverwurst, blue cheese, and mayo sandwich.  Something about all that tangy mixed with creamy mayo, I just love it - in small batches.Also, fresh popcorn with soy sauce, or worchestershire, or hot sauce, or teriyaki.
Twitter, no joke. I follow SAA, JN, other rebels, IS sympathisers (until I break their circlejerk and they block me), YPG and mapmakers. Most of the twitter accounts also posted videos and pics regarding their operations, capture of places/people or in the case of IS or JN: executions.I actually find twitter more reliable and comprehensive than mainstream media with regards to Syria.
We *kinda* do. There is a very weak, overworked and pretty ineffective network of care for these patients. It's no fault of the workers (they are usually competent and caring). It's the government fault (in all levels, municipal, state and federal). There are veryf ew shelters and they usually have drug addictions and conflicts with law enforcement too. It's a mess. The real difficult part as a doctor is not treating those guys, it's when they are ready to be discharged from the hospital and you have no choice but to take them out of what they consider a 5-star hotel and throw them back into the hell hole they came from..

[Full details on the registration process](http://www.blackrockwifi.net/how/connect). Short version is, factory reset your device, point it at the tower, and they'll configure it for you. They discuss the subnets that they use in there too, so you can be sure not to use them (it looks like they're doing stuff in the CGN range (100.64.0.0/10), so pretty much any normal private subnet should do fine).

Halftime Four FactorsFactor | Bulls | Bucks------|-----|-----EFG% | 59.2% | 39.4%OREB% | 27.3% | 04.8%TO% (est.) | 14.1% | 20.2%FT Rate | 14.3 | 36.4Posted this in /r/nba and got asked to post it here too. I did these Four Factors breakdowns for some Duke games on /r/collegebasketball because I like to see what some of the stats say about the game, and whether it agrees with my eyes. Here, it basically confirms everything we're seeing: the Bulls are shooting really well and the Bucks aren't, the Bulls are doing a lot better on the offensive glass than the Bucks, and the Bulls aren't turning it over as much. But what I don't think gets captured is the percentage of opportunities that the Bulls are converting compared to the Bucks. The Bulls are outscoring the Bucks 15-1 off of turnovers, which exacerbates the disparity in turnover rate. They're 7-7 from the line to the Bucks' 7-12, neutralizing the Bucks' advantage in free throw rate. That's just my two cents.
Placed a pretty big order. I got 2 surprise me sample packs - I love surprises! Oh, and a custom lipgloss (even though that wasn't on sale... I was paying for shipping, so why not?!)
I was experimenting with the coefficient of drag, and entered the wrong thing. I fixed it, and that changed it from 700k joules to 33k. Factor of ten means multiplied or divided by 10. "Order of magnitude" means the same thing. For scientists doing rough calculations ("back of envelope" or napkin calculations), getting it to within an order of magnitude is the first step.If I'm going to the moon, how much energy will I need? Looked it up, and it says the Saturn V rocket produced 10^11 joules of energy. Doing rough calculations, it doesn't matter if it's 1x10^11 or 2x10^11 , the exponent is the important part.I used the dimensions from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Delivery  to do my calculations.

Off topic: but it seems somewhat naive to think that all copyright cases would involve a contract.  Someone could simply see something, without ever having bought it, in which case no copyright could ever be applied?

I'm no expert, but consider that you might actually be thirsty instead of hungry (I often misidentify thirst as hunger). If you're humidifier is set low, you could be losing more water through your lungs while sleeping than you're used to. 
I'm in the same situation as you. I'm the one that's mainly to blame though since my grades are pretty poor. Is your lack of job offers also partly because of grades?  (if you don't mind me asking)
Esports and Sports are two seperate things, and I hate sports, and I love Esports, but thats just a fact. If you look up "Sports" in the dictionary it says "an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment."This isnt Esports. That being said, Esports is WAY better imo and will last a long time :D
also, based on my results from extensive testing, retracting landing gear (yes, with your kerbal in EVA) raises your chances of survival greatly. You can survive basically any fall if you land on flat land.
Might be a good thing to add to the sidebar. Just some quick, dirty tips on buying better product. I usually buy cage free, vegetarian fed eggs. They are really not that much more expensive, and I'm not a huge milk/cheese eater, so paying an extra buck doesn't break the bank for me.
Now you're just getting into opinion territory, where I call your view bullshit. You can argue for the meaning of life, and I don't care to think about such things. If the meaning of life is reproduction, that's  a pointless existence. A better way to use our limited existence would be to create pleasure for ourselves and others, while minimising suffering. I'd rather live by this quote than your idea of perpetual reproduction: "An it harm none, do what ye will."
That's an interesting quote and link. Regardless I feel the true sage, Buddha, "philosopher", would view indifferent externals as just that, indifferent. If we don't work towards perfect communion and understanding with nature what are we working towards? More things? Are more things good? What difference do they make? Even the richest among us are unhappy either craving for more or desperately trying to hold onto what they have.Epictetus Discourses I 23"If I cherish my body, I make a slave of myself, if I cherish my property, I make a slave of myself"

women like to feel like a man is in charge. We like that safe, yet attractive security. If a man asks you out first, he's being dominant, which is quite attractive (at least to my standards). Girls are told by society that we need to be the submissive ones. Girls normally don't ask guys out, so we prefer to stay within the social norm. However, to encourage a guy to ask her out, a girl would flirt with him to let him know she's interested.
The Rock's most well known melody is more of an offshoot of the Nation's song, though. This video traces the evolution of the Nation music to the first version of "Do You Smell It" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KavLF-QzAcEDIT: Though now that I play them all again, I can't help but notice that slight melody from "Destiny" starting from Do You Smell It, so yeah that might be the case.

He didn't invent the straight line method. Bottom line is, it works. I wouldn't recommend paying him to learn it, but the guy knows how to sell a product. You can't deny that, and if he can teach it, more power to him.
Some of the teachers at my school were pretty cruel. I remember my music teacher telling  me I wouldn't pass the theory test, so I said fuck her, passed it and quit promptly after. My 4th form science teacher told me and my parents at a teacher-parent interview that I wouldn't pass the course, even if I put more effort in. Like who the fuck says that to a 14 year old. Another moment to say fuck em and prove that you can do it. My 7th form stats teacher told me not to take the course cause I wouldn't pass (I'd admittedly scrapped the barrel in the lower level classes). Fuck that guy, I am now taking a stats based paper at uni and am kicking ass in it. Telling someone not to even try at something cause "they know you'll fail" is the shittest thing you can say to a kid. Fuck that school. 
Typically I wear cropped/waist-length jackets with maxi dresses instead of hip-length coats. You could throw a (blanket) scarf or something on top as well. I find that the extra fabric on maxi dresses tends to keep me pretty warm, though the slit might make it pretty chilly.How cold is it going to be and what is your mode of transportation? If you're driving, you can wear whatever you want or throw a blanket/leggings in the car. If you're taking public transportation/walking, no one is going to judge you for dressing sensibly. IMO there's no need to be the shivering girl for the sake of fashion.
I put in an order with him 2 weeks ago but he didnt respond after like 3 days so i just pulled my coin, but Im sure he would have eventually gotten to my order. Better that than just having him confirm the order then lollygagging holding up your coin.
EXACTLY what I was thinking, combined with what /u/forkoverthegoods said, hes a professional actor getting paid A LOT of money for it.

It is the Askmen, what did you expect?A sub that has female mods who abuse their power, mods that shut down almost every thread that is posted, and one in which females are allowed to spew their nonsense while men are pussywhipped. It is one of my biggest fears that a day comes when this sub allows a woman to be a moderator, that is what has happened with Askmen. You cannot let a female be a moderator for a sub that is meant for men spaces, women will run it to the ground. This is a classical example of women abusing their power when they are given power. Women have no right to have any authority in men dominated spaces. I can't really say much nice things about the male mods on that sub either, they delete every thread on there when given the chance. Most of them are just as awful as the female ones, if not worse.The sub is full of some the most crooked power-abusing mods on reddit.

Fair enough. I also consider us apes. Sort of how "world" used to mean everything, and has been used to describe our planet only (or "other world" used to describe others) once we discovered how much more there is, and called it the universe.

If you go to the link it should also show you an example of how to use it. I'll try to do my best without the screenshots. Chrome allows you to search supported sites directly using that site's own search engine right from your address bar. For example, if you type "amazon.com" and then press the tab key in your address bar, you will start searching Amazon's site. What I've made is one that will let you search Kiranico's MH4U section from your address bar. When you go to the page I linked it will ask you for some information in a [dialog like this](http://k.mhquestboard.com/kiranicomh4u/public/chrome-dialog.png). The only thing here you should change is the keyword, to something short and memorable, I use kn. This will let you type kn (tab) and the monster or item you want to see on Kiranico.

Wow that's very generous of you! I hope I win because Ike is my brother's best character and we failed in obtaining his amiibo when it was available :/
&gt;but by the 5th month i was there I noticed I had seen the sun about 4 times...this got really depressing fast...it would also rain a little bit seemingly every day...I was used to the cold but I wansn't used to the rain/lack of sun...Germany is quite a bit further north than New York though, so naturally there are fewer hours of daylight in the winter. On the bright side (literally) the days are longer in the summertime. 
&gt;I’m not very good at ending these types of posts. So…discuss.End it with something motivational, thus the reader will feel better and think what you said is true.
Dungeon Highway is fun. I'm almost sure that every character can be unlocked without paying a cent. Some just through playing it a bunch, others by just waiting it out (the game gives out gems all the time to try and get you back to playing it, which is nice.)Final Fantasy Record Keepers is interesting, though loading takes a while on older phones, it may or may not need an internet connection, and it technically does have a "stamina system", though it's generous enough that it won't effect you until you are just grinding. Also doable without spending anything.Symphony of Eternity by Kemco is a nice little traditional JRPG. It costs about $15 normally, but I would recommend getting it when it's on sale. Dragon Quest 1-5 and Final Fantasy 1-6 are also available, but from what I've heard, they really aren't designed well for a mobile device.
I mean I don't know about magnets.... I didn't drill a single hole into my box though, I fabricated a bracket out of some steel that I heated and bent to get the pre-drilled holes in the back to line up, and then screwed the bottom of the backer into my fabricated top to hold it steady the length of the box, which was of course screwed into the pre-drilled holes in the top of my box.  So I didn't affect the value of my box one penny as far as drilling into it or scratching it or anything, if anything it's keeping the high wear areas from wearing :)
Love this site and their customer service.  I returned my iStick 50w a week ago and he offered me a full return or exchange.  I offered to get an iStick 30w and a subtank + the difference.  Can't beat their prices, shipping and service.  
All proof and evidence points to the current government being ideological liars with their own agenda.  If Dr Karl didn't take this into account when spruiking a report *he hadn't read* then he deserves all the criticism that comes his way.
That sounds very plausible. I was actually very hyper and in a positive mood this morning, and for about the first half of the day. But then, like a lightswitch, I became an asshole. I sat in my garage (I was firing my car when it flipped) for about an hour just being angry. I even punched my toolbox. I mean, what the fuck? 
I watched an interview this morning with a pizza shop owner who said the rioters tried to set him on fire...um yeah assault rifles are needed i would think.
Go do Bar Smarts Wired.  It's cheap and, when you're done, you'll know more that 80% of "craft"  bartenders out there.   If you can't afford it, message me and I'll send you a code that will pay for it. 
The film guy barged in there with his own agenda.None of his business barging in there with all that self-importance and hijacking the situation for his own purpose. Just so that he has some film.
How would i maintain a cut with that length of hair? It's really inconsistent throughout the day and doesnt usually look the way it does in those first pictures. It's really difficult to style and changes shape alot so should i start using hairspray? Also the back looks pretty bad imo. Just me? Or should i go for a taper the next time i get a cut
ALL OF THESE makes you think the sayer is stupid? Why do you go on reddit? Are you a masochist? I understand that this shit gets redundant, but thinking less of someone because they repeat things they find funny is a little unreasonable. When some funny shit happens to you in your day to day life, you tell the story because you think other people would appreciate it. That's how the human brain works
&gt; Not a feministnot to be *that guy* here, but feminism is actually a legit field of research, it's just completely different from what that whole tumblr crowd makes it out to be.
Imagine if he BD Zach like holy shit. I hope for his game he doesn't as much as I want Zach gone. Surely can't be though right? Damn this kid is hard to read. 
It wasn't *terrible*, but it wasn't nearly as enjoyable. I played it through once. The other two I've played through several times each, and it's my go-to "I'm bored, let's go punch people in arenas" game, which I don't do on *any* other game. Origins is just kind of meh.
I buy things in cheap areas and sell in richer areas. i usually make like 10-20 dollars a transaction.. once again, im no pro. I do this like once a month to fund my fast food outing that i treat myself to once a month
Poverty increases crime.  It's cheaper to pay them then to arrest and incarcerate them.What do I know, though?  I'm just an actual fiscal conservative.
ELI5:The article assumes that the chemical machinery in cells 3 billion years ago was similar to the chemical machinery in cells today. This is not necessarily true, and therefore the conclusions of the article are highly questionable.
As soon as I saw the title, I immediately thought Eric Prydz and was delighted to see you thought so too haha. Absolutely magnificent show at the ASOT at Ultra; the energy, the lights, the LAZERZ, the crowd, all made for a special experience I'll never forget. Hands down best DJ/Performance I've ever seen.
It *is* incorrect, and I am open minded, but not towards backwards ideas. No certified psychologist, therapist, or psychiatrist will tell you that being gay is a mental illness, and it's not defined as one by the APA, ICD-10, or DSM-V.
&gt;I want to have a universal local bitcoin seller rating app with GIS implemented, like Yelp. I have no idea about anything at all beyond that, technically. Do it for me and give me a share of any profits. Thanks. It should also be decentralized with a Blockchain. Can someone draw up the patent?
:) I made the mistake of insinuating this one time. I then got a full on rant from his friend that i was saying mean things to him. All I did was light teasing (really hinting), and i assured her being gay is okay. She politely told me back that no, it isn't. I didn't know she felt that way. Damn.
Dammit Was hoping they'd make a mistake and pick white like so many people thought they would.  I honestly can't believe Leo is still available....
The parallels between Arlen/Jesus and Jardir/Muhammad are not unintentional, but neither should you try to read too much into them. They are their own characters in their own story.
Except they would have had to set that within the last 2 weeks, you are saying they forgot they set that within 2 weeks?Why would they have even set it in the first place?
For how 'Rare' that chance is from a vendor, there sure are a lot of them. Aka, they aren't really that rare from vendors, and if there were otherways to get them they wouldn't be worth that much.
I just joined this group today but this was the first post I read and I'm so motivated by it.  Thanks for taking the time to write it and congratulations on your Masters program!  Very cool and well deserved.  Best to you..
i agree a shotgun should be powerful but does it really need that many shells? these guys can't even aim but all they need to do is hit you once or twice and they don't even have to ever reload. not to mention you can just craft any shells you lost killing fresh spawns so what is the point in conserving ammo.this game has gone from a mediocre survival game to a mediocre sandbox shooter. or at least that is how it feels when you die to the same gun, different people, different spawn locations, an all under 10 minutes. somebody please justify that becuz i certainly can not. if this game is going to base it's gun mechanics on their real life counterparts than the other guns need to be buffed as well. and so does the bow to match the power of the shotgun. becuz currently there is just no better gun in the game. why else is everyone using it solely?
If youre using MO, it comes with a built in BSA unpacker which you can use, just unpack it to the same folder as the mod and then hide the bsa using MOs hide function.If youre using other tools, unpack it to a seperate location and then backup the bsa, delete it from your data folder and then moved the unpacked files into the data folder instead. I use the BSAunpacker from the nexus for this but I know there are other tools around for it too.Because youre not actually deleting or changing any files, just unpacking them, it shouldnt impact your game at all :)
This is the kind of guy who was in my first grade class. When recess came around I would be trying to put together a X-Wing while following the instructions, and hes sitting across from me building a fucking Deathstar from memory.Guys like that always know how to get the girls. 
I hadn't thought about Stubborn Denial and I think people bring up a very strong point with that. Being behind on both mana and board presence, I think it's important to play something, probably Anafenza to use mana efficiently.Opp is down on cards, so we can afford to make trades if offered. I probably wouldn't trade Anafenza for Heir of the Wilds, though. Definitely Boon Saytr. Trying to go for a kill spell and then getting Stubborn Denial-ed is such a huge blowout, leaving us way behind.So I'd play Anafenza, but I could see an argument for Fleecemane

I personally know my entire league in person, but they don't know each other more than opponents. We range from Seattle to OKC so it is hard for everyone to know eachother personally. I personally set up a facebook page for everyone to chat and propose trade ideas, and as a place to post my weekly LM note other than the league home on ESPN.My set up usually goes... quick review on trades, good and bad acquisitions, a little LM banter/humor. Then I review each match up , preview next weeks match ups, and close with more humor.Outside the note, I run an excel spreadsheet to show weekly numbers as a way to do statistical analysis.
All of these for different reasons:    Luca    Millstone     At the Bottom    Good to know if....    Fork and Knife    The No Seatbelt Song    Logan to....    And...Degausser    
Since it's a sphere and rolling perfectly, you can use ω = v/r and I = 2/5MR^2 to turn 1/2iω^2 into 1/5mv^2Makes it easier to solve when you can express rotational energy in terms of linear velocity.

I feel like if they keep similar patterns we will see 1 of each physical toy ( excluding Anakin / Vader) and their older selves will be power disc costume variants.
&gt;This isn't a racial issue. It's a multi-generational poverty issue.Considering that its mainly the black population living in poverty thats pretty much the same thing.
This is playing with my emotions too much. Imagine a front line of Ibe/Marko, Sterling, Depay, Origi with Coutinho feeding them the ball. If Depay comes, he gets the 7 shirt without a doubt. 
Many women do split, especially here in Europe. I myself always split. There are so many good reasons to. Besides the whole equality thing, I just want to order whatever the fuck I want and however much I want without having to worry, "Oh shit, what should I order? I don't want to leech off his money, but it's not like I can have just a glass of water while he's having a full dinner... and how much should I order? No, this is definitely too much, ok fuck it I'll just eat at home afterwards..."
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
Not to alarm you, but I wish I had been more prepared for the loss in order to mourn properly...my belly button has not yet (8 months pp) returned to it's former state. It's just kinda...baggy. And sad. The rest of me is back to normal though so it's a small (but unexpected) price to pay. RIP belly button.
Kids are like clay. They can and will grow up to be amazing if they are molded by the right hands, and not squashed to bits by those who don't believe in them.Your son is an amazing person who will grow up to do good things, and I'm happy that you believe in him.
My grandfather was a great guy, who was also kind of crotchety.He died on December 30th. For as long as I knew him, his birthday was December 31st. We all wished he lived one day longer to see his next birthday, or at least die on his birthday like Shakespeare (because that's poetic).When we were cleaning out his stuff we found his birth certificate. Low and behold he was born on December 30th. He hated parties so much that he always lied about when his birthday was, so that he only had to celebrate one. My mom even thought his birthday was December 31st. He lied to his own children. But at least he died on his birthday like Shakespeare.edit: fixed a word.. because December 30th doesn't kill
I hate the way Melee plays. All the characters feel way too heavy and fast for my taste. I grew up playing it and I love it, but I'd rather play PM or Sm4sh. 
Because we should analyze the text and God's text needs the most analysis. Gen 1:1 covers specific things, yet chaos and void appear to predate creation itself
Funny. I can't remember what I had for breakfast yesterday, but I do know where I was on Jan. 13, 1999. I live in Toronto, and that was the day our mayor called in the military due to an insane snow storm. I had to walk 3 hours in waist deep snow to my minimum wage job, only to be told "go home....we're not busy enough for all this staff". http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/sixteen-years-later-remembering-the-toronto-blizzard-of-1999/43613/
I felt like all of BRM was kind of underwhelming compared to Nax, the theme, the emotes (humour) and many (not all) cards...I also wish they would have just skipped the hidden laboratory all together as that was a shit dungeon in general, especally lore-wise.  (from WoW)
I took a class where we focus strictly on these power struggles.  You have a class of avatar students that are voiced by actors.  Their goal is to break you down until you get in a verbal argument with a student.  I've seen fellow classmates leave those sessions in tears. Its awesome.
here's the most important thing to ask yourself, "Do I care whether my beliefs are true"? If the answer is no then believe what you want, you've already given up reality for a fantasy, but if you DO care then you're going to have to take steps to confirm or discredit the claims of the belief you're investigating. Theists will claim that you just need faith to believe. There's just one little problem, faith can justify anything. Muslims use it to confirm their god just like the Jews, Hindu's and all the rest. So how do you find out which is the truth? you investigate the evidence and if you're convinced then so be it. But like most of us here that have already gone through this process, you'll probably be an atheist by the end of it. 
This will sound horrible. But try doing one without HQM. I love HQM, but not every pack needs it, not even skyblock. Try something different. If you have any interest in 1.8 http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/63384-mobtalker2  looks interesting.
I'm sure there is, but they might need to use different materials. I'd have to ask them.Edit: I think the point though is to have it repeat. They're called "Pocket Universes."
Dirty Heads, Jon Bellion, and Logic.I've wanted to see all these guys since the first song I heard by them. I just got into Jon Bellion about a month ago and know most of his songs by heart.

I often use SIL's rapid words questionnaire. There is also a fairly good vocabulary questionnaire in "Describing Unwritten Languages" that focuses on basic words with example sentences.When I'm just starting, though, I like to translate words that are often parts of semantic "systems", for lack of a better word: kinship terms; motion verbs; spatial reference; pronouns and demonstratives, etc. 
You could always fake a cough&amp;sore throat &amp; hit up the doctor.When I was still in high school I did that once or twice a year, usually in the winter and spring when people are sick often. One time they gave me a damn big bottle of codeine/promethazine, &amp; I was a very happy kid, but they pretty much always gave me codeine when I went. 
Was actually just looking at that! It's 4.5 LBS though... Also only 1 HDMI out.  You have any experience with the USB to HDMI?Definitely an option though.

For your first question, as far as I know He will be an amazing compassionate and charismatic leader that will lead the Jews to rebuild the Temple and come back to Jerusalem. As for the second, I have no clue. I was agnostic/atheist for a few months prior to finding my spark in Judaism.

Well in BL there are corps right, these corps for the most part can act independently and when Elo isn't around they all form little cliques.Anyways, in BL there is a squad of people called "Drop Squad" and the "leader" is a person who would be banned really quickly from Brave Comms. So this dude who leads drop squad says stupid shit from time to time and people get their feathers ruffled, in this case he actually pissed off an entire corporation. The people in this corp generally refuse to associate with the leader of drop squad and it's difficult to get them to cooperate as a result. That's the gist of it basically, run of the mill stuff so far as BRAVE is concerned.

Que poco nos conocen, cuanta mas presión mas unión y mas fuerza.

"We work hard at keeping costs down," says the dude whose bank is very obviously more interested in keeping profits up... Weren't they the ones who also fired a bunch of Canadians so they could get cheaper foreign workers in? Fuck them.

While I've seen it written before, I'd have to say that it is my experience if one considers desires that exist beyond parochial, daily desires.   Not sure if that makes sense.   Not sure if this is a common experience.  
I constantly have nightmares about animal agriculture. I see thousands of chicks passing through a machine to be slaughtered and I see lines of hanging decapitated cows' heads with their mouths still moving. The scary part is it isn't even made up, it's real. It's hell on Earth and happening right under our noses. I am vegan and trying to do what I can to stop it.
The insectoid is a [Vratix](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Vratix). The other is a [Gotal](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Gotal/Canon).(non canon) - The Vratix are the species who invented [bacta](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Bacta/Canon).The image is captioned on a [Tumblr archive](http://zenothian-archives.tumblr.com/tagged/gotal) as "A Gotal surveys the Bacta inventory of a Vratix." 
yeah I wish it was as simple as that :( but it's the best way to get better imp since you're playing against people who know what they're doing and you aren't restricted to final destination stages
I wanted to ask real quick, how many of you guys skip OPs and EDs of episodes? And why? I never do. Even if I'm watching the show all at once. For me it's part of the experience, it'd be crazy for me to skip any of it, so that's why I'm baffled that people have to make comments to stick after the ED for after credit scenes. Just watch the whole thing, IMO. Especially if it's a show I like (like Eva) hearing the OP and ED every time increases my hype and excitement to watch the next episode. That's just me though.
I grew up in a white neighborhood. Not one single white person there got murdered. Sure that's an anecdotal account but the leading cause of death for white males is NOT murder.
One argument is that all the machinery for two-person marriage is already in place. There are laws to handle marriage, divorce, probate, child custody, taxes, etc. These laws have become more or less neutral w/r/t sex, so extending to same-sex marriage is relatively easy. Extending to three or more spouses would require extensive revision of the laws. I'm not sure you consider that a *legal* argument, but it's the first one that comes to mind.
I love their Frat Boy blush and the Nude Dude palette is a pretty decent everyday neutral palette! I also really love their highlighters. The Cindy-Loumanizer is probably one of the more unique highlighters that I have (I have a fairly extensive selection of highlighters.......). 
You're right. I don't know you. And you don't know me either, but I'll tell you what, I once kept up a web of lies for three months just cause i was getting pussy. There is no easy way to go through with the process, but at some point, a liar should learn to feel remorseful for an opportunity he passed up. The only thing one can do is give opportunity.
You wrote---&gt; "They found chemical weapons. But we (The US), sold them to him..."Which is false. The U.S. sells computers and steel tubes to countries all the time and if those countries use them to make weapons it doesn't mean the U.S. sold them Weapons of Mass Destruction.

I considered going to Comicon last summer to meet Ian Somerhalder. Then I realized that if I ever actually met him, I'd likely start crying and either pee on him like an excited puppy, or hump his leg like...an excited puppy. I did not go to Comicon. 
I love this. I love TG. But why couldn't Steven also have a koukaku for his shield, like on his arm like Pearl/Tsukiyama?*Garnet as a rinkaku is the most badass thing ever and Lion Cub is the cutest alias ever.*
Agreed with Uptown. Luckily Dallas is starting the trolleys again in May and it runs right by my building, so I can go to Uptown for free. I'm not opposed to driving. Thank you for the info!
My grandfather passed a few years back after which we discovered he'd had a son with another woman (not my grandmother). My grandma knew before they even got married, but they never told any of the kids that they had a half-brother the whole time.
I'm just utterly confused by all of this.  I was prepared to grieve, I came here to grieve... I can't even laugh at the things I'm supposed to laugh at because I feel like I should be grieving right now!
I love Charlotte nn Charlie! One of my favorite boy names on girls is actually Teddy (the name Charlie reminded me of Teddy because of characters on a disney show - sigh), which I didn't mention in my original post. It could be a nickname for Thea, Thora, Dorothy, Theresa, Theda, Edith, or pretty much most names with a "th" or "ed".
A few years ago my ex and I were moving and couldn't take our cat where we were going. None of our friends were able to take him in. I tried taking him to a shelter o said I had him about a week and they said technically it was considered mine and couldn't take it. I ended up dropping him off at an abandoned house. This morning on my way to work I saw a cat running across the street and reminded me of what I did. It gives me that sinking feeling in my chest that I did that to a cat that was mine. I remember crying right after I dropped him off. I will never forgive myself for that. Somehow admitting it doesn't lift any weight of my shoulders.

Yeah it's a relatively new rule, and it's a pretty shitty solution to the runaway rookie contracts.  I actually didn't know about it until I heard somebody talking about it on the radio today, to dispel the rumor that a trade might happen after Mariota was drafted.  
Every great team has a small rough patch. Especially considering our injuries and defense, things like this are bound to happen. No need to worry though, if we finish May with an above .500 record which is very likely to happen then this team is going places.
Can't wait for the left to understand the process is a lie, primaries are manipulated from the start, and nothing they do matters if the people on TV don't want it to.
Check out YouTube channels like cgr and avgn. They have a lot of retro gaming videos based on oldschool machines. There is also an excellent series called history of videogames that go year by year
I wouldn't say invested, that's far too dedicated off a word, and in terms of skill I'm in no way incompetent, I'm just not competent per se in the orthodox meaning of guitar competency. I'm a 6 years, 22, but it's a 22 where I also went to school so that takes up a lot of time as well. 
Thank you for the advice.   His birthday is Saturday and we have been planning a party, but I'm like 85% sure he's going to skip out on it.  Maybe Sunday I'll stop over and chat with him.  He needs to get on medication because this is just destroying his life.  
If you have a level 50 character (because silver doublons and linens) and if you also don't want to invest time into chest farm then bags. You can make gold on somewhere else and actually have fun. If you like shiny golds and have enough time to spend on them, then keys/chests. Some people actually like to chest farm though, because it's relaxing and feels like semi afk while watching something else, I personally don't like it.
Offer to pay, that is polite. If she declines strongly, split the bill or go "but the next one is on me, okay?" and smile your best smile. The fact that she's a "feminist" shouldn't change anything. Being a feminist doesn't mean you wanna pay for everything? I think there's bigger things to worry about lol.

Naturally Auto Rifles need a push. Hand Cannons aren't really the problem - its just that the Exotic ones are all too good, even compared to the power spike from Legendary to Exotic for the other weapon types. Hard to say what can be done to fix that without causing the pitchforks to come out.
Bernie Sanders is a conspiratard. The idea that a few wealthy oligarchs control the government is just bunk nonsense. Everyone lobbies for their interest on both sides and then the decisions are made via the democratic process. We elect our leaders because we trust them to act on our behalf. Bernie Sanders just wants to stir drama over nonissues to get attention for his campaign. Bernie is an old kook who wants to punish America's large corporations for no crime other than being successful. If large corporations are not successful what does Sanders think will happen to the economy? He needs to retire and make way for Hillary, she's obviously the better choice to grow America's economy and spread our influence abroad by allowing easier access to foreign markets.  The TPP is the best way of achieving that and Hillary knows it. Bernie needs to stop with these crackpot arguments. 
You're saying people shouldn't be held responsible for their actions because they're black.  You're either dehumanizing or infantilizing them based on their race.  That's racist.
I apologize, I'd read several articles on the topic and just assumed the one I sent you covered it.

scripthooks basically hook into the memory of the game to alter them, it usually has to be updated every new patch anyway. It's probably something that R* is not intentionally trying to do.
I understand your reasoning, but honestly I'll be happy having whoever is republican to win the presidency *precisely because* they will make things substantially worse.Why would i want a party to win who will make things worse? Because it's clearly obvious that things are not bad enough for people to get it through their heads that they need to change. The worse things get the more pressure there is to fix things, and if Bernie and people like him are not voted in and actually fix things, clearly things need to get worse before people will finally get off their fucking asses and act.Bernie for prez.

The biggest one I can think of is identity theft. They need to make it a Capital fucking offense with no chance of anything less than life with no possibility of parole, if not the death penalty. It massively fucks up peoples lives, costs billions every year, and makes the cost of doing business with credit higher. Fuck these lazy, opportunistic bastards: stick a needle in their arm.
If the market crashes tomorrow, it may not sufficiently recover in 5 years. 10 years is a bit more comfortable.How much would you want to invest in an index (44k?), and how much other assets do they have in total?

Apparently Mettenberger wants out. How about trading them Schaub and a 3rd/4th or something for him? Get Joe to tutor him, have a big QB 7 years younger to smooth the transition between Flacco and whoever our next long-term QB is?
Hey! I tried using a different mouse, and these were the results: http://i.imgur.com/BxQA8MT.pngObviously much better, so it does seem to be a mouse problem. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the mouse... and it didn't fix anything. I have no clue what the issue is at this point, I had ideas, but now I'm at a complete loss.
In Italy people avoid combining striped clothing. Only one piece can be striped. Generally speaking, coordinating the colors is of crucial importance in Italy; people are almost obsessed by it and spend a lot of time getting dressed for work. It can get really crazy, but fun!
Are you gonna watch AoU? I'm so excited that it'll finally be out in the US so I won't have to worry about spoiling my friends when I talk about it. Here, it's been out for about a week or so.
a thing i always do is go on lfg and look for gorgon chest cp like 5-10 minuits before weekly reset because heaps of people are looking for someone they can share chest with because they need 2 people so one can leave and visa versa, works everytime
We'll find out later I'm sure. I'll be shocked if two firsts and a third weren't offered at least, and that should've been enough for your front office.

Never on the ringroad itself.Never near a blind crest. Preferably always at a designated parking place. On pretty much every road there will be some place where you can park a car for some time without interrupting traffic. On gravel roads they are often around bridges. On bigger tarmac roads there will be signs for available stopping, like [this](http://www.vegagerdin.is/sthbthjon.nsf/2d1e761d5db9cd840025702a00731850/dc1833dfa9aa1b6700257243002f6dca/Body/0.28B8?OpenElement&amp;FieldElemFormat=gif) or [this](http://www.vegagerdin.is/photosrv/photosrv.nsf/vgPage/B9937F87E6E5B7400025724B00371BD4/$FILE/thumb_E02.63_Aningarstadur.gif) or similar. 
I never said I don't care. I said your welcome to insult my continent. I don't believe in God. It doesn't bother me. Your welcome to believe in God. I just find fhat funny. Sorry lol. 
We Have so many needs....Mett is still a question mark, but ...fuck. I am in no way shitting on MM. He seems like a stand up guy, so was Locker. I hope i am so wrong. I hope I am wrong.. But this just seems like a gamble when we could have made our team better with more picks. I do not want a question mark at QB when our team is this bad.
Exactly, but what is enterntaining to us within the community isn't what's entertaining to most casual viewers. And in the GDQ they outnumber us and their pockets far outnumber ours. GDQs are taylored to them without being horrible for the fans, but it's not FOR the fans.
1. Bill [is not "all-seeing"](http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/315yoy/im_bill_cipher_i_know_lots_of_things_ask_me/cpynrre) he has--to quote that link--"blind spots". The first place Bill looks is the kitchen, another room that lacks the EoP/Bill image.2. I did not say Bill was evil or the villain, for all we know he wants to stop the author from doing something he specifically doesn't want to happen that will interfere with his plans. He could even be like a character from the book Good Omens named Crawley, who despite being a demon doesn't want the world to end because he enjoys it and humanity's existence (because humans are entertaining or something).
As a special ed sub, that's infuriating. In my district they're hand picked so we don't end up with any people over their heads or rude assholes like that. 
That would be amazing if they hinted at Azazel being a demonized angel. Would explain the fact that he's the only yellow eyed demon ever and can apparently possess angels (tess).
I used to not get athiesm at all. All the athiests I knew were total nihilists and just thought everything was pointless, and I was so confused by it. I asked people what it was all for, if there was no purpose or destiny to anything. I straight up didn't know. *shrug*I love my family, but sometimes I shake my head at the things I was raised not to question.
I think PTR left. Watching his stream today he said they tried to replace him with Skadoodle once they returned from lan, and he no longer had the desire to move forward with the team emotionally after knowing they nearly cut him.
I mainly play as knife stalker and id recommend adrenalin pump over the emp bandolier outside of squad-play. It helps when trying to get the jump on people, it helps running in enemy crowds getting kill-streaks while outrunning people that noticed you and try to follow you in the crowd and it also helps when you need to loose someone whos chasing you. If you are running around with the EMP bandolier you better use the xbow and normal knife for EMP+xbow combos
There's definitely a chance! Your mindset can change drastically once you're in the heat of the moment. But not having an erection is fine. Just do other stuff until you do. Good luck! 
I quite like Anor Londo since the Silver Knights are worth about 1k each and they aren't too hard to take down once you learn how to parry or backstab them.The painted world is also pretty good with the phalanx, especially if you have AOE (easily available thanks to pyromancy). There are other places as well. http://darksouls.wikidot.com/soul-farming Here is a helpful guide if you don't mind some minor spoilers.
I doubt there's very many people who EDC a GR2.  If you don't get much of a response here, you'll probably have better luck in r/goruck (also, I'd help by only have a GR0).  Edit...DEERRRRPPPPP just checked out r/goruck.  My bad! 
You cant use Lebron, or KG's skill set as an example for what a superstar is. Carmelo took the nuggets to the playoffs every year he was there and the knicks the first 3 years he was here. Obviously he can't do it alone and needs a pretty specific supporting cast. But the fact that he lifts a team so much with just himself is pretty damn good.
Each rider has a bit of a specialty or preference in how they attack but their power levels should be generally the same. There are more than I'm going to list, but they are usually one-ofs or small time, anyways I would rank the main ones like this:    1. Alejandra  2. Johnny  3. Danny  4. Robbie    [Alejandra is the one that tore out Mephisto's heart](http://i.imgur.com/smrQT4A.jpg) and she has tapped into the most diverse abilities of the different riders (at least when she was a ghost rider)  Johnny prefers the hellfire attacks a lot. He especially is gifted at the hellfire nova blasts that most others don't do.  Danny prefers the penance stare, he's the first to use it actually, and using his chains a lot.  Robbie so far hasn't displayed any penance stare, and although he has a diverse skillset it's all pretty low level.
I used to see something similar to this when I was a kid, I would see...like dots all over my vision. I could change it too, I could think about a different shape or color and sometimes it would change. It doesn't happen anymore, I wonder why.
All I'm saying is Chip better win now. He made all these moves, I EXPECT nothing less then a deep playoff trip. Not saying he was wrong in anything he did, but I don't agree with it. HE. BETTER. FUCKING. WIN.
&gt; Who are you and why are you such a know it all asshole?(I'm gathering this from other comments on this thread, not this one alone)....you do realize my argument is based upon the fact we "can't" know...correct?That's literally my whole point. We can't know because of our limited experience in space. We have only explored planets within our solar system. You honestly want to sit there and tell me you have the knowledge and experience to determine how life has evolved on planets which we can only see as points of light in the night sky?If being an asshole is calling out people who make false predictions then so be it. Call me goatsee, there are no shits for me to give.
Get something online. People won't book you if they can't hear you first. Or at least rarely. If you're touring solo, do a mix of music venues and 3 set pub nights. You may not get people paying that much attention but pub's have a guaranteed wage, which helps put gas in your ride. Also start booking as soon as possible places fill up months in advance.
I just learned the term for people like you is "sea lion."  Regardless, because this shit is so mindblowingly easy to find, here's [the lawyer who blamed an 11 year old for her rape](http://m.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Lawyer-likens-gang-rape-victim-to-a-spider-luring-4071735.php).  Here's the [police department that told a victim her rape was probably just a drunken mistake](http://m.missoulian.com/news/local/missoula-agrees-to-reform-police-response-to-sexual-assaults/article_b27157ea-bd6b-11e2-a337-0019bb2963f4.html?mobile_touch=true).  There's the [PA woman who was accused of contributing to her own rape](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/24/justice/woman-blamed-for-her-rape/) even though she was unconscious.  It's really not hard: Google it. 
How so? (unless that requires spoilers, then don't tell me) Right now I think Edea is my strongest and the only move I really use is Judgement. Since Tiz has Performer, I can give her BP so she can attack more often. I get a lot of 9999 hits with her.
Then maybe she is the one in the right and the people who would treat you like a nerd because of it are the ones who are wrong? Think about it. More people need to act like it is 2015.
Hmm...I don't do this stuff often enough to know the right way but if I put it on my Google Drive and give you a link to the file, that would work right? (Mac guy)
You can't afaik. Every time I've gotten a firearm at  Wal-Mart I was background checked. Also do remember that those evil semi-automatics are used in a tiny percentage of gun crimes. 
I know many people who got their citizenship in boot camp. Unfortunately I myself did not. But it is definitely doable, they got snatched up now and then for citizenship classes and swore the citizenship oath prior to graduation. Ignore gunny, he's old.
Juatduck, take it easy bud, you're gotta use your head now, think about the law.Allright? What happens if you accidently hit a child with an umbrella? In the eyes of the law that is child abuse.What happens then? In the eyes of the law, you have to give your properties to the parents of that child.I'm sorry, little kid, he doesn't know the law that well.
I definitely understand where you are coming from and I'm not being critical of a selfless attitude. I'm merely recognizing reality and the fact that those who are ambitious and capable will tower over those who are not.
Shield is probably my absolute favorite active that's come out since well ever.  I hate Adc's and assassins with a burning passion, life steal and crits suck.  But I find that Shield is a great equalizer, as someone who likes Guan and Ares, it does wonders.
Maybe I wasn't very clear, but vending machines for cigarettes used to be the money maker, and most tobacco shops (no real cigars) could just have some vending machines in front of their shops and let the business roll. NOT ANY MORE.When the rule was changed and they implemented "[taspo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taspo)" system, all smokers who wanted to buy cigarettes from vending machines had to register and obtain an IC tipped card. This discouraged most smokers to use vending machines and most started using convenience stores to buy cigarettes, and many individual tobacco shops got hit.If your future shop is one with special cigars and pipes, then, the situation must be very different. Either way, I'm not really sure if it can be easy enough for non-Japanese to get a permission of tobacco/cigar selling in Japan.  http://www.mof.go.jp/tab_salt/tobacco/  (in Japanese, I can't find English pages for these explanations.)  
Have  you talked to your doctor about all of this?  Have you been tested to see if you are fertile?  Many CF men are sterile.  Also, if your wife is a carrier for CF, your chances of having a child with CF are higher.  I myself adopted.  I haven't heard of being off Kalydeco before trying to get pregnant.  I would think it would be more of an issue if your wife was taking it.  Maybe contact the company that manufactures Kalydeco and see what info they have regarding it.  All the best!
Next guest? We haven't even had our first one yet...Well, we've looked at the applications but we haven't given it much thought yet. It's not really relevant to us until we get the podcast up and running which is when we can actually do something with the list.
I'm on the same deal as you, and work all over the city.  I honestly have very few complaints about service quality.  I am incredibly happy with our deal.

Apart from the first sentence (which goes into no detail) this does not address any of what I am asking.  The rest is simply a comment on the subject of churches and charity.
This happened to me on a cruise to the Bahamas that ended at Disney World and it was unbearable. I even put on sunscreen and waited 30 min before going into the sun. I could barely walk because the pain was all encompassing and my dad kept calling me a crybaby because I was a grown ass adult crying at Disney World. My skin was blistering, peeling, and raw. Despite painkillers and aloe, I also couldn't sleep for days. Ruined the entire trip. 
not through this give away.  I am however doing another give away on /r/pcmasterrace in 5 minutes.  There will be requirements, but they will be free requirements.
&gt;As of Wednesday, the store has posted a sign in the window that reads: "To ensure that your child has a safe and enjoyable experience in our store, please do not leave them unattended."[Here's a picture of the front of the store I took a few minutes ago.](http://imgur.com/9h1XiKX) Can you spot the sign?

That's not the apps fault. Those phones are terrible for everything. Even Swagbucks will barely run on them. That's why I traded mine off with the Verizon deal.
If you find the originals, or can do this without, is there anyway you can take the sky from [this wallpaper](http://www.zoom-comics.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2011/01/calvin-and-hobbes-look-at-the-stars.jpg) and add it into the fifth, referring to Calvin and Hobbes under the tree?

Yeah it seems Sanders is picking up momentum, and quickly. And running democrat is a pretty bold strategy which is sure to make him known among far more people. It would be amazing if Stein becomes his running mate though.
Wow... just... wow.He let's you borrow his nice Ukulele, you break up with **him** (which is totally fine), but then you dare say that you get to keep *his* property as his **PAYMENT TO YOU** for hooking up with your friend... *when he was single*?I'm fucking beside myself in disbelief. I don't even know if I can be nice while saying this.Give him his god damn property back! It's not yours. What's the matter with you? How the fuck do you have any right to be mad at him for sleeping with somebody after YOU broke up with HIM. Not only that, but you feel he owes you in the form of PAYMENT for doing something he was *clearly* in the right to do.Grow the fuck up and give him his god damn property back. He is better off without you.
The emails from the new site all came within ~5 minutes. It does seem like they 'mass dump' the emails all at once.From the old site, in my experience, they send out emails at midnight CST telling you they got them, and then at 4am they send out the gift cards.
Yes, I clicked the link dude. I'm not trying to cause a problem I was not even remotely justifying what this guy did, you're looking for shit if thats what you thought. This is literally identical to something I've seen on the news very recently, probably not a week, I'm bad at keeping track of my days. No I didn't look at the date this was stated to happen, I more or less skimmed over the article. And yea, there was body cam footage of the case I saw, it was played about 5 times when it was highlighted on the news. *edit: you're right there is no body camera footage of this particular case, the case I confused it with did happen a week ago though. I was confused because they were extremely similar at a glance. I didn't pick up that the last one happened in Florida though, could've helped a lot had I remembered that.
I find that you can flesh out those details before you even eat a full meal with a person. If they suggest going to Olive Garden or like...Applebee's on a date, I'm gonna stop taking them seriously for a hot sec at the least, if not the rest of lifetime. That might make me sound pompous, but I don't care. No compromise for this guy.

I'm in a public place. There is, unfortunately, no porn. As a matter of fact, I don't think there's any T &amp; A at all. what the hell is wrong with me?
I did the exact same thing on PS3. Played it once for about an hour, never picked it up again on PS4 on a whim and tried it again, so glad I did. Fantastic game, play it!
Ooohh yes. When I was seven I got a cut on my eye with a folder. It was just the white part of my eye (I apologise for my shitty terminology), and it got better within a few days, but I can still remember that pain. Awful. 
With the 400 pt stat advantage Nico has over Kotori, it will be extremely difficult for Kotori to outscore Nico in any song... If the stat difference was closer to 250 than go with the scorer, the potential of getting the higher score than is in the scorers favorEdit: this is also under the assumption that the majority of the time you don't need PLs to FC a song
The correct answer is never. Mr. Eichel there should just refuse to report, finish college, then sign in Edmonton as a UFA, so I can relive the glory days of the 80s.^^^^^Am ^^^^^I ^^^^^being ^^^^^a ^^^^^bit ^^^^^too ^^^^^selfish ^^^^^here?
OP should not do this if they value their life. I know some crazy "feminists" with this viewpoint. They're why you can't post anything on Tumblr without getting hatemail anymore. I know someone who posted something innocent about their boyfriend and got a series of hatemail going "how do you know they're male YOU'RE ERASING TRANS PEOPLE" and various similar things.
Except for the part where I never once heard the term "black riots" while watching CNN or any other news network. Shit, I never even heard "black protestor". All they said was protestor or rioter and they all mad a very clear distinction between the two.
The man who designed the software to do it leaked it in the early 2000s because he was pissed about its proposed domestic use. It blew over. He didn't release any classified documents to prove his claims though. 
New laws need to be put into place to make Police "friendly" again and PEACE OFFICERS instead of statute/commerical law enforcers.  First step is to have cameras on every cop. Any time the cop's camera malfunctions during a questionable offense the court case against the defendant needs to be thrown out.  Hawthorn effect needs to be turned right back onto them.  I think everyone will play nicely then.  
I was just roommates with a girl who was a ranger in Torres del Paine. She said winter was the best time to go, it's cold but the weather is actually more stable (less wind). Though you might find it difficult to get up to the French valley. Also she said to watch out for pumas, she said they're a much bigger problem then the park lets on. 
No specific area in mind, although I'm shipping from Canada so you'll have to take that into account. I'd be charging you something like $8/case plus shipping, and you'd sell them at whatever price you want.What exactly do you need a picture of? An example case?

&gt;The existing 5by5 server will continue to host the existing minesmash world, but it will be part of a mult-world server Why a multiworld server? Activity on Minesmash has already been relatively low-ish for the past month or two. This move is likely to further divide the community in half, as various people choose which of the two versions of the current world they want to play on. Checking /r/5by5craft, it looks like that group has been inactive for a year. Seems unlikely that it's going to be bringing in many new peopleto fill in the gap.So if either way it's going to probably mean a drop in population...what's the benefit of making it a multi-world server, other than to even further dilute the available players over a larger area?If you're going to do this, wouldn't it make more sense to simply revive 5by5 with a single new fresh world? 
A few thoughts off the top of my head:- The left side of your heart, which is much more muscular, pumps blood to the body. The comparatively weak right side of the heart only has to push blood to the lungs to be re-oxygenated. If you reversed flow, the right side wouldn't be strong enough to move all of the blood around the body.- There are lots of valves in the circulatory system that prevent back-flow of blood (this is necessary for heart contractions to direct blood the right way and to allow blood to be pumped up-hill), so it might not flow at all even if your heart muscles were up to the job. 
RepulsiveFTFY If I were in your class my response would of gotten me suspended, I was the type of high school student who voiced their opinions often and without permission.
and they drive a Cayenne? /u/pato1908 explain yourself! You can obviously afford something nice since its a 2015... I'd suggest a 4C, but I know the interior quality can throw a lot of people off.
Context is I installed zsh and wanted it as default shell. Ultra noob as I was, I started it and uninstalled bash from within. It started to behave strangely (no shit) so I rebooted... Into a blank promptless screen. It was just a virtual machine so I installed a new distro (didn't know about snapshots). I'm sure I could have salvaged it but that was way over my skill and I itched to test a new distro.Did I learn something? Always look things up before doing them. When in doubt, hands off! It's like with mushroom hunting really. You take a risk, you potentially lose function in your kidneys for life. And no snapshots!
There is a portal to stormshield in stormwind. Its in stormwind keep in a room to the right of the king, where the old battlemasters used to be. Walking through the dark portal also gets you to draenor, and there are portals to the blasted lands all over.
Have a mechanic check it out, that will be your your best indication to the quality of the car. Only thing I'd worry about with used wrx's is that some people buy them new and drive the hell out of them, then sell them for near purchasing price  when they get around 50-70k.
[](/flutterumm) Nah, most of them are still creepy monstrosities made of legs.I make an exception for jumping spiders though. Those little buggers are so freaking cute!
Yeah ahaha, I do think Dave is gay but I'm wondering about Davekat too by Karkat's reaction. It seems like they aren't together, huh? Also Dave kept calling Karkat bro. That doesn't sound very boyfriend-y to me. Sad day, I liked that ship, but oh well they can be good friends to each other. They seem to balance each other out. Dave was way too unemotional and Karkat was just the opposite.
You're comparing a 5'x8' bathroom (that I assume you regularly shower in) to a gun safe though. I'm not familiar with that product myself, but I wouldn't completely write it off given the particular experience you had...
It's stupid that he said women shouldn't...I'm a guy and won't walk alone to my car after work (I'm a server).I already know one dude who got jumped in the six months my restaurant has been open (not a bad area, just inside the city).It's more of a general statement of diminishing your chances of something like that from happening.
I'm straight and have a gf but I had a dream once where I was about to have sex with a man, literally an inch away from pounding his tight bunghole, but I hesitated because I  knew if I didn't use a condom I could catch something and give it to my girlfriend. I woke up before I could do anything.I've had this same dream before with women, but a few of those times I go along with it and in some cases the woman transforms into another woman during the sex. Pretty weird!Edit: was my comment even relevant to yours? Lol
Flameblast is the gg race build right now. Flameblast, flame trap, and then arc, from what I've been able to gather. It's easy to gear for spells because of the ability to get '+1 to X gems' wands with an easy vendor recipe. That alone will carry you for a long time.
I just yelled in excitement super loud. I know Raiders were excited about Leo, but Cooper makes a fuck lot of more sense. The defense is fine, the O-line is fine, you guys needed playmakers, and Cooper was the biggest one in this draft.I fucking love this pick for the Raiders.
Uh...how are you comparing unlimited talk &amp; text to 100 minutes talk? 100 minutes is used fairly quickly if you make calls frequently. Also T-Mobile post-paid plans are contract free so that would be what most people would compare to Fi. You have to compare plans with similar features for the comparison to make sense in the scope of the general population. Pre-paid plans typically target a specific audience. I guess you don't understand subsidies then. You pay a lower price initially, but the rest of the cost is built into the plan cost so you're still paying for it, just over time. Difference is you continue paying that built-in cost every month well after the device would have been paid off if you don't upgrade at your scheduled upgrade date. Fi offers for you to pay off the device over 24 months interest free. So in reality Fi's plan is advantageous.
It is mostly related to Heathenry, but I've known Druiths (the term I use for people mixing Druidry and Heathenry together) to have read the book and liked it.
South Howard, man.Althought, to be fair, I used to go to The Lodge and see Josh Freeman there all the time.  So maybe it's not a good idea for Jameis.
"I'm pretty sure I don't exist"This is one of the recurring ones for me. It's not really unsettling or nerving, but I catch myself saying this both out loud and in my head when tripping from time to time.
This is the problem with criminals.If they can see the obvious damage they do they won't do it - it's just that they have trouble seeing the damage, say, stealing motorcycle from a 37 year old man does. The loss, the inconvenience, the time wasted, the money lost etc. It's harder to for them to see.

This story has been running around here for a couple of days.   My guess is that the COLTS attorney is not happy about how the transit authority handled the situation.
If you are good enough for people to hire you, I would consider advertising yourself as a personal chef. That might lower start-up costs as you would use a client's kitchen and equipment. Plus, initial costs of groceries would be paid back by the client as well.
Damn, that sucks. It's an amazing video. I share the link to it as often as I can find a halfway decent reason to do so. Looks like I'll need to scout around for a few more halfway decent reasons...
I'm not op, but I used to work as a projectionist at a theater that had one house with a film projector.  We didn't use it very often, it was really only for when a movie came out early on film.  I imagine there are a decent amount of theaters that still do that on occasion.
If your argument is contingent on intangible and immeasurable concepts, then we are just arguing "well, I think....." I'm not doing that. I'm not wasting my time with everyone that wants to discuss morality. How moral is it to stunt the contributions people are willing to make to society because you disincentivize them with fees/taxes. How moral is it to prevent mutually consenting people from interacting simply because they agree to lower amounts than the government thinks they should? How moral is it reward slackers and otherwise untalented people at the expense of more talented/motivated people simply because they earn more? How moral is it to..... Its not worth my time because you can't give me an objective answer
We used to play there, then realised it was a shithole in a shit part of town and moved! ;-)But yeah, its nice that there's such a lot of football history in our city.
Haha rich people can be assholes... Yeah I have some good friends and stuff, but there's a layer to it now. Friends v business, friends v money. As long as you're aware of the layer you're OK. 
&gt; I just would like to point out that you can use lethal force only when you're in danger of death or severe bodily harm. It's not a simple "Guy was doing this so I can shoot him."Actually, you're allowed to use deadly force to defend against robbery.&gt;He or she reasonably believes that such other person is committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping, forcible rape, forcible criminal sexual act or robbery; - See more at: http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/ONE/C/35/35.15#sthash.GxpCv3LE.dpufN.Y. PEN. LAW § 35.15Also, I will reiterate - do not draw on cops, no matter how wrong they may be. At best, you just shot a cop and now you have to defend yourself in court. At worst, you got yourself shot and the cop is a hero.
Last week, someone said to me, "Fish are not animals."I told a different person about this idiotic comment, and that person said, "But fish aren't animals."Facepalm.
And to think, just four short hours ago you said: "an open source project requiring open source developers to indemnify a major corporation for their legal expenses. Again, this is factually false. That is NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING. Just because you say it is, does not make it so." Here's something for you to take back to Australia with you, Rob. Most American lawyers pretty quickly learn not to make assertions that they cannot back up with facts. Have you ever read section 7.1.5?? Before you start labeling anyone a troll or liar and making defamatory accusations, maybe you should take a good long look in the mirror and have a chat with your company's lawyer!
He's made a lot of boneheaded decisions since he became commissioner years ago. He usually gets booed much more heartily than that too, I was disappointed in Chicago's lack of animosity
&gt;Lol I only read your last few sentences cause im sure the rest is BS.That just perpetuates your ignorance. I give you facts and you have nothing to say but "lalalalalala" with your fingers in your ears. No need to say more.
LOL.  We're the trolls here?  You asked what the protest was about, and here we are, ACTUAL SUPPORTERS of such protests, and here you are complaining about us describing our position?
What i personally really like about the skatepark community is that absolutely none of them is able to wake up in the early morning.LPT; early bird get the skatepark to himself. ;)

Not a teacher but found out a teacher that was the sister of my neighbors (who were a nightmare) husband talking shit about me. Never had her as a teacher but 5 of my friends told me about this she would say that I was an unruly kid, shot marshmallows all over her brothers house would bother them all the time. Flooded there back yard and was just not a good person period. I ended up going up to her saying hey Ms. T I'm John. So I heard you were talking shit about me to the rest of the students now I have 5 other students that will collaborate this story and I'm good friends with the superintendent as he was my middle school principal. So if you wish to keep your fucking job, I don't want to hear that my name came out of your mouth ever again. She was crying and told me okay and went back into her office. 
there goes cinderhulk and my favorite meta, alright everyone back to no one other than midlane having fun in the game, lee sin and burst mages forever. ability to come back late game? no thank you ff @ 20 if LB gets first blood. salt
You forget that the Legion has a howitzer at the Fort.If the Legion wins at Hoover Dam and overwhelms the Boomers, there's no reason not to assume that the Lucky 38 would be demolished in a bombardment from the guns the Legion would possess. House's patience would mean nothing at that point.

People can also use the Internet to try to impose their sanctimonious bullshit on others without subjecting themselves to moral scrutiny. Most of the guys passing themselves off as outraged would do it at the drop of a hat if they had a chance with the right married woman. They'd  forget all about what they said here. Posers. Also, a correction - I didn't say I was superior. I don't believe that. Ali I did was answer OP and make an off-hand comment about married women. Then the fake outrage machine started. The trolls are those who fake outrage while wishing me ill simply for telling the truth about something the vast majority of married men have done. Don't believe me on that - look up infidelity rates yourself. I've examined the moral implications closely. If people are going to debate me on that, at least make an argument. Labels, name-calling, and wishing people dead doesn't cut it.
My dad gave me a piece of advice about whether or not to have kids that he'd gotten himself in his youth. "If you're uncertain, for any reason, *don't*."

You might want to say that you are also talking about standard sized maps.From experience, games on larger+ maps will last so long, that a single unique unit that is only relevant for a short time no matter how good it is, won't have much impact.

No. Clingy is sending multiple messages a day with no reply.Asking a guy with a single text to stop wasting your time, because otherwise youll make other plans, is completely allowed.If he somehow feels smothered by a request to adhere to normal protocals for human interaction, well thats a fucking big red flag there as to how selfish he acts.
Laurel never loved a woman...You mean the woman *her sister* used to love. And I think you also meant to say the man she *once* loved, in regards to Laurel's feelings for Oliver, not the man once she loved. I think that's why your comment came off confusing.
It's a shame the girl seemingly just got a slap on the wrist and was let go. Pussy pass in action. Would've been funny to hear about an Aussie chick get lethally injected.

I'm not perverted enough to have any idea what you are talking about.  If I had that app, which I don't, I would enjoy the privacy, which I don't need because I have a loving girlfriend who is also a redditor. 
there is quite a bit of evidence against creationism. while it may be hard to find out how the world was created, you could definitely say that it wasn't made in the way the bible said it was. even if i did believe in god, i would still hate the fucker anyway
Moutinho and Toulalan both grew to 86 for me for a short time with Monaco. They stayed steady at 85 for at least 2-3 seasons before I sold them; those 2 were so consistent for me...rarely had &lt;8.0 games and possibly never picked up an injury. Benzema, who I bought at 87, is currently sitting at a 91. Performs every game. 
No, that's actually called temperature protection and basically all chips have it. Temperature control means that the mod can sense the temperature of the coil, and limit it to below a set temperature. It gives a better vape, and prevents dry hits. 
Much good advice in other replies, but adding some. Unless you plan to run past enemies it is a good idea to prepare your char with many many low level medium dmg spells. Those soul arrows, dark orbs and lightning spears (depending on build) should be set up on numerous slots and with extra casts. As you grow more powerful increase the power of them. Get faith 40 quickly and talk to Licia for the best priest/paladin hood. Get 20 int and 20 faith and talk to the hexer at the start of Copse for the best mage/hexer hood and best hex staff. Extra sunlight spears and crystal soul spears win the day. Generally infuse catalysts and bring several catalysts for each school of magic. As a pure caster you can carry two catalysts easily since you don't carry weapons. Some levels are long so carrying a backup boosted catalyst is smart. 
Join the 0 fucks crowd. We're tired of the bs too. So now we just play for fun. Terrible BR? No problem.Terrible teams? Also no problem because look at how many fucks I give? 0. Losing? Thats fine too. In fact I'll just plink away at other tanks like everyone else instead of you know... playing the objective.Playing the objective is for losers. We're not here to be losers. We're here to win. So we're going to shoot tanks.
i donated pretty much right before my initial TRT workup.i had low ferritin but all other iron was normal. would you guess the low ferritin was from donating?
The attitude that we shouldn't expect horny college boys to be able to control themselves is exactly what people mean when they talk about "rape culture."
I just recently started a job as a rod man for construction surveying, and from what I've heard, my employer has gone through about 6 or 7 people prior to myself, even with the job starting at $16 hourly and full benefits.  I get the idea that most of the people hired prior to myself either couldn't deal with working on a bridge project due to heights or they couldn't deal with the long hours and early days, which has caused them to go through so many people to try and find someone.
I actually went and purchased an iPod Classic recently (~1 year ago).My rationale at this time was that I had a vast music library which I collected over the years (being a Millennial, it meant that all my CDs got transferred over to MP3s, along with other "alternative" methods) that I didn't want to get go. Also, I wanted to download a fucktonne of podcasts as a back-catalog that I can listen to whenever I want.This was going well, up until I was able to get an iPhone with had LTE on it. Now that meant that I almost exclusively listen to Spotify for all of my songs. I still don't pay for premium, but if I want to listen to a song that I want when not at a computer, I'll just look it up on Youtube. My iPod, which I bought completely new, is currently sitting in my desk drawer, literally gathering dust. 
i read all your posts. You understand how narratives work and you're completely right. Unfortunately most people wouldn't know narrative themes if they bit them on the ass. The tones, story lines, goals, and behaviors of both shows/sets of characters are so different. Seeing Matt Murdock just walk up and chill out with Coulson simply wouldn't make any sense right now. 
But she's not an egg donor, these are embryos they created for in-vitro fertilization with the intent to raise them together.  She would have none of the protections regular egg donors have, and she can't just sign a paper saying she wants nothing to do with *already created* embryos any more than a man can.  
thats a nice idea because it will let u skip the first low levels that u can actualy 1 shot. and on hight levels heavenly strike its actualy garbage it does 2 to 5% dmg  :/

I don't know, I have no use for any of them really as you can see. I'm just gonna hold on to them in hopes they become like a collectors item like some sigs
I haven't had any recurring dreams since I was a kid.    One that I remember was that the old, disused BBQ we had in our backyard would somehow catch fire and end up burning the entire house down while I was sleeping. I made my Dad check it all the time to make sure it was 'dead'.
I would want Villager.In box or out of box, doesn't really matter to me. Packaging: doesn't even need it, so any is coolio. First, Im not a collector. Sorry for choosing the 'rarest' one, but... Well, here's my story. When I heard about amiibos, I decided not to collect them all, just get my mains. Dedede, Ness, and Villager. Ouch. Well, I go to best buy, where I preordered smash, and I think to myself, 'eh, no rush to get him.  Villager's gonna be super common. Nobody wants him.' I apparently couldn't have been any more wrong. So TL;DR, im really bad at guessing.I'm not a collector, I'd just be playing with him. :) Anyways, even if I don't win, thank you for doing this, OP! This sub is always so nice. :D
Man, I always forget about Ian's death. I think I wanna block it out of my memory cause shit doesn't make sense. Ali pushed him and killed him. So why did A move the body? Why make it look like a suicide? It seems completely pointless for A to pin Ali's death on Ian, because it'll never come back to A (because he knows it never happened) and it's something A could use to torture the girls with. 
Water Bending, because Water makes up a significant portion of pretty much all living things, a lot of the atmosphere, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc. I would, with enough practice and meditation, be able to control anyone's mind, for example, and a lot more beyond that.
 Having positive physical experiences with a parent actually sets a child up to be comfortable giving and receiving physical affection, and is stored as a positive subconscious feeling about physical love in relationships.  In fact, many people who have difficulty expressing physical affection to their partners relate this to their family not being very physically affectionate.
One note, generally any tornado in Oklahoma county will be south of downtown OKC or north of Edmond. By no means a fact but Edmond hasn't had significant damage from a tornado in 25+ years. Good rule of thumb anyways.

Thank you for the advice. I was actually informed today by the management I talked to that the issue was now in the hands of HR because of similar complaints. The suggestion put to me was to keep quiet so as not to put ammunition in the the other party's hands.
Amiibo:RosalinaIn/out of box: in if possible, but if not oob is cool :)Packaging: doesn't matterReason: by the time I started collecting, she was impossible to find, and I think she's one of the best looking amiibo and would like to add her to my growing collection!
Yeah, I went to my bank today to speak to someone directly. I wound up having to call a card services number and talking to them they said that no transaction had ever come up from Manadarake, like they hadn't processed the transaction. I don't know if thats because Manadarake was asking for a credit card and I was using my debit card, though I don't really see that being an issue. Either way, I was able to pay for the cover I should get a shipping email here in the next few days.
Um. Bands + artists, favorite atm off the top of my skull: Nine Inch Nails (always), Bright Eyes, Earl Sweatshirt, Brand New, Sia.Really depends on the mood.I really hope that the OP wasn't bullshitting about his list. That was EPIC.
Idc how that game ends because i didnt bet on it but 85% for C9 is so fucking retarded LOL. Like they just changed 2 player and LG got ptr as well. So on what basis are 85% of the people betting on C9
Not sure about seasonal allergies, but my husbands runny nose and snoring went way down when he cut out gluten. Do you do low-carb wraps or pasta on keto? If not, you may be accidentally going gluten free and seeing benefits from that.
I taught English at a school in Tokyo.  My colleague always complained about this one student of his, usually calling her a major pain in the ass.One day I substituted for him.  The first time I turned around to write on the board I was kancho'd.
I know somebody (not Mormon). That was robbed in Ecuador.  They were 22 at the time.  In a separate incident, my daughter had a couple of Peruvian friends from college.  They came from a wealthy family and had body guards.  My daughter decided to venture out a little later than them because she was tired.  She was robbed at gunpoint.  I WARNED her.  
Though those are issues, pretty sure they can put them up fast because of the construction methods they use. Compare regulations to 1920s America, still took them much longer back then. 
i wish every house was like this - you walk in and the owner has their music taste displayed clearly on the wall. in cases like this you would just be able to walk back out again and trash that person from your facebook, phone contacts etc.
I have literally watched every game of Leonard Williams career. He is going to be a MONSTER for us. I am so excited I'm buying his jersey as soon as it's on sale. It is my sincere belief he is the best player in the draft.Edit: Welp...
Ya I hug all my friends pretty good now, except the ones that continually gave me an awkward "really bro?" look after.I can't really disagree with the classification of "coupled" vs "single," but everything here is basically what I was thinking for years while "coupled" in my last relationship:    -  laying in bed, feeling really alone, wanting to even just snuggle/spoon.  -  wondering how long it's been since anyone touched me.I've moved on pretty good from everything, but touch is the one thing that still gets me.  I can't help but laugh at myself about in the moment *(and feel awkwardly uncomfortable about after)* about how happy it makes me to get a solid hug that was initiated by the other person *(and not the awkward, obligatory, end-of-date, i'm-hugging-you-out-of-politeness-to-avoid-greater-contact hug).*  I feel like it's weird . . . 
&gt;Without the how it is very likely that we have rather mundane explanationThe two seem pretty unrelated to me... Layman here for sure, but like... just because you don't know how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work. Practically, I understand where you're coming from, but one doesn't say much about the other technically.
There's not much difference between a Keynesian liberal and a social democrat. He also supports universal health care and tuitionless higher education, which are both social democratic positions.
I was at work last summer, between my junior and senior year of college, and had a customer tell me to go to trade school. He asked what I was studying and I told him music and he responded with "What a useless major, you're better off going to trade school and working towards a real career where you'll actually make money." Fuck him. I'm going to grad school in the fall. 
That's one of those scenes where my TV will be on in the background while I'm getting ready to go out or something, and then the heist sequence starts and even if I'm late for an appointment it's like "Shit, guess I've gotta sit down and watch the next fifteen minutes of this movie."
Nobody is expecting a cargo ship to perform the same as a real carrier (or "super carrier"), but it would be significantly more accessible for players to get. Finding and purchasing a real carrier will likely be difficult and have lots of restrictions (especially if it's a military ship). A cargo ship? Not so much.I'd be all for having it be able to deploy/drop/uncrate its cargo. Keep in mind that the Hull E has no facilities to resupply, repair, launch or even board stored ships, so the process of getting people in the ships and the ships out of crates would likely be slow, awkward, and not efficient. The ships are transported exposed and the Hull itself is not well armed or armored. But it could work.
I taunt after most kills. In 64 it was called "Fighter Stance", and you got bonus points for doing it at the end of a match in the Story Mode. Because of that, I've always thought of it as just the thing to do after a kill.Sometimes I use it randomly in the middle of a match for intentional disrespect though, but that's different.
I managed to get every day this weekend off except for Friday because I'm shooting a short film on Saturday and Sunday.And I work box office on Friday, so it won't even be that bad.My co-workers hate me right now.

TBH Cali makes a mockery of "medicinal marijuana" - any Joe Blo can fake a cough and get some bud. But it makes it look bad for the real sick people out there who actually need cannabis. Chemo patients, glaucoma sufferers etc.If people (adults only ofc) just want to get high, they should just be able to buy some weed like you would buy a carton of grog with your ID at the bottleO (er, bongO?).Agree with you on the rest though.
DEAR GOD WILLIAMS OR PICKS OUT THE ASS YES PLEASEedit: didn't expect Scherff if we were taking BPA.  I thought we could have gotten him if we traded down.  Oh well, I trust Scott.
Rekkles hopped the team once from Fnatic to Alliance when it looked like fnatic was breaking up. Basically every time before he stayed on fnatic. Even during his time playing for the Wolves it was clear he would go back to Fnatic so what do you mean by team hopper? If the team you are on breaks up and you want to be on the very best team and it looks like the best team (and elements looked great going into the split) wants to pick you up, is it bad to switch? Rekkles looked like an extremely ambitious guy and really which of the changing moves he did do you disagree so heavily on?

Police brutality and abuse is very much an issue that needs to be addressing.  But how does it help anything in defending those that are damaging and looting from local businesses?  That just makes those that can help address the issue less willing to help out.  The more people riot and loot the more justification it gives for the police to obtain more military gear and that use more force.  Its really self defeating really especially when a good portion of the rioting and looting is done by those coming in for fun because they know they can get away with it.

I can remember the exact time all those coma theories came into existence in a massive wave, and it was just after the 'Ash is in a coma' Pokemon theory. Pretty soon everyone was shoehorning shit in to whatever they could. The Rugrats one is particularly bad and still gets circulated around a lot.Also 'we didn't see X die, therefore X is alive,' which is even worse when it actually comes true.

Every time I check in on this subreddit I get more and more depressed, it's just so much bitching and moaning about how being short such a terrible fucking curse that there's no way to overcome.At 5'2" I'm shorter than just about all of the short guys on here, yet somehow I don't seem to run in to most of the problems they constantly complain about.  I wonder if that has anything to do with not giving a fuck about my height.  When you make everything about your height, your height is all people see because you constantly point it out, when you act like a decent fucking human being, that's what people see.
To be fair, if we are talking about John Waters, then yes, there are only a few bars where wealthy old white people drink, I guess.  A decent proportion of the rest of the bar crowd is Hopkins and UM  students.    And to be honest, in the working class areas which are less gentrified, especially farther out towards the county, there is a pretty decent racial mix in many of the popular drinking establishments. 
I think the other player was a hacker or at least there was a hacker in your session. Some destroying the game by killing all players simultaneously, others throw cash around and drop other items of all kind.
You do understand that God permits divorce under certain circumstances, correct? He has not unanimously forbade it. He hates it, true, but it is not forbidden universally. The fact that divorce is legal does not invalidate the Christian ideal of the sanctity of marriage. 
&gt;but after it was lowered off of the lift and I drove it around the parking lot I noticed it rode a little harder than before.Your struts are junk.Sometimes when they are bad enough having them fully extended (like from being on a lift) will do them in for good.  They were broken anyway (would have done this on their own soon) and the garage is in no way responsible for this.It's maintenance time.  This is a safety issue.  And if these are original (I'm guessing they are) they are well overdue to be changed.
When I was maybe 5 or 6, my much older sister would use these poop-looking chocolates to make it seem like she was eating poop from the cat box, and try to get me to pull one out and eat it.  Either I never fell for it, or blocked the memory.  Mostly sure it's the former. =/
Yup, just 2015 sets. I hadn't used CCBS before the reboot, it was hard for me at first to figure out how to use the system well, especially for bigger builds.
How many pushups can you do? The idea that you can do ten full pullups but can't bench more than 60 pounds doesn't make any sense to me.Also, if you can "almost" do 10 full pullups in a row, you haven't even close to reached a plateau. The idea that switching to weights is going to make you progress faster is false. I'd save your money.
The Vaccinator isn't no means a horrible weapon, but in a more competitive setting, the slower rate of healing really hurts. The Vaccinator helps with damage the player is taking while you are healing them, but it's going to take way longer to heal up any players that took damage while you weren't healing them. Plus, you'll be going into most mid fights at a major health because you can't distribute overhealed at the same rate another medic can.It's great at keeping the player you are currently healing alive and a good Vaccinator medic can be frustrating to deal with, but it is inferior in team healing and that ends up being more important in competitive.

This one is more of an intro and I'm still wrapping my head around the whole topic, but it's great to think about. http://www.core77.com/posts/12752/a-periodic-table-of-form-the-secret-language-of-surface-and-meaning-in-product-design-by-gray-holland-12752
How? Are you using an enhance active? The scenario you just described would be a total of ~3 million for the entire team, not per Kali. A max plussed Kali would do about 700k by herself. Even if you're talking about ultimate Kali, a max plussed Kali will be doing 1m damage, no where close to 2m. To get 2m per Kali on a 5x activation with no enhance (pre uvo), a +99 atk Kali would need 4 light TPAs and 12 total combos, which isn't possible without skyfalls.
Oh man this was great the Onion reviews are always so good. I thought it was pretty great he specifically mentioned Marvel's gigantic roster and then referred to all the DC heroes as just Batman and Superman. 
A guys instincts and a girls instincts on sex are very different especially at young age. A 15 year old boy would fuck anything with a pulse and a vag. Is this the same for a 15 year old girl? We are also raised and pre determined what are sexual roles are in society.
Very true! Thank god they are removing a lot of these level crossings, hope that Clayton Rd is on the list.EDIT: Page 6 of the report actually recommends that the money spent on the Metro could be better spent on removing level crossings... I guess Labor are doing both so that's good!
Of course its practical. All it takes is some straightening up. If you manage 2 semesters of 4.0, that basically evens you out to about 3.12, if the whole unit count is even, with 4 semesters to go.You have 6 more tries at it. If you even average a 3.5 for the next 6 semesters, you'll end up with like a 3.2.The underlying problems are your study habits and understanding *why* you got a bad GPA, and take steps to fix it.

I highly recommend you do a quick search for the few posts by men complaining about their wives' bodies post-pregnancy and notice 2 things: 1, that they are *very* few and far between. Do you really think so little of your husband that he didn't prepare for this when he married you? 2, these men get absolutely scathing responses from pretty much everyone. There is no support for guys who complain about the body change their wives endure for birthing the child they sired.

Here you go: ^\(\^.\^)I have to admit, this one was difficult to make. The trick is to backslash-escape the left cheek-parenthesis and the eye-carets.

It reminds me of the quotation from Stephen Colbert - "The more you know, the sadder you get." I will read all of these different topics for school and just barely touch on them, and I want to learn more about them, but it just isn't feasible, and I realize that there is so much out there that is waiting for me to discover and learn about, and it will most likely never happen. And that makes me sad. 
Every time a president visits the University of Texas and does the "hook 'em horns" sign with their hand, the conspiracists cite it as an example that they worship Satan.

Yes, indeed the lyrics are there. For example, here's the page for [I Appear Missing](http://imgur.com/W2iDgT0) that I immediately made into a wallpaper.
I don't think this is the case. As far as I know, only J'zargo levels up with the player. I have read that transforming a follower into an animal with the Wabbajack resets their level to that of the player, but I have never bothered to verify this myself.I do think that followers are set to a level when you first meet them. Take for example Borgakh the Steel Heart, a female Orc that can be your follower, who lives in [Mor Khazgur.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mor_Khazgur)Her level is set to the player's level, up to a maximum of level 30. Her armor is always Heavy Armor, but depends on the player's level. If you meet her at level 30 or higher, she'll be wearing Orcish Armor. At lower levels it will be steel if I remember correctly.So if you have a favorite follower in mind it might be best to look up their maximum level and wait until you hit that before you meet them. That way they'll be at maximum strength.
It's not easy to reference these things when reading the ebook. On of my biggest pet peeve is being unable to check maps a d other references, and a regular look st the cover. Hell I've read entire series and forgotten the name of the author because I don't see it every time I open the book.
I can't speak on anything specific, but just know that (in the US) OTC supplements are basically unregulated, rarely contain what's on the label, and don't even work when they *do*. [Here, have a source!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQI3dlQP5gI)
Didn't say it won't take advantage of them, but that in parallel the input voltage means the board will be locked to 60w mode. YiHi programmed the board to only run in 120w mode when presented with series input voltage. Both series and parallel would give you the same battery life at the same power level, but series open up the full capabilities of the board, so there's no reason to use it in parallel. 
I thought a lot of the Danganronpa 2 characters looked off.  Something about then seemed...sinister I guess.  In the end, I understand the art direction better.   
i tend to disagree with the law, however. I don't know exactly where to draw the line, but having one drink shouldn't mean you are off the hook as a girl. And when both members are drunk, I don't think you should be able to lay blame on the guy either. 
Exactly, *спасибо за то, что &lt;clause&gt;*, but you can also shorten it to *спасибо, что &lt;clause&gt;*. The former is slightly more formal. (However, speakers of the younger generation tend to use bare *что* less frequently, saying things like *слышала, то что он женился*, so I'd expect the shorter construction to fall out of use, too.)
Thanks very much - that link had a great deal note info than I was able to find last night, so that's promising. Thanks also for forwarding that question along.The more I read about this the more excited I am, assuming it delivers on the premise.

Honestly, I haven't seen much of the mainstream media calling what happened a "black riot". However, I have heard a lot of this from reddit, more than anywhere else. Specifically, /r/videos .
Yeah minorities can't be criticized for racism by white people. This is why whites can't criticize Japan for their racist genocide and rape spree through Asia in the 1930's. Whites can't come in and help stop the genocide in Rwanda because it's two black ethnicities involved, and blacks can't be racist. 
Well, it made sense in the context of the time, but it no longer does. It's still an entirely valid criticism of a supposedly perfect and unchanging "word of God," just for a different reason than some people assume on its face.
Deism believes in a non-personal deity who does not interact with humans or creation in general. They generally believe that a higher power created everything and set everything in motion, but doesn't after that hasn't really done anything
You have it pretty good luckily. You make a lot more money and have much cheaper rent than Midwestern people who straddle the poverty line. I had the same issues with not wanting to shop for groceries because fast food required less interaction and was instant gratification. In actuality, purchasing groceries requires the same amount of interpersonal interaction, except you have to walk by people in aisles and pretend like you weren't aware of their existence more often... which is much easier than paying for fast food/groceries in the first place. Invest time in yourself to make actual food and save lots of money that way. Hey, at least you aren't burning it all on drugs.
Well.. Then Manpower, Addeco, Centric, and Tech4Hire are either lying not don't know their shit. There are always companies hiring that do not care about Norwegian skills. Especially in IT.Could it be that what they mean is that your particular skill-set is competing with a lot of Norwegians? A degree in in IT isn't really saying much of course, but more specifically? What have you done in the past? How can you be an asset for a company?This is something the recruiters look at. They don't want to help *you*, they want to help the company hiring a guy. For you to be that guy you have to help the recruiter by telling them all about you.

Bigger doesn't always mean better either, it also has to do with the cut, clarity, and color, and usually bigger diamonds are less likely to have a good color/clarity. And if they do, will cost an arm and a leg. The thing I see lately is halo rings, where there are a lot of small diamonds around a bigger diamond to give the illusion of a huge diamond, in which case the carat may not be as big as one single diamond. There are just so many trade offs when it comes to diamonds and rings, IMO, and really depends on the couple. Mine is a three stone and sometimes I wish I had more stones to make it look bigger but I know I never actually would be able to do it. Maybe instead of upgrading the ring you can add another ring as an anniversary band or something, that way she can keep the original engagement ring. Some are even angled to frame or "enhance" the ring, and then she can also solder them together to make essentially one ring.

I've already explained it to you. It's just not what I enjoy. I don't like the, for a lack of a better term "flippy shit"  And they're backstage movie-eque style of storytelling is probably the biggest turn off for me, it makes it kinda hard to get into.  I do sometimes catch the end of it on the taima streams and check out the videos on Youtube and there certainly is some in-ring stuff I enjoy. When I put aside the other stuff, there is some solid in-ring action there. For example the casket match with Fenix and Mil Muertes was a match I really enjoyed
&gt; But this needs to stop being the sole focus of the discussion. There also needs go be a focus on men not attacking women in the first place.what makes you think that his office is taking no steps to address the Josue in other ways?

How does energy density makeup of the universe coming out of the Friedman-Roberston Walker metric relate to "crazy" technology? Dark matter and energy are absolutely established, just not discovered on a particle level.

Yeah but imagine being the stylist standing there for 10 hours a day. You constantly have people there to talk to who don't want to talk to you. I assume it would be pretty boring if no one would have a conversation with you all day.

Don't be too upset about that. If she did it to you then chances are shes gonna do it to the next guy (who I guess is also her ex). Probably dodged a bullet.
I would suggest 4. Even if you didn't like it, the Premium edition is quite cheap, and all the gripes people had with it on launch day have been repaired. Hardline is a bit... Eh. Even with only 2 months to play BF4 before Hardline came out, it was a blast to play.
Only issue is not with her...but when you do terminal legendary quests on her it doesn't count for some reason. Anyone else experiencing this? When I kill a boss it acts like nothing happened. Sucks when leveling up.

To be honest, the TV show's ending was just as dark, with [](/s "Homura separated from Madoka forever in a world where only she could remember her.")I kinda like the idea of [](/s "devil Homura"), but would've preferred to see an End of Eva-style "alternate ending" movie to the approach Rebellion took, "overwriting" the old ending's value as an ending with new, unnecessary plot.

lol I was a psych major so my basic technique is this:most people who are assholes (see:trolls) do it because they hurt deep inside and they've learned to believe--usually via their parents/caregivers/family--that putting others down will elevate themselves.  Obviously, this is fundamentally untrue.  We're social creatures and we enjoy giving.  Also, People hate to face themselves.  So I use the presumption that they're not simply a sociopath having fun (hard to say the likelihood), use basic psychoanalysis and just tell 'em the truth about themselves.  They usually battle a few rounds before I shut them down...sometimes it's longer but I like to think maybe I can break through to just one and help them!

Hey all!I downloaded the beta version and snagged the apk off my OPO since it's rooted/unlocked. This *should* be everything you need if you don't want to join the beta (**Note:** If Bungie asks me to remove this, I will!)EDIT: Link removed per Bungie request, thanks!
As an Auburn fan, showing highlights against us is way too easy. Our DBs were not good last year. Cooper shredded us, but it was not just because of his skills. Showing him against LSU is a much better showing of talent.
I've eaten there at like 3 am before.Maybe it changed though.Actually there's Dennys on north road that's 24 hours now that I think of it.Austin and north road I believe.
+1 For my local shop. Their max vg line is pretty incredible, with  stand-outs for me being Pluto's Paradise and Quasar. They've even started selling another vendors juice called Slurp and it is very passable for a Looper/Cereal Killah alternative.
I have no plans for ever getting plastic surgery, regardless of what pregnancy does to me, since I wouldn't want to take money away from my family, or put myself at physical risk (and risk leaving kids with no mom!) for a cosmetic elective surgery.
He isn't averse to diversity in STEM, he is averse to the people with the personality stereotypical of Gender Studies or similar. My best friend is a woman in my STEM Major. She is awesome. And she spends her time encouraging EVERYONE to join our field, because we are passionate about it. 
as someone who has worked at the eastern market in Detroit, I've seen it many of times. Forklifts break or are outdated, park them in an alley, within a night they completely stripped. Talk about a chopshop....
I did HH then Dead Money. I still haven't played OWB or LR. But JE Sawyer, one of the developers, said on his formspring that he thought it should be HH-&gt;DM-&gt;OWB-&gt;LR. Which is why I played it in that order.Of course he also said it does not truly matter, since the stories are specifically designed to stand on their own two feet, and reinforce each other subtly no matter the order. 
Good point about it being in writing. I think ordinarily the business owner could get away with throwing the employee under the bus, but it's going to be difficult to explain the call sheet.

The problem with all that is that it doesn't actually matter. Noone cares or appreciate you for it, it has no impact on your or their lifes, instead it rather makes people dislike you. Social interaction and friendship is very important. You need people you can rely on sooner or later and you won't build any of these relationships with bridge burning behaviour.
Do some people not grasp the concept of jobs around here? There's constantly guys getting super upset that others are spending big money on shoes without even thinking that the buyer could potentially have a well paid job and is secure financially

But remember, he hit the ball hard. Which makes it a great plate appearance according to tHom.Doesn't matter that he hit them hard, straight to defenders for outs.

Go for it; it's cheap and effective. I've been using it on my cut. I suggest that you read up on EC stacks before taking one though. Take a look at this chart for a suggested dosage. http://i.imgur.com/1xvs64Z.png
Full quote from the Woj article:&gt;When Rondo realized his run with the Celtics was over this year, he planned to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer, league sources told Yahoo Sports. He expected a maximum contract. Once Dallas made the trade, he was open to re-signing with the Mavericks – only there are no max contract offers for Rondo on the market.Not that there's anyway to defend Rondo at this point, but the full quote suggests he wasn't always going to leave Dallas. Only if things didn't work out - which because of him - they didn't.

I don't have any specific examples, but I do have some ideas. You could use tabs, but I don't think they would apply here. I would just make it so each page slides in from the right after the user presses an FAB to submit the page. If they want to go back, they could swipe to the right (sliding the page from the left). You could put a progress bar at the bottom of the page, or it would be really cool to have the progress bar [around the FAB](http://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_3/material_ext_publish/0B0NGgBg38lWWbTlSaHdQZEMtalk/components-progressactivity-typesofindicators-061101_Circular_Aspirational_xhdpi_002.webm), and have the FAB stay constant while the paper pages slide underneath it. Don't use the back arrow in the navigation bar to go back, because the expected action for that is to exit the form.
Some friends and I went last year, it was FANTASTIC.  The weather could not have been nicer, and the scenery is just...ridiculous.  The music, of course, was beyond great.  Greensky Bluegrass late night is going to be out of control.  Definitely check them out.  It's just me and a buddy of mine this year, send me a message if you want to meet up!  These things are always more fun in a group.
Pegasus Seiya starts out as being a sound-speed building buster, and ends up having universal strength and massively FTL speed by the EoS, so there's that.

[Sora no Woto](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6802/So_Ra_No_Wo_To) - Much more than simply K-On in the military, but the similarities are there. It has the whole tightknit group of girls dynamic, but it's set in a military platoon in a post-apocalyptic world and gets quite heavy at times and has some very memorable scenes. I really can't decide which show I like more between the two. They both have lovable characters, but there's definitely more substance to this show. The worldbuilding is incredible, its themes of finding oneself and finding meaning in the world were very thought provoking and left a really good impression of this show as something much more than another SoL.Also, it's not a show about music though there is significance to Kanata and her trumpet playing.
It is a joke. And the worst part is the intentional mixture of academics and athletics. We're a school that has sports teams not the other way around.Look, I was in the band so I marched on Kyle for four years. I was in the basketball band so I attended every men's and women's basketball game for three years. That was before Gillispie and only the 9–19 first year under Gary Blair. I was on the volleyball band the one season we had one so I attended every one of their home games even though I didn't understand more than the minimum and just cheered when our team did because I assumed we must have done something well. I went to as  many baseball games as I could and tried to get to some softball and soccer as well...I enjoy Aggie athletics.But that is an awful, awful seal and we shouldn't combine the two. I did not get a diploma from the athletics department.
Gotta keep going up ccs to compete with the correctly made 1000cc bikes from other manufactures.No but really though, L Twins are great at producing midrange torque, but the massive size of the pistons is a disadvantage in revs, so they output less horsepower due to lower redline. So you have to make up for it by making more overall torque, thus the increase in capacity. Also, the engines got more and more oversquare to further shorten the piston travel length to shift the torque in the upper range. And they will never go I4 to keep their characteristic sound. 
your line saying "only telling the teacher which group was labeled as smart or dumb" unequivocally points to the Pygmalion study since in the Jane Elliot study the teacher was the "researcher" so why would she need to tell herself?

Something from Wikipedia I found interesting: &gt; "The set of Frasier itself was built over the set of Cheers on the same stage after it had finished filming. The producers of Frasier made certain there were no stools in the coffee shop in order to distance it visually from the Cheers bar"
I know he started as a romcom pretty boy but if you've seen his more recent stuff he's actually become a pretty solid actor.  This coming from a guy who used to *hate* Channing Taint-yum.
Like you said, statistics and probability and linear algebra for the background. A lot of the common classifiers are already packaged/implemented (in R, python) so you never really have to "know" what they do in extreme detail.Some basic/common examples (look these up in Google):- Logistic Regression- Classification Trees, Random Forests- Support Vector MachinesAll of these rely on knowledge of basic stats and probability and some linear algebra only.More complex ones will involve optimization techniques.

I definitely would not get any work done if I had super smash brothers set up in my office.  I think a video game system would be fun for younger patients (and older ones) and would make the sometimes necessary wait bearable.Not gonna lie, kind of jealous of the doctor who had professionally done photo of anonymous ballsack 
I have the Benefit Erase Paste cuz home girl got some serious blue circles. It was creasing on me like a mother. Then I watched "how to cover your dark circles" from makeup up geek. If you're using the NARS concealer to cover instead highlight try applying it under your foundation. I find that if I do that with the erase paste, then cover over it with whatever is left on my brush from foundation it doesn't crease. I then go over with a highlighter and set it with setting powder.
I'm genuinely of the mindset that crime can't be eliminated, yeah. I never really thought about Criminology dealing with the rights of offenders, though. The vast majority of what I've read of this book deals just with various theories that try to explain why criminals behave the way that they do, so I do now see that my initial posting was laughably uninformed.I appreciate you giving me more to research and reflect on. I may still not actually pursue this as a potential career path, but I at least have a newfound understanding and respect for just how intricate the legal system truly is.
Previous company implemented a 90 day retention on Sent, Trash, and IIRC Inbox when we moved from Lotus to Exchange. Everyone knew this and had a reasonable amount of time to move anything in the wrong place. Quite a few used their Inbox as a base for their folders if they had any.
Human action is changeable by changes in circumstances, and follows some patterns (including ones that flow from age).I agree that changing people's circumstances can change their behavior.  I was referring to the originally posited idea that black people should simply be exhorted to work harder, with no change in circumstance.  I see that as pointless.But changing structures to there are more reasons to be ambitious?  That can definitely have a positive impact.
Before I moved, I used to live on the same street as a hoarder.  He'd owned a house in another neighborhood that used for hoarding and was eventually condemned by the city. I don't know what the inside of his house looked like, but his car was filled to the absolute brim with tattered old paperbacks and his yard was a mess.  After I moved, I continued to see him regularly going through the dumpsters behind the grocery store near my new place. So, maybe he would just use the dumpster as a temporary storage facility. 
Hahaha that's an awesome story for the camp fire. I've now tagged you as Carlito. Edit: unless it's scarred you, in which case no campfire stories. But I'm keeping you tagged as Carlito.

I worked for USPS for one day (on the sorting floor of a local post office) Can confirm.  Every box goes into a big cart on wheels that are stacked ten or so wide to a row and 2 rows....soo... picture 20 or so big carts in a GIANT rectangle....Now picture someone throwing them five to twenty feet to make it into the proper cart for placement at the respective routes carrier "office"  It literally looked like making three pointers or half court baskets into an over sized net.
It is indeed 5 man crew. They picked fairly short folks, especially the guy behind the turret to the right of the passenger, barely any room for knees.The turret upgrade was done in late 1943 due to the damages suffered by Soviet army at the battle of Kursk. The older 76 turret could be efficient at the distance of 500-600 meters, while the Nazi's  were shooting and hitting Soviet tanks at the distance of about 1500 meters. So, that's about a kilometer advantage. 
Jeg vil lige se om jeg har forstået det korrekt, her.. Jeg har nemlig selv gået på teknisk skole i forskellige omgange. En elektrikeruddannelse varer.. Fire år, cirka? Og du står ved grundforløbseksamen, grundforløbet som varer 20 uger - som regel. EUX.. Lægger den et år til? Hvornår starter din elevtid?Og jeg kender godt miljøet på teknisk skole - det er heller ikke altid et, jeg har følt mig hjemme i. Folk er nu som regel alligevel altid gode nok, omend bare nogle gange bare fra en lidt anden omgangskreds en en selv. 
We had the in office procedure done about a week ago. He cried so so hard - it was heart breaking. But as soon as it was over he was fine. No pain for the remainder of the day even. I think the process is similar aside from the anesthesia. Babies are just so so resilient. Be strong for your little one!
[](/s "Berserk.") It's a prequel to its manga so in a way you're supposed to know how things end up, so it isn't even really a spoiler. Also I haven't read the manga and I can say it's still enjoyable on its own. 
Look into some community centers. There's one in Conway with a pool and one in College Park. I'm sure there are others too. Going to be a lot cheaper than the Y. That being said, if that's not really an issue, the Downtown Y has a huge group of swimmers, as does the Winter Park Y.
This isn't a good fit for a long term relationship.  It is better to end things when you are just 4 months into the relationship than it will be if you remain hoping that she will somehow become motivated.You are both very young and realistically...she doesn't sound like she is "the one" for you.You really need to have some of those basic things like long term goals be compatible for a lasting relationship.Source, I have been in a relationship for 40 years, married for 30 years to my best friend from high school 
I think the best way to support the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinians of all colors, is to kill the Hamas cancer that is poisoning their minds.Non-violent resistance and throwing the radical strains of islam into the garbage bin of history are the way forward for the Arabs.
Hearthstone should be an example for *anyone* who wants to make a CCG at this point. It's not perfect, but it's a great example of "easy to learn, difficult to master."
I think it's pretty standard to warm gels up to help them work a little better. My dipbrow is starting to get a bit dry and I stick it in my bra every morning to warm it up! 
I think there a lot of problems with DE's approach toward the game. I do criticize when I feel it is needed. I agreed with your points. Just because someone does not agree with you it does not make them a DE fanboy with no sense. The points you made aren't even that unpopular. 
Some women have a particular taste for semen or dick or ass.  Some women can acquire a taste for semen or dick or ass.Some men have sweeter semen than others, though diet also plays a big role in this.So there's a combination of factors at play here just in terms of your bodies.  Then you throw in accounting for how openly and honestly the two of you talk about sex and sexuality, and you can see that there's variables within variables.
I actually like the idea of an unknown nefarious entity. Besides I hate when they do the scoobee dew reveal where it was the creepy janitor or the evil chandrian or something the whole time. That would be weak

&gt;and the end of the story I dont feel bad, its almost like the human life has no meaning, i could pull the trigger and have absolutely no issue with the outcome of it.I think you do really need to get your mind right about this perspective before you start carrying. You need to really ask yourself what you're thinking and why you would carry. I recently took a 1.5 day class, introductory level. For me, the most striking moment in the whole class was when the instructor really drove home the point that if it ever came down to the moment, it would leave you changed forever. He closed that part of the class by asking "Do you think George Zimmerman is the same as he was a few years ago?" There was a lot of silence.
FYI even the PC version has aim assist and it's on by default. Don't know how it works or if it even helps when playing with a mouse. But I feel like it makes your bullets magnetic to the target when you're close. I've hit shots that didn't seem like they should have hit while I had aim assist on.

I'm so sorry. I'm on my 2nd month of clomid and have been on metformin for 8 months. My first round of clomid did basically nothing. I'm trying to be hopeful this time, but it's difficult. It helped me feel less shitty when my doctor called to tell me it was useless to track my temp. I knew I didn't ovulate. I just hadn't been officially told. I hope something works for you soon.

So when me and my brother were a few years old our mom would have us bathe together. I was about the age where I had discovered the built in squirt gun that God had given me. I looked over at my brother innocently playing with a toy boat or something and saw that his mouth was wide open when he made the boat noises. I sneakily walked over to his side of the tub and let him have it. But hey, they used to gargle urine to clean their teeth in the old days, so I guess I was actually performing a service to him. Yeah, mom wasn't amused when she found out why he was crying.  
What if... Valve were to hire the Black Mesa team to do HL3? They've proven they can kick some serious ass. Take key personnel from Valve to guide things along, then bam, HL3.

And if you are black and are really well spoken, good at school, a hard worker, etc, you aren't seen as an individual who is really intelligent and hard working, but as an exception to the rule they apply to most black people.

Reddit is ridiculous, they get so upset about "global warming can't be real since it is snowing now" but you are literally saying "psych isn't a bad major because I got a job" and you are getting upvotes. How about some facts?On one end of the spectrum you have the physical sciences, business, and even education, these have relatively low unemployment for recent grads.On the other side is the arts, architecture, social sciences and psychology. These have relatively high unemployment when compared with other majors.Does it make one major better than the other? No.Does it mean that as a psychology student you will get a job or vice versa for a business major? Obviously not.But it is a trend and it is the truth.[Source](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/23/these-are-the-best-college-majors-if-you-actually-want-a-job-after-graduation/)
&gt;You know, with the way the Republican Party has purged all dissenting opinions and sought "purity" with increasing fervor,this is so astonishingly at odds with reality it disturbs me that someone could actually believe it.  Let's just compare the 2008 democratic and republican primaries, shall we?  For the republicans, you have Mccain, the maverick, Ron Paul, the libertarian, Romney, the republican from central casting, Huckabee, the social con, and Rudy Guliani, the socially liberal new yorker.  Then on the democratic side, you have 5 center left senate democrats, three of whom were from the northeast, an and Dennis Kucinich.  The single biggest policy argument in the whole election was the individual mandate, which obama ran against and then decided to pass into law anyway.  It is not the republicans that are insisting on ideological purity.
You are highly invested in telling me that it is not DANGEROUS.I have studied BRAIN DAMAGE. The change of condition brings in untold additional risks which are not accounted for and endanger the participants.AS an illustration- take an artist's mobile- many things hang in balance on the strings.

This question really depends on where you live. In the US? Look up the laws of your state/ city/ county. Outside? Look up the laws of your country.

They don't like us talking about them. They are aware of everything I've posted about our talks today on our sub. I took their initial response to mean they would no longer be deleting/banning our mention. I was mistaken. They will be deleting our mention, just not banning for it. I told them our goal is open conversation, not piracy. But apparently our open conversation is somehow promoting piracy. They'll delete us no matter what our name is, I'm sure of that. 
I live in a town called Oak Ridge in eastern Tennessee, and there used to be this little hole in the wall type of restaurant called "Magic Wok", but was commonly referred to as "Mrs. Betty's". The shop was owned by and elderly woman named Betty from thailand, and her husband, Jim. That's it. Just the two of them owned this place. And let me tell you, their sweet and sour chicken was like nothing I'd ever tasted in my life. It was the most delicious thing I'd ever tasted. But it got shut down this year and the building was demolished because they didn't meet health requirements.
for a good reason. they don't have a right to do this. it's illegal. it'd be one thing if they just didn't service the people that didn't pay them, but it's a whole different game to say "we won't serve this area because there are colored people here and colored people don't pay". don't be an idiot.

I think the first Mew song I heard was "Introducing Palace Players". I didn't enjoy it at all. For some reason I was still interested. I downloaded No More Stories... listened and still didn't really like it. I continued listening to it just because it found it to be interesting and different even though I didn't consider it good or enjoyable.Over time it grew on me. And since then Mew has become my favorite band and I love all of their music.My experience with Mew has taught me to give music I don't like at first multiple listens. It also makes me wonder what other artists I don't particularly enjoy now would grow on me if I were to listen to them more. 
I'm pretty sure the fact that you're following blogs that reblog those kinds of posts says a lot more about your own sexual preferences than anything else. 
The guy has the word "obtuse" in his name, he's probably trolling.  The funny thing is that he's being upvoted anyways because he's taken a contrary position on what most consider a pretty good deal just because it's the Harper government.
I counsellored at a camp and there was a camper with a speech impediment named Christopher. Myself and the other counsellors all referred to him as Cwistopher.
im for the idea that if I am going to buy something in game, I get to have access to it for as long as I have an account. no point in funneling money into temporary aesthetics. just put a year next to the icon and leave it be. make it legendary when the team is out of the lcs
If you plan to PvP later on, I'd suggest not upgrading anything until all these balance changes are over. Saving stones would be the smartest thing to do for now.For PvE, if you can get your hands on a Liberto (리베르토) weapon, that would give you the most damage output at this point in time. Just remember they are still changing stuff around and it could affect PvE soon as well.
The camera adds pounds for sure. I ran into Shaq at Lulu's cafe downtown when he was playing for Miami. He looked pretty fit for someone over 7 feet tall. On tv he looks like an offensive lineman.
I have a sneaking suspicion that these people are the same ones who at my office say things like "I'M NOT HERE TO BE QUESTIONED!" (when I HAVE to ask questions to figure out what they need/fix their accounts)
Exactly right. Some people believe that the world would be better if religion disappeared, but I think it would only be replaced with other misguided self-righteous beliefs like these.

I wish I could make a joke about ducks, but congrats man! How deep do you normally play until you take the money of the table and buy-in for a 100BB stack? I'm normally scared to lose too much to the larger stacks (scared money so worse decision making, more of my bankroll at risk per hand), so whenever I get over 2-4 buy-ins, I take the extra money off the table. Then again, you can't win this big either :)
If they complain about your character you aren't playing people who care. Find better players or tell them that complaining won't help you get better against sheik.
&gt;We have a campus-based university, so partying undergraduates are commonly encountered on Thursday nights as they make their way to one of the clubs in town. The often confuse me for an undergrad and let's just say...hilarity ensues.Hah, I still dress like one most of the time, so I get that, too.  Fortunately only got hit on once, but that was hilarious, if a bit bizarre-feeling - he was a freshman, and I was.... 25 at the time, I think.  He was younger than my little brother.&gt; In any case, good luck to you, me and all the future Dr Evils!Verily!  :D
Well, DE did give me a dog that is slowly dying unless I give it medicine to live - medicine that I can only buy from DE.  DE IS LITERALLY WORSE THAN EA GAMES / HITLER (they are pretty much the same).Yess I can feel the hate flowing through mehttp://i.imgur.com/EIhw212.jpg
Fuck. Really? .....fucking fuck..... REALLY?  Well doesn't that just bite the big one...I had the most epic playlist... The epic omnibus playlist of super ultra badassery, in fact. It was something like 1100 songs. No clue what most of them were. Shitballs...
It's not a counter point... Because there is no point, you literally did not make a point. The person was not officially ruled as a murder victim. If the person is ruled a victim of a crime then the consequences will follow. Until then there is no "point" you don't know what happened, I don't know what happened, even the officer might not know what happened. Why is it so hard to wait for the medical examiner to rule on the case and then make a "point". Right now all you're doing is assuming something happened, I'm not defending anyone trust me I'll be the first one to say let's kick the bad cops out but you have no basis if there is no evidence to back up the claim you made. 
I mean....  in casual play, yeah, I suppose, since they have the same stats.  But you're not *supposed* to, and you wouldn't get away with it in Organized Play.

Whatever you do, stay away from the comments. There was someone there complaining about the graphics not being realistic, therefore "not appropriate for the current generation".
Wikipedia has a great page called ["Bamboo ceiling"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_ceiling) about how Asian-Americans are the model minority mentioned in the article and how it hurts them. I think this "bamboo ceiling" is the reason that Asians are not to Whites what Whites are to Blacks.
Pretty solid lines if business/school laptops good news it since its a really common model you should be able to get a (Prime) battery for 20-30 bucks and an easy return if it turns out to not be your problem. 
Seriously, when I have kids, I will tell them to focus on writing normally, and tell them to specifically *not* do those cursive practice, and if they get in trouble, to leave it to me.
I have read this book. It's kinda a hard read and there is a lot of math. Check it out. http://www.amazon.com/Who-Built-Moon-Christopher-Knight/dp/1842931636
Rob a bank and then go purchase diamonds with the money while time still frozen so that way when time freezes I can sell the rest cut diamonds for trillions and the jeweler is stuck with all this heat for "Robing a bank "
Although his first major role was in *L.I.E.,* his breakthrough performance came via *There Will Be Blood.* He played the conniving adversary of Daniel Day Lewis incredibly well, *maybe so well* that producers/directors/casting agents keep him in mind when they come across a character that gets pummeled on screen? 
Lol we already know we suck. It's worse to suck when you have Carmelo. Just wasting away his talent on the train-wreck that is the knicks. Enjoy your 60 wins man. 
Yeah seriously they're getting blown out on what is probably their last game of the season, of course they'll have more opportunities in the future but that has to be a shitty feeling.
Is anyone aware if I would be able to use a hard drive I have lying around as a replacement for the data HDD on the original Xbox fat without some sort of tweak?
Nope. I looked at quite a few different recipes. Most recipes top with parsley, but those are basically the ingredients.http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/chicken-marsala-recipe.htmlhttp://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/chicken-marsala-recipe.htmlPerhaps you are thinking of the indian dish chicken tikka masala, and not the italian one that is generally served over pasta?
Yeah I don't know if I would do it either to be honest, but I know you guys aren't exactly the richest team in the league and Semins contract is horrendous, might be the worst in the league (7 till 2029 right?). I think if you switch JvR and Kessel in that deal it gets done 100% but I don't think the Leafs are that crazyEDIT: 2019 not 2029 LOL
Yep, and if you're the guy who waits until the necessary point to merge you're literally Hitler and need to be punished with flashing high beams and obscene gestures. /s
Nah, the luck is truth. I've already gotten as almost as many Ascended drops on my new account, which is less than three months old, as I have on my first account which I've been playing on and off since beta (nearly 3 years). So yeah, I can see the proof in the drops. 
The only thing that threw me out of the story is the fact that the person scanning the ticket is not going to be one of the flight attendants on the plane.Also the fact that you can't open an emergency exit while the plane is pressurized. Other than that, I love it!!
Actually I got it working after just trying everything all over again.The issue I think was that I tried to download the support files and then install windows after.You have to just do it all at once in boot camp and let boot camp pretty much so all the work for you.Ended up being a lot easier then I thought.  Thanks though.

Good pick for Oakland. He should do well, and the raiders really needed a WR. Leonard Williams is available for Washington, what a steal that would be for them.
Well, it's his own topic, you weren't linked in SRD. I can't engage having been linked. Thus shit just screams [Balloon Boy](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_boy_hoax). No one is going to watch your shitty show about you being shitty parents and forcing your kid in to STEM. Urgh and he calls himself a futurist. Cause that doesn't make you sound like a douche. 
I think they help with the sound pollution as well as ground pollution. You can also plant them to get a forest industry sector going, and they look just bad ass in general :)
You should really try running euphoria, the 20% haste helps immensely, especially in low gear. Yes, boomkin is a turret caster, but if you plan ahead it isn't that bad. You can save a starsurge charge to fill another gcd while moving and refresh dots mainly when moving 
Closing my first week into the game. Decided to go heavy iAP to try to skip early game but unfortunately im running into a wall. I can only manage to consistently pick up 3 star runes from hard difficulty/b4 giants. I cant even begin to touch high essence farming. Could use some general direction in terms of what teams i should build to farm runes.  http://imgur.com/cHyGXjY,rD0Gqrg,n6IhSFp,6sAGIgb#3
I think I'd find a weird sense of solace in knowing that someone I knew is still helping another guy go out, meet people, lift a few skirts and enjoy is life. Your family is amazing for allowing that to happen.
on the page it says: &gt; Please Note:If you purchase this deal you will only be charged the final group price, when the deal expires, and only if it reaches the tipping point (MOQ).
Every episode will go by and I will be anticipating something bigger and bigger. Eventually on episode 162 I will be let down overall but I realize a deeper meaning in the show, it's telling me to take life slow and enjoy it rather than waste time watching paint dry. I would then go and rate the show 8/10 for showing me a entire new philosophy.
I was greatly disappointed in this mechanic turning out the way it did, like so many others I wanted some consequence for our rampant violence as hunters to turn us into beasts and have it somehow tie to PvP. PvP is limited as it is. Including a covenant where the chasing of beast players, then a covenant where the beast players feast on hunters, would have made the game more interesting, give Bloodborne more replayability which is arguably one of it's weakest facets compared to the Souls franchise.Those are my thoughts on this issue.
Mine does, but we all avoid doing them whenever possible. For some reason they make us do extra paperwork after doing an RNP approach, so I'll pick the VOR or NDB over the RNP unless I really need the lower minimums (if they are lower in the first place) to get in.
The Big Island is a lot bigger and the bigger mountains create a bigger rain shadow effect, so the leeward side is a lot dryer. In addition a big chunk of the island is pretty far up in elevation where not much grows. Also,  chunks of the island are covered in geologically recent lava flows which burn down anything that was growing there. 
Are you aware that the Jewish Documentation Centre founded by Simon Wiesenthal was set up mainly with funds provided by Mossad with approval from the UNWCC (The part of the UN that deals with War Crimes)?This is an ELI5 - I kept it simple and broad for a reasonIf you have something worthwhile to add feel free.

What are you using them for?They're nice if you need something that doesn't take up much space and just need it for web browsing, watching videos, etc.
Even if the rich control politics, why does that imply that voting is worthless? I can acknowledge that the Democratic party is run by big money and still vote for them because I agree with their stance on abortion rights. 
I've seen lots of links to this site posted to FB lately.  While some of the topics are interesting, the site itself strikes me as simple click bait, at best.  Even the photos aren't original to the site, but are culled from various local Flickr accounts.  One of my fellow photographer's images were used and he was completely unaware of it.  At least, they do have the decency to credit the photographers and provide links back to the photos.
I'm in bed, then I hear a commotion outside. Ususally I'll be inexplicably living with others who I hear leave the house. I get up and follow them outside, to where it's dark, but we look up into the sky and see HUGE PLANETS and GALAXIES and all sorts of gorgeous things, but way up close, enough that we can see them at night. It's still quite scary though. Sort of like... [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBDZtt0vWD8), or something.
I strongly recommend the Canon 100-400 Mark II. It's got the right amount of flexibility and reach for nature photography. You can't go wrong renting from LensRentals. 
I have never had such a problem, even when half of the time I actually read comics. Teachers usually prefer that students who finish fast or whatever do silent stuff instead of talking with their mates (which is what would otherwise happen). 
The Haunting Of? It's not really ghosts, it's about a psychic who helps people understand a ghost experience they had, and talks to their deceased relatives and such. 
It seemed to me he was mocking milk in tea, which is commonplace in England. I was providing a second example with the iced coffee which is similar to iced tea and how iced coffee often has cream in it.
All of the Rotom Forms (other than standard rotom) have the same stats.  The difference comes in typing and their special move.  I don't see why our Gameboy possessing amigo should be any different.The reason Rotom-Wash reigns supreme is because of it has the best typing of the lot (only being weak to grass) and it has the best special move (Overheat and Leaf Storm maybe strong but they cripple the user after one use, air slash is mediocre, and Blizzard is ridiculously inaccurate.  Hydro Pump, however has a tonne of power and decent accuracy)
I don't see the benefit.One of the great things about the time it takes to train into new things is how it really teaches you how to use what you have, which benefits everyone.Being able to lose a pimp fit marauder in 1/10th the time means those people won't learn to lose a normal fit battleship more efficiently.
&gt; People using legacy hardware won't be able to run bleeding edge software after a certain window closes. They never were able to.Unless your GPU was made by Intel or AMD. In which case, you will be able to use new features for the lifetime of your device, as long as the hardware supports it.

Okay, just what the fuck again.Not that I like the senseless destruction, but I have to agree with most of you here: if you are not protesting for change, if you are just on of the fucking "silent majority", then I don't really care about your property damages. So years of incarceration because you expressed your anger about a vicious cycle? Damn, that's just cold and silent oppression.

I wouldn't care because I don't get angry on the Internet with strangers over tipping. Look at your life and priorities. To me it seems quite sad that you're so angry about this. Try and grow up please. 
It's actually kinda nice seeing guys stay at home with their families, not that the bells and whistles at the draft wouldn't be cool, but it's probably a much more relaxed evening.
haha aight bro. Truce.I think ultimately were all on this sub because we want the same thing. Generally more respect for Asian males and for more Asian men to embrace masculinity.I have no doubt Asian men face varying degrees of discrimination in different facets of life. But from my perspective growing up I saw my Asian bros at every level (high school, undergrad, med school) socially years behind our white counterparts because so many of us (myself included) were raised in such a feminine manner.I still see so many Asian guys my age (30s) who are still beta and I just want to grab them, slap them around, throw a barbell onto their backs, dress them with some style and teach them not to settle down for the first boomerang vag that shows them the least bit of attention. 
Where do i start! The design of the strap was a no-goer to begin with. Always too tight or completely loose, never just right,  but then again even a dummy would have thought to make it elasticated! And then there's the upper fabric.  Just too flimsy to keep your foot planted onto the sole. At best these can be worn as slippers, but then they'll be inferior to other slippers
I feel you, as long as its not a bottleneck and the only path to something I'm ok with them. kinda like the hill in operation mortar was done. That part of the map was underplayed. it should have had a flag inside.
I interned with a Kindergarten teacher for a few months a while back. One day at recess, I heard one of the other teachers talking about how tired she was of "this retarded little shit's antics", while referring to a developmentally challenged kid who was being chased around and bullied by the other students. Being a decent person, I shot her a dirty look and chased the bullies off before pulling the kid to the side to make sure he was ok and tell him it's not his fault. I also complimented his spongebob shirt, which totally brightened him up. I got him talking about Spongebob and another kid ended up overhearing and going off to play with him and talk about spongebob together.
Lifecoach has worst nazi mods on twitch. I got timeouted for a legit question about gameplay. Thats why I am not watching him anymore - if he has idiot mods, i don't care about him.
I recently got my first job, and I am 18. So far I have only done 2 shifts and I my feet are killing me by the time each of my breaks rolls around!

This is awesome!  Congratulations on your keto success, and you're upcoming nuptials!  Make sure to post some pictures.  Especially one of your reaction to the bride, you'll get so many upvotes.I'm getting married in three months and I'm going hard in the paint for the same reason you did!
I bought a 2000 and used it for a while, the extra battery life was nice but I ended up going back to the 1000, mainly because it felt far better to hold and use for a long period of time. Build quality is also a lot more solid and I like the OLED screen more than the LCD screen.I liked both the 1000 and 2000, but I went back to the first purely out of personal preference.
I drink it the same way.  Shake it up with cold water and drink it right away.  I've never waited because a slimy consistency would really put me off of it.
I still wouldn't  buy an iStick50. Eleaf has still not officially admitted to anything.  These need to be recalled from the manufacturer.  If this vape store is still selling them, then is hasn't been handled
Warspite is one of my favourite ships, and I was really excited to get it. I was willing to overlook a lot of flaws but a 16.3km range for the main guns on a tier VI BB is just not acceptable. Especially considering that historically, the modernised Queen Elizabeth class battleships (which includes Warspite of course) had the elevation of their main armament increased to 30 degrees for a max range of 29.5km. On top of that, there is Warspite's feat during the Battle of  Calabria where she hit Giulio Cesare at roughly 24km.I am sure most of you are already aware of this info but I just wanted to vent my disappointment I guess...
Would it be acceptable or frowned upon if I only kept an assault frigate/interceptor, a probing ship, and a battlecruiser in the null sec station? I imagine that's all I would really need to do what I plan on.
How is it beautiful? It's not even right. According to the "axis", the red and blue aren't even in the right spot. Not that the axis makes sense in the first place.

Came here to read posts from black people complaining about how "hard" they have it.  Was not disappointed.  Lol.There is no such thing as "white priviledge".  If youre having a hard time, its probably because youre acting like a thug.  Black people who act like normal human beings do just fine.  But then the homeboys call them "Uncle Tom" and other dumb shit, for not being "black" enough.  Dumb logic, but what more can you expect from a hoodrat?  Later, fellas.  Off to go riot and stuff.  Just kidding.  I have to work in the morning.
Massive tax rates? Note no figures quoted here.We stopped violence in Ireland and UK by giving IRA members a democratic alternative instead of criminalising them. Same with ANC. Immigration has had a net benefit to our economy. What resources would we be talking about being stretched? Immigrants come in paying tax and creating jobs, so we build houses and schools, no?Many things are expensive and not necessary. Not an excuse to not have something.Not convinced it's a deterrent *at all*. It's the 21st Century, and we're facing challenges that nukes are no good for. In these circumstances, it's "expensive and not necessary."
I was wagging my tail before it was coolRemember air bud? of course you do you poser. He and I were friends on friendster before you were born.Facebook? more like wannabebook.Hey you like my owner? He is a lumbersexual.
Haha, that sounds like a much funnier scenario (from an outside perspective). Anyone that heads toward a bounty should anticipate a hostile response, though...
Stores do prepare for the influx of burners. If you can, try to get there early in the morning as the stock people might not be able to keep up throughout the day. Go for a big name like Walmart or Trader Joes and you should be set, especially on Friday. 
Post pics of how you have it wired up it will help.  Are you using a cherry style switch it has 3 prongs I would check you have it wired correctly.  It has a normal open and Normal closed so if you have it wired wrong it would be in a constant open and only close when pressed you would just have to switch it.     But to be able to be sure on anything else would need to see what kind of buttons you have it wired too and how.   See this wiring diagram http://www.koenigs.dk/mame/eng/microswitch.PNG  
A dramatic and stylish interpretation for #13. It would be interesting to have the Rani or Romana or the Doctor's daughter come back. Or a non-Doctor non-Missy female time traveller. And I like Missy as the Master regenerated. But I am undecided about a female Doctor though, cause it can change a formula that works, if poorly done.In the meantime, here is a YouTube fan film with a female Doctor. It's called The Ginger Chronicles, E01: A Dame to Kill.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw5d3E8velc
You were not arrested. If you stub your little toe and I need to call an ambulance for you, I still need your id and all the info "for the report." It's just a report that this happened on this date and time. It's both because we care about you, and because it needs to be documented so the department can't be found negligent for inaction. I hope you are getting the help you need and feel better :)
I'd rather have it be called a legal Union or legal matrimony and they just give them the same rights, it removes a lot of the religious debate if you just done call it a marriage and say you're recognizing them as loving each other and they depend on each other, therefore should receive benefits as others who love and depend on each other do
It is a bit distressing to me that how you describe liberals is exactly how I describe the far right.  What a terrifying thought that one or both of us could be so mislead.  So it goes... self serving politicians and authority figures casting us against each other.  Dan Halen/Master Shake 2016!

I really like the Daretti deck. I even liked it straight out of the box, but I've made some alterations to it that make the value snowball engine so good that *even Tibalt is really good in the deck*. The other day I had out Tibalt, Daretti and Ugin, with the Chain Veil. It was as disgustingly fun as it sounds :D
&gt;but i would be questioning management if this is actually happeningAgree 100%. Sounds like somebody misinterpreted something (hence the "not specified" stuff) or is seriously exaggerating / trying to one up ("ah man I can't water my lawns every other day", "oh yeah, i can't even shower certain mornings!")
He will probably bench him all the time to prove to the world that he doesn't care for a players status or history. He might also just show his balls again to get his point across.
Leonard Williams, lifelong Raiders fan and #1 guy on everybodys board is probably confused as hell right now. Washington could trade down or just grab the next Richard Seymour...

Ah idk how to help you then because that's how I write 100% of my jokes. Maybe look for weird words? I remember Mitch Hedburg's joke "I have a king size bed, I don't know any kings but if one slept over he would be comfortable". If you are having a mental block maybe try to look for adjectives to things like that? Like "dry sex",...idk I can't think of another adjective noun pair. Also, /r/jokedaily is great. 
Yep.  Sadly, the whole "in-group vs. out-group/us vs. them/minority vs. majority" thing is basic human psychology.  It has happened everywhere to everyone since the beginning of civilization.
Riot specifically stated that the first batch will be money only to test the waters. There is a mighty good chance of a chroma or two being worked into the mastery system, or even other rewards for events or something special now that they're an option in general.Of course that doesn't mean there wont be more that'll be available for purchase, of course..Rp, or ip.

&gt; It is obvious that almost all the players on here are familiar with actives and are not ashamed about it, but nonetheless I find the discretion and restraint exercised on this sub to be commendable.You won't find any first time trip reports or 'look at my first gram' posts here, we've all been there and done that - er, most of us. This place is for sharing knowledge. I try to arbitrate with a soft hand, but sometimes swift justice must be served.  &gt;Still learning so I don't post much, but I've been lurking and really enjoying all the content so far.Please - if you're interested in growing, shoot me a PM and I'll hook you up with a culture of Oysters, they're great for beginners!
Senderick Marks is an elite dt though.  The jags have too many interior guys and not enough outside guys.  Well, now they've solved that problem somewhat at least.
If they're selling Office Pro Plus, that's volume license only, so it's not legit. If they're selling one pirated thing, chances are the rest of what they're selling is pirated as well. If you don't receive a certificate of authenticity with your purchase from them, it's probably safe to assume your product is not legit and will be deactivated.
can you please refrain from giving idiotic advice. this is a serious problem with the game. it isn't my fault you play with blinders on. the shotgun is a cancer plaguing survival and i am not the only one who feels this way. 
Extremely flawed.  Small, meticulously-drawn but shitty circles score *very* high.  Large, much more accurate ones do not.  I don't know what this is measuring, but accuracy isn't it.
The episode is going to jump 9 months ahead and we're going to end the episode with the camera panning to Meredith in a hospital bed with a baby. Or maybe we see a chair from the back and pan to Meredith's face and you hear a gush of water and she yells it's time. Camera pans out to show her baby bumpEdit: eh, somewhat got it
Voting: No, I think you're right that non-citizens can't vote.    Donating:     &gt;An immigrant may make a contribution if he or she has a "green card" indicating his or her lawful admittance for permanent residence in the United States.    But my understanding is that Canadian citizens *do not need* a green card to enter or reside in the US.  Is that correct?  If so you should contact the FEC and ask them directly.
She was implying that he may have some sort of mental disability. Maybe he did, maybe someone he knew well did, either way he was pissed enough to just leave. The teacher probably realized 1) Exactly what she had just said to the student 2) that she could probably be fired or sued or some shit like that
What I reccomend is accessing your consoles settings and go to the part where you can edit the Mac address , then use the max address of your phone or computer there. Usually these sorts of things are tied to a devices Mac address which when you log in / accept like at a hotel it allows your Mac address to use the network So just go to settings--&gt; network setrings--&gt; advanced settings and take a look at your laptops Mac address to know what to use ! 
&gt; Stuff more serious than breaking a car window. To be fair, it _was_ a cop's car window. That's the criminal equivalent of killing a dozen thugs, maybe more./s
I saw him just last year, like a couple of days after he was kicked out of STP. He played some STP classics, a few of his own songs, left the stage, came back for an encore, played more STP then laid on the ground for about 5 minutes while the band jammed behind him. It was a pretty awesome show.
Most of the time they are fantastic. I just wish I had those collars from Up! So I could have them tell me what's going through their crazy little brains
Have friends who are in long-term poly amorous relationships, although I agree it isn't for anyone (I'm pretty sure I would be too jealous).  I made an assumption this was a situation where wife &amp; gf weren't aware of each other....which would be much more complicated.
Psychology is one of the divisions of the [National Academy of Sciences.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_National_Academy_of_Sciences) I'm not really sure how it can qualify *more* as the "S" in STEM. 
I was on a field trip with my school, as a student not a teacher, and I overheard two English teachers, both girls, talking about a classmate of mine. They said her feet were so big they looked like clown shoes, then giggled like they were in mean girls. It was hilarious.
I can't wait to see Shazier be let loose. I could deal without Mike Adams though, actually met him when I was going to OSU and dude was a giant asshole. 
You can only cheese one FeB at a time. FeB 5 can only keep the rank from 4. 6 relies on your rank from 5, which you didn't play... You just used your rank from 4 to buy stuff as 5 was starting. 
Alright then, compare it to a child who habitually nosepicks in class, that's a bad habit if ever there was one. A teacher still shouldn't shame them about it, especially in front of the class. It's just not professional. They should tell the student not to do it, and if they persist, pull them aside after class, or maybe contact their parents about it. I just don't believe shaming is the answer when it comes to teaching.
It's a personal preference. My small town has some pretty amazing municipal water, but nothing beats a good old well — in my opinion. I can't find any bottled stuff that doesn't taste like plastic and chemicals.
Yeah, I walk dogs at the local Humane Society, I work at a weekly soup kitchen, and I donate food and clothing to the local homeless shelters.  I'd highly recommend all of the above.
You get people annoyed at others bringing up gear in the context of celebrities because the majority of the time, the physique in question is obtainable naturally (just maybe not in the same time frame). Bringing up gear gives people an easy way to tell themselves "nah it's impossible I can't do it" and frankly hearing people whine and sell themselves short and give up before they even started at the mere mention of having to work hard gets irritating.
How about "killing shots will detonate your target and chain explosions with enemies in a close proximity"? Meaning killing a target will cause enemies around that enemy to have their own individual explosions.
Ugh deluxe dining plan. Went with the shitlady and her parents, I don't think I've ever eaten so much dessert in my life. Not that I'm a food snob, I just legit don't have a sweet tooth. Every lunch and dinner I'd get a $5 hunk of cake or something that I'd have to take a few bites of to be polite, since we'd already paid for it. 
IMO the problem is Valve have to find a way to automate the patch updates into that part of the clients library. Judging from the YouTube videos in client - I'd say each spell description on every hero was written up and put together individually by hand. To update every hero's 4 spells and aghs for every patch is just an absurd amount of work. I'm hoping they will find a way to implement a way for the patch notes to update the library in source 2. I also think we're not quite able to rely on pre-recorded videos to showcase each and every spell and they need to scrap that as a feature.
When I worked at a restaurant in college, they were pretty stringent about meat and health standards, mostly because they had had a few deaths, one of which wasn't really anyone's fault.
It's good for the money. That's not to say that it's a bad guitar, but it has it's limitations. Go play it and see for yourself. If it sounds good, and it's affordable, go for it. A guitar doesn't make a sound unless you decide to plug it in and play it.
yeah, i read that it's ps plus only, so that kind of sucks. ill get the demo and see. sounds kind of like gta online as far as earning stuff as you go.
I agree.  Same with cyber.  On the other hand...4 failed PT tests?  The test isn't that hard.  I'm usually on the other side of this argument, and I'm usually preaching about how we put too much emphasis on the PT test...but 4 failures?  For situps?
 First off - amazing give away.My number: 898My song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoJSDi6o0mA364 Days by Murder City DevilsMy favorite "christmas" song just due to the narrative of the song. I'd guess not a ton of people know this song...but I could be wrong.Luck to who ever wins!

For those frustrated at the amount of time between picks even when a team turns there's in quickly: This is a TV show just as much as it is an NFL draft. There's time to fill. I don't like it either, but when you remember that this is a show, it quells the frustration. 
&gt;Not to mention the Dragon Balls actually had an intricate roll to play in the whole thing. Vegeta goes to Earth hunting them then they go to Namek hunting them. Buu and Cell were just like oh hey we are here. The Dragon Balls don't really matter outside of undoing everything both of them did.This. Just the multiple sides vying for the dragon balls on Namek was so great. I love it when they're more involved with the storyline as well. 
Although you've phrased it as a joke, the logical fallacy here is really just an [appeal to tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_tradition) or as we would call it on reddit, a post worthy of /r/lewronggeneration.Claiming that something is "better" or "more natural" just because it's older doesn't make sense.

It's not rambling, or incoherent, or irrational. I valuate the company at $1. And I would delete it off the face of the internet. It's an anomaly how this site lost money annually and even performed on a public stock market. It's even more of anomaly that the public allowed the bastardization of the "#" number sign to be used in modern lexicon. It took 8 years for it to stick so my guess is we were force fed this one. By the way... "awarded no point" - I am not seeking your approval. At any level. I am merely speaking the truth about that so-called company. 
brass eyelets are sweet! There's 9 pair here, I kind of wish there were one or 2 more but still. I was also thinking these would look better as cap toe but they came out looking good.
Its a inconsequential "low bar measure" It doesn't need to pass any such test, just like a movie that doesn't pass the "/u/bardofsound dog test" (does the film contain someone patting a dog three times?) No. ("the film can't even pass the dog test") The test reduces far more complex issues to a way to simple metric and so loses all value. 
This. Hopefully this codex means my SoB will rise stronger than ever! Buut...they are SoB so I doubt it. But o can hope...like I have been the past 7 or so years
People also used to think the sun orbited the earth. Popular consensus doesn't make it correct.I also didn't claim it didn't impair driving. I was saying everything I read has said there's no true evidence that difinitively says it does or doesn't affect driving skill. Most sources say it's due to everyone reacting differently to the chemical. One person can be fine, another won't.
Ugh... still, it's not like Cooper is a terrible pick.EDIT: Initial *slight* disappointment has worn off and I'm definitely feeling this pick more. AC/DC baby!
I've always liked Lucian, but I didn't like either of his skins, so I'm definitely gonna buy his chromas. I don't like any of the other chromas enough to justify buying them though.
I tried but the valet always looks at me funny and asks me to leave when i tell them to put a static band on... then again he probably was just used to parking cars at the restaurant he was in front of... nah that can't be it.
It is execution if you are being arrested for a crime you have not yet been convicted of by a jury. A cop just suspects you're guilty and causes your death. Was that friend of your family's death an accident? Maybe. But I would feel a whole lot better about that circumstance if I knew there was an independent body of individuals that looked into it and said, "Yep, everything looks above board here. There was no falsified documents, no misleading statements." etc, etc. How many times have we found out later that police misspoke or outright lied on their reports (I mean, we often say eyewitness testimony is unreliable and then somehow we buy into police testimony as gospel for some reason)? I really worry that police departments are only accountable to themselves. As they say, "absolute power corrupts absolutely."
School was too small for a yearbook haha, but this is a picture of her from back in the day. Hope the link works, I haven't uploaded anything before.http://imgur.com/hBPRSbu.jpg
&gt; Except that there's very few things in this world that are 100% always true and always will be.People like you need to suffer greatly for this belief. The vast majority of "things" absolutely are 100% always true. Everything you had for lunch was metabolized and it will not alter with time. You can dress up your memories all you like, but if you ate your glyphosate tab this morning the little fucker will be in your GI cancering up your precious colon. The chemical will be bonding to the walls of your intestines, bio-accumulating in your thyroid, blocking your serotonin reuptake or whatever shit thing it is that chemical does, and it will not stop doing it no matter how many Monsanto-funded studies decrying its' danger are released.
Personally, I'd like to see anyone that is confirmed to be cheating on a multiplayer Steam game get their *entire Steam account* banned. Everything. All of their games.
1. At this time during 1992 Bill Clinton was just as (relatively) unknown2. Two days ago he visited Iowa on the same day that Hillary did, and was received significantly better, as he was able to appeal to blue collar workers and veterans on his visit. Today he was at the Vietnam War memorial in D.C, shaking hands and talking with Veterans and Vietnamese-Americans. Also, he is VERY well known in political circles. Webb was considered as running mate for Obama in 2008.3. I'm still researching this, but the articles I'm reading seem to suggest that he was growing disillusioned with how far left the Democrats were going in preparation for 2012. Also, he didn't retire, he just didn't run for re-election, a common practice among politicians. 
Once the Surface Mini idea was scrapped, my instant thought was maybe they were just going to add a dialer to it and turn it into a phone. Now with Continuum in full swing, we may very well get a phone/tablet/laptop capable device soon enough
I laughed when I saw that. Wouldn't that be worse than any arty out there?with .9 you'd likely be better off just staying in spawn and firing randomly.
**You gotta choose the Winnipeg Jets.**We are a young, up and coming team that plays the exact kind of hockey you are looking for.

No.  Against OLCC regulations.  There are efforts in the capitol to change this that are ongoing.  Call your favorite state Representative and beg them. It probably will happen soon. Cannabis too. Cigarettes are however legal to have delivered. 
Gait belt = belt used by PT's around patients for something to hold on to when walking during rehab.AD = shorthand for Assistive device in this instance aka a walker-------Or "PT's break your hip, your heart and give a RW for the walk of shame" (RW = Rolling Walker)"*BLANK* Miles down?

Not only that but I love how Hunt conveniently joins and leaves the military at will. Edit: Did Kepner somehow go through Officer Basic Course and her advance school and I missed it or something?? 
Without a landline, they will also need to sign up with their electricity provider to ensure they have uninterupted power or invest in a UPS. While I realise that in time there won't be copper anymore things are still new and it isn't affordable at the moment.  These are people on low cost housing. Their monthly bill goes up to $70 per month and they are forced to subscribe to a service they don't need/use.
I think the whole your money going to a business man is more for big label artists like himself, and in that case pretty much everyone is falling in love, talking about, and listening to these artist anyway. 
The other person would have said the same thing if they were not allowed to buy something for sale in the store. If the person can't be reasonable about something they agreed to, the store is better off without them as a "customer" anyway. 
My comments aren't regarding BYOD. You can't preload Store apps on company images. That means every time you reimage a computer, the next user has to go through the steps of downloading and setting up the Store apps. Microsoft is always "fixing the problem", but the problem is that they always take years to do it. And by then they realize the ideas they had weren't effective and scrap the entire thing.Edit: I should mention that there isn't any "using one that is pre-configured" either. All store apps are local to the user account, not the computer. If New Student uses Alumni's Surface tablet, the apps that Alumni used on their account will not be on New Student's account. Only the pre-packaged apps or side loaded LOB apps will show up. 
My only problem is when someone gets downvoted and there's no counter-comment, or if they're just freaking saying their opinion.I pretty much never downvote unless it's legit a troll comment or the spread of false information because I believe if someone is honestly "asking a stupid question" or saying their opinion (like "I think NME will do good.") they can just get upvoted or sit at "one karma".Downvoting them just makes no sense because they're just communicating.
Yeah I'm not a teacher, but fuck youWhile doing the mile run in personal fitness class our teacher said "Seth, come on you fat fuck! At least jog!" He was also the women's volleyball coach and was later fired for saying something to the effect of "shove the volleyballs up your cunts".
If you can afford a bit more, they have 7GB option for $55, same unlimited calls &amp; texts as the $45 one. Not sure though, if the same discount for the first month applies. I haven't had any issues with rounding up sub-MB usage to the nearest MB as /u/GetUpMorningMVFC has suggested, and I have a bunch of small connections (mainly SSH) open nearly constantly, plus the usual plethora of push notifications (TextSecure mainly). Most of my usage comes from music streaming, but I've yet to use more than 4GB in a month.
I read a *lot* of M/M romance these days, and most of my favorite authors, such as Heidi Cullinan, Amy Lane, Eli Easton, and Ryan Loveless are women. That said, there are some great guys writing in the genre too, Damon Suede, Brad Bonney, and B.G. Thomas come quickly to mind for starters.

I know rape is terrible and it's a fairly controversial topic but...this is a video game. If a kid learns to rape someone from seeing this in the game, literally find those kids parents and shit on their face while also calling them "dumb shits". Plus, it's GTA V and if you've played it,you may have  already seen some occurrences of rape in the game. Just please don't make this a whole ordeal because rape in a video game is widely different from real-life rape.
Unless a better candidate pops up, probably. I'd pick Hillary over any GOP candidate. I've been holding a grudge since '08 SO NOW'S MY CHANCE. But being serious, I really want to hear more about her economic agenda and want her detailed stance on fiscal policy.
As an incredible underdog, he needs to win Iowa and/or New Hampshire to keep his campaign going. If he has poor showings in the first 4 primaries, he'll be done well before Super Tuesday.
They had evidence in hand... kind of hard to ignore that.... If it were only hearsay, perhaps... but having a note in X teachers handwriting saying "hey check out the ass on suzie today!" is a bit different.   specifically if you can get multiple people to collaborate the story with evidence, in all but the most backward good ol boy system the teacher would be kind of screwed.
Aw, I love Solas and I love his romance. If you think about it no Bioware romance really adds anything to the game aside from the romance itself. There is a whole massive world of difference between friend Solas and romance Solas. Yeah, maybe the different is just a few cutscenes, but isn't that the meat of all the romances? The really fun part is what you make up in your head in between the cutscenes :) I just find the whole character of Solas romantic in a poetic sense, regardless of whether the player character engages in a relationship with him or not. I certainly think his is the best romance in Inquisition, just like I think Zevran is the best romance in Origins, and it's fine if you disagree but I wouldn't discourage someone from romancing a certain character for the first time and discovering for themselves. 
I think he deserved more first place votes than Mirotic. I would have had it Wiggins, Payton, Mirotic, Noel. Idk. Kinda like when last year ppl were saying "MCW is the rookie of the year, but Trey Burke will be a better player". That remains to be seen, but I believe Payton will be a much better player than Mirotic.
I'd suggest that you call advising at your faculty and check with them. Are you able to take summer courses to complete enough credits for promotion before September? I don't know if this helps but I'm transferring out of Science for Geography (Environment and Sustainability) and I know that for Arts, they'd promote you "technically"  (ie update your file on the system) once you've finished enough credits after the first term, midway in the academic year. 
I got mentioned on an SMH article about Thy Art Is Murder without knowing haha, they used my FB comment. Not huge in the scheme of things but I sure was flattered!
Except at the point people have beads *and* magi's your team is also moving as a unit and can pop beads, and set up residual damage so that you can finish a target with or without your ult. I hope this isn't going to end up going in some pointless circle.
Also incorrect. Nothing ever stops evolving, their body shape may be similar but things like their DNA becoming more efficient at encoding it, genetic drift of non-expressed alleles, and the structure of soft tissues continues to change.
If by that you mean like 63% in a mode where people aren't trying so they eat an inordinate number of skill shots, then you would be correct. A vast majority of the time the tanks will far outscale the range in ARAM, it just no longer takes much skill to do so

Giants fans... Kevin white is probably gonna be available at number 9. Of the teams ahead of us, the Skins, Jets, and Falcons are almost definitely not taking a receiver. Chicago is the only team who might take White.
Maybe work on your aim and use the tactics/play styles you used to.Play a few deathmatches or a few comp games to get back in your rhythm and try to do what you did before. Maybe you just need to relearn everything and rank up from the bottom again? I don't know your situation better than you, but that is what people I know did. 
That would be cool to put together. I just felt like known brands might all have something exclusive about them that others don't. Hard to explain in text but you know what I mean?
Have you tried Little List? I used the baby registry part of the site and really liked it. I don't know about the rest of the site, but it's worth a look
Rape is just a one way street, Heading down to New Orleans.  Wont be long till I am havin fun,Chasing boys and drinkin in the sun.

What you got there in those jeans?Hope its something from dreams!Now you can try to play pretend, But we both know how this ends.  Say no all you want, or even scream,Just know that rape is a one way street.
Why are you guys talking about this like it's theoretical? Microsoft explicitly said they're doing this and there are code samples in the video. Watch the video from 1:15 onward.
Yep - love it.  I use it for work process notes.  The paper is a lot more absorbent than Rhodia but I think actually prefer it because of that - Rhodia can be a bit too slick and smear-prone.

Why are the Raiders unhappy with an elite WR talent to pair with their up and coming QB? I know Leonard is a fan favorite, loves Oakland and is a great talent, but Cooper is amazing and has the potential to be a great duo with Carr.
Thanks for the great feedback! As I said, Zamplebox is a great idea, but something is VERY wrong behind their doors. This makes total sense! Not only were there shortcomings with the service and promptness, but the juice felt so low end I was kind of offended. They did refund me 50% and sent me a free Atlantis tank, but I cancelled as they gave me the worst first impression possible!

I don't think you have enough experience at enterprise scale. In the 90s at AOL they had on the order of 1000 FTP servers. Do you know what the alarm threshold was for an alert at the NOC?  30% unavailable. Because it was cheap hardware with rotational disks and each data center had a full time person who's job was to reboot the server, replace the drive, reconnect the motherboard, etc. If a machine stops sending data the first action of the monitoring software should be to replace if not alarm. That's what the phrase don't hug your server means. 
You have to type the keyword, then tab, which will put it into kiranico's search mode. It should look [something like this](http://k.mhquestboard.com/kiranicomh4u/public/chrome-omnibox.png) after you hit tab.
Yeah idk, everyone at my school hates and looks down on flip cup. Everytime it's suggested people call the person a pussy or something lol... I'm pretty indifferent about it.
I see these dipshits get into bmx accidents all the time for one of two reasons, sometimes both: 1. No brakes and 2. Texting while riding. One kid was riding his skateboard, staring at both me and his phone (I ride a racing bike), flew head over heels into a curb, got up and just kept texting.
Cause he has NO eye for talent, he's completely destroying our roster. Also, I hate the offense he runs, it's all a gimmick. Either we get a TD or we go 3 and out, but mostly just go 3 and out and take 30 seconds off the clockEDIT: He came, he destroyed, he went back to college. Mark my words, he'll be so hated in Philadelphia in 2 years he'll have a bounty on his head

Take my master and honourbale Christopher Nolan's word ["My films are always held to a weirdly high standard for those issues that isn’t applied to everybody else’s films—which I’m fine with."](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/10/christopher-nolan-uncut-on-interstellar-ben-affleck-s-batman-and-the-future-of-mankind.html). Same thing with Will Smith, for certain actors/actresses and directors people have do have weird high-standard.
You can replace Kiora's Follower with [[Aphetto Alchemist]]. The combo then works with an artifact (Gilded Lotus, Mana Vault, Simic Signet, [[Seat of the Synod]], etc.) or creature (Birds of Paradise, Bloom Tender, etc) that generates mana. 
You left out the pertinent part: &gt;Rotten Tomatoes awards the Certified Fresh accolade to theatrical releases reviewed by 40 or more critics (including 5 Top Critics) with a steady score of 75% or higher on the Tomatometer. **A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%.**
Everything you say makes sense! I see where you're coming from. Thanks for your input :) And you're right, I've never seen porn on our history before so I think he may have just forgotten haha. Normally he's pretty keen on not revealing his porn proclivities to me. 
But they *can* turn out this way. Even with no history of mental illness in the family. Kids are a lottery, and this is another example of what you can end up with.
Just to be clear, from what you are saying there aren't two card *types*, there is 1 card type with 2 cards built from each one.other than that, the other post here sums up what you can do about it nicely.
CongratsI remember being so excited by that trailer they put out for Brink. And then it seemed thoroughly mediocre on release. Would you recommend it as anything other than an easy Plat? 
Everyone here is suggesting being very direct, which is good advice I think. Maybe talk a bit first though? Marching up to a guy with no conversation and asking for his number will work with some guys, but it may also elicit and awkward/nervous laugh and that doesn't feel very good.
Not much of a reader, but I do have a recommendation to fill the void.[Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!)
This was my first ever metalcore album i ever listened to, I was 10 or 11 at the time it was released and i listened to it non-stop till i discovered theyre older stuff right before Sempiternal dropped and then i was hooked. Like most people say, Suicide Season is the best album though.
Some teams we built today on IRC of those leads https://www.padherder.com/user/Eiam8821/teams/Asked shiny to do card analysis on them this time around since there isn't a lot of discussion.If you take their JP names and search google you can see some teams on YouTube as well.There is one guy on this sub that runs Ilm for descends and seems to be doing well
I agree with this, my mmr and rank look like shit. but it has not to do with my skill. You cannot carry in this game, and i get grouped with rank 40-50 people almost every game. So i lose sooo much when there is nothing i can do about it. So yes i am looking for skilled people to group with and make a  team.  add epictankz#2810
Some people like that whole "pocket dump / EDC" thing. There are times I question of people ACTUALLY carry all that crap, or if it's just for pictures. But really, that's about as far as it goes when I stumble upon a picture someone posts. Other than that, I don't really concern myself too much with what other people do.
A good rule of thumb to go over as well is most people's skype profile's contain personal information. Please go over your skype profile and private/remove any personal information you dont want to be public before joining something like this. Also, as he points out, this is in no way official to PlayMindcrack. If you get ripped off/have personal information stolen, message one of the moderators listed on this post, not PMC staff.
Just out of co-incidence - you have the same set of Rankings as me. I own a Clipper too, I'm allied with the empire  and I have ~the same amount of credits. I assume therefore, that you are one of the good guys (like me)
That strikes me as a non-sequitur. Let's assume that film makers are producing what their audiences want and that only a tiny majority care about the forms of male-centricness that the Bechdel test flags in film. So what? What changes? How does that affect anything that I've said or the Bechdel test's illustration of this imbalance?The premise that film is meeting popular demand seems irrelevant to the observation that gendered representations in film are unbalanced.
Mianite is the god of order, and he believes that by killing his siblings that there will be no more religious based wars but it doesn't work. So he just has an interesting perspective on things....
What a weird question, not really sure what you are expecting. Homeless people think I'm an MD and walk up to me like they got an appointment while I'm eating lunch. To nurses and doctors you're just the guy who moves people around for them, but if you give respect and have a good attitude you get it back in return. 
They can have this idea for free.It's called the "wankey poo monster". It sits, shivering, disturbed by the presence of children. Parents hate it because it's name encompasses all they did but dare not think &amp; by which paranoia they are controlled.
&gt;I'm considering approaching some of the bigger accounts and just saying, hey go ahead and use my music if you want but tag me please.I think that's completely reasonable, Ian. You are the soundtrack for their vine, so that's the least they can do for you. 
Do you prefer jasmine to basmati?  I have both but used basmati.  I had never made rice before, so I'm curious to hear what your thoughts on rice varieties are.
Hah! That's why I was asking! I always imagine stories to the music I'm listening to. I'm creative and I daydream 60% of every day, so I'm pretty good at it. When I workout it's all crazy hardcore action and over-the-top drama going on in my brain. It's so fun!
I'm agnostic, my husband is Buddhist, and my younger son is a Secular Humanist.  My older son was Lutheran for awhile, he might still be for all I know.
Strictly wet food to start. I have her on wet food that is small pieces in mostly liquid. She was eating well at the vet, so if she stops eating here we will have to have her get injections to make her eat. I also got a cat water fountain, which should help some.
It's not so much "different philosophies." As /u/treetrouble pointed out, Penn Station is owned by Amtrak. Amtrak is in a nearly impossible situation controlled by Congress. I think they just don't have the financial freedom to invest and renovate. 
Yep, that's the thing with chaos. It was god damn time EU scene experience it first hand. Just like NA with LMQ last year.Because, seriously, when that shit happen for you for the first time at world when you play a chineese team, that's not really the good moment to learn how to deal with it.
The US has to be the most two faced country on the planet. On one side they send warships literally to the other side of the planet to seize Iranian ships. Then they send warships to prevent Iran doing the same to a third party. Mind you outside Iran's own coast. I wonder if the US would be happy about China escorting their commercial ships with destroyers and carriers along the US coast.
So you like "on-disc" DLC then? You are entitled to your own opinion, but on-disc DLC benefits you, the consumer, in no way. With Day 1 DLC it's possible that it wasn't ready when the game went gold, so it's delivered in the form of a day 1 download. This way, the DLC is still technically Day 1 DLC, but it wasn't content that was cut from the base game to serve as a pre-order incentive.But on-disc DLC is exactly that. It's on the disc, so it was ready when the rest of the game went gold. For the lack of a better term, that's holding content hostage.
Civ got old fast. This sounds more like you simply have a preference for Civ. Which is fine, but civ isn't free of fake depth and plenty of less popular games are not killed by their complexity. Dominions3/4 has perhaps the most complexity of any game and yet it still has tons of vocal long term fans who even use mods to make the game MORE complex.
Yes it would, this is the quick and easy solution.  There are online calculators to help you pick the resistor values(for an input, higher is better, 10k or 100k ohms should work).  Shoot for 5v at the input when the signal is 14v.   The brake signal will be noisy so you'll probably want to use some software to debounce it.  There are some good articles on Adafruit and Arduino.CC about how to do this. 
It should slowly transition from one color to another. If i remember correctly spectral spectrum is red to yellow on red team and blue to white on blu team
Because I have guns lying around waiting to be used, and as a business/ home owner and under castle law. Come fuck with my property or family I have every right to kill you..
Yeah my heart rate was 121 up until they announced it and I think all the build up made it a huge let down when we didn't get him.I was one of the people saying I don't think they should trade the farm for him but man I want a QB I can believe in
I guarantee thousands of people drive stoned everyday, if it was such a danger to society why don't we see dui death rates from weed like we do with alcohol?? Accidents from being high on weed are either never reported because we don't even have statistics for them, or maybe, just maybe, smoking weed isn't the same and drinking and driving. Which do you think is the more logical conclusion? That there's some global conspiracy to ignore high DUI statistics or weed smoking drivers aren't as dangerous as you think...Driving while stupid is even more dangerous yet you do it everyday :p
&gt; Is it not strange that we want Democracy everywhere except the workplace?You have to understand ... we have a republic.  Many of us are opposed to the idea of a direct democracy.  We have a representative one.And no ... we do not like government in the workplace.  Merging the state and industry is a disastrous idea.
I work occasionally with teachers in the inner city, some of the things they say are atrocious. Middle School referring to a student "Little hoodrats will never learn this kind of stuff"3rd grade "I guess she'll have to learn how to start working boys for money because she's not getting math"High School "He's a fucking idiot who will never do anything or be anything except for a newspaper headline"I swear **some** people get into it just for achance to re live their failed school experience and boss people around. I will say that teachers are also some of the most amazing inspiring people I've ever met and visiting schools is often the highlight of my month. 
Looks like it's seen some pretty heavy use!...As an aside, I found out as a child after tearing one apart (for science!) that the figures in there are really rather small. I was amazed at just how much the bouncy-material magnifies it. I've still got that tiny Vaporeon... somewhere...
here's the video : https://youtu.be/LhNdbipWPFYpretty nasty stuff, I'm amazed that he can recover from that with proper care.   I was positive that it was just a matter of time before he would die.   But I guess others have survived worse.
"Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike."  "...It hurts, ...It hurts..."  "It's not right... not right... not right..."  You cannot grasp the true form of Fazbear.  
Good advice - yeah, same thing happened, more or less, on our family.  Cut out the crazy abusive people.They are of course entitled to their narrow little lives.  Annie sounds like a strong person, but one who needs the support of her SO (as we all do).Oh, and btw, if you're dealing with Bible-believing Christians or the equivalent "all sins are equal in the eyes of the Lord," hence the equating of infidelity and anything else.  This can be a doctrine that underpins tolerance and forgiveness if you read it one way - but usually, it's used just as you saw it used (to equate all "sins" with each other).
Er no. 42 is the answer to the ultimate question, which hasn't been calculated yet. It could be about life but like I said, I don't know.  42 however is not the answer to life or the ultimate answer to every question.  Do you even hitchhike?
I think coffee addiction is absolutely horrible. My extensive experience with it was it made me kind of crazy, angry, and unable to experience deep and happy psychedelic places. You're not happy when you're addicted to coffee in particular; tea is a little different. But because it's so accepted in society, few people even realize it. I'm infinitely more clear-headed now that I just smoke a little weed and get my energy from a healthy diet and avoid stimulants altogether.
I have a bone to pic with you.This is clearly the creator's tumblr blog so that means that having a different source would be moot as it'd still be the same image.If you click the link then you can find the artist's DeviantArt in the sidebar.[Here ya go, ya lazy fuck.](http://isquaredart.deviantart.com/art/Fight-Club-Satsuki-529436532)If tumblr is blocked for you for some reason then disregard most of what I said.
I can see some pros and cons. The downside is it kinda separates you from the rest of your families, both symbolically and in terms of how clear it is you're related. I guess it depends how your relatives feel about it and how you feel about them.
&gt; I find the filename a little bit strange (2014.10.17.0000.0000)I wish I could tell you how much more you have to download, but I don't remember the file sizes when I updated my PS4 copy. If it makes you feel any better, I think the current patch version is 2015.04.21.0000.0000 or something like that. Definitely 2015.04.x though.
Most of the time you can find the intro graphic/cinema files and rename them and the game will boot immediately to the main menu.  A neat little trick I've picked up.
My mom just turned 69 earlier this month and she's lost about 20 pounds on keto. She's been on and off for about 9 months and still has some pain in her knee but I hope that now that she's re-dedicated herself to the diet it will help her lose more and get rid of the inflammation/pain in her knee.
A month ago, a womans unborn baby was cut out of her and died. People wanted her attacker arrested for murder because she killed a baby. The police said no murder charges because unborn babies are not people. People like it when their definitions work to their advantage, but cant stand it when it benefits others.
so you're saying if I collect it for the first day at 7:45 est, then 16 minutes later I could collect it again just past 8:00 est cause it resets at that time? No certain time required in between? Just resets at 8:00 EST everyday?
It never came up eh?  Why would it?  I'd be hurt if my family member keep something like that from me too.  Nothing wrong with it but it is abnormal, you should have talked about it with them.
It kinda feels like... nothing. You hear about the shit that happens to other races and think "Seriously? Is that even a thing" and yet you know that it totally is a thing. On the other hand, people (honestly, it's *usually* people who are white themselves) will say all kinds of things that they would *never* say to someone of another race, and justify it as "it's impossible to be racist against white people". 
&gt; Then why are the states not allowed to define it as "A man and a woman?"Have you read any of the legal arguments made by gay marriage proponents?

That was me. Unfortunately I bit the bullet last week and ordered for full price after /u/pointerbrand mentioned the next sale would be for repeat customers. Kicking myself now, oh well. A great price now for anyone who's still interested.
Aw, your right. I really liked the mechanics and the story. So I can't say I disliked it. The ending did feel really flat though.Hey, anyone who's played the game, is there an alternate ending that Mark missed?
Whats funny is most routers are at 1GBPS so even if you got a big family hard hitting the line I can't see any benefit to this since your bottle neck is the router. 
Then hold your weapon in the ready position, not pointed at the person. This is a very basic rule of gun safety and use.Your weapon should not be pointed at anything you don't intend to destroy. This should apply to police as well, but it doesn't seem to. Any competent gun user or military veteran will tell you the same; your weapon doesn't come up if you aren't about to fire.
The conductors won't measuring the paper, if that's what you're wondering. As long as the QR codes aren't distorted (which they won't be as you printed it unscaled), then you'll be fine. 
glass work is indeed fascinating! Watching it be done is quite fascinating as well. I had a friend who made pipes and pendants and each one was so unique in its own way. They were so beautiful. And now, i kind of want a glass eye! lol. 
You could Nut if she interests you. Awoken Venus might be an interesting option. Durga might be fun, as you seem to have a lot of good dark subs. For farming, you could try a dark fagan team. YOu have Hino Kagu/Ronia/Dragon Shogun, which are some of his best subs.
Nice fucking work! I grew up where they filmed the first Mad Max (our house was just near Anakie Rd), so I loved the effort that went into matching the footage to the audio. 
The name Kattegat probably wasn't around at the time the series is set. It is a Dutch name likely from the time of the Hanze/Hansa trading league, a bunch of centuries later.
Can you please drop this on every TBM wearing those anti-porn porn-kills-love tees?? Please?? They are fucking up my facebook and Instagram feed. Thanks.
I said it before, but when my disaster is getting Amari Cooper, I'm not too bummed. I'm surprised for sure, but I have faith AC/DC will make some magic happen this year.
Little MacDoesn't Matter (On the box)Doesn't Matter (On the packaging)I REALLY need Little Mac! He'll ALMOST complete Wave 2 for me. I need him and Pit to finish it off. But I want Little Mac more. I plan an using him in Smash Bros Wii U. :)

I've always thought the combination of business law and family law could handle all relevant complications.  I've never been sure as to why it wouldn't work.
You got $100 and $13 for Valet/C1? I got 3x$25 and 1x$0 for the 4 Zingers. All were in excellent, mint condition without any issues, scratches, dent, corrosion, etc.
About a year ago, they were briefly best buds, Mitch was on Harmontown a few times, and they were supposedly working on a project together. I guess it never panned out, but I really like them as a duo. 
*Path is blessed above all other worlds, they said.  For the God of Path is Gloriously Bright.**Xenocide*, Orson Scott CardSometimes I think he wrote the entire Ender series just to end with that line.
You forgot Demetrious Underwood, and I havent forgotten about any of those. Hell after last year you could add Kalil to that mix. I still truly believe none would be as bad as Ponder.

Revan? I'm curious, what feat, of any sort, does Revan have that's competitive with Darth Sidious - or even close to his level? Revan was put down hard by the Sith Emperor, who's been canonically stated many times to be weaker than Palpatine. 
I was thinking about this today.  We were the original generation that was playing hand-held games in black-and-white, just like our parents/grandparents were watching TV in black-and-white while we have all this fancy color HD now
Wow...so someone downvotes my apology too. A mirocoft product in an apple sub. Don't know which camp is guilty on that downvote.Anyways the product looks genuinely interesting though after reading the article and watching the intro video. I do a lot of c# and asp.net coding to pay the bills, but on the home front its all apple. I'll have to give this a whirl.
The only problem is that commercial buildings cause noise pollution. Which is dumb. In my experience, if commercial areas are noisy, it's only because of traffic. 
Woldstar is another website that host videos.A lot of street fights on it, and are what it's known for. As it became popular the people filming began to shout out the name of the site as they filmed since they were going to post it on the site.http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/worldstarhiphop
I sanded my Lodge smooth late last year. I seasoned it with Crisco 3 times. I cook in it multiple times a week and it has yet to get darker than this. I've cooked bacon, fried chicken, cooked steak and this is what it looks like today. Did I not do enough layers of Crisco? It's pretty non-stick as it is, so should I not worry about it?
Ursprünglich gab es die Bäume schon, aber im Krieg und in der Nachkriegszeit wurden die alle als Feuerholz genutzt. [So sah der Tiergarten 1945 aus](http://www.istvanocztos.com/uploads/3/3/4/5/334511/1138881_orig.jpg) – bei dem wurde die gewonnene Freifläche als Acker genutzt.
I've thought about that too.  I think that's the route I'll end up going.  I actually am vegan because I have a hard time processing dairy from cows, and when I was younger all I would drink was goat milk.
heheheActually Steamworks isn't that great. Try Spa Excess. So much more laid back and classy. There's a bar with cheap beer, a lounge/TV room (normal TV, not porn), billiards (iirc), a gym, and a rooftop patio/garden. Not to mention they actually card people coming in... Sure, there's plenty of sex if you want, but last time I just went to socialize. Met a bunch of awesome people and went barhopping afterwards.
Take an honest look at the US and European countries that employ socialism, and you tell me which is doing better overall. Yes, you're right they aren't perfect, but one is clearly doing better than the other when allowed to do so more unfettered by government intervention. &gt; The division we see in today's society has been brought to you by the rigid mind that cannot comprehend new ideasNot sure if you pay any attention to history or not but Socialism isn't a new idea. It is the principle of taking from the wealthy, or more accurately taking from anyone who has. This has been around since the time of Monarchies, hardly a new concept. You cannot seriously and honestly look at what is happening in Ukraine, and say that all the "fear mongering" about the Russians that existed during the Cold War (as if it actually ever ended) was completely unfounded and based on nothing more than blind opposition. 
Its pretty adequate for sure, but when you take into account there is not any modding, wont be, and all the dlc will be spendy... it could be a bit better.Of course, as with everything, more is always better (*to a point unlike GT/Forza where cars feel too similar.*) That said, the list is *highly* pleasing.  McLaren F1?  P1?  Sauber c9?  Modern dtm? A few Aston's?  A few RUF's?  More LMP's than any other sim?Yeah, the car list is quite pleasing :)
I don't know. I prefer the way Chicago does it. It is illegal to ride on the sidewalk. That makes sense to me. I am a cyclist, and I just don't see using the sidewalk in most of the city. Places like E. Marginal Way being like the only exception - where there's no pedestrians, and the roads are literally highways. And then you have to be SUPER careful and slow way down at intersections.  - I mean. I don't even ride on the sidewalks on roads like Canyon Drive in Kent, or James Street. In the lane all the way. There are so few highways where riding on the street is just too dangerous. 
You're free to stop replying at any time if it bothers you that much having your racism pointed out. That's the difference between you and someone who actually experience racism - they have to deal with it in everything they do every day. You can walk away from a conversation that makes you uncomfortable.
Actually I don't think most of the people who proclaim themselves the defenders of social justice understand social justice. I on the other hand believe in equality for everyone regardless of race and gender.
Well hell, there's already tons of bro love between Ducks and Vols fans...might as well get this to the professional level too.Oh, and initiation rituals? Just broken hearts, and crushed dreams.
We have ones that do that too, but you tend to have 10-15 of these at big jobs, and we do a lot of dry fire fighting. we can get a lot of them at short notice.they need to go anywhere, and they do that really well. 
I can agree that they were overplayed, that's fair. I wouldn't say a waste of time though. I still enjoy almost all of the album, even if they aren't all heavy hitters. 
If Markstrom sucks two years from now, hopefully our goalie prospects will be better positioned to help us, if that's too soon for them, I imagine Lindenning will find a stopgap until Demko etc are ready.Markstrom is still a good goaltender, Melanson is a good coach, it's still very possible Markstrom becomes a legit NHL goalie.
Wood is essentially a semiconductor. At a really high voltage it conducts, but it normally doesn't. I ran into that when making a Van Der graaff generator. The wood is a conductor as far as the generator was concerned. 
Really depends how curved it is. Go with the smaller stickers to be safe. The bigger ones will definitely have creases when you try time wrap it round and uneven surface. 
Get a maid right off the bat and split that 4 ways. You will save yourselves a lot of headache since, being new to living on your own, and having 4 roommates you don't need the added friction.You'll still come out way ahead.Also, might consider having each person be in charge of one night's dinner and making extra for leftovers. This way you all depend less on takeout or waste food.
I find it odd, but maybe it's cultural? It's not uncommon for children to still breastfeed into toddler hood in some places. I know studies have shown that extending breastfeeding is beneficial for the child's growth and overall development but to each their own. I am not an expert by any means! 
There are so many other options given the circumstances that could've led to a better ending. I swear that ending was designed to leave literally everybody disappointed.
&gt;Look this really isn't complicated. I want a hover board, that knows where I want to go before I do, and has a built in ASIC miner. Why is this so hard? Seriously we already have Skateboards, GPS, self driving cars, Hovercraft, and ASIC miners. Why won't someone code this for me? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRzqI3BJ2A&gt;Hell I'll even split the profit 60/4060/40 = 1.5. I want more than 1.5% profit.
&gt; I do not know her at all and have no ties to her or anyone she knows.Then what business is it of yours?&gt; If I was snooping I would have gone through his phone without asking. I did not have any intention of snooping which is why I asked him instead. It was left open for me to see sorry not sorry.*sigh* My point is that if he isn't entitled to any privacy and has to tell you everything, then why do you think snooping is wrong?Wouldn't it be way more efficient for you simply to monitor all of his communications than talk to him about it if you feel you're entitled to know everything that is going on?EDIT: That's not to say that I think he should dodge a direct question, but I think a certain degree of trust is necessary for a healthy relationship. You certainly don't have the right to pry into everything he does in the name of openness. So there's a lot in this relationship I'd be concerned about, were I you.
That the problem of evil refutes theism is controversial (though to say that is has persuasive power seems fine)To say that rejecting the existence of god (or at least a benevolent god) solves the problem of evil seems true - there is no obvious reason to expect the world to be all-good if there is no master plan.Though it would be interesting to see if someone can come up with one.
I love this pick. Carr finally has someone to throw to. Cooper is legit, he is such a good route runner and has great hands. You don't find WRs like him very often. 
I'm An Australian who gets matched up with people who don't even speak English half the time, let alone other Australians so i can have decent ping. I pretty much stopped playing online until they fix this.

I wouldn't call it a filler. We learned a new thing about gems, a kinda important thing - rushed regeneration can lead to disaster. I wonder if it can lead to corruption.I imagine that during the war a lot of gems tried to regenerate as fast as possible, so they could get moving and back to the fight before someone shattered them. Their gems are very vulnerable when they don't have a body to get them out of the way of a giant axe. Maybe too many rushed regenerations on a short period of time caused them to become corrupt, or if not corrupt, unstable and easily corruptible by whatever actually made them corrupt.I found the episode kinda important, even if to only make me speculate.
This is a better answer than I could've given. I didn't count calories at all, just enjoyed the freedom of eating everything in sight and making sure I got tons of protein. If I had to throw out a guess it would be 3500/day, and some weeks with massive binges could've been more like 4500. It should be noted that I only cared about raw mass gains (which translated into strength gains), muscle definition was not on my radar in any capacity. 
What do you mean?EDIT: Nevermind, I misread. But, to answer your question, he's trying to make it look as close to the real game as possible while being spacious enough for however many players are on. 
I'd be surprised if the gaia guardians aren't protected against insanely high attack damage weapons, then mods like Orespawn and Wildycraft would make them a joke.
I would have to agree about C7.  With the discount codes that they posted in the Perk sub I got 10 ZTE Sources for about 10 bux each last month.  They ended up being some pretty nice phones for the price.
Nope, still doesn't work. The boss from the left still wins, because he achieved the ultimate goal first: reaching the top of the mountain. It doesn't even look like he needed those bottom two losers at all (but the second highest guy on the left is still doing better than the entire right team on his own). Whereas, on the right side of the mountain, the other boss is actually being held back by his incompetent help. He should have ponied up and hired better quality climbers, and maybe working as a competent team they could have beat the boss on the left. 
What I don't understand is how apparently people don't get that if something is omnipotent it is all powerful. Being all powerful means that it has the power to do anything. Thus, it can't be restricted.Even if an omnipotent being were restricted by a set of laws it would have the power by its own definition to change those laws. It's a moot point because the definition says it all and it's a fictional item that we're arguing over. If there were an omnipotent being that we could interact with then by all means argue about it's abilities, but this is a poor understanding of a definition of a word.
Caught on a 4" watermelon senko.  Bought an Abu Garcia Black Max/Cabela's proguide combo yesterday for $50.00.  No backlashes or bird nests.  I would say today was a successful day.
It is true that Mt. A can have good relations with its neighbors without the UN, but the scale of the UN stretches far beyond Mt. A's back yard. As a member nation, Mt. A would be able to talk to the myriad other members of the UN in a professional manner. To address your second point, under no circumstances would Augustans need to fight under the UN banner against their will. If a universal resolution is passed declaring war and Mt. A does not support it, then Mt. A can leave the UN.
I love to see results like that for every crucible game! I think it would be cool to see what weapons were used most commonly and who was your Nemesis too.  I think Halo 3 had that IIRC
Australia- around $5000 per year for 6 years with a 10% discount for whatever is paid upfront. But that was before a lot of the degrees changed from undergraduate to postgraduate with course restructuring so I don't know the current cost.
MS is a heterogenic disease currently divided into four forms: Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), where transient exacerbations are followed by remission; secondary progressive MS (SPMS), which develops in RRMS patients and is marked by worsening of symptoms without remission; primary progressive MS (PPMS), where symptoms gradually worsen without a previous relapsing-remitting stage; and progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS), where symptoms gradually worsen and patients experience acute exacerbations without remission (Goldenberg, 2012; Ortiz et al., 2014). However, due to the vague disease course of PRMS, it is being suggested that this classification be discontinued (Lublin et al., 2014).I am not sure if RRMS always progresses to SPMS or if it is possible to have RRMS without it ever developing into SPMS.  Either way "RRMS" itself is considered "non-progressive" because there is not a worsening of symptoms, at least until it develops into SPMS.
The reason I have an AS is because I couldn't handle the math portion of my program. I retook Pre Calculus 3 times and still didn't understand it. CS, at least when I went through it, was heavily focused on programming. I was never interested in programming, but, it was the only tech program at my school at the time.IN my experience, on the support side of things, advanced math is rarely required. I'm sure those that build the networks need to worry about understanding hex and proper subnetting, but, I don't. While I have to make sure the device is on the proper subnet, I don't build the networks so I don't need to know how to do it.I would love to get into server support, but, I currently work for a very large, multi national, corporation and all the servers are in another state. There is a LOT of department segregation in my company and moving up through the ranks of the IT department is very hard to do if you can't drop everything to relocate when a position opens up.
&gt; So you are against the RFRA laws like the one in Indiana that allows businesses to refuse to serve Gay weddings if their religious beliefs don't allow Gay weddings? Wasn't that amended?
Depends...If I can't stand him - no way! If a creep is not good enough for me he is not good enough for her. If I still love him - no....unless they are really in love then I will have to deal with it. I
Yeah she is pretty terrible. Seen her in the indies and she's just as bad there. She's dating Mad Man Pondo so I don't think she'll be improving anytime soon.
Very interesting, I'd not even considered this as an obstacle. Surely with our increasing population we will need to be building more generation capacity in coming years.
Not surprised Del Rio passed on Leonard Williams.  Williams doesn't explode off the line, he's going to be a solid 3-4 DE that eats up blocks but he's not going to be a Pro bowler.  Cooper is the best pick here.
I think it would be a bit too convenient to find 5-10 able bodied trained knights hanging out in a Sept - perhaps he could find a rag tag group that he whips into shape, with maybe only a few of them being practiced knights?

You're totally wrong. You don't think intelligence has anything to do with inherited gene mutations? Of course it does, that is how intelligent animals evolved. What fallacy is it to think that if you stand where cars are likely to crash you are in more danger than if you went about your day normally? That is perfectly logical.His comment was simplified of course, there is no one "trait" of intelligence, but based on the truth.
I don't think it's coming to PS3. You'll need a PS4 or Vita (or maybe a PC, not confirmed yet, but fairly likely to come out shortly after) if you want 2nd Encore.
Cartels would **NEVER** allow that. Why? Because it would fuck with their money. The last thing a cartel boss wants is even MORE security and surveillance on the border.
Yeah it's a sacrifice for a bit of damage for a bit of AC.  I would personally not use TWF because I like to keep my bonus action available for other tasks.
That I grew up without a father and I never really got to know him.  It's hard to have regrets when you are 5, but I now wonder all the time how different my life would have been.  I also regret not being able to tell him I loved him one last time.  I am glad that his death helped pass the stringent drunk driving laws we now have so that other children (and people) didn't have to grow up the same way I did.
Cooper's going to be a very good WR as long as he stays healthy.  So I don't think he's a bad pick.  I don't think he has the ceiling to be among the best WRs in the league though and that's usually what you would expect at #4.  
He's at least got the leg up on Maher for not backing any pseudoscience or woo, but I can see how a lot of the public might not like his confrontational attitude on some subjects.

Both are tiny, the node is about 100$(Readily available), the M1 i think 200 with special order. 
Centaur aghs is straight up broken in teamfights. Alch and octarine core as expected overhyped and not even that strong on practice.Lotus orb is most fun and high skill-cap thing that was added and it's enjoying as hell, definitely my favorite addition.Also ld ratting power is over the board and should be hotfixed with centaur in .64a. You just go maelstorm, moon thingy and aghs and your opponent can't finish game anymore.
I very explicitly did **not** mean Jetty, a horrendous pile of legacy and crappy IO code that has practically been weaponized :)I name Tomcat and Netty as the former, despite also being ancient (in terms of Java-land), is a wonderful, fully J2EE/servlet capable webapp server, and the latter is what everyone should use for practically every single other type of IO project/service (barring the times that something terrific already exists, such as HTTPD/Nginx for plain HTTP[S]).
omg I KNOW RIGHT? I thought it was so insulting! She seriously said that I "obviously have no kids or hate them". OMG what if I couldn't have children? Ouch. What if I didn't want children? My choice. What if this has nothing to do with the situation? YUPPPPP
I'm trying to say that the reviewer may have had legitimate concerns but didn't word the comment well.  I'm not saying it's a good or helpful review comment, but it might still have some underlying reason which is agreeable.I don't think we should jump on someone as being excessively sexist from one comment posted on twitter taken out of context.
Most BWW aren't showing because they've decided it'll cost them too much. Here's a list of some places showing it though http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2015/04/27/mayweather-pacquiao-indianapolis-boxing-pay-per-view/26465717/
That's interesting! I have the same problem. Like, I feel I'm that lab monkey who was prevented from having contact his whole life. I was wondering about Krav Maga since I'm not down with crossfit. I'm not in great shape. Not horrible either. How intense is it? I only have time right now to work out 3x a week. But I really need to improve my physique and some kind of hobby.

Really not sure, I was reading up on MacRumors because I'm debating between a GS60 and 15" rMBP. Intel said it would be 20-40% faster and have 48EU vs. 40EU. Speculation is that it will match the 750M - which would be enough for me to fuck around in TF2 at 60fps, I guess.
Do you think Braxton Miller will be drafted as a QB in the **2016** draft?  I don't think he can play in the league, but will be a good "athlete".Where is the 2015 draft thread?
Step 1: read a lot about financial independence. It'll all become pretty intuitive after a while. The learning curve is pretty short.Step 2: think about how much you would need per year to spend in retirement. Multiply that by 25. This is how much you want to save during your working years.Step 3: Make a budget that allows you to save that much. Here's a spreadsheet to help you - just fill it out. Note the multiple tabs. Also, set your rate of return on investments to something like 4% to account for inflation in your calculations.https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AB979IpnPJErlLhiOktwnt2U-Uwgn189sGotW0Ls9vc/edit?usp=sharing
Very true. Also, everyone in our brigade who wants BA has got it, the others - about half our members - have chosen not to for various reasons which is entirely up to them. CFA is stressing the importance of BA more these days but has traditionally not been a priority for rural brigades. 
I like that it's effectively, "here's my voting record, categorized for your convenience". Is this common? I don't recall seeing this as a common way of describing a platform. Generally, I sense that candidates prefer to "talk their way through things" ...
That's why I gave a few question options, because obviously not every one can capture each type. In general, I've noticed that most Perceivers think more about their long term plans or hobbies they want to pick up etc than actually getting it done. However it's true that Se-dom is more about the action (it's a good indicator of their type). ESTP and ESFP seem to work sporadically in bursts of intense energy. They don't seem to plan but more just react, just go with the present moment. I do find those two a little confusing to type at face value, because they can come across as Te at first, but when you observe them, the Se is a give-away.
I think Laylee having a ranged attack based on sound (was it called a sonar burst in the IGN article?) will be pretty cool and bring you back into Kazooie with eggs.
Oh wow! The balls on him, that is super fucking hot, to mention that you were shaking so badly in front of him...wow. There is no doubt he has been steadily using all of your videos and pictures for personal pleasure. Just have to answer me this, did he put his hands on your ass that day? Anyways I will stop, you answered more than enough of my prying questions. Actually one more, Theoretically speaking, if there was no consequences of your family falling apart or taking advantage of you further, would you let him know about the fantasy or give him more videos however you can?
Look into the Poker III. Is a 60% mechanical keyboard so it's small and has a program layer built in. This means that you can store the macros on the keyboard and activate then through the pn button. This will allow you to activate an f10 macro with fn+pn+f10. Fn and pn are right next to each other so it isn't a problem. The poker II can do the same thing but it's since been discontinued and will be hard to find. I believe you can do the same thing with some Ducky boards as well, bit maybe sure to double check. 
Wrong on all accounts, though Touch of Evil and The Seventh Seal were both my initial favorites of Welles and Bergman when I first started watching their works.EDIT: I will also add that my favorite Welles film isn't Citizen Kane either.

The effort bar is low and you do not have to personally take them to court: File a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Office.  They will investigate the facts and render a decision.  This is a reasonable and inexpensive way to get an official government  stance on the issue that also gives the charter rights offender an order/opportunity  to stop the charter violating practise/behaviour. (the ostensible goal is rehabilitation, not punishment ) If the offender ignores the order, THAT is when the shit starts to hit the fan, and you can just grab some popcorn and watch from the sidelines.  Source: have done this.
I mean, it's sort of prickish to not give her another shot, but she even says it doesn't matter *why* she lost them, just that she did. Its a business, you don't reward people for failure.
See my sister took the SAT, worked her ass off studying for it a year and a half in advance, and she got a 2080. All I have to back myself up is the Question of the Day app and a class I'm taking at school. I feel really unprepared. 
I like to think that every year he thinks it will finally be the year he doesn't get booed, then he boldly steps onto the stage with a smile on his face. Only to have his dream promptly shat on by all the drunk fans. 
Holy shit y'all, I just discovered this sub and it's my new favorite! I actually lol-ed at these comment-gems. When I'm hungover (or plain lazy), I like to dramatically collapse onto the floor super-inconveniently right in my guy's way. I'll make weird squawking noises and loudly proclaim "baby bird is hungry" until he goes pick up whatever junk food I'm craving. I'm totally a grown up!
Oh sure everyone uses it. But nobody likes it. Most engineers treat pro tools the way you treat the mandatory vaccine shot before travelling. Obviously you have to do it, but it's not pleasant.Can't remember the last time I heard someone actually say something positive about PT
I don't understand why Google can't seem to make their services run efficiently on their own operating system. My old iPhone 4s had horrendous battery life by the time I got rid of it, barely hitting 2.5 hours SOT, but it did better in standby than my Turbo. That we have to root just to fix problems in Google's own apps is ridiculous.
ESPN's football "analysts" act like they're splitting the atom. Trent Dilfer said "you cannot lose games in the NFL and still win" and damn near spiked his clip-on mic.
I'd recommend banana cream and strawberry regular instead of ripe or even both. Stand alone strawberry is hella good. Ripe for mixing. And honeydew man. Best one ever
Minority or majority =\= everyone. Your claims mean nothing because you don't get to tell someone what they think about their phone is wrong. Maybe that was their main reason for buying a Nexus, and yours was to flash roms. It's not "very incorrect." Everyone has their own view, *sir*
I can agree some but looking at Baltimore and trying to light the pizza guy on fire or burning down the pharmacy, I would think you'd go after the courthouses, city hall and police stations not the community itself and the places you depend on for medicine to survive? The majority of this is people being assholes because they can get away with it right now.
&gt; Many atheist fall back on evolution as there evidenceNo they don't, or at least shouldn't. Evolution says absolutely nothing about the existence or otherwise of God/s.&gt;There is as much evidence that god exists as there is evidence that god doesn't existThere is no such thing as evidence that something doesn't exist. The complete lack of evidence just makes it likely that one doesn't exist, especially one that gives a fuck about us.Edit - BTW, unless you believe in a god you are an atheist.
I would go with Freddy or Odoamne, Sven, Febiven, Forg1ven/Vander or Rekkles/Yellowstar.If you want to play to win lane take botlane1 if you want to be less ADC centric go with botlane2. Note that individually i think Forg1ven and Yellowstar are the best at their roles - however their playstyle is to different.
I am suggesting that God grants us free will. I understand that my proposal that God is not omniscient will seem like I am putting limits on God to some people. However, this is just my understanding of the paradox, and I do not feel that this makes God any less powerful. But, I've said it before, I could be wrong.
Do you actually understand the issue? There are no copper lines run into the building, this is by design since it's an outmoded technology that has no use beyond landline phones, and since those can be replaced by VoIP, there is no financial justification for running in archiac cabling into a building.It's not greed, it's forward progress and actually quite surprising forethought. The generations following them into this building are going to want internet, and if they don't are capable of using cell phones. Yes it sucks there's no copper landline available for them, but there are plenty of solutions available, but rather than attempt to try something new, they just complain and demand to be catered too.Maybe we shouldn't be using all this fancy new medical technology to keep them alive if they hate progress so much, kinda solves two problems at once.
Thanks! Kinda have to keep it inexpensive for now but if my fan base increases, then a microphone and dedicated camera are the first purchases to make.
MW2 was the most fun I have ever had in a cod game. Maybe the most fun I've ever had in a video game ever.  It was so fucking fun. Go watch a Sandy Ravage video of him shitting on people in MW2 and try to tell me that isn't fun as hell. 
I do this every semester. Makes life alot easier when you are having problems in class, profs are more helpful when they know you care about what they do, not just your GPA.

*Pulling the book back that he'd originally been still holding over the edge of the balcony, to some, it may have looked as if the young man may have tossed the books over the ledge on purpose. Seeing one of the textbooks hit someone in the face, he rushed down from the second floor to see if she was alright.**On his way down, he caught the leer of a rather pissed librarian, and gave her a small wave as he pressed his lips together nervously. Approaching the young student, he set the only book he had left down and extended a hand to her.* "Oum, I-I'm so sorry. Um…a-are you alright?" *He says in a quick, but quiet tone, his eyes averted from everyone and everything as the embarrassment of what he'd just done continuously spread throughout his body.*
This is an interesting case actually.The blood vessels in the sclera (white) respond to a drop in the intraocular pressure; as the medium is allowed to expand, the blood vessels follow suit and cause the redness.So those blood vessels aren't expanding as a result of the THC, but as a result of the expansion in the surrounding tissues.

Myrcella will not become the queen of Dorne, but of Westeros as King Tommen's wife. Princess Arianne is likely the next ruler of Dorne. Best guess is that is Danaerys Targaryen or another similar looking character readers may know about. 
When we were expecting our first child, my mother-in-law told me a story about my partner when he was a toddler. She was pushing him in a grocery cart in a busy grocery store in the summer. He pulled her tube top *all* the way down and cried out "boobies" and latched on in front of everybody - other breast still just out there! She said that was the last time she wore a tube top ever. I told my partner on the spot that we would be doing baby sign language for "milk" at the bare minimum and baby would not know the word "boobies".
Sure Rome was the greatest power in the world at their height, if they wanted something bad enough they could have found away to get it. But that's not to say they never tried to capture places like Scotland. They made many attempts, even establishing many defensive lines. But all attempts past Harridans Wall failed and Rome was always pushed back to that line. Maybe if they thought Scotland had something of great value to offer they would have put more resources towards its conquest, but as is a big reason Rome never held Scotland is because the people there did not want Rome hanging around. This is similar to Romes relations with the Germans. Ireland is a different matter, there is next to no evidence to suggest that Rome ever seriously want Ireland or had any kind of military involvement there. 
I see this mistake so many times on the internet, it's pretty ridiculous. If so many people are fans of the guy, then how come they can't spell his damn name correctly.
If I'm a Bucks fan I look at that ejection as a good indicator. Realistically nobody thought you were making it past round one so his ejection isn't important in the big picture. But that kid wanted to win, showed passion, and unfortunately got the foul. That move to me showed more heart than malice IMO
Dude awesome! Is that a filter over it? Is it possible to remove it? Or is that just how trace works? If that's the best you can do then I'll take it. Thanks!
Shocking that someone that prides themselves on advertising that they actively take joy in the suffering of people that aren't like them would be equally disgusting both outside and in.
Fun.   We're going to be starting on calls at my job soon.   I'm in health care IT. Going to bed early because I'm sleepy and feeling down.   I'm started taking blood pressure meds yesterday,  they're helping but they're also sapping my energy,  which the doc said was possible.   I think they're causing mood swings too. 
Yes, for the small percentage of times that has happened. Because most crops are never propagated from used seed there's no opportunity for cross-pollination. Though it is an issue for those few that do self propagate, and it sucks for them, but it isn't specific to GMOs. Just becomes good management practices at that point,and is a reality of nature with no conceivable workaround, so... 
I'm honoured that your first post on this account was to call me a racist for suggesting that the person convicted of Hae Min Lee's murder most likely did it!I guess I'm in the company of noted racist [Ira Glass](http://www.reddit.com/r/serialpodcast/comments/2v8y8y/ira_glass_thinks_adnan_killed_hae/) on this one, amongst many, many other racists.
Thanks! I keep them indoors. I have a spare room with my fishing gear and I set the motors up in the there. I have a 10' in-process wood boat being built and I'll bring some of the motors with that to shows. My wood boat will run the Mark 20, Mark 25, and my 1957 Evinrude Fastwin rhats not pictured. I have a 14' 1957 Speed Queen that will run the Mark 30 and Merc 500. Different motors for different loads and shows. 
And it is Golden Week here in Japan. I get about a week off - spent the first day pretty much sleeping, the second playing Game of Thrones with folks from work... The rest of it is just Unplanned.I'll probably spend some of my conscious hours working on my Spencerian, which is still a horrorshow, and maybe see what kinks I need to work out of other scripts. Should be fun.
&gt;sub-standard beingsThis is possibly the most hilariously stupid way to describe anyone I've ever heard.  I just imagine like . . . I dunno, "regular" people are Fords and Chevys and VWs, but those *sub-standard beings* are all Yugos or something.
Regardless of my affinity or lack-thereof towards Bush, at that rate, no President should receive any credit because they have experts help them make decisions.
Wait, wait, wwaaiitt....There is no **way** that this guy is for real. If not, he is fucking hilarious. If he is, ...Edit: [He's an ac-tor, apparently.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrrxOzl68PY)
I haven't followed this story step by step, but what indication, if any, has there been that he had anything to do with the murder? A lot of this has seemed like irresponsible reporting with a lot of dangerous speculation.
She's 67? I thought i heard someone on tv say she was in her early 70s. Anyway, age aside, he'd balance out the New York liberal label that'll get thrown around either candidate. Besides, the VP is a terrible place to waste talented people like Booker, Warren, and Franken.
You left out the pertinent part: &gt;Rotten Tomatoes awards the Certified Fresh accolade to theatrical releases reviewed by 40 or more critics (including 5 Top Critics) with a steady score of 75% or higher on the Tomatometer. **A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%.**
I wanna say the gory ways of dispatching zombies. Slash, club, shoot, curb stomp, beat to death with baseball bats, blow up, incinerate, drop off buildings, electrocute, break necks, explode, throwing knives at them...If there ever is a German version of Dying Light, you'll be like "Well yes, hello there, I'm Herr Kranich, and I think it's good that we are having this discussion. Now how about instead of running around screaming and hurting each other we sit down in a circle and a draw a smiling sun?"I'll admit that getting the "Hush Hush Now - Quiet a Screamer" achievement made even me go "gulp".
hiko said he loved C9 when he played for them, except when they offered them a raise after they were doing less than good to keep them happy. also some things in the player agreement when he wanted to leave the team really upset him. he wont go into specifics though. 
The smallest Meetups are normally about 8ish people and the larger ones have seen around 20 give or take.But there are always good people, it not what you picture a reddit meetup being like. 
I would want someone who views raping children as okay to feel unwelcome. I would want a police officer who feels it's okay to brutally beat people for fun to feel unwelcome.Alienation is a useful tool. We shouldn't shy from it. Without it, we're just stupid hippies.
He came back from his ridiculous cosplayer gimmick when the Mizdow thing got over. He's like Cody Rhodes that way: they can both make ridiculous ideas entertaining.This though? I don't think so. It's incoherent, the theme music is boring, (which is worse than even being bad: at  least Cesaro's siren is memorable) his finishing move is lame, and that ~~Stunt Double~~ shirt makes no sense if he's going to keep doing imitations.A guy on /wooo/ said it would be a neat idea if he was basically Taskmaster, which is what they're trying to do, but they're gonna fumble it if they don't fix some of this.

Found my old Sonic watch from 1995. Unfortunately, the band is a little messed up so I can't wear it. I thought a watchface would be the next best thing!Side note, I hope smartwatches have a 20+ year battery some day.
No, I watched a lot of tape on Cooper, he is the real deal if he put the work in. Great feet, great explosion off the line. A actual team player, does block when necessary. What is not to like, he has the size, strength, and ability to be an all pro in any system. 
&gt; $4K worth of property which is funny considering that rule was made in 1867 and never updated.It doesn't have to be real property, it also includes personal wealth and it is not tied to any province either.Interesting, section 33 places the responsibility of determine eligibility to the Senate with the Senate. That means it is the Senate and not the PMO who should be calling the shots on who is eligible and who is not.
I mean... He earned that joke. But he's a very solid player who is an absolute beast on the PK with Pageau (every Montreal fan can attest to that). He has crazy advanced stats too. We definitely want him resigned. Hell, he even scored on a breakaway these playoffs and it was spectacular. 
"Hmm I see. Well is there anything here I can help you with? Perhaps a tour or something?" *He was trying to find an excuse to stay close to the hooded man. to keep an eye on him*
&gt; stormfront incursionI know this isn't related to the discussion at hand, but I see this accusation a lot, and don't know if it's actually true or just people trying to smear by shouting stormfront. Any idea?
&gt; Someone who isn't vaccinated visits from somewhere other than the U.S.So you're positing this:1. unvaccinated2. from outside the US3. exposed to rubella within the incubation period4. somehow manages to make it through customs while asymptomatic5. and mingle with anti-vaxxers (a very small population in the US)Not only that, but all this occurs and such a significant outbreak occurs that it *re-establishes*.That's just dumb. It's even somewhat of an anti-vaxxer idea itself... it dismisses the idea of herd immunity as incapable of suppressing re-establishment.
My soul may be Purple but my blood runs Redder then the rising sun, redder then the roaring flames that dance across the battlefield, redder then the eyes of a demon in the black and blue, so knowing this will you still take me into battle with you oh Crusader? so that we may battle until the fields run red with our blood? 
men aren't bears. if people stop making statements saying women are *inviting* rape by walking alone at night more and more men are going to realise that rape isn't justified like they think it is, that no woman (or man) is ever asking for it, and that it's fucking not okay.women don't have access to protective equipment. so essentially the only way to keep safe is to what? quit your job? just stay inside all day? what's the practical solution for women here? this is nothing like hiking in the woods without proper supplies. this is trying to go about your daily life in a world where you're not able to buy supplies to defend yourself and where people keep saying you're asking for someone to rape you if you have the gall to live like a normal person
When playing Vault of Glass with my usual crew, everyone HAS to wear chatterwhite, and when we get to the Gorgon's labyrinth, we have to listen to The Pink Panther soundtrack until we're in the clear.
&gt; My take on it is that it is similar to the idea of BMI. It is a simple approximation that can be used reasonably in some areas, but is often abused by those who read too much into itI agree with that. It's not a terribly accurate test when looking at instances... but I think it does measure a broad cultural inclination.&gt; From the use of the test that I've seen, this is an overextension of the test to draw conclusions that require making a lot of assumptions about a very complex system.I'm less interested in how it's misused and more interested in what it says about our culture. (which I think it does have something to say).
Then you've heard a bad exhaust. I can say from experience the H22 at full chat is a proper car noise. Keep a modest muffler on a full exhaust system and all that comes through is cams gears and unicorns.
Yes, some games (e.g. Black Ops 2, using TAC - Treyarch Anti Cheat) did ban you when you cheated, TAC got you and VAC didn't.You didn't get an account ban tho. (you were simply disabled from playing the game)
I actually don't think this is a laughing matter. I asked her about the username because it demonstrates that her self-esteem is very low; possibly because of the emotional abuse of her boyfriend. I was honest about it-should I have tippy toed around it so as to not offend you? I really couldn't care less what you think. As far as I'm concerned, there's good grounds for emotional abuse here in this thread and I pulled together various bits of evidence to prove my point. 
they have to be for the playoffs - can only use 2 jerseysalso I can't really remember the last time we *didn't* use the "alternate" as the aways... so are they really still the alternate at this point?
In middle school, I had a teacher tell me "I'm yelling in your face because you deserve it" as she walked me to the office.  I don't remember what I was in trouble for, but my mother was not happy.
Sigh... the weapons thing, *again*? Is it all at least readily accessible if someone or something attacks?Is everyone really this paranoid?I know how to drive stick shift. I can fight zombies. I can hold a shovel and dig a ditch. I can sit on a wall and look out for things, or paint a pretty landscape. I can sing, and I also have a guitar. The strings aren't the best, but it still sounds pretty good. I am really good at climbing trees and towers. I was into parkour and stuff. I can handle a rifle well enough. I can't swim so well. I can use a knife. I can hunt. I can boil and make basic leather if you've got the chemicals, that was an old hobby of mine, pre-apocalypse, so... yeah I'm really scraping the bottom of the barrel here for skills.Do you have anyone that can pick me up? I'll pay you back with service of...however long that takes, I guess.
If you know my deck, it's easy to break down with a few sideboard cards and conservative play. If you don't know it, it'll probably win. My best chance of putting up a good result in a upcomming MOCS is by taking everyone 100% by surprise.
I will do a search! Considering today there was a post about a guy being turned off by a woman's butthair, I feel like something like physical scarring/sagging will be even worse! But I will feel better to know that most men don't feel that way about their wives postpartum.
I had a dream last night that Tim Duncan retired. For some reason Manu was doing the commentating of the event. This all happened in a pre-game ceremony. Interpret and discuss this as you so choose 
&gt; Do you really want your truck back after its been stolen?No, but I wouldn't want them to take it in the first place. That's the purpose of anti-theft...to help prevent theft. Now something like Lojack I could care less for (who cares after they're gone?) but other devices/measures that deter/stop the casual car thief are worthwhile.
My stack is a mix of silver and gold bullion. Majority of the gold are mixed year sovereigns, my silver is mainly brittanias, maples and Philharmonics with a small qty of crocs, polar bears, Ellie's, Noah's arks and sharks. It would be great to get silver bars but the 20% vat on bars makes it uneconomical compared to silver coins....
Ya just like the rest of music.. its all poetry: from country, jazz, classical, blues, metal, rock, folk, heck even rap. Each genre reflects a certain time and place. I personally don't think hip hop has the depth and individualism one would need to make that leap above all other genres to consider it by itself.  I wouldn't mind seeing a music history class that would embark on why artists chose the path they did be it folk, blues, rock, hip-hop, or even heavy metal they all play a part in our constantly changing culture. 
Op amps are integrated circuits that amplify the analog audio signal.  It is doubtful that replacing op amps in a PC motherboard would result in any noticeable improvement, assuming it even uses replaceable parts.Edit.  I see that this mboard actually has replaceable op amps.  You could try, but I tend to think this is marketing hype.  They should have used a quality part in the first place.  In my experience, you need really good equipment and good sources to notice any difference in op amps.
Just because we have no substantial regulation doesn't mean there hasn't been strenuous actions taken to take them (by take I mean to add restrictions that are really not "smart" or "sensible"). Biden was tasked with gun control for the Obama Administration and failed. A lot of states fell to pressure from the Obama Administration (NY Safe Act, Colorado mag bans, Bloomberg's lobbying, Feinstein's advocation for another AWB, ect...)- 41P - 7N6 Ban (Attempted to ban M855 ammo as well) - Obama's Executive Orders on Firearms Are just a few of the changes - some not directly tied to the president, but it's no surprise the current administration and democratic group is not advocating for a libertarian view on firearms. 
FE8: Lute? I do use her sometimes, but I usually don't want to bother training her up. Her Mag growth is nuclear though; and I have a soft spot for mages on ponies.FE9: Meh, Devdan?

I find that if you can let out your true feelings out about people helps keep you sane, not that you would usually say it to their face. I work in a old folks home, and the shit that comes out of my mouth around coworkers about some of the residents are down right fucked up. Some of the nurses I work with have said much worse. I believe teachers and those who work in health care have some of the darkest sense of humour, but it's what we do to keep ourselves sane.
On Wikipedia, typically the introductory paragraph is the TL;DR of the article as a whole. The article goes over how the impact will depend on how benevolent/malevolent the aliens are, the method of communication, etc.It also goes over how there will be other impacts such as theological, political, legal, technological, and ecological.You should read the whole thing if you're interested. It's not that long.

You would think dunleavy up and punched Giannis straight in the throat from how the people in this thread are describing it. None of you have played competitive contact sports nor do you watch the big boys in paint play all game if you think that throat hit was that unusual. 
The collapse of industry, the shrinking of the port, and white flight have been tough on Baltimore. The last remnant of heavy industry in the city's environs was Sparrows Point steelworks which finally shut in 2012 after being sold to a private equity fund.
Azeem, the essence of electoral politics is choosing the candidate who best meets what you feel is right.  Recognizing that no candidate is likely to meet all your criteria.

There is too much bad blood between them. There is some hope for reconciliation after the coalition bombed 'Khurasan group' (aka JN), when IS supporters sympathised with JN, but that moment has passed and they are now back to calling each other Sahwat (from IS to JN) or Khawarij (from JN to IS)
yes, i think part of the reason that it is so difficult to be open with others about quitting is that people tend to simply roll their eyes if you suggest that porn is harmful. i definitely feel comforted after reading these comments and things that people have written in other threads.
Okay? The picture you linked looks more like the shower room in my high school locker room, and it was build in the 1950's. It's also looks like some YMCA and cheap gyms shower rooms that I've seen. If you're paying $30+ per month for a gym membership, the men's room will probably have shower stalls and probably have curtains or doors on the stalls. 
I use focus and recompose at f1.4-f2 it works perfectly for me, I shoot in a very reportage fashion, so it is fast. I've never noticed quality loss based on diffraction, you really have to pixel peep to see it, Im not really into spec based photography. I know that 5d is technically superior, but I think its not reflected in the quality of images you get out of it, its just a camera after all.
I did it twice. As long as you trust the people surrounding you, and the setting is calm its awesome :)The first trip felt like I've awoken from a dream, and completely forgot about reality. The second wasnt as strong. pretty much "only" visuals, but it felt like it lasted like 12 hours or something.
Omg I was really good friends with this kid when I was in high school. He's a year below me but all of this is completely sarcastic and not meant to be taken seriously at all. He's awesome in real life

I am between life coach and gaara... lifecoach sticks to his bread and butter and really masters a few decks, gaara plays everything, and has 9 deck rotations always switching every few game-  I always have 9 decks built I feel are best for meta/most fun for me to play, and I'd say I've got 2 mastered, and about 5/6 I play well, then 3 I need to work on, or learn to play (for me this is handlock, oil rogue, patron warrior) but this is an interesting question, I think gaaras approach is best, but it is hard to have that much time to play decks to get good at all of them/know their match-ups and how they perform in the meta
Does the sound turn off on the stream for anybody else when it goes to commercial? I'd be cool with it if it turned back on when the commercials were over, but it doesn't.

This game is a non-persistent MMO for the online side of things. People need to man up and accept that. The game will be active until the next one drops not only because of single player mods, but because online has progression and RPG elements.
Really hoping next patch gives him real buffs, as they were saying that there was more planned. He seriously got buffed in none of the reasonable ways I'd been harping about.
Your religion is what your parents called themselves (and you) while you were growing up. There's no other criteria. Every christian has different views, many are contradictory (even within themselves).
"Bob Sapp is a freak of nature. He has beat Ernesto Hoost, four time K-1 grand prix champion, one of the greatest kickboxers of all time, at his own game . . . twice. He has beaten Olympic medalists, in Min Soo Kim. His sheer strength is unmatched in combat sports. In over a decade of experience &amp; nearly 60 fights, he has never gone to decision. Bob Sapp comes to kill or be killed."
I guess my problem with the "discussion" was that it glossed over/didn't even mention a lot of the potential pitfalls of paid modding... How can you have a meaningful discussion while completely ignoring legitimate concerns about paid modding. By only addressing the concerns about paid modding that support one side of the argument, you are left with meaningless half truths. 
Ah, thank you. Then I'm guessing Curvy Kate wouldn't work good for me because I'm narrow and projected as well. Would Elomi or Goddess be similar to Curvy Kate? When you referred to them as wide, did you mean wide wires? Anything with wide wires is uncomfortable on me. If I were to try Panache or Freya, would I potentially have to get a different size? That's what I'm really wondering is if they are consistent with a Cacique 38F or not.
I don't think consensus has to be reached for a dude who constantly quits games to be generally regarded of as a dude that constantly quits games. At a certain point, public opinion becomes an objective, observable trend.
In my opinion, the BEST position is the one which allows you to write comfortably for whatever amount of time you need to write.  Adjusting your hand, wrist, arm, etc. to some position you're uncomfortable using is the wrong way to write.To hell with "convention" or aesthetics - be a slave only to your own needs.

I'll be honest, having had to teach 13/14 year old girls is the one of the most difficult things ever and you have to have patience and clear discipline to not go crazy.That said, maybe it's the hormone enhanced beef or milk or something, but I'd swear some of them look much older.
I love how people come up with these things. That's one of the awesome parts of having a mathematical mind: you think of unusual things like this, and it's absolutely brilliant. And, they had a good reason to eat lots of chicken nuggets! Maybe we can apply some physics to McDonald's... :)
Before other free thinking middle of the road people get swept onto the Reddit Wave of Derp I think we should pause for a second and recall the "eye witnesses" from the Mike Brown shooting.
This is completely off topic but I am interested to know how you two (you and your gf) became romantically involved.Is it something similar to Orange is the New Black trans girl? (Basically he(she) tells his wife he identifies as female and the wife supports him(her) more or less)Are you attracted to men and women?Genuinely currious. Hope I don't offend.
No. It isn't. Jesus Christ you people just do not fucking get it. Once companies in an industry get an idea they **will not stop trying iterations of it** until it works for them. Its not over until valve gets it's mod integration. What happened to "forgive but never forget". Don't let them forget.
No, this is what I actually think, being a Cantonese-speaking person, the CCP is a threat to my "ethnic" group and my heritage. Imperial Britain is not.I would like to see a reference where the British killed hundreds of thousands during their occupation of HK. Still, that's lower than the death count of the CCP and the Japanese army.The CCP is a huge BS factory that leans on the "150-year humiliation" to distract from actual problems they are responsible for.I guess you like the PRC for "standing up" against white people?
Ya I believe all girls have some sort of flashback explaining why they are there and increasing their backstory so you feel like you know them more, but I'm pretty sure Amane's is by far the longest taking up most of her route.
Without ads then people could rely on a donation model which is the less intrusive and more ethical means of acquiring money from people who use websites. If every person like you that sits around espousing the virtue of giving developers money for their hard-work actually sent them some cash then they would probably earn quite a bit more. But I bet you aren't doing that, are you? LOL.
JonTron is about the only YouTuber I really follow nowadays.As for podcasts, I'm really into [SleepyCast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5i73-Udg4665ybe6BxlzYA). It's the first and only podcast I've gotten into. Keep meaning to find more and yet I keep forgetting.

Thanks! The whole "garbage bag thing" was some hair-brained scheme I concocted when I made the decision that the shingle scraps I had laying around were garbage. I included that pic to remind everyone (including myself): To 'un-fuck' your project while you still can. 
Some more SGA, the increased revive speed is enough to allow you to sprint through your team mate's ghost and revive them without stopping. It seems like so very few people notice and it really can make all the difference.
I put my headphones into the audio jack of the stereo and it sounds fine there. I guess I'll just have to live with it as long as the CDJs aren't causing the problem.
Yeah, I would have stabbed him back with a quickness. Not hard enough to draw blood, but enough to get the point across. That's how I was raised...Then, you know, if the dad acts like a typical breeder about it, just claim, "Oh, I thought we were playing..."
Have you ever watched a draft before? This year is flying compared to normal years. Teams normally take the entire 10 minutes, then the 3-4 minutes delay in between each. This is fantastic. 
No, the pens unused so you cannot even see the plunger. I had a sample of that specific type, its 30% intermediate acting &amp; 70% fast acting. Its real cloudy and not clear like normal long &amp; short acting insulin's.
Yeah it is Ive built plenty of things but once I did the rifle I just wanna build more! And do cool things to them lol. It sucks being a broke highschool student 😂
And since the True Patronus can resurrect, AK fueled by the power of indifference is now a really useful unblockable, unstoppable one-hit-knockout that works on anything with a brain (unless I'm missing something). Just AK, stun, then resurrect. Because does it really matter whether this enemy combatant retains use of their computational substrate / meatpuppet in the next couple of decaseconds, given that you're about to stun them regardless?

IPL would really probably help you out tremendously, especially for blotchiness and sun spots. I quickly looked up what it *wasn't* for, and it's not intended for [wrinkles or loose skin](http://www.drhasen.com/non-surgical/ipl.cfm). You seem to be good on that front.I'm on RealSelf a lot (I'm obsessed with learning about aesthetic procedures) and so I searched for IPL really quickly. One woman left a [review](http://www.realself.com/review/lihue-ipl-works-board-certified-plastic-surgeon) that says, "I want to write this review to show what can happen when IPL is done right. I had my first IPL treatment in September 2013 with Dr. Bao Phan. After reading horror stories and the pictures that went with them, I avoided going anywhere where the laser wasn't operated by an MD."Bottom line: see a certified professional if you do decide to do it.
About where your beliefs come from. They come from the things you are emotionally invested in, that's pretty fucking obvious. I merely suggest you become involved in something constructive instead of meekly bickering hoping it changes something. Do you not realize that this level of communication is itself violent and destructive, and hence nothing of value can come of it? We can only argue, my point of view is seen as an invasive species and you instinctively destroy it, as if it were infecting your mind. Or You find other people to side with you and it becomes a common effort to destroy the mirrors that remind you of your ugliness.

IMHO I don't think it should be more than 1 or 2 just because of the recent precedent set by the Celtics game.They suspended Kelly for intentionally pulling K Love and injuring him and they had to have deemed it intentional for a suspension so I don't think this is 4 to 5 times worse than that.Especially since it followed a non called cheap shot and he isn't a repeat offender.I definitely think he should be suspended and needs to learn his lesson but 3-5 seems quite harsh.

A bit of feedback on your project: I like the idea. I checked out the tumblr and it's nice to see the writeups, I'd suggest copying them into a reddit comment on each post so folks from here can still get the information. More importantly, I'd like to see them fleshed out a little bit. The detail is nice but you don't really address what the soundtracks *sound* like, and I know I'm more likely to click on a long video if you sell me on it first.Good work, though. I'll be keeping an eye on this.
We can't make them end it, every time they'd push, we'd win a fight. Problem was that we couldn't push into their base because the techies had everything mined. We really needed a bkb on our carries for that but they didn't see the value in one.

For some reason while glancing over this I read that as "suicide note he left for his wife."Like, he ate these plums and felt so guilty about it that he wrote this poem as an apology, stuck it on the refrigerator with a magnet and then offed himself.

Scientology followers are batshit insane. They stalk and harass you for life, and try to set up ways for you to get injured by proxy, like cutting breaks or pouring water on your sidewalk if it's freezing temperature. 
During my current and last semester of high school, my English teacher when asking my friend from Nigeria to turn off the light jokingly says " I asked you cause you're black, and you know slavery and stuff." There was a solid few minutes of silence due to the shock of what our teacher had just  said, followed by the entire classroom echoing with awkward laughter.

No it doesnt reset but say you log in at 5:32pm, it might register as 2:32pm, then the next day you can collect it starting at 2:32pm. That *might* to be the case.
I felt that there where so many WR in this draft, but only one all-around best athlete... Cooper will be a reliable, consistent performer. ...but Williams would have been a beast.
I get that the friend was trying to help, and I'll admit that "enraged" was a strong word on my behalf, but yes, the friend calling it a personal space issue would have led to an annoyed eyebrow raise on my behalf.I'm sorry that you see this as a caveman/cavewoman thing, and I'm afraid that I still can't quite wrap my head around that. I don't advocate starting fights with strangers, but I do advocate dealing with situations like these in a way that doesn't leave room for interpretation that might lead a person like that to feel welcome to stick around and hang out at that table.  I agree with you that OP is a very smart person, and as I said before, I think she stood up for herself and handled this very, very well. 
Wtf since when do people here think Williams is 10x better than Cooper. Both will be stars at the next level, one just plays for offense and one plays for defense 
My mothers side came here in the late 1800's and settled in Surrey Centre. Built the first church, and a large amount of ALR belonged to them up until recently. Still have roads named after my relatives, which is pretty cool.Dad's side came from Norway a long time ago, settled in the interior, and eventually made their way to the coast, to fish.
The thing that bothers me about it is the message "Your free trail is over" when there was nothing in the original Textra app about it being a free trail. 
Because real women don't want to be topless because their "gender identity" tells them so right? It couldn't be because women's bodies are regarded as inherently sexual by society and thus a topless woman is either considered an obscene taboo or considered as being sexually provocative. 
Aww that's sweet. I'm not sure I want kid blocks on my wall. But I do have plans to include a bit of 'history of a daisy' on the piece. I considered a beer named 'olive theory' 
I hate how they act that Rollins stole the win from Reigns at Mania like Reigns was about to win kayfabe. No, Reigns just took like his 4th or 5th F5. He stole the title from Lesnar. Little stuff like this bothers me. 
It is speculation,  but I also used to work with abused kids and teenagers. So it's definitely my opinion, but I've also seen this acting out behavior dozens of times. 
This is my stance. I'm not upset that all my favorites are getting voted out; I'm upset that the show now consists of people who range from mildly annoying to full-out awful. With each passing week, the ratio of people I like and am interested in to people I don't decreases, and each passing week is progressively less fun to watch. That's all it is.
Similar request:I'm on a lowly 8GB phone. Sync, by far, uses the largest cache of all my apps. But, I don't really use the sync functionality. So, I just manually clear the cache every week, but if it could be disabled, that would be neat. And, yes, I get the irony of disabling sync, lol. 
That's significantly different from what you got. And if this is some sort of official promotion, you deserve the prize. I'd definitely contact official channels about it.
it kinda feels like they actually DEcreased the drop rate.. yesterday i actually saw some portals linked in map chat after VW (like one every other VW), but today, nothing... (about the same amount of VWs played)... But maybe people just stopped linking them because they dont want to get death threads in whisper chat or so... :D :D
So which quarterback are Browns going to pick at either one of their picks? From what I heard Manziel absolutely tanked last year (Hopefully he works on all his personal problems and starts to feel better). And who should the 49ers pick in the first round? We lost some good players this year. 
Lucario is my favorite I love pokemon and I just had to have him!. Me and my boyfriend drove an hour and a half from connecticut to massachusetts to a toys r us that happened to have one left and put our name on it for us!
I really love the cock itself, especially the head. It's so soft, and I really love swirling my tongue around it when I suck my FWBs cock. My favorite thing about cocks is definitely watching them grow and become hard when I play with them. Mmm... delicious.

Considering how big they are, the return on rebuilding CVS might be worth the liability. Whatever they do, it's almost assured that all the family businesses that provided niche services (small grocers, hair salons, dry cleaning, restaurants) will pull out because they can't afford to take the risk, draining the community of jobs and services that might never fully return.
I seriously have no idea why everyone is giving this game a pass. It's become over glorified pinball. Put quarter in, get another ball and slightly different variables of gameplay. Same with destiny except its one huge shiny quarter.
A male model's life is a precious, precious commodity. Just because we have chiseled abs and stunning features, it doesn't mean that we too can't not die in a freak gasoline fight accident.
Looking for recommendations for a preamp around $150 to go with my AT LP120 (if you think i need one). Here is my list of gear im going to buy so far MB42X,  SMSL AS-50, Schiit sys and Modi2.
As well as the shape of the plane, the entire body of the f15 is designed to generate lift, allowing for a huge body and smaller wings, hence why an Israeli one flew without a wing and landed. Something like the Typhoon however, which has a very small body and large delta wings would most probably fall out of the sky like a brick.
All constant functions f(x) = k have the same output k by definition. Periodic functions, also by definition, have the same outputs over different input intervals (one interval is called a period, hence the name). If you've taken trig you know the functions sine and cosine; both have period 2*pi. Were you looking for something more in-depth?
He probably doesn't have a degree at all, he just climbed to the top using a ladder, a lever. He doesnt know how to do anything, unlike the leader who struggles to the top, along with his comrades
It's almost Friday but meh !21/F/Montreal, QC, CanadaLooking for female friends to hang out with ! I want to do... Friends stuff. Watching movies, going out to eat, taking walks, shopping, playing pool... Heck, I'm down for anything ! 
Honestly thats what all of this made me think of, but if they did that I feel like whichever professions get a new specialization last will be complaining that they are being ignored, similar to how junglers will complain if a jungle champ hasn't been released in a long time for example.
Did someone mention sloths? Here's a random fact!Healthy sloths generally live from 10 to 16 years in the wild. In captivity they can live to be over 30!
I know, I spend a lot of time in my office. Nothing personal, I just- I'm used to being alone, I guess. I forget that there's other people in the castle.
You don't prepare for it, really.  I had no prior experience whatsoever, while half of my classmates are made up of former dental assistants or hygienists.  I'm probably in the top 25% of clinical skills/tests so far, when I have no artistic ability that I know of otherwise.  Everyone is all over the map skill-wise.  Everyone gets it eventually.  School is practically 40 hours a week in the classroom and 20-30 hours of outside study, so you live and breath dentistry/medicine.  I love it.
I was there when it was P2P, when IMC said said GE would revolutionize mmos with multiple character control.I was there when pre-2010 gamer blogs say it was a alternate choice than FF11 due to MCC and character design and sound track.I was there when it became F2P which included a lot of paywalls.I was there when they reduced the paywalls and replaced with P2W items.I was there when they placed lyndon boxes for exclusive premium characters.All these features were in all GE servers, if you've been following GE blog regarding the latest contents. The only GE server that I have no say is the private server.I loved the ideas of Hakkyu kim the father of RO/GE/ToS and the designs of Maggi, ToS art director and GE character designer, however its just wishful thinking that IMC would not make a P2W game based on over the years of following GE.
I'd agree with you if the area was stable and could take such an event in its stride. Alas, the Middle East is an absolute clusterfuck, if SA fell, something worse would appear and take its place. I imagine ISIS-esque extremists. Either that, or civil-war. At this point, a falling SA is nothing but bad news. They are cunts, but the region is better off with them there for the moment. 
Serious question - If you need to park next to a bike lane, how do you go about it on a busy street such as SE Hawthorne or N Williams?Pulling along side a vehicle and then parallel parking seems next to impossible during rush hour.
After reading the article, it didn't seem to me he was being a snarky Hollywood bunghole, unlike what the title seemed to suggest. Oh, media. You got me again with your adorable clickbait ways.Seriously though, RDJ is on point, and I don't think he'll catch a lot of flak because of his remarks here.  Soderbergh still makes indies (or indie style) films, but they are well made and thematically coherent, so I guess he wasn't spitting on indie filmmakers per se, just the unprofessionally inclined and unnecessarily messy productions, imo. 
Nooo! My timestamp was wrong![It's this one, sorry!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnyb1IOGDuM#)What the. This is all over the place...Oh well. Suits the album - Cheers!
Maybe something related to his lore, like:&gt; "The same dark magic that shattered the Graven King's invasion of the Satrapy into a million shards of possibilities obscures the fate of Nerif and his allies in battle."Obscure fate as in some spells work against them and some don't, and they may live or die by the end.
i would switch wingbacks to complete wingbacks and add look for overlap, have them run wide with ball and get further forward.  attacking mentality is why your conceding so many goals your players stand upfield from opposition players it's really dumb i would switch to control.  but opposition instructions play a part here if you wanna play it like the pros man mark strikers and close down wide players or you can say fk it like i did and close everyone down, tackle hard, man mark strikers and set hassle opponents and close down more on team instructions.short passing and high tempo you wanna move the ball around a lot?  but the game doesn't super duper work like that you need to have the plays one-twos ppm so train your dudes on that.treqs never really worked for me i would switch the ap to something else maybe have him as the dlp-d switch the dlp to a anchorman or hb and switch the treq to an ap and your strikers can play whatever your strikers are best at.
Whenever I tell people my favorite superhero is Superman, I usually get scoffed at. They usually tell me he is unrelatable, and prefer Batman because he is human and they can relate better. I always respond that I can relate better to Superman/Clark. I grew up in a small rural community. I can relate better to someone who grew up in that similar environment and is trying to find his way in the world. Obviously, I don't have Superman's powers but I can relate to feeling like an outsider and striving to make the world a better place with what power I do have.I have more difficulty relating to the loss that Batman feels. My parents are not deceased, and I don't feel that loss or the need for vengeance. Don't get me wrong I like Batman stories too, but I feel sorry for him. He seems lonely and is mistrustful many times. That is not a person I want to be, and hope most don't.
I agree, these people know **much** more than we do about this case, the IP especially. The Innocence Project has access to absolutely everything about the case, and if they seem to think he's innocent it should be enough to at least instill a shred of doubt in your mind.Unless, of course, you're one to believe that this is all a massive conspiracy to get a murderer out of prison.I don't know where I sit, it is a lot easier to say Adnan is guilty than to say he's innocent. I just don't know, and I don't think I'll ever settle on an answer by myself.
I would probably end up bringing a laptop with some games on it, getting a written approval to install 22 printers means 22 documents would be needing approval, which might take a while.
These kids left Birmingham three days ago. We think they're staying in Atlanta with the girl's birth father, who's a fugitive. If you see these kids please call the police. Their names are Johnathan Ketcham and Hannah Gibson. 
Seeing as the L7 used HE, HESH, APCR and HEAT, when they are implemented, they should get GREAT ammo as the stock round. I swear to god if Gaijooby decides to fuck up the L7s, I'm permanently done with WT.
Inb4 golden chromas for mastery... coughsmitecough, lol...Would be amazing though, walking around as a zhonya'd champion and then BAM, you use a real zhonya's. 
No problem! Definitely try to relax... Look on the bright side (of right now, not down the line, because that is the brightest side...babies!), the BD is a lot easier of a job than some of the other things we do on a daily basis! :)
Why do people always make jokes about the Lone Wanderer drinking from the toilets? They're almost always paired with a sink, and in 3 you literally get four times as much radiation drinking from the former as opposed to the latter.
I'm married with small kids so I'm boring. Not much to offer on the "things to do" list, but I know there is quite a lot.  Great food, and everyone here is great. Check out Pacific Ave downtown.  There's a pretty sweet bookstore there too. What I can say is, Welcome!
Ahhhhh, they're probably my top. I jump around from quite a few alternating my most played, but Billy Talent is normally up there. Against Me, Rise Against, Blink-182, Sum-41 are the others, I do listen to loads, but the above are the most common and likely to not be a phase. 
I don't know if/how you will be killed doing this, but can you enlighten me as to how you made this map?  I want to make similar maps but it seems that google maps is beyond my technical know-how.
You're the third person to misread "political" as "police", although I agree about there being problems there...Speaking of "there", I don't know where "here" is to you - I'm in the UK and various people are elsewhere in the world. Probably very few reading this are on Mars though. 
And you don't have to count their deck every game. Just throw it in like once every 3 matches. If everyone did that the cheat would not be worth  running. 
This is eerily similar to the wolves-Kevin love situation. Player gets drafted by incompetent front office. New one comes in but might be few years too late. I could see Demarcus getting traded for sure this summer. 
I just played through Director's Cut and had zero issues whatsoever, aside from an achievement that may or may not have failed to pop.  It was one where you have to use no firearms, explosives, or praxis points for a very long sequence, so I may have failed it and not noticed.

&gt;. . . the Jews didn't have the law written on their hearts. Looking at the wording of the Greek in the Septuagint, it seems to match up with Proverbs 6:20-23,&gt;My son, keep your father’s commandment,and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.&gt;Bind them continually on your heart.Tie them around your neck.&gt;When you walk, it will lead you.When you sleep, it will watch over you.When you awake, it will talk with you.&gt;For the commandment is a lamp,and the law is light. . .
Some shifter fantasy like the Raksura series by Martha Wells Or a animal bond series like Pern/A Companion to Wolves.A culture different than any found on earth (no nuclear families) think Raksura or Rowena Cory Daniells Outcast Chronicles. Finally, gay protagonist book i havent read. ive read most of the well known series.
Remember when the Seahawks' coach Pete Carroll hinted at a first round surprise? Well, it's just history notes for each pick in the NFL draft. Don't expect any trades involving Seattle.EDIT:Why are you downvoting me for telling you guys news about what's happening?EDIT:Sorry about the flair, jerks
I should win because I used to play wii fit and seeing her make me feel all nostalgic and I would give the Ike away to my friend as a surprise gift because I already have one.
Really though? Carr had no weapons last year and the Raiders were the worst offense in the league. If they'd taken Fowler they'd have improved their D sure - but at what cost to Carr's development?I think really, there was no way they "lose" on this pick whether they'd taken Cooper or Williams. Williams gives them youth to pair with Mack, Cooper gives them youth to pair with Carr.
Don't feed your cat when you get out of bed - she's associating you getting up with getting what she wants (the food). I taught my cats when they were kittens that me getting up in the morning will not get them food faster. Instead, I shower or get ready for work first and then feed them before I leave the house. One of my cats tried that meowing shit on my boyfriend and I since we shut our door and not let them in at night. She learned fast after not getting what she was demanding though :)
And on top of that the players go into the hall with no team affiliations. It's not going to be Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, it'll be Brett Favre, quarter back played for the Falcons Packers Jets and Vikings. 
I enjoy the new American Td's and new maps, they bring a whole new field of opportunities to tank game play and the new tanks for all nations allow for some diverse battles
I got a gram of his honey oil a few days ago. I was going to dab last night, open my fridge, its gone. Nowhere to be found, I looked for 7h and dug through the garbage. Rip cheap sample gram T_T Hes a good vendor, stealth and shipping speed.
The Oakland Raiders are slowly becoming one of the smartest drafting teams. I can't believe how right they are here. Williams is better overall player but giving Carr a player like Cooper just makes too much sense. Great pick. (Now let Williams keep sliding to #9!!!)
Oh, certainly.  And it's not the first time I've heard that particular objection, plus you summed it up well.  I just disagree with the objection itself, of course.
I've never understood why people are so adamant that Ghostery is spyware.  Their search rank is optional, so is the/your issue because of the conflict of interest or because it's closed-source?Edit: actually, is Ghostery closed-source? I mean, I know it's not open-source, but is the code readable yet proprietary, akin to TrueCrypt's license?
I have to disagree on that one, I don't think most people are hearing it that way. The "invitation" comment, yeah, that's in terrible taste and is totally ridiculous. But on this point I think you're off-base.
If I'm not mistaken, this appears to be in AU. I'm not sure if there laws are similar to those of the US, but if they are, then bicycles are considered vehicles, and drivers of motorized vehicles (i.e. cars &amp; trucks) are legally required to share the road with them. According to this video, the small space between the curb of the side walk, and the white lane on the street is a designated space for bycicles. If as most other countries, if they normally drive on the left hand side of the street as opposed to the right side, that would explain why she was on the vehicles left side and not the right.
While that's a commendable sentiment, the reality is that hoarders are usually very set in their ways, and the time and resources it would take to even have a chance at turning their life around would be more than most people have to spare.
I have dreamed this for probably 30 years plus now. There is a thrift shop located in a specific place about a twenty minute drive from where I am now, but around the corner from a place I lived in briefly as a kid. There was never a thrift store there, but in my dream world it's a permanent establishment. And it's always about ten minutes to closing time and I'm searching for vintage dresses. I sometimes find dresses my mom used to wear, but they are too small for me.
Why do I find this so sad? It's an inanimate object, yet the thought of it out there, doing its job, serving humans, makes it seem like a greater loss.I once saw a cartoon of Curiosity (?) wanting to come home and I teared up!With thoughts like this, maybe I don't belong on a science subreddit!
Some people don't want to aim for accuracy nowadays. Honestly if this was a movie about Innuits in the 1600's Tundra there would have to be an Aborginal man in there. 
Did I say 'on live servers I am surrounded by avenger2142 that only gets kills because he crutches on the HA'? No. Stop being so sensitive. I'm talking about the bulk of HA you run into. 
I can't say I agree with the pick, but it's definitely the second one I would have made. I think we'll be able to look back on this and smile though at some point, although you have to feel terrible for Williams. 
&gt;"Al evento asistieron un estimado de 150 personas, en su mayoría estudiantes universitarios, les hablaron por 45 minutos, les ofrecieron visas, le ofrecieron todo un paquete de beneficios en las universidades de los EE.UU., a cambio de registrarse en un link de la página web de la embajada", resaltó Cabello.kek, como si fuera tan fácil...
OK, I think we can all agree that there's all kinds of sick and twisted out there; I don't think there's any advantage to be gained in arguing over which is worse than the other.
Yeah, I figured you didn't mean it in the way it came across to me :)  the words just jolted me a bit!  But the thoughts behind them, I can certainly agree with.
It is something I've noticed, the Danish aren't the only ones on that boat though. Anything that comes out of Denmark is by default superior and cannot be criticized on /r/europe. Obviously I do not interact with the Danes on a regular basis in real life, so I tried to refrain judging the entire country but seeing how you're confirming this, I guess it's just sad....
Sorry, I should have said that all major scholars. (This is one of those quirks of the language where someone who has an associates degree level of understanding of the deen and someone who has a PhD are both considered "scholars" on the same level)The [Amman Declaration](http://www.ammanmessage.com) held that all Sunni and Shia who follow their madhab correctly are Muslim.
Yeah I had two interviews. The first one was with a manager over the phone lasting approx 45min. The second was a video interview (I had to download some sort of software the firm uses - scopia? Or something) with the same manager and a partner also around 45min. I received a verbal offer a couple weeks later over the phone from HR. 
and then you'd use MSPaint, and fill in the bottom part of the screen... and then erase out the rooms and corridors of your evil lair.and then they made evil genius. :D
As mentioned, that would be the Total Extreme Wrestling series.TEW 2010 is on Steam and has been as low as $10 recently. TEW 2013 is on the dev's site for $35.2010 is a bit more user-friendly in terms of accessibility of information, but it has a game-crippling flaw which causes long-term game worlds to break down (of course if you get in that far, you've already got your money's worth). 2013 is less friendly, but fixes that flaw.They're more fantasy bookers than management games. To get the most out of them you really have to work within the game's odd logic and use a lot of imagination. Great for diary writers, not so good for players looking for a strategic sports management game.The same dev's MMA series is better, IMO. I like wrestling much more than MMA, but prefer his MMA games.
http://www.reddit.com/r/LordsOfMinecraft/comments/2l71rb/roleplay_tipsadvice/this is something i wrote quite awhile agofeel free to use things from that for help :) ( i still need to transfer this into a book on lom)
I actually agree with you. I don't think whatsoever that there is active radicalization within these communities. I do think however that the lone wolves that emerge from such communities are much more likely to embrace Daesh than the lone wolves of other ethnoreligious groups. 
&gt;What tax work did they screw up?4 weeks and counting to produce a tax slip for a taxable transaction (RRSP contribution of stock) with endless back and forth with support to no resolution. &gt;fees2 weeks of service in 2013 and was charged &gt;$150 in fees on Dec 24 of 2014 with an outright refusal to consider a rebate for the 2013 fees (saying it was an 'executive decision'). They charge annual fees for US accounts and RRSP accounts. 'low cost' they are not.The amount of infuriating bullshit i've endured over the last 6 months with this company is outrageous.
You guys have Derek Carr, an up and coming qb, he needs a playmaker to throw to. Amari Cooper will be legit. Did you watch any college football this year?
It really depends on where you go.  My hometown had two hobby shops and the atmosphere couldn't have been more different in them.  There was a dark and musty one that attracted all of the basement-dwellers and then a more well lit one that had a more "normal" crowd.  Still plenty of social awkward people, it's a shop for geeks after all, but a much more inviting atmosphere all the same.
They are specifically made for that fat 70s rock sound drummers got from their toms. I have them on my kit and they sound amazing, especially if you tune them up nice and high and you get a nice 60s jazz tone to your kit 
As someone who is not a pretentious fuck when it comes to that type of thing, I can safely assure you that the vast majority of people who say "chemicals" are fully aware that everything is chemicals. They say chemicals because "harmful chemicals" gets redundant after a few times' saying it, and "carcinogens" is not always accurate.

More like wanker malfunction.    I'm by no means skinny myself (not suggesting you are fat, but others in the thread have suggested it), but do you wear them correctly? Chamois undies aren't meant to be worn like loose fit boxers. Get 'em all up in there! :D
I suddenly feel really old for a couple of reasons. * My nephew is 5 already, where the fuck did the time fly?!?!* It's been 21 years since Senna and Ratzenberger died. I can still remember watching that race on TV. 
Yeah, I'm 5'-7". As a young man, I always thought it looked kind of comical attached to my (then) 145 pound body. I wish I would have taken a chance and tried porn. I could have Eiffel towered Victoria Paris, with Tom Byron (80's porn stars)! ;)
Nope, it's not you. Even my fiancee, who was only paying a little attention, commented on it. I always watch the NXT enhancement talent carefully because you never know who will show up. Blue Pants and Murphy both started as jobbers. This girl was a little disappointing.
Your outfit in the second one looks nice but I think it would look better with tighter pants? Idk maybe it's just me but a loose top and loose jeans seem to clash.
Are you american or Indian? Just curious. Rules don't change, and they don't particularly matter that much. The basic principle is that death is not a cause for mourning but rather celebration.
Because most (not all) cancers take a long time to develop and kill you, whereas most people in the Fallout universe are killed by other means... Like me.
What critics are saying:-&gt;"I approve of this! :)" - /u/egolds01 8/10 with rice. Thank you for your suggestion.In all seriousness, thank you. I was tired of playing with randoms and hope this becomes a decent outlet to escape the entirety of the Xbox community.
The only 2 games I have played the past month are League Of Legends and OSU.I would've played some Hyperdimension Neptunia but my buddy who gave me the game wants me to stream it so he can watch.... but he's not even there most of the week.
This isn't my area of law but it seems like a decent case. Can you link the statute? I will be able to research some case law for you to use more easily.
Oh my goodness, I am married to an ENTJ and he struggles constantly with this. He will sand a piece of carpentry work until it is almost ruined. It took him 2 months to perfect his business logo/business cards. I don't think this person is feeling sorry for themselves. They are obviously an ENTJ just like my husband and the drive is a part of who they are. It is a real struggle to enjoy what the rest of us see are successes but all ENTJ's can think about are how to make it better. 
I think sanctioned killing is bad. War is death. War is evil, killing is killing no matter if its under a flag or in a back alley.Many conspiracy guys like Alex Jones (people you'd call right wing or extreme conservative) in contrast praise the militaryObama doesn't act alone, he doesn't write laws, he hardly reads them. It's a group of people, in this case an oligarchy that exercises much of the power of government. Occasionally the people get a say.......I hope it's just an exercise, or that its a preparation for intel of an ISIS invasion to defend our nation better.If I believe 90% its just an exercise an 10% something nefarious, I'm still going to talk about it. The point is to talk about it and share information, to debate like you're doing here, thank you.
The set's odds do not change. They are still 51/52. The only two possibilities are that you picked the right card, or that the card is somewhere in the other set. If you did not pick the correct card the first time (and we know what the odds of that happening are), it will, with absolute certainty, be the other remaining card. Therefore, the odds of the other card being the right one are still the 51/52 from the first choice.
Yep, I just traded in my 360 S for the deal and got a $50 gift card on top, once I purchased it.  Also used my $5 credit and if you buy an xbox one, you can get xbox live 12 months for $40.
Excellent! If you have time and like the book (or even if you don't like the book) could you leave a review on Amazon for it? Either way, thanks and good luck!
[](/twiponder) Well, I would not say that it is fine in the first one. Yes, it is supposed to sound embarrassing, but not painful for the audience, and I think it is. But then again, maybe it is just me. I think the second one is alright. Decent. But I can not hear the first one without feeling uncomfortable.
I wouldn't stress too much over it.  People will only judge you based on your score everywhere you go, and you will judge your self-worth based on that.

For me there really is no one thing that makes an Anime good. I had fantastic times with fascinating, story driven shows just as much as with "mindless" fanservice comedys. Considering that, it's probably easier to say what I dislike:1. Painfully forseable plots2. Characters acting completly braindead when it's not their specific character trait3. Bad sound design... and to be honest, even those things by themselves don't necessarily ruin an Anime for me.
Actually, I haven't been paying extra from them. It was a free upgrade from 100/10. I also have no data caps, never had one in my life. CC on the other hand, I know they do much more shady things to their customers.
Checking in with your local trans* communities is generally fairly helpful, the some of the more organized ones do tend to to keep track of what doctors/psychs people are using and who is helpful and what not.
Close, I cook specific pasta because it seams to make my favorite sauces taste better. Vodka cream sauce tastes so much better on filled pasta then spaghetti.
I just released an app on app store and now workin on an android version. There are couple of bugs here and there. But nothing game breaking. Plus the community for ionic is pretty helpful too. I really like the framework for its simplicity and ease of integration
&gt;Or maybe just take it upon yourself to be a more thorough reader when this subject comes up. It seems important to you to have "actually seen it happen"Oh trust me I do read a lot of this kind of material when it comes up. &gt;Luckily those comments tend be frequent when discussing topics like this, so it shouldn't take you that long.Well see, that's the point I'm challenging here. I don't actually think that comments like this are common at all, so I think that it would in fact take me a very long time to find one. But if you think it would only take a short amount of time, please feel free to find one and prove me wrong. If they are really as common as you say it shouldn't be that much of a burden, right?

A friend of mine takes his out when we play in open games at Splatterpark. He refuses to even shoulder it and shoots from the hip John Rambo style. It definitely turns heads when he's charging like a mad man, one arming it as if it were an M60 in an '80s action film.
tbh I doubt he looks at it much. When you have that many subreddits, your inbox and modmail are going to be orange all the time. He probably just marks all read out of habit and moves on.

Wonder if it has anything to do with that Sable brush ban in the US last year. Perhaps they have finally run out of stock in the US and therefore need to make new ones. I dunno if it's still illegal to import sable into the US.
You just have to calm down buddy. Get some water, deep breaths and don't keep thinking about it. Occupy yourself. You will be fine, no worries frient! 
Imagine that you're an intelligent and successful Mexican American business owner. You're conservative, you don't like taxes, you want to be free of government regulations. Cruz is Cuban American. They see themselves at the top of the Hispanic hierarchy. They think that Mexicans are just above Puerto Ricans at the bottom. Cruz, the religious right's "messiah", comes before you and lies, blatant unfathomable easily disproven lies. I'd be just a bit offended.

You need a cohesive group of smart people.  Mainly because they have seen it and written about it and studied it.  They minimize risk and don't work people to death.The typical middle manager person that ascended into software...just because...doesn't really care about the software process, they just want stuff done so they don't get yelled at by the CEO.Academics just have a way about them that I appreciate.  They typically think out the process in rational ways as opposed to just getting stuff done.

Housing costs in Adelaide are lower than Perth. Not sure about Gold Coast but possibly lower than there too. It also depends on where you live in the US when comparing costs of living etc. but generally speaking food is more expensive here.

I don't really have an opinion on it other than it is a temporary solution and the larger problem is a societal one. It is my firm belief that people should always be treated as innocent until proven guilty. This includes the false assumption that all men are sexual deviants and that trans people should be treated unfairly because there might be someone lying about being trans. Similar laws based in the US and here is the result: http://mediamatters.org/research/2014/03/20/15-experts-debunk-right-wing-transgender-bathro/198533TLDR: There is no increase in bathroom related crimes and there is no known cases where someone used the bathroom claiming to be trans to commit a crime. This is probably the same for change rooms.
Congrats! Going to school is a pretty great experience. I left when I was 17 and started at my local CC 3 months later. Really got me out of my what do I do now funk and learned social skills.
If you wouldn't do it yourself is more to accentuate 'if you wouldn't do this why are you trying to force me to?'. It's even more inconsiderate and awful than begging someone to do something you yourself would do. 
[](/ajbook) The Polish dub has "znaczki", which means just "marks". That term is also accepted by anyone in the fandom while discussing cutie marks, whether they prefer the dubbed version or not. [](/sp)[](/ajugh-r) However, the CMCs call themselves "Znaczkowa liga", which, as you might guess, means "League of Marks". I'd call that a teensy weensy bit less cringy than the German version. Still bad though.
Gah!  They got me, the bastards!  Noob mistake.  First try at sending btc to a market.  I'd even seen this weeks ago and forgot.  I even had the correct url SAVED in a text file and forgot!  Because duh.  Did a duckduckgo search and trusted it.  DNM sidebar from now on!

This is pretty clear:The Amount and Substantiality of the Portion TakenThe less you take, the more likely that your copying will be excused as a fair use. However, even if you take a small portion of a work, your copying will not be a fair use if the portion taken is the “heart” of the work. In other words, you are more likely to run into problems if you take the most memorable aspect of a work. For example, it would probably not be a fair use to copy the opening guitar riff and the words “I can’t get no satisfaction” from the song “Satisfaction.”This rule — less is more — is not necessarily true in parody cases. **A parodist is permitted to borrow quite a bit, even the heart of the original work, in order to conjure up the original work.** That’s because, as the Supreme Court has acknowledged, “the heart is also what most readily conjures up the [original] for parody, and it is the heart at which parody takes aim.” (Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510 U.S. 569 (1994).)

This used to be easy pre- Art of War, you can just blob and get lots of papal influence. But now its too random and frankly it doesn't make much sense. Obviously if I had Rome under my control and every other Catholic nation is so much weaker, I should have the say on who becomes the next pope.
I went to Chile on my mission. My heart hurts so bad right now for these sisters. :( I was very dumb when I was down there--going to dangerous areas, entering shady looking houses and the like--it's just not fair that this happened to them.

I'm glad the carabineros have them (the perpetrators) in custody, because no South American prison is going to be kind to those guys.And the fact that I'm glad about that sickens me. But doesn't change the fact. I'm not a good person :/

Do circumcised  guys wash their penis when they pee?  I don't think so.  Trust that men with intact penises  know how to care for them (as much as circumcised  guys do). Genital mutilation  is barbaric and immoral.  You should  be ashamed of yourself. 
It's recoil mitigation. In all seriousness, I'm surprised it could even wrap its fat nasty hand around the grip. On another note, someone teach this stupid-ass blob what trigger discipline is before she kills someone.
No...it's real and proven, like it actually has a mass and stuff that scientists found. I don't have my notebook on me right now but I can bring in my Science Inquiry notebook that explains why. It's a course where we look at mysteries from a scientific point of view and usually just end up revealing a bunch of stuff as fake. Most of the astrology stuff is real but not completely understood yet. Dark Matter falls in that category.
If you like Teddyloid, his music has a very, very heavy French electronic music influence. So you've got guys like Madeon, Martin Solveig, with the most popular being Daft Punk and even David Guetta making similar sounding music. Though, just avoid Guetta's radio stuff and just listen to his album exclusive tracks.
I totally agree with this, but in a different way... [MAJOR AFTER STORY SPOILERS](/s "After Nagisa dies giving birth is when Tomoya experiences the most growth... and learned to live with Ushio. So... why did Ushio die, and then somehow it went back to the scene where Nagisa dies just to make her live? And even if he remembered everything that happened, there's no explanation in the show why his conciousness went back in time to that moment. It doesn't make sense, and it totally wipes out his experience in episode 18 with Ushio. I hate that ending so much. Probably my least favorite as well.")
I don't know. There's still a lot of people in China and then Indian and then Africa who are still hoping to buy there first car some day. Just look at the evolution of the cigarette industry which is now more globally profitable then ever while slowly dying in the developed world.  Obviously, technology will change drastically over the next 100 years, but seems like fossil fuels still have a lot of runway. Certainly enough time to still make money.

Some clinics allow benzo scripts and others don't.  Just call the few local clinics in your area if you have that option and ask then what their policy is on prescription benzos.  If they allow them, go check em out.  If they don't allow them anywhere, you're going to have to make the decision which one is better... being on methadone or being on benzos.
Yes. Everytime I update the script you need to redownload the script to get the latest version. I'm not sure if xmod has updated yet for the newest clash udpate. Try checking cydia to see if their app has an update available.
Me! I had already set up my phone and added stuff before I heard about rooting. I am not scared of resetting my phone since most of my stuff is backed up, I just don't really know what I'm doing and don't want to mess up my phone :(SOS 
I will give you the "how did she start up" thing, because that's a legitimate question. But I can't give you the gray boy thing. All she'd have to do is kill him (which is possible) and then claim his shard before he resets. He's not unkillable. He just resets. So all she has to do is kill him and claim it quick. As for how she got her other powers at first? Could be a death touch. But I feel we should have heard more about her death touch if she can kill a completely healthy cape with just a touch. Like where is her striker rating?? Why isn't it mentioned outright? I won't say it's impossible. I stopped saying it was impossible awhile ago. I still don't buy death touch for a full health cape. 
His lawyer said in his closing argument that Hernadez WAS at the muder scene, when a good part of the case was trying to discredit the fact that he was. His attorney was even trying to discredit a footwear expert who's testimony put Hernandez there.  Why would you go through the trouble to prove he's not there only to drop a bomb in the closing statement and say he was?  
No, there was one back in the day that would research you and post paragraphs worth of personal info. Admins ended up banning him/her. The stuff the poster above had can be found using one of those reddit detective sites.
I'm not "against" her in any way. Just underwhelmed with her performance on the show. She isn't great at performance challenges, and the area where you'd THINK she'd be delivering (the runway) isn't anything special either. She still hasn't come close to topping her 2nd or 3rd week looks, and we're at top 6, which is making people get bored with her.
This is a very common problem. Too many people focus on the first shipment. It is not the first shipment you will be screwed but the last. It is your job to realize when the last shipment left the dock.
i feel like another mechanic that really turns off new players in the same way is stun.  temporarily losing control of your character for a then-unknown reason can feel really bad in the early game. even more stunning in normal is a consequence of increasing monster damage values, which is something i think GGG should be very aware of.
Well there's a revealing phrasing- I can see how this might confuse you given your inventing a fantasy life to impress strangers with, but I don't need to tell myself anything. Is that why you make all this stuff up, to try and feel good about yourself?

This just came across my Facebook wall. I'm not surprised, Bernie's strength is in engaging conversation and answering questions. I hope to see him doing it a lot more often.

No, never worked in asset management... I've just worked in generic GL/AR/revenue stuff in my two years thus far.Oh well, I'll just finish the exam by the end of this year and then see where it takes me from there.

Now see, here's the thing... when I was in about 4th grade in the  seventies, I came home and sat next to my Dad who was a cop, and said, "Hey how was your day, bastard?"  Because I heard it being said around school and didn't know better.    My Dad caught me with a charlie horse to my thigh and said, "Don't you ever say that to me again."  I never did, and the only thing I suffered were hurt feelings for the night and a bruise to remind me to be respectful and not take the playground shit back into the house.  Good guy Dad!  :D   Point being that shit needs to start at home.  If not, then this attitude needs to be nipped in grade school.  The Seventies were a most excellent decade to be brought up in.
I ordered mine in the 15th and then is shipped on the 17th... still no sign of it yet. i emailed him 8 days ago about the order and he did not respond so I pm him and asked for updates. He told me that he is no mail man and does not give out constant updates...
He supported the AMBER alert system, but voted against it because there were sentencing provisions tacked on the bill, which he felt were unconstitutional.

I apologize again. I didn't mean to disparage what Criminologists do, merely wonder if there was much tangible change to reflect their work. That said, the only crime data that I'm presently aware of is the FBI Uniform Crime Report. Would that have been gathered by FBI Criminologists? I thought it was just a running tally that every office was required to keep for bookkeeping purposes.

Really it just depends on the amount of good and positive Bernie memes that are made. The more positive ones we flood the net with, the more likely one of those goes viral and starts to inform people. More people were mocking Paul. More people were praising Obama. Most Obama memes are about him just being a boss. 
This could be what your dad wanted to tell you when he was alive, but never got a chance to.  The people you love can't read your mind, you have to talk to them.
Yes. Most cakes are fine to bake beforehand. Generally, if you are going to add frosting, ganache, fruit, or anything else moist, you want to wait as long as possible on those and do assembly as close to when you serve it as possible. After you bake the cake, turn it out on a rack and let it cool COMPLETELY. Then wrap tightly in a couple layers of plastic wrap. I live in an arid climate, so I generally leave cakes on the counter unless it's a very moist recipe. If you are in a more humid or hot place, you probably want to put it in the fridge. The things you have to worry about are the cake drying out, or the opposite of getting moldy (again usually only an issue with high moisture content).

Your reply here fits very well to my reply to your original comment, so I will just add that the matchmaking advocates are starting a discussion that could have an unforeseen negative impact on the end-game content.  I am not talking about you specifically here, so don't take anything personal.  I fail to see how matchmaking will not be a first step in a series of steps that lead to raids that everybody can finish easily.  I want content that will be so challenging that you will need a good, dedicated team to finish it.  Complainers calling Bungie 'arrogant' and 'self-entitled' over this issue is what irks me.

People don't understand this stuff at all, nothing you stated was opinion that was all fact.Unknown Memory is a better debut album than illmatic is technically fact, but opinion would be "I like Unknown Memory better than I like Illmatic"It's kind of depressing that people don't understand that opinion by definition cannot be right or wrong. I think people get confused because there are facts that aren't or can't be proven. Like God is real isn't an opinion, but we can't prove it either way.

Normally, I'm that guy who gets offended when Staples Center shows our Stanley Cup banners on the Jumbotron when Pia gets to "...Banner yet wave!," but I'm guessing you're the guy who goes stomping on the team logo in the locker room.  I think for the Isles, showing respect for the team banners shows no disrespect for the American Flag since sports in America has generally been about civic pride, and that's the sentiment many ITT are trying to express.
I know, and he grew up a Raider fan. Could have been 2 drafts in a row Raiders ran away with the best player. Not that Cooper can't potentially provide more impact going forward but the Raiders would have a young scary Front 7 with Williams. 
Since you're adjusting it correctly, I'm at a loss as to what would cause the symptoms you're describing. Maybe time to ask someone with a higher skill level at torch repair. I go through these guys for rebuilds: http://www.regulatortorchrepair.com Thelast basketcase I sent them was a completely trashed and abused Victor straight cutting torch and the total bill was $55 - came back  in 2 weeks good as new. It's about the fourth or fifth reg/torch rebuild I've sent them in as many years, and so far they've treated me square on every time.
Downvote?  What?  It wasn't an insult -- she's been traveling all over the place working her ass off trying to feed all us hungry children.  She deserves a nap for all her efforts, no?
I agree that Henderson is more effective further forward, but I think Coutinho really thrives in a forward, central position.  With our lack of penetration I don't think we can afford to lessen Coutinho's offensive influence to get more from Henderson.  In your set up I think I'd swap Henderson and Coutinho.I also really like the idea of Lucas and Can alongside each other.  Solid.
I like DG for their hyper paranoid, angry, 'losing your mind' type lyrics and how they mix it with super esoteric ideas. Plus the style is exceedingly novel and innovative. Ride has almost 5 different types of vocals he uses. This is almost closer to aesop rock or stylistically but actually seems like it fits in with an older time period and the lyrics aren't super deep like Aesop's. The lyrics remind me of RATM. I'm not here to say it's bad. I think there is potential. It just would be cooler if it were more emotive and had a different style. 
Well I'm not a teacher but I've got this one:When I was in high school my AP Biology (advanced placement, college level course) told me that I was going to hell because I was an atheist. This came about in a discussion about evolution and the merits it lacks. It was fun. 
Had both at the brewery last month and if you didn't know ahead of time that the yeast was the only change in the two you'd guess they were two totally different beers.  I like both of them but Ponce is definitely my favorite, what an awesome beer.
You know, half the time I catch myself upvoting people because they've been downvoted into oblivion by a bunch of self righteous cunts. - Remember when voting, It's not about if you agree or disagree with them. That's not what the upvote/downvote system is there for. It's to regulate things that are off topic. If someone talks in a hardware review thread about a purple monkey - that would be the appropriate time to downvote.
Well at least it's consistent. But even so $9 million still sounds quite high for a referendum. I might have search google and see if I can't find a breakdown of costs.

I want New Day to really heat things up in their feud with Kidd and Cesaro by stealing Tyson and Nattys cats and holding them hostage. Dress them in new day attire and feed them positivity. 
Que loco que se le llame gorila a quienes respetan la democracia y la República y estan en contra de la corrupción,  el feudalismo y fascismo populista.En ese caso estoy orgullosos de ser gorila y no un peroncho corrupto. 
I worked with kids who had emotional/behavioral diagnoses. It was very, VERY draining emotionally and physically. We were to teach them life skills and how to interact successfully in society. We would vent to each other all the time and say the most fucked up things but it was just that, venting. When we were with those same kids, we were professional and conducted ourselves with unconditional positive regard towards those little shits. To be honest though, we almost exclusively blamed the parents. Some people just suck major ass at being parents. So talking is one thing, how they conducted themselves is something else entirely. 
Get to the biggest city I can get to (prob Nashville) and create a human pyramid of about 100 people.  When time unfreezes, the media frenzy will be hilarious.
Do victims have a right to retribution? I have always felt that the justice system should be purely rehabilitative in function. I don't get the justification for retributive justice.
I think this goes along my feelings that the problem is not the test itself, but how people try to use.Useful for commentary in film trends, but doesn't really say anything of the individual film.
Cetian's answer is pretty much spot on, but I wanted to add one other factor that led to anarchism to be such a virulent force in Spain -- and that is the traditional decentralized nature of the Spanish nation. Spain was never able to create the level of cultural and political centralization seen in France and England. In Spain, areas had a long tradition of more autonomy from the capital and had distinct cultures in each area. Indeed, if you look at the areas where anarchism was most popular it was in the areas with distinct cultures, namely Basque, Catalonian and Aragonese.  
You seem like a normal guy, don't go FHP unless you would write your own grandma a ticket, or really like working traffic crashes all day long. If you have any questions about the FWC, feel free to PM me. 
Agreed. There was I guy that use to train at my gym regularly that would always pull off some weird behind the back arm lock from guard (think you're on top and have your arm twisted behind you). We just called it the "James special" because he was the only one that did it, and he did it well. 
If it's "a gross cycle that black people can't simply "fix for themselves," let me step in. The Universe is impartial, it plays no favorites. The only two guarantees that we get are birth and death.However, that is not to say we are not loved, Life presents us all with every opportunity to grow, but these opportunities must be seized when presented. This is our choice. We are shaped and defined by the choices we make and ignorance is no excuse, and still Life gives, it's just fewer and farther the older we become.  So if someone has a brick hanging around their neck, it's 'cause they put it there every morning when they wake up and say "poor me."  Remember, chances are taken not given.       
Thanks for doing a giveaway.Love all the new craft, especially the american TDs.Absolutely hate the way they handled the calliope, both in cost and in mechanics. I was really excited for it, but now I'm afraid it's going to be nerfed into the absolute ground.
I wouldn't want dude making anything for me if he can't even tell what vegetables he's cooking. He probably doesn't even know how the food should taste then... Some girl will be very disappointed... Unless he's hung like a horse I guess. 
Not sure what that has to do with anything. I work a job, but that doesn't mean I plan on staying where I am. I'm simply offering advice based on what I hear other people say, books I've read, and things that I do that are working for me.
&gt; He doesn't prioritize me at allYou deserve someone who does! It's a critical component of a relationship. "Don't make someone a priority who only considers you an option."
All the "need" in the world! The main thing that motivated me to play the last MMO I played was once I seen the dancing in it! It was the best dancing Ever in a MMO and I would hope Star Citizen is = or grater then it. I fact I kinda think it has to be to live up to CR Level. ;)BTW the game was ArcheAge and danging was a toggle you turned what stile of dancing you wanted on and then you could Dance Walk Dance jump all in the stile of dancing you there toggled in to. It was awesome for making videos and having fun or when drunk.There are many but one Example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksTUEz-gf8M
I should mention that on the roof of the FIB building it says T1 on one side and the other has a like cut through the middle but can still tell its T1. The roof of the IAA building is labled T2 incase you didn't guess
&gt;Instead, many churches strike me as doing charity as a form of advertising.This seems true.  I had not considered it.  Is it prevalent in your community?  Does it seem like churches are competing against each other to seem the most benevolent?
I agree for the most part, and fuck all that blind-hype-train crap people got all worked up over anyhow.  Disapointment is what happens when you have blind, unfounded expectations.  A lot of it seemed too complicated and convoluted and exclusive anyhow.That being said, decent covenants with a a slight modicum of depth would have been welcome, but as it stands, the covenants in BB are the lamest and most shallow to date.  The covenants in previous games all had motives, rewards, and mechanics related to them, and BB pretty much completely lacks that.  For that and mainly that, I am dissapointed :(
Thanks. I love to point out false predictions.You probably just pulled that from a cheap youtube search in 5 seconds. I have seen the video before.A lot of those may be taken out of context. He's discussing things that could happen not necessarily believing THIS is the thing that can happen. @2:59 Stage some terror attack, end of 2009 was the underwear bomber false flag, and others since like boston bombing; yeah these involve no one dying so thats a good thing.Someone should make a new video; there's probably tons of Alex Jones content since 2011 on things he's said you can show haven't happenedI'm GLAD he was wrong. But what if he's just wrong about the timeline? Notice he's not saying the dates of many of these things.
What's even sadder is how much of a hypocrite you are when I click on your profile and see that you've spent an entire page of comments just repeating the same stuff, because you're obviously a very angry loser yourself. At first I figured you were a troll, but no, you're just stupid. Whatever.
I  have the same fear as you. I'm terrified of going by my windows at night because I always feel like there is going to be someone out there watching me. I'm okay around them when there's light outside but that's it. It also doesn't help that I sometimes get nightmares about people being outside the window and trying to get me and once I heard a couple knocks on the window itself.
If you were walking backstage to pull out your phone and use your bank app to remind yourself there are millions and millions of dollars there you would keep walking out there with a smile on your face too.  
Does that only work with eclipse? I really like the idea of having a package nonnullable by default and using optional but java really needs common annotations understood by the big 3 (eclipse/intellij/netbeans).
The worst decisions Big Brother ever made was BB 14 and BB 13. BB13 should have been all newbies, and BB14 should have been All Stars 2. The fact we will never see Dan compete in an All Star season sucks. I would have loved to see Rachel, Brendon, Jeff, Jordan, Dan, Dani, and Britney compete against each other. But none of them will probably ever return.

Carr will benefit greatly from having Cooper. Plays the most like an NFL wr already out of the big name rookies, rather than just relying on athleticism like a lot of guys do. Good pick.
All these are useless..What's the point of any of these if there's not pictures of her sticking things in herself and spreading her lips?Honestly. 
I don't. Well, I did and I posted them on this subreddit (probably been  10 months) back when it happened. I wish that I did because, now that the creep factor has worn down with time, that shit is hilarious.

"Classic" type system, like it is implemented in Java, for example, sucks. No need that crap in ruby. What ruby needs it's contracts support in standard library, this will solve type issues completely.
Do you mean HQ?  The ones with the yellow dust at the top of their icon?When used in crafting, they give you a headstart at high-quality (that's HQ) results.HQ items give more of their effect and have lower cooldown timers.HQ gear gives higher stat bonuses.
I feel a little bit reassured you think I'll outgrow getting angry over arguments. As for the being more empathetic and stall myself things? I think I can do that if I just have that on my mind when or **while** (if I'm not too angry) I think another incident or something is about to happen/**is** happening (again, if i'm not too angry). Thanks for the advice, I'll definitely keep it in mind.
The way I see it, if you didn't notice it while playing the game, it's not a huge problem that needs to be fixed...is it?Although I'm not disagreeing. The NPCs are definitely not the smartest. I can silently take out an entire group of people from about 10 feet away hiding behind a tree, and no one so much as looks at the dead bodies.

hey guess what? You're not a special little snowflake. Your gender issues have been around since day dot, the way you deal with them is how you rise about it all.The message is simple to be safe and even then you were fucken offended and made it a gender specific issue AND ABOUT YOU. Your reality of the world needs to change quick fast and you need to adapt, sure it sucks but thats the way its always been. YOU are not going to change it.Get a fucken grip and seriously come back to reality. 
It went well, if a little awkward (when is it not, am I right?). We had been dating for about 6 months at this point, and we knew we were serious about each other, and we had already talked to each other's respective families a lot about each other. I can't remember what the occasion was, though.Neither of us was at all anxious. I actually was looking forward to it because I knew it would be fairly entertaining (my family is very conservative, hers is very liberal), and that nothing our families did would affect our relationship very much.
I don't like to farm low rate stuff. Example, I've been on Mobliz all day trying to get 5 greater wind orbs. After all my stamina so far today, I've gotten 1. If there was at least something else besides the minuscule XP to go along with it it wouldn't be so bad. There's a big difference between farming and sadism. 
Very informative video. Thanks for making this! Some of your sources were mentioned in the video but would mind posting them so we can further analyze and research? 
Man isn't annoying how only certain players on a baseball team ever pitch? The game would be so much more interesting if they had the players switch positions more often. Man metas are the worst.
I'm done. I don't need to give advice. I'll just continue reading about how everyone has 100k in student loans and can't find a job or hate their jobs while most people I know have 100k salaries coming out of college who all love their jobs. it's cool. no need to offer advice to the unwilling.
&gt; I don't trust that they all know more about drugs then I do, as pretentious as it sounds I like to think I know more about drugs (maybe not how they work on a biological and neurochemical level) then a lot of doctors.you probably do. GPs tend to only know the most common issues people present with in any significant detail. everything else they either know very loosely or they just refer you to someone who does. or they just bullshit their way through the consultation, because if there's one thing us medics are good at, it's being able to sound like we know what we're talking about when really we have no clue ;)
Well, of course there are places on reddit for it. There's like, a million gaming subreddits of differing flavors. It even had its own subreddit when the MLP version was under development."Having a place on reddit" isn't important; it's whether or not it's what we want it *here* that's important.

Season 5 during the time flashes, they share quite a bit of screen time actually! But it was standing outside of the well at the orchid station before John lowered himself down into the station to turn the donkey wheel and move the Island. Her exact words were "John, if whatever it is you're trying to do actually works, thank you". We know that what John did was influence the Oceanic Six to return to the Island and back through time until they ultimately caused Juliet's death at the Swan station.
Maybe we *should* cut them some slack though. Look at [all I've done in 5 years.](http://tj-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/printable-thumbs/a-whole-lot-of-nothing-printable-gift-ideas.jpg) Maybe they work as fast as I do.
90% of the time the bartenders at 45 Tchoup wont card a person if they look over the age of 21.  The idea that they would refuse a foreign ID while just "eyeballing" the age of most of their patrons should show how no one cares about foreign IDs unless they are looking to be an asshole.  If those bartenders cared about their jobs they would ID check every person, every time.  Luckily for us sane people, they dont.

I disagree, Liberty University is a joke - for the same reasons that eminent philosophy departments don't teach "New Age metaphysics," or Ayn Rand's objectivism, Math departments don't teach Numerology, or Medical Schools teach Homeopathy, et al.That's not say that Prof DeWitt himself isn't qualified, he is. And, like you say, he's wrong, but that university should not be viewed in any shape or form as approaching anything we'd call scientific. I'll be surprised if anyone ever has taken their BS or BA from LU and gotten into a prestigious Graduate Program. LU is a diploma mill, pure and simple. 
Oh man, that is just terrible - I am so sorry to hear you've had such a hard time! Has your MS been diagnosed as degenerative, or is it more episode-based? Question: does anyone in your family have it? They keep flip flopping between whether it could have a hereditary link or not. My husband's dad had MS and my mom has MS, and we're expecting our first child, and we have always worried that it could turn out to be genetic.

I dated the same girl 3 times over 5 years. There was never any animosity between us, we just wanted different things out of life.Dated for 2 years, broke up, saw her at a party 6 months later and fooled around... dated for another year. Broke up, saw her at *another party* a year later, fooled around (alarm bells are ringing, dumbass) and dated for 6 months. Then she moved to New York and I haven't seen her in 10 years.
never said i was a psych major, never was defending psych majors , never called engineers boring, only boring when they are talking about their work life, which seems to be constantly cause they are in love with themselves for being engineers
Does your team have any Commando classes? If not there's your problem. Commando's at this point in meta are your Tier 2 Killing Machines. The Scar combined with the 20% Damage increase makes them perfect for disabling Bloats/Husks/Sirens at a longer range than any other perk.If you do have a Commando and he is shooting Trash mobs with his Scar most of the time. He's doing it wrong for the team. I personally will only trash kill if I have a Bullpup/AK12 spare to have mitigate the trash. Otherwise by round 3/4 I have just a Scar to deal with Tier 2 mobs and that's it until I'm Full Buy.Just my 2 cents.
it looks like some kind of coating has worn off or their is oil smears. If you had more funky direct light you would notice it. The image you attached was pretty flat light.

&gt; Australian history professor Philip Dwyer documented, McIntyre’s factual assertions are simply true.Including claims that ANZACs bent space and time to be involved in Japan? Or how about that Australia was somehow involved or complicit in the nuclear bombings of Japan? Makes me think the historian has alternative motives if he doesnt even qualify his statement when declaring the tweets "simply true". 
That's manipulation, not gaslighting.Gaslighting is when you start making someone question reality. It's when someone comes here and has to *ask* if someone beating them is abuse, or if it's okay because [reason]. It's when people come on here and are confused because their SO keeps doing something, but then denying that it ever happened and making the person wonder if they're imagining it.
That sucks I saw you apologized for the upvote thing &amp; edited it right away. Don't see the need to remove your post over it. Anyways thanks for the update. 
That is a true statement of law but has nothing to do with whether the guy was entitled to refuse to enter into the contract on the original terms AND get to keep the deposit back.
if you didn't qualify then the govt has assessed your dad can more than pay for you and your siblings to attend college. whether he will or not that's another issue.also... you might be a spoiled rich kid. your dad is a doctr? in America? you are wealthy. my parents one year made 24,000 between the two of them for a family of 5. they begged and borrowed to put me Andy sisters through private schools and I'm the only one who went to college.  figure it out, if you want this money isn't stopping you.
I think you're underestimating the hype train of star citizen. I don't think you guys should be launching anything at e3, but a high quality demo or trailer would most certainly attract lots of attention. Just about every single PC gamer I know is following star citizen. I'd go so far as to say that if you guys don't show something impressive, a large number of the people who are interested in the game, but don't follow it closely, will think that all the bad press is true. Regardless of whatever CIG shows or says at E3, please make sure that the presentation isn't a shit show like all your other events. The kind of stuff that flies with the community does not fly at E3. 
Once in one of my cs courses, my mind went numb. Like I couldn't figure out why the fuck "if (x==5 || 6)" wasn't working. It just blanked out on me for whatever reason. So I deleted the whole if statement and went to the bathroom, grabbed some water, came back and I felt stupid as fuck.happens to the best of us
Every card went into a penny sleeve and then card saver I. I sent all 15 cards that I had graded out in a priority mail small flat rate box. All 15 cards were stacked together and then lightly wrapped in small bubble wrap. Kept them tight and centered in the box. Their shipping fee was like $24 to return it to me with $500 in insurance, and I think I paid $15 to get it out to them. You can't use a top loader with PSA.
I'm mostly looking for a nice machine from one of the early models to cover on my show, LGR on YouTube. I'd love to also have one of the later, more compatible versions later on, but for the purposes of my video I'm looking for otherwise first.Thanks again for the info! Any idea of what the cost of shipping to the US may be? I've seen all sorts of wild variations on estimates.
Remember Riot is still a company whose goal is to make money and as long as people are willing to spend money on these things they will never be free.  It all well and good if people want them to be part of a champion mastery system of whatever but at the end of the day people will be willing to pay for chroma packs and so long as there is some profit Riot will not make them free.  May be a bit of a harsh truth but in business money is the name of the game.

I can't really argue with the Rockets' decision to fire him from a PR standpoint, but I thought it was a bit harsh. I thought a suspension without pay would've been more appropriate, but that might just be because I personally wasn't offended at all by the joke.I just hate when the moral police always comes in and thinks one mistake automatically makes a person scum of the world. Most of the people who are cracking jokes about this guy losing his job aren't doing it because they believe he deserves it, but because they can get their e-fame whether it be RTs/Favs, Karma, or whatever else.

Lies.1) The vast majority of lives that are saved by healthcare are not inheritable2) of those that are inheritable, the largest killer of humans is heart disease, which generally affects people AFTER they have reproduced.3) Many diseases that are inheritable as well as affect you before reproduction, will also still reduce the likelihood of you reproducing.4) Given that genetic diseases can still be recessive, they will still be around even if everyone that had symptoms did die.
Let me just clarify I haven't seen anybody that denies the holocaust happened entirely. AFAIK the common belief is that it's greatly exaggerated and there was no death camps and most deaths came from when the Allies cut off supplies.Roughly?

Life? It's a handheld gaming system for fuck's sake! We're not talking about the moon landings, the first car, or hunting and gathering skills here. We're talking about a machine that people game on. Get some perspective.
I've read a couple articles on this, but I also have my anecdotal reasons for thinking this. I had friends whose dad made over 250k a year and I've had friends that are around the 75k mark, as well as myself and I like to think that after the breaking point you start running in to the same issues again. I dunno, personally, I'm happy where I'm at in life at my age and I'm around that dollar value.
Less a recurring dream than a recurring *theme*: claustrophobia. I'm not very claustrophobic in my everyday life, but if I have a stressful dream it almost always involves trying to climb/crawl/squeeze through very small spaces, and I'm always terrified I'm going to get stuck.Either that or running away from someone/something. 
The Night and the Moment:http://netflix.com/Movie/The-Night-and-the-Moment/60025591This is like a more sensual and less dramatic Dangerous Liaisons.A lot of the movies in this genre tend to have themes of infidelity or other controversial topics, but if you are OK with those I can throw a couple more recommendations.
&gt;Inb4 someone says there isn't anyone who shares their views that high up, lol.That's completely true though. So I'm not really sure what you mean by that.
Ha, yeah I hear you there.  I've flown with 3 different dogs and it's never been a problem.  My cats are the sweetest angels but I wouldn't even consider taking them anywhere near my plane.
You mean negates the effectiveness of LRMs in any capacity? Compare that to the monstrous amount of LRMs clanners were able to field this week. Bottom line is they are able to bring an ECM mech that isn't completely useless in CW. Like Maxwell said, once IS gets a heavy ECM the hellbringer will be just another mech.
Fountain core has us a bit paranoid atm, and for good reason. I don't dock for a single neut, but I can't speak for everyone. It really depends when you show up and who is around. A good chunk of our members are blood thirsty and ready to bring it, but we also have very new guys who are broke and only have a couple ships in system. We're getting better, but we'll need a little bit more time to be running on all cylinders. 
I should win because I am missing both of these for my collection. Ike would be amazing to use in smash as well as Code Name STEAM! Wii fit trainer would be cool she's a unicorn. I would love to explore what she's compatible with.

As someone that wanted Williams I'd say it's crazy the reactions in this thread. Cooper is a fine pick here. It's one Mayock even said he'd rather see us take with this pick over Williams. It's one many said. I wanted Williams. But Cooper fills a huge void.

There's a lot more to detecting a ratio cheat than just clocking their speed, but they should have been able to tell that you was using a seedbox or an OVH server if you actually was, there might have been more to this.
Will do! Probably won't be settled til Sunday night cause we have to go out to ikea and get a dining room table and then grocery shopping for the week 
Well, to satisfy the first amendment it's gotta incite imminent lawless action and can't just be advocacy. "We should gun down the looters" is advocating a position. If I were standing in front of a riled-up crowd of people with guns a hundred feet from looting and screamed that, then we're getting toward incitement of imminent lawless action. But just saying it over the internet is just advocacy.

Heterosexual couples can create children and we have laws in place to protect those families in the form of child support and visitation rights in case of a divorce. That cannot happen in a homosexual marriage. Which spouse gets to see the child? By law it can only be one since two men and two women cannot naturally conceive. If you want to create parental rights simply by marriage, you would see straight couples ceasing to get married.
You say you cannot do chores and all that on weekends/family time - but I personally have found that my boyfriend and I do well when we work on that stuff together. No it isn't fun to both be cleaning and not hanging out, but it feels nice to have that sense of accomplishment when we have worked on things together. You may also benefit from searching on Pinterest to find chore schedules. Hire someone once to get caught up again, then try out one of these schedules - they give you a list of which things to do when, at a limited amount of work each day, so that you can keep on top of it. I have seen them on sahm blogs and they seem to be helpful. 
Meh, we will see. I waited to use refresher combo until teamfight broke out. That way i did maximum damage to enemy buildings. They just couldn't keep up with constant pushes. Remember the ult has a 60 second cd, so you can pop it on cd we wheb refresher is on cd
Probably not a game in the sense you're talking about, but Flight Rising is an awesome site. It's basically a pet site but with dragons. You can battle them, dress them up, trade &amp; sell them, breed them, etc. There are also forums and in my experience everyone on there has been super friendly and welcoming. It sounds lame how I'm describing it, but it's tons of fun.
and previously it had been beckoned by Laurence &amp; co. (" his associates"), and who knows how many other times; just like there have always been cults trying to beckon the moon and/or great ones (in line with the lovecraftian inspiration for many plot elements)
[Srs] I didn't look at which post this was a reply to bc I also posted something to /r/trashy and thought this was a comment on that post and almost died.
I honestly don't care too much about the environment. I won't do stuff to intentionally make it worse, but I couldn't care less about stuff like Earth Day. That being said, littering bothers me so much! Mostly because either someone has to pick it up, or it gets caught somewhere and looks bad. Just walk over and throw it away! 
I didn't do sports, but I was in a lot of AP and honors courses and my school didn't weigh them. I did knowledge bowl, photography club, philosophy club, and yearbook. But my friend who had a lower ACT (27) and the same GPA got in. Probably because he played tennis and is a guy.
such a bummer this is only on the app. I don't feel comfortable with mobile transactions after my CC got compromised the last time i bought something through a phone app.
xD thanks! Yeah, but to me there's something too creepy about their souless voidless white eye sockets...lol!Thank you, hopefully the lab will be kind to you a second time. *crosses fingers for another xweetok robo zap*
He also used to call up the President (I forget which one) high as a kite, because he was a fellow Southerner.  That President used to pass the phone off to one of his aides and Elvis never knew the difference. 
My momma is getting this![Owl Diaper &amp; Wipe Case](http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/owl-diaper-and-wipe-case)Except I'm modifying it into a case for her iPad (no need for diapers anymore, haha). She was in the Chi Omega sorority in college and subsequently loves owls (Chi O's mascot). 
There's a reason people will buy a girl a few drinks before trying to get laid. It's because alcohol impairs your decision making. If you have sex with someone you know is drunk you're an awful person and a rapist.
Right, because in the real world only 50% of people would try to get 20% of their money out in a bank run. The treasuries don't let their gold get audited, obviously because it's not there. If the US defaults, it defaults hard. that's why post-2008 the banks were bailed out.  Otherwise people would've actually felt how bad it really can be.
I don't know why someone would think that nudity and gardening go together? It's one thing to relax in a garden nude, but it's another thing to be arms deep in a bush or turning compost...
I'd be worried that the vampire shrimp may get hassled to death. Maybe more ghost shrimp instead? They breed easily,  so you won't be down stock if some get snacked on. 
Most people should and will live simply, but we need to be aware of those who don't and can't. Merely arguing against ambition doesn't keep people from engaging in ambitious activities.On the flip side, I doubt we'd have such a growing electric car and private space markets if it were not for ambition. Some of the hardest human endeavors require someone ambitious enough to take them on.
Yeah, but Pearl's DESPY win is never brought up as that controversial because of her stans, who factor into the disillusion. Having stans defending her every move to the detriment of other queens gets old eventually. For instance Pearl had the same exact factors going against the justification for her DESPY win that Kennedy did for her Spoof win (1. Mostly written by a teammate, 2. Win was a storyline one following a near elimination, 3. Win was based on strong execution over writing, 4. There were other contestants who arguably were funnier), yet these factors are brought up to Kennedy's detriment constantly and are praised but when someone tries to logically bring them up about Pearl they get attacked by the stans.
Doubt it.  If you really do that for final work product and not just drafts, then you're an idiot.  Do you also hide weed leaves in your powerpoint presentation like you're in middle school?
Thanks, after chewing on some mustard seeds it definitely seems like I need to ramp that up a lot. Think I also used too much vinegar, so that's coming down. I like Howler Monkey too, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. I've had Lottie's, but it didn't make an impact with me. Maybe I'll go try it again.
Lawyer here. That's true that it's often used in law school. The movie isn't totally accurate, but it's noticeably better than most movies. My firm actually uses a trial scene from My Cousin Vinny to show first year lawyers.
Jaysus. I went to a Nordic nation, and the girls were not dtf, at all. Very conservative. This nation was not in eastern Europe, but in the proximity. Happy? 
Oh that's so awesome!! I'm going to apply to grad schools (behavioral neuro) next fall and that's a lab/school I'm seriously considering. If you are at Emory, you have access to animal behavior researchers and if you have experience working with a dog lab, you can probably go for a postdoc in dog behavior. Postdoc is about getting more training and it's a chance to learn a new field (or get more credentials to open your own business).Edit: I replied thinking you were the OP. My bad. 
This is one of those films you'll be kind of glad you watched, but you'll also never feel the need to watch again. It's 30 minutes too long, but if you want to go on a bit of a trip through time and space you'll enjoy it.
Wait, they have shuttles? I've always held off on echostage shows because of how awful it is finding a way to/from the venue. How is their shuttle setup?
Feminism is the new religion, and SJWs are the new holier-than-thou power trippers getting their rocks off by ordering others around.  Same shit, different day.
Thanks Michael.  OK, here are your credentials. You've been granted level three security clearance.  Don't get too excited, that's out of 20. Right this way
&gt; Apolitical. Politically agnostic. Like Capitalism, which works regardless of the political forces around it.Ancap theory is a theory about political actors and why they are inevitably going to perform worse than the market. It's not a theory in a vaccuum.
To stop this,right before you play in the Superbowl every season change your team to the broncos and then they won't be playable as YOU are the broncos. Keep doing that and you won't have to worry about that audible calling pain-in-the-ass
YAAAAY!!Seriously, as someone who had a drug-addict as a neighbor who would blast music on FULL VOLUME in his home entertainment system (techno, to be precise) from noon to like 6 in the morning next day when he was trippin' on drugs *when I was trying to study for entering university*, I can heavily relate. The day he got an eviction notice was the most silent and most happiest day of my life. Go make all the happy noises now!
I'm actually betting that we will sooner see a "new Modern" based around either the M15 frame or Magic Origins set as a second staggered eternal format.
No, that's my job. As a tissue engineer, I'm trying to come up with materials that have "good" mechanical properties for cells and their survival, then build different structures with anatomically relevant shapes from them, coat them with different proteins to facilitate cell adhesion and then see if cells start to differentiate into specific cells and maybe even tissues (in my case, I would like to see bone cells). The idea is that if one finds a perfect combination of these various factors, we can start growing tissues and maybe some day even entire organs, which would be kind of kickass and prevent many deaths due to organ failure or shortage. Also, I get to use a 3D printer to build my structures 😁Sorry if this sounds too technical, I just stopped writing my thesis for the day and I'm still thinking in technical jargon 😝
Yes, I have a big family if I include my extended family and I love it. So many cousins and we all get along great. Family dinners are never boring. :D
The only way this feud results in anything other than being filler for two guys WWE wants around but creative has nothing for is if Ryback becomes a follower of Wyatt's at the blow off.

Because that is not a good explanation I decided to do my own investigation and found the following link: https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/and it does state that the competitor has 15 seconds to investigate the puzzle (cube) prior to starting the solve.  I am glad there are regulations for this.
Dunleavy had it coming to him. One fist to MCW's throat, the other to his mouth. Backhand to Giannis's throat. If the refs were doing their job, Dunleavy would have been ejected 3 minutes into the game.
The ONLY purpose of Rbias is to * make sure the (+) plate of the left polarized electrolytic, is more positive than its (-) plate  AND* make sure the (+) plate of the right polarized electrolytic, is more positive than its (-) plateThe reason why you connect Rbias to the highest, most positive power supply on the whole board is: to make sure the voltage on the (+) plates of the electrolytic capacitors is as high or higher than either Term1 or Term2.  This way each polarized electrolytic capacitor never sees reverse polarity.Install this 2C+1R stunt into the full EEG schematic and print it all out at 200% magnification.  Write the DC bias voltages on each node using red colored pencil.  Now ask yourself: is the left polarized electrolytic "reverse biased"?  Is the right polarized electrolytic "reverse biased"?  If so then give up and sell hotdogs from a pushcart.
"It's not too often you get quick guys who are also fast." What?! Dumbest fucking thing I've heard so far. How are these people paid American dollars to do this?
Not that I recommend going solo, but you should have been able to get one to kill the other in the timelimit. Maybe palicoes were messing with positioning?
you should check out the film union in florida...since your already union, you could get in real easy.and let me tell you man.. you get treated good. all you do is weld 2 inch angle iron and supports for movie sets.  they feed your gourmet food. make more money then you would making welds that are 100x harder and more demanding on your lifestyle, and health.  I have a buddy in New Mexico thats in that union.  He use to be a pipeliner, and alloy welder.  He's making dam near 48 an hour, barley does a thing, welds little 2' Supports and such.  They feed him 4x a day.  You get good hours 8-16 hours a day depending on what level the production is in.  benefits, double time after 8. ect...  dont have to worry about x rays, n all that bullshit.  per diem, pay for your hotel.  http://www.ia477.org/
You can actually set your debounce time through the service menu, where it has options in milliseconds.  The 0.06 I suggested is 60ms.  It's in the Input Options section.
Oh yeah, definitely. My ex was unattractive at first glance, but once I got to know him, he became cute in different ways, his mannerisms, behavior, etc. SO in a sense he was attractive to me, just not conventionally. I'd say he *definitely* had game. I noticed he didn't seem to have a problem getting women, and he had tons of female friends who adored him. It's all about that charisma!
I still don't understand why Chrom can't just be a reskin of Ike.  Hell, Ike has a Chrom color palette, both of them are heavy sword users, and both use Aether anyways.
To be fair, even if the child was young enough to still be breast-fed, I think I would certainly be somewhat startled if a woman just starts breastfeeding all of a sudden at my desk.
Everyone starts out that way. When I started mindfulness of breathing a few years ago sitting for just 10 minutes was a struggle. But I stuck with it for a few months and developed enough patience to sit longer even though I was still constantly distracted by thought. I still remember my first 45 minute session and how proud I was. Fast forward a few years and I've done literally hundreds of hour-long sessions. It's like anything else, practice makes progress.
So the service line to speak to an Operator states the hours of operation are 9am-9pm mon-fri.I sat on the phone on hold listening to music for over 15 minutes before it announced the hours of operation. Btw it's 7:37 CST.
Can confirm, just got my copy of Dominion: Adventures in the mail. 1. The middle insert that identifies the cards locations in the plastic holders is completely ripped, crumpled, and barely usable, it also does not line up to the spaces at all. 2. Almost all of the cards have incredibly awful scuffing/damage to the outer edges and the cards look anything but new. Pretty disappointed.

Yes.  Most docs will make you try antibiotics and all that other stuff first, but honestly if you are really bad just try to get on it.Nothing ever worked for me than more than 1-2 months.  I started accutane about a year ago, and have been off it for around 8-9 months.  Been like 95% clear since then.Don't make my mistake of being afraid of it and waiting too long.  Get on it and save your life now.If you do run into serious complications just stop.  It's really quite rare.
I've ordered 2 and I'm planning to get 1-2 more the day of--granted, I actually need half the set since I'm building Zefra Yang ZingsDon't buy boxes if you think it's a 'hot set'However, if Galaxy Cyclone manages to become a $200 card--pre-ordering a box or two wouldn't hurt
i considered cutting my dick off recently because i felt i was too driven by hormonal urges.'but then i realized i needed it to masturbate. oh and pee i guess.
Eh I can see where she's coming from, to be honest. Neither she nor 95% of the Inquisition know Dorian personally, all they know is he's a mage from a generally hostile realm, a realm once ruled in part by the very enemy the Inquistion is fighting against, a realm where the cult that supports said enemy currently has a notable amount of political power... and he's managed to gain the confidence of possibly the most (currently) important person in Thedas.She hasn't spoken to Dorian the way the Inquisitor has, doesn't know he's thoroughly opposed to everything that makes the Imperium "the bad guys" - and frankly he doesn't really seem all that interested in telling her, either. The only interaction we actually see between them is antagonistic both ways.Frankly, she has every right to be concerned, in my opinion.
OH BOY I have one of the Kamp-Kings seen at the bottom. If it weren't the first knife I ever owned and therefore sentimental, I would've thrown it out long ago.
&gt; k the Oilers have some similarities to the Islanders, they were secretlyI thought that once too.  I no longer do.  We need a bona fide starter.  Scribbles is a backup.
I have the same gpu but an I5 650 and I can never hit 60 fps on med settings. You think my cpu is the problem? Usage is pretty high with the game running.
Backlight bleeding, when the monitor's panel doesn't block the backlight completely in one or more areas, usually the corners. In some cases related to the plastic enclosure pressing against the panel. Can happen with monitors in any consumer price-range. The U2415 might be more safe from this because it's higher pricepoint suggests better quality control, but after a bunch of really obvious quality control problems with the U2515H I'm not so sure.Here's a bad example of backlight bleeding in the 800$ Acer XB270HU (exaggerated by the dark room):http://i.imgur.com/gU2GeUfl.jpg
To me swallowing my boyfriend's cum is kinda hot, it never tastes bad and I swallow it too quickly to really taste too much of it anyways. When I'm horny it tastes suuuper good, but when I'm not (which was only once that I can remember) it just tastes really fucking strange. I guess it's like accepting him fully to me, I love him and his cum is part of him, so I love his cum. Ahh, nothing like romanticizing semen.
He was. It basically goes like this&gt;Ene&gt;Shintaro&gt;Everybody elseThe rest of them were pretty lame, except for Konoha and that one leader girl whose name escapes me.
Yeah totally. I could understand it if you had to pay some copper for some bonuses but the way it is now there is literally no point in putting my money into more than one brighthollow upgrade (i do it anyway but still...).
You know what's better than having your dick flopping about in the wind and asserting dominance over everyone? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Except maybe a zonk. That shit's dank af. 
As time passes, and skepticism gains popularity, fewer people are wearing the cross charms and fewer buildings are being built with crosses on their steeples to protect neighborhoods.Soon, there will be gaps in our defenses, and the vampires will again prey on our kind.Beware, the [#FallingCross](https://hshtags.com/tags/v/FallingCross)
Only have the battery in its own separate enclosure, also make sure the battery enclosure is vented. Make sure the battery enclosure is indoors as well. Plus it's easiest to not have the charge controller in an enclosure at all so you can program it easily and check how the battery bank is doing.
Well on my box mod it says .3 ohm.  idk how the indicator worksCould you explain more of the difference between .3 and .5?Edit: and yes the shop I got everything from carries replacements, I don't know if .3 or .5Edit: it appears the replacement is .5 and I'll check later to see if the one I'm using is actually the .3
I'm really not understanding this LPT. I have no idea what's a vertical seam (let alone opposite side). Is there any way you could show me a picture to elaborate on this? :D
Watapon Beat.  Equip Watapon with armed changer while you have honest in hand, and you can run over any monster in the game.I also once made a hieratic deck, that turbod out blue-eyes shining dragon.  No one knew what to do against it.And the absolute worst deck that I ever built, that should not have worked:  I took wind-ups, added an empty jar engine, and 3 junk synchrons for lv 5 syncho plays.  This was before I got my hand on carrier, rats, or sharks.  That deck was so bad, but so trolly.  
Indefinitely? It's an extra day. As specified in the executive order signed by the governor Tuesday to deal with the 200 looters brought in Monday night. 
We all have the same advice: stay away.  However, we are also not in your shoes, and can't quite fathom what keeps people in abusive relationships even somewhat together. So I will not judge in the least.    Best advice: cut off **all** contact. No emails, no phone calls, no fucking nothing.  If he has no legal rights, i.e. not named on the birth certificate then he is shit out of luck with regards to any sort of visitation.    Lastly, don't believe **a fucking word he says**. These guys all have fantastic excuses and go to great lengths to say they have *improved*.  However, this is one area, like sexual abusers, where the leopard never changes its' spots.    Glad you are home safe and sound.
I heard they figured out something else o machine and sell and are not making hoses regularly anymore unless a vendor makes a nice sized order probably
That would piss me off too! I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out that it was Midleton in The Drop because of how poorly they showed the bottle. Conversely, Justified does it right, you can see exactly what they are drinking, and I love that.
Nah man, you should be happy. Your offense isn't going to be great this year, but now you've got a young core, with some good veteran leadership. I'm picking Oakland to win the AFC West, not this coming year but the following year.Plus think about how much more you can pick up on defense in the later rounds. Stay up, man. This was a good pick.
I'm salary in the oil and gas industry and the company changes stuff on us all the time from our days to now travel being included in our days off, to working 100+ hours a week. Also taking away earned bonuses and changing the requirements to get these bonuses on the fly.
My goal for 1 year is to be touring the  world performing my one man show at collages and theaters. 5 years from now I hope to be one of the most established magicians in the country.. And making myself a household name to laypeople.

You don't have to watch it?... I don't see the issue. I didnt even know how long it was because I don't have any interest in getting audible so i simply left the video. Did you think you had to keep watching? were you like "ugh now I need to sit here and listen to this thing at the end, damn I wish I didn't have to but dems da rules."
I have 2 dogs, 6 cows and 6 wool producers. They usually tend to bring out ether the cows or sheep, never a mix which is interesting. They put them back around 6ish but every so often I check and 1 got left behind.
I don't think anyone can deny the GDQ ARE interesting content. It's just more taylored to casual viewers than basically everything else in the speedrunning world. Which means it's more interesting to them, and less interesting to us, but that's good for the bottom line since they outnumber us big time.
cathodic bombardment does break up the oxide, but some of that gets into the weld pool and some gets carried with the now hot purge gas up into your face. (hot air rises and particles are small enough they go with it. Molten metal is defacto.. liquid. and all liquids have vapor pressures as well. That's why we can smell hot metal. part (most) of it is ozone. part of it is actual metal particles. 
Thanks so much for the in-depth response. I've been dreading the S word, I don't think my soldering iron will be up to much in the way of delicate tasks. It was my dad's and I think he had it since about the 60s, it looks like a giant screwdriver that plugs into the wall. I'm sure I can at least manage to get the speaker off with it though!When you say hot air, do I need some kind of special tool, or can I just blast stuff with a hairdryer for a couple of minutes? :DSeems obvious now you say it, but it's interesting to learn it can work as a regular speaker with such limited input. I certainly have much to learn! Must off to bed now but I'll likely pester you with more follow-up questions tomorrow if you don't mind! ;p
My grades are sufficiently adequate. I'm not amazing, but I can't say I have bad grades.Overall, I'm getting interviews but had some major issues (that I've since fixed by doing about half  dozen mock interviews) and tried entering a very competitive area. My resume is full of the competitive area and not much else that I pigeonholed myself quite a bit. Now, when I go to interviews in other areas, I'm immediately placed on the defensive and need to "explain" why I "want" to work in a different area.So, it's a wash at this point. I shouldn't have messed up my first interviews.
Isn't it the job of a community manager/PR guy to be calm at all times and never make rash decisions, especially ones in the public? It seems to me that NShadow would be a quite good candidate for having his own PR manager, perhaps to help with the pressure of public community drama.I wish him luck, of course.
Very true, hope he does get sent down sometime soon. Guessing the current injuries and possible DL stints for Schafer &amp; Hughes will slow down straight up demotions right now, though.
It is a tax levied by the Government. In theory it is only supposed to be a tax on people who watch live television but in reality they harass everyone with an address. If you don't pay it and they think you should be paying you will end up in court. If they feel like it they'll even give you a prison sentence for refusing to pay their "licence fee". It is as much of a tax as road tax or VAT. Stop deluding yourself.If it was not created by an act of Parliament then the BBC would be considered a racket because it essentially operates like one.

If you register as an SBR, you can swap out the shorter for the longer, no problem. If you cut the 16 down and permanently attach the flash hider so that the "permanent" length of the barrel is still 16 inches, then you can avoid the headache altogether.
boyle should've squared up and gone for the hit instead of backing up on ovi. though you cant blame him for not wanting to do so since ovi is built like a brick shit house
To bounce of Brimacki, not only are their points valid, lack of credit would be hard for you if you have absolutely no credit history.I would build your emergency fund first before thinking of the home, at the same time establishing some credit.  3K savings is barely enough in terms of an EF when you're renting, and the amount of risk you take when owning a house can present quite a substantial bill when (not if) something happens (normal repairs, something breaks, foundation rots, etc. etc.)Not to deter you from getting your home, I would rather recommend you rent cheaply for some more time, build your savings and emergency fund, and consider your options all the while building your credit history which can qualify you for a mortgage and even net a better rate.  Having no credit history? That's a tough sell.
fyi options are overpriced they have a lot of extra bulk built into them. annualized its very expensive. go into your paperaccount sell otm puts if youre bullish and sell otm calls if youre bearish, do this in aapl as it has the most liquid option and the models will be the most accurate. 
alternate method is to animate your character moving forward, then to take those frames and put their torso in the same place once it's done.  you'll get proper foot slide this way.
Inspection mechanic here, they are still in US models, I get lots of Volvos, Benz, VW (not as much) and Audis with them. The have to work, too according to PA safety insp laws
I really know how you're feeling. Honestly, I'm practically the exact same. Same age, nearly done school, furthest I've ever personally gotten was holding hands (6 years ago). I have only realized recently what my own problem was, and I'm suspecting it may be yours too. You think that there's something wrong with *you* because of these rejections and lack of girlfriends. **This is not the case!** There are a million things going on in everyones' lives, so you can't possibly know the reasoning behind every rejection. I'm working on myself and that seems to be what you're doing too, so keep at it!The way I see it, you're already miles ahead because you're trying! That's awesome! Going out on a limb and asking someone out is the hardest part. Also, never be embarrassed about the things you enjoy. My pastimes couldn't be nerdier, and there's nothing wrong with that. If nothing else, know that you aren't alone because I'm in the same spot. I believe in you.
The Pink Panther? With Steve Martin in it. Idk all the cheap slap-stick was just so hilarious when i was younger and whenever i watch it it's as if my sense of humor never went through its refinement phase. Still laugh *every* time at the "may i have the harmbaarrgaargghh" scene. And also the completely random JOJOBA shampoo dance.

Ok. So i've spent the past 8 hours putting together a system that involves rolling AND point buy, so that everyone will be happy.1. Roll 4d6 (drop lowest) and add up the amount.2. Multiply that number by six (because there are six attributes)3. Add the number of points you want to use for point buy.4. Get an idea of what race/class/concept you want to play.5. Take the original dice roll number and multiply it by negative six (because scores under ten have a negative modifier).6. Now add the above number to the number you had before.7. Use the new number that you have calculated for point buy.I know it's a bit mathy but I think that this new randomized point buy system will make everyone happy.
Well they did earn that guy's trust when they owned up to a flaw in their recovery script and helped him recover 85 bitcoins. Three days ago we were praising them for how they handled it. 
Not what I had hoped to hear.  Any way to temporarily fix the problem?How did the seller hide this?  He had to drive 30 miles to me to sell it...when I purchased there was no white smoke at all...(curious because I might sue him).
Also, there's at least 3 or 4 different people that show up on screen in two separate places at the same time.But yeah, definitely looks like the professor from Dia de los Dangerous!.
This is why I have started taking 5-6 pics of every phone I am sending in. I regret not doing it with my first phones I sent them, because it will be tough to prove they were in good shape without pics. Yes, I have had a similar experience with 2 phones so far. They had stated both were appraised at their full value, then I received a $13 gc for one and a $38 gc for another. I will be calling them tomorrow to give them a piece of my mind. Especially since Christopher never called me back today. I plan to specifically ask for him, call him out on his lies, then ask for his supervisor.
Ahh. They're closed but looks like generally con census is that it's not a glitch, but just the date I preordered it. Thanks though. I probably would have if I didn't get any help with this. 
Pressing on the corners is pretty meaningless. By the time that tells you anything, the shock absorbers are well and truly blown,  and have been a long time. There's two sets of valves in them. One set for fast bumps (like washboard roads or seams in concrete) and one for slow. Its generally the high speed valving that not only wears out faster, but is what's responsible for ride quality and stopping wheels from "chattering". The low speed  contributes more to the "feel". So, struts cannot be ruled out. Is the car sitting level? Any one corner appearing lower than before? You may have a broken spring, possibly when the suspension was loaded back down with the vehicle's weight coming off the lift. Not the shop's fault--just shitty luck if this turns out to be the case.

No, they aren't equal, but you are looking for total cost. So you want something like y*_total_* = y*_1_* + y*_2_*. So you need to modify your equations so that only every even item costs 13 and only every odd item costs 26. Can you think of a way to do this?
This is great news! Bernie honestly has very little chance of winning the nomination, but if he gives Hillary a real fight he'll drive her to the left from the center right she occupies now. 
Is that for a single adult??I just checked the MIT living wage calculator for Denton Co. Tx. and a single adult was $9.29. An adult with 2 children was 	$23.07.Queens NY came in at $12.75 for single adult and $32.30 for adult w/2 children.
Highly intriguing, informative content. And I know the line between a robot and a hillbilly bicycle is pretty thin, but sometimes it really must be drawn. What we have here is the opposite of a robot on multiple levels.  Wait, are the farmers robots? 
I volunteered at a local library helping kids K-12 with their homework for a few hours at a time. Was a really great experience, and would definitely recommend seeing if that's an option near you.
It's not meant to be taken literal it was a joke name I thought of to make a point, the name is immaterial. Of course I didn't mean he was actually a communist, just like John Key isn't literally a Donkey.

My favorite is through sun room window to smoke off generator, if you encounter someone who likes to play B from generator it throws them off their game easily 
I think your probably referring about Cromwell's. To get there, drive to Kahala, and park on Kulamanu Street. **DO NOT PARK ON Kulamanu PL. You will get ticketed by HPD.Walk down the street to the beach access, and once you go down the stairs, make an immediate left. There is an addition set of concrete stairs around the perimeter of the homes. Once you get to the end of the concrete path, walk on the rocks around the point. You probably want to make sure you go at low tide. Hope that helps.Search on Google Maps:21.256497, -157.795145
I'd be polite too if I were a criminal in an imposed state of heightened security. Don't be fooled, the gangs want unrest and distrust in the government. It fuels their business and reinforces their power grip on the community.
I hope not. We really need anyone but O-linemen to go haha. If they don't pick Williams there has to be some character stuff or an injury we don't know about. Either that or the plot to Draft Day is real and teams really do panic for no reason and Williams is that Bo guy.
Plus, *most* of the character of your bittering hops will simply boil away. So using a neutral hop, like Magnum or Warrior makes sense.You will get some character from bittering with Chinook (pine) or Columbus (dank), but the delicate orange/grapefruit character of Amarillo will simply be gone after a full boil.

these NFL pundits have no respect or decorum. On the NFL's live stream guy's like, "this is a good setup and pick for the Raiders, I can't believe I'm saying that!"Are you serious? Good god do they pick these idiots off the streets?
Odd. I thought we were talking about religion, not a race. Thank you for the assumption and the enlightening way you explained your position. I learned a lot!
No it's not insane. Think about all the customers that would come in to watch the fight at BWW. Now think of all the lost potential revenue HBO would lose because of that.They are about maximizing profits.
From the beginning my husband has had two name suggestions: Charles and George. I have had countless suggestions shot down and vetoed34 weeks later and the baby is going to be named George. What can I say, he can argue a good point.
Can you point to a specific example?I'm not trying to be a dick here, it's just that in my experience I cannot offhand think of an occasion where Moore uses rape in a story that doesn't seem to have a very specific purpose in mind. Now, granted, sometimes it's not a *great* purpose; the aforementioned Pollyanna/not-so-immaculate conception gag in *League of Extraordinary Gentlemen* was a few lengths beyond tongue-in-cheek. But I can't think of a single instance where he just "threw it in." So if you can come up with an example, I'd be grateful.
When I spent 15 million coins and didn't pack a TOTY player. Taught me a very valuable lesson. Just buy the fucking players you want. Another time was when I spent more coins trying to pack SIF neymar than what he was worth at the time. Same thing.
As long as that doesn't come up, everything is all good. I don't really talk abortion with anyone because people are soo sensitive on the topic but if I wanted to I could talk to my brother, we share the same views.

It is known that you panned on having Jesse killed off early in the show but Aaron was such a good actor you changed your mind. What were some of the plans going forward without Jesse? He is such a major character it's hard to imagine the show without him. And how were you planning to kill him off?
Really, y'all? He was just mentioning a concern and what he thinks about it. Dude was just trying to be helpful. And, walking in groups IS statistically safer and recommend in many areas after dark. He wasn't victim blaming as the title of the post would suggest.
Would make for a good poke OoS. Would be safer than most options for when an opponent crosses your shield up. More range than grab, so for when people space outside shield grab range. Overall is a great poke, so it would be nice just to anti-air people or to poke them out if they're going deep to try to punish a roll/wavedash OoS away.
I'm glad to have seen some similar opinions to my own floating around. Everyone always say vote with your wallet, but its always structured as "vote with your wallet, but if you vote different to me you're a god damn fool". The chroma's are $4 worth of RP or something? That's the same price as my morning coffee...that is such a low price barrier. Peoples perspective is obviously different to mine on how cheap that is.
They've both had a lot of work done on their faces in recent years.I still find Nikki to be the ugly twin though, no matter how great a body she has.
This is a situation of making a mountain out of a mole hill. This isn't a problem. This isn't a concern. Offer to treat if she says thanks then you pay if she says she wants to split it then split it.
Interesting, you really have no control over what applications get passed through in 6.5 you'll see a folder with all local applications.  I never got my poc past that point since the client requirements could not be met. In my 7.6 environment you can "publish" a local application and only that app.  Works very well. 
There is an uncountable amount of gummy bears. You eat one. Does the fact there there are an unlimited amount mean you didn't eat that one? Stupid fucking logic
Did you use Butt Paste?! I've been using the regular version (16% zinc oxide) at night to help with my skin during allergy seasons (it's extremely dry, bumpy and irritated) and I think it's soothed my somewhat. Makes me look horrifying, though :P
Honestly this is basically what happened to me. After the account wipe I lost all motivation to play the game. I told myself I would give the new mode a try, I did and I don't like it at all. Unfortunately I have a month or so of premium remaining but idk, that's what you get with early access games. 
He does, and I do really like him, even as he slips further and further into senility... Manfra aint bad either. Honestly, at this point it's only Hunter I don't like, now that I've fully come around on Thorne. 
I dont think gtao uses even this amount of data. 1 Mbit is much more than most people think. Sure, when you download games, or video in hd, its fucking bad, but for a game i think its quite enough.
He has no excuses, no chance. The class was based of 4 tests and that's all. You either pass them or fail them. I started off pretty roughly and that killed me. 
....and as if to prove my point...The Federalist LOL.   If you go any further to the right, you'd fall over the edge of your flat earth.

Nothing has been confirmed. Though some people think it might make sense to remove glamors from chronomancers. Invis is already kind of niche so it might make sense as the defining aspect of core mes.Pure speculation though.
I'm giving it until mid-late 2016. The Smash line will wrap up by the end of 2015 (with the exception of DLC characters), and once that's done, Nintendo's just going to shit out wave after wave of Mario reposes because hey, fuck all those other IPs, right? As a result, Mario characters will pile up on store shelves until stores have no choice but to clearance them out, refusing to order future waves and effectively killing the line.
I wonder if you'd agree that the cops who can't seem to keep their hands to themselves, and who so often choose solidarity with their coworkers over standing up for citizens, should be described as thugs, or if name calling should limited to window breakers.
I think it looks cool as heck. If it actually can map the rooms and make the ghosts move inside the parameters of it will be mind blowing.Going to follow this one and just maybe support them if they get close.
They're all great, so no worries. I spent A LOT of time in Renegade when I first got my PSP. It was also the first game I took online, and even joined a clan for. That game definitely holds memories for me. :D
&gt; it was built to see how close you got to a perfect circle.And what better way to show that than percentage? 100% = perfect circle, 0% = not even a circle. How does an arbitrary integer achieve that?
Nope, I was fine with 8GB when I moved to 1440p. I got another 8 because I'm a tab fiend, like to have everything open at once, and do the odd bit of video editing.
Yeah I'm really enjoying all the animations and niceties of Naut but I'm used to RES night mode, finding it hard to get used to bright blinding white everywhere. Hopefully the creator sees this and it isn't too difficult to make a dark version, I'm sure it would be quite popular.
&gt; Nihilism and existentialism are separate things though.;.. True, unless you combine the two and arrive at Existential Nihilism... Thats where I landed, its a nice blend of optimism, pessimism, and cynicism to remain neutral and realistic about things with a healthy dose of skepticism.
I definitely think it's based on their mental state, since once they lose focus, they wouldn't be able to properly reconstruct a body. Needing to rush a reformation might be too easy to mess up in a battle.That or maybe some evil Gems were messing with their regeneration for evil purposes or something, though I feel like that would be too predictable.
Last night I had a dream that my next door neighbor and I were going to play "sniper". But we had real hunting rifles with scopes and we're trying to shoot each other in the head. I remember thinking that I'd never hear the shot and while sneaking through the bush to get closer to his house I decided that this game was "stupid". Somehow I managed to flag him down. We had a good laugh about it; although at some point he turned into a woman in her mid-50's. Needless to say I am damn tired today. 
I gont have a GearVR but I got to swap between the GearVR and DK2 versions of *Crystal Rift* at a recent event and with the various factors taken into consideration, it seemed like much better overall image quality on the mobile.
I have thought about this, and I decided I would run the app and just be aware of the very small possibility that someone might listen in.   Most of my conversations aren't that interesting to outsiders and it wouldn't be that serious if they were overheard.    If it is a conversation that would absolutely ruin your life if someone heard it, it might be best to turn the phones off.  You might also reconsider whether or not that is a good conversation to be having at all.  
Of course now you will be prepared for the experience, which means you won't be surprised by this whole new level of rudeness they dish out. Spoiler alert! LOL
Don't you worry, I'm sure she'll be fine! My pup had an issue with his knee when he was young. Took him in for surgery and all that's left is a badass scar. He's super spry still almost eight years later!
I find that it's JFA's own structure that leads to some of these problems. Cases 1, 2 and 3, as I see it, are all building up to the the fourth case, which is where the majority of the character development happens. As a result, so much of the game just feels like a chore. (Contrast with the first game, where Edgeworth's character development happens during the 3rd case)

i really don't know anybody i can speak to the school counselors are always busy, and even if they weren't i'm too scared to talk them i had a vary bad experience with former counselors, where i nearly got removed from my home because of a misunderstanding, and i got removed from the normal lunch waves in elementary due to bullying and sat in they're office. recently i found out that the counselor who watched me was a pedophile, guess that explains his absence during the time when he was to watch me. what i'm trying to say is i'm scared that something worse will happen if i do go, as well as i'm shy i don't talk much to any one and my reaction to authority figures is to clam silence and look at the ground when i'm scared. and i dont even know if i could afford a therapist or psychologist.sorry for the text wall :l
I don't think it's so much the act of criticism, but rather the methods of criticism that are being mocked. People aren't criticizing, they're making demands, some of which you wouldn't normally ask of people. In a lot of cases it's unreasonable.

There's a lot to be said for this approach.  Addiction thrives in darkness &amp; secrecy. Shining a light on addictive thoughts takes away their ability to fester.

You're right, but you just confirmed that some beauty ideals aren't set in stone (or genetics) and change over time. Many men claim that the current female beauty ideal - very slim, toned-looking women with 18-20% body fat, huge boobs and curvy ass is universal and men are genetically wired to be most attracted to it. Of course there are things like hip-to-waist ratio which was proved to be pretty much universal, but other things probably aren't.
The way I understand it is that there's some sort of "jew lineage", where even if you aren't a part of the religion, you have some magic "jew" qualifier that gets passed along.It's still a belief, just a separate one from the main religion.

&gt; Nunca pude ver que en Android se escuche la musica de la forma en que se escucha en iOS.La calidad de audio no tiene nada que ver con el sistema operativo. Sino con el hardware (sobre todo el DAC) del teléfono, y con los auriculares.Varios teléfonos Samsung (incluso los viejos como el s1 o el s3) usan el mismo DAC que algunos iPod, y si los usas con buenos auriculares no vas a tener ninguna queja sobre la calidad del audio.Ojo no te digo que te compres un S3 porque hoy en día ese teléfono es una mierda. Solo te digo que no descartes Android porque es una generalización y el sistema no influye en nada en la calidad del audio.

Batman in the comic was always relatively dark.  The TV show was the exception, and influenced the comics briefly.  The campiness of the TV show was due to the times and the sort of TV that was popular back then.

Yeah, I think he means that the "secret project" he's working on in this video is for something else, and he'll be back to making JonTron episodes soon.
Yeah I guarantee he's discussing Red Octobers. Relatively speaking a lot of Rick's popular shoes are somewhat within the realm of reason for pricing. If I saw a kid with a pair of Geo's the thought of them being fake wouldn't even cross my mind unless it was blatantly off

There is a key difference in that United only once won the league by a big (more than 10 points) margin pre-Roman. Bayern have won by 20+ point margins often. It really is not comparable, as Bayern dominate, while United was masters of getting those extra points needed in close matches.
So first the raw data:We've got about 41.7 million black people, and we can assume half are male, and you're a man above the age of 18, average life span being 78 years = 76.9% of them are men, so 16,037,820 black men in america.Immigrant population is 38,517,234.Pet population is 95.6 million cats, 83.3 million dogs, so roughly 178,900,000 pets.Now if you were to take a picture of every single pet, immigrant and black man individually, that would be 233,455,054 pictures shot. I have no clue what the bullets have to do with it.
I don't hate lounge, I'm actually on reddit to talk about trading, not to trade (still trying lmao, but never traded something from reddit).

I don't understand why you talk about hating lounge, I'm talking about hate but about a minority of people trying to sell for 100$ 0.05$ pattern as some are now trying to sell for 5 K 0.05€ items.   **edit:** not even hating these guys, just laughing when I see some   I just told you that you were talking (kidding, obviously) about giving an idea to lounge while lounge already know that and while reddit is already quite making fun of people who try to sell 0.05$ items for 100$ because special pattern.

*Nor chuckles as she walks up to the bar counter and orders a glass of whiskey.* "Thanks. A lot of kids hang out here, and I'm pretty sure a couple work here too..." *She muses as she leans on the bartop.* "I tried getting a job here, but they haven't gotten back to me yet." *Nor's voice is lowered so the bartender doesn't hear her as she's retrieving her drink.*
My local Yodel driver is ace, she even rings me when she's 10 mins away to make sure I'm home so I can pop out from work/have her drop it at reception if i can't sneak out. 
&gt; I don't have a desire to spend multiple hours correcting bullshit.You can add to the bullshit, but I don't have the time to correct you, sorry.  I hope that you eventually do some research and use sources that aren't considered to be openly biased.  Like the Supreme Courts of the US and Canada.I also like how "I quoted something elsewhere" is your defense.
Guess so.  Cooper is definitely amazing but I don't think I could pass on the opportunity to have a defense like that with Rivers and Manning in my division.
2000/14Not sure what to say about why I'm attracted to vaporwave. I don't think I could explain why I like any other genre either, or why I find starburst the most delicious candy on Earth(closely followed by Skittles). It's just good.
Man I wish I had the amount of free time it would take to fuck around on reddit all day just waiting to downvote entire threads. Being a stay-at-home parent must be awesome! ...Y'know, except for the "parent" part.
You probably have a lot less stress overseas.  Also everyone treats you differently.  At least that is how I felt living in Asia.  Try to learn the language and you get called genius constantly.Could also be diet / exercise / sleep aka health.  For me in China all the buildings were new and dust free - I have a terrible dust allergy (migraines) which always made me feel horrible without really knowing why.   I moved back to the US and everywhere you go is full of dust in old buildings with old hvac systems lacking filtration.  Such a huge difference in mood when you are always just a little sick.
Enjoying the new airplane damage modeling. I'm unsure about the BR's of the new British planes; it will be interesting to see how they turn out once they start showing up in more matches.
What.  What. I don't even know where to begin.  First, where did you find that cpu?   Second, your graphics card is a much lower range than the rest of your parts. Just, ah, keep that in mind.  A 1 tb ssd is a bit overkill, but live your dreams. Your motherboard already has a wired network adaptor.  And ah, get windows 8 for $12 instead of 7 for 200
Here's the trick.   Avoid going right after class because that's when everyone else is going.  Do something else or eat for like 20-30 mins then go to the well because that's about when people start their last sets.
Honestly, this makes me like Giannis more.  One of those times where you wished it was hockey* and you could just let them fight and get it over with. *Giannis would be horrible at hockey.
It is!So I watch movies, play games, and listen to music. And in my head, I try to make them all cross over and tell one big, terrible story that I would never, ever write down, but keeps me entertained. 
&gt; The difference is that the police are an institution in place in society. If you can't trust 100% of the police force to act respectfully and have the best intentions for the citizens they serve in mind, than the institution has failed.Oh. With your logic you shouldn't trust *any* organization that does not have a 100% perfect record? So you shouldn't trust the FDA, SEC, IRS, ATF, FBI, or the Secret Service. After all, as a group they are not 100% trustworthy as there have been incidents of malfeasance in the past. How is this any different from the logic that racists use? 
I assumed the De Gea situation was tied into this. The deal would be to bargain Bale's price down through an exchange with DDG. Thus, opening up for other signings like Depay, Gundogan, Clyne, &amp; Hummels.

There is a reason he is now helping people like crazy. It's not because he just randomly grew a care for forgien people who were disadvantaged. It's because once your making that kind of money, what is really the point? When you're at the top of the game with no real goal but hoarding more cash and the years start to tick by and your just not really accomplishing anything, that can be something very troubling to people who have their whole lives been intellcually savy and vigerously challenged to claw their way to the top. 
&gt; Next guest? We haven't even had our first one yet...Ah, I meant /u/Fallen_Glory.&gt;It's not really relevant to us until we get the podcast up and running which is when we can actually do something with the list.I see.  It's just that I feel like the main cast is kinda small, and I'm not really sure how to put this- it seems like your podcasts aren't busy enough, if you know what I mean.  Like the cast members don't have enough presence.

I'll check them out. Google Play has Sartre's book available. Which Camus book would you recommend?BTW, if you happen to visit Los Angeles area, LMK. I'd be down for an afternoon where we can grab some food, talk and maybe burn a couple grams.
Up vote to you for finding this and sharing. I read the thread on se7sins and couldn't believe the immature comments. Reminded me why I don't visit se7sins unless I have to. Are you sure it won't work better with 2 cars?  I'm about to try it and want to give myself any advantage towards success. 
What they could do is drop her base damage values and up her ratios. Do the same for her stun -- make it 0.5 seconds with an extra 0.25 seconds per 100AP (numbers pulled out of my ass). That gives her a much greater need for AP, which she won't get a lot of as support. It would also nerf her early game as a solo laner, but she's already safe enough that I don't think it would hurt her too much.

&gt; Firstly, I didn't think I was defending a positionMy point is we can't predict what they look like because everything we know is tainted by human experience. Your point is we can and we can make predictions outside of our existence. That is a position. &gt; Secondly, when you picked out what I thought was the least relevant portion of my responseYour response claims that we have the ability to predict the unfathomable. That is in itself an illogical statement. Unfathomable means beyond on the spectrum rational thought. It means we are incapable of understanding it. The second you say "it's unfathomable" you cannot make any claims beyond that and argue they are rational. It's like saying "The mystery of god is unfathomable......but Jesus is the way"The precursor to the Jesus statement makes the Jesus statement void. 
Going to law school is also time out of the job market. There are invisible costs in terms of otherwise gaining job experience and a network for any other field.
Though I appreciate the writer trying to give insight into the character, I feel like it would be much better suited if an explanation was in the game.With Calpernia you can at least learn about her motivations and such, but with Samson it's basically a giant leap from DA:2 to DA:I with no information.I would have loved to see this in maybe codex entries scattered throughout parts of the world.But it is nice to have one way or another.
what is your foreign policy philosophy and what do you see Americans role in the world is? What do you see what the role of the bill of rights in the modern era, speifly the 2nd 4th and 10th?
Basically the 3d models of the mercs update slow and don't accurately show where someone is looking so when the spy baits a medic into meleeing them they juke to the other side and stab what seems to be their face, however in reality the player was already looking to his saw to melee the spy. Basically it's baiting and prediction and people who don't know better than to melee spies.
I don't know for sure if the numbers in the "HP" series were reference to the amount of cylinders of the engine, but so far it looks like the case, HP2 with the 2-cylinders boxer engine and the HP4 with the 4-cylinders inline engine.  If BMW does ever make another HP bike and name it "HP6", and it has 6-cylinders for the engine then yeah I think we can assume the numbering system is in reference to the cylinder count.
Every is acting surprised but the predictions threads all had Coop going to Oakland and Raiders fans excited about it. Now it's happened y'all are all freakin out 
Most of the higher up British officers were wondering why there soldiers used so many condoms. Turns out when it rained and got all muddy they put it over there barrels so mud wont get in, and they could shoot if they wanted. My source is only from a fire arms instructor named Peter. So yeah, could be taken with a grain of salt. Fucking Peter...
Not sure why you would spend 200 to get a perfect grade and not paint it but from what I hear, it's a solid kit. There's a few [reviews](http://youtu.be/qTHlkoFHNBA) on YouTube. That one I linked looked like it was unpainted. 
Totally up to you but there are ultra marathoners and an Australian football team, not to mention other athletes, that are exclusively keto. Why wouldn't you be able to stay on keto?
I have a very similar dream in my parents house. Before the split up we had all moved into my grandparents house when my grandma passed. Once we moved in there I would always have dreams about a secret room that everyone always forgot about. It has s really long hallway a bathroom and a room that only had a old couch, a crib, and a really old TV. Somehow I knew that it was related to my grandma but I never really knew why.

Most games actually pause, or you can pause them before you tab. (Skyrim seems to keep playing background sound loops, tho, which is kind of annoying, and there was one other I forget which kept running unless you paused it first.)Can you actually have multiple games in progress at the same time on an XBONE or PS4? Because if not, yeah, Windows handles suspend also. :-)
[Here's a Lobos run that will satisfy OP's request.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PdmJw6-usQ)1 Stamina run, so no rolling, backstepping, sprinting, or blocking anything worse than a feather.
We use two medium size Sherpa bags for vet transport. One cat is 11 pounds and the other is 13. They have a decent amount of space to move around in the bag, especially when they compact in one side when they get scared. Both of them can fit in one bag alright if they want to, although I think they'd get uncomfortable squeezed together after a little bit. They take up most of the floor space when they're both in there. I haven't looked in a long time, but back when we bought our bags, they made one with roll down flaps to cover the mesh windows and help keep the animal calmer. We would've got that one if we thought we were going to be traveling anywhere with them where there was a lot of activity or people. We're happy with ours though. They're four years old and look new. Very tough and well made. My cats freak out when they go outside, but I've never worried they'll be able to get out of their bags.

I don't get it. Was the dad mad that he thought you texted anons mom with that text on purpose, or the fact that you were going to say that to his daughter. Just a bit confused.
Agreed. The depth of the forehead wrinkles and shine of the skin makes it almost cartoony. Not a huge deal, but sometimes you wonder why they make certain artistic decisions.
couple approaches here.1.a. ortho to close gaps, with the aim of bridge work to replace canines. this may not be optimal considering all teeth involved (from photos) look to be healthy. this would be unnecessarily be cutting healthy teeth. alternatively1.b. Ortho with the goal of making room for implant based cuspids. going to be really tricky placement though. may need a consultation with oral surgeon.2 Snap-on smile. temporarily this could work until you gather the finances to explore either of the ortho based options. i am afraid those may be the only good way to care for your smile long term.3 turn 4 teeth into 6 with cosmetic bridgework. this is a very very long shot; a lot of labs won't be capable of such a thing in a wax up. this again may involve too much tooth cutting to work. 4 lingual space fill with composite. this may make those gaps close but may also give the illusion of teeth that are very wide. over all i recommend exploring options 1a/b and 2. 
&gt; I feel like I had to ... I mean, I had to ... It's all good ... It's just, things have changed ... I don't need it ... I perfectly fine ... I don't count this ... Just a simple stress relieverSorry man, but this is all *really* defensive language. I'm not trying to be overly critical. You claim that there's "not a bit of guilt" but the way you're talking about it says otherwise.Relapsing can happen, there's no shame in it. This is a difficult thing to do. But trying to brush it off like this and pretend it doesn't matter is going to be a problem if you're really serious about this. If you're not, that's cool too. Everyone's entitled to walk their own path, but it's very important to be honest with yourself.
Most of the emotional pain in my life is a result of my job, honestly. It puts a lot of stress into everything.I was struggling and distressed a few months ago when I was in a triad. I was never jealous of them or their fun, but very few of the group interactions worked well for me and I never had enough free time to build a good one-on-one with the newer person. It was really emotionally draining being with two extroverts at. the same time, especially when most of the time we had to spend was at big weekend social events with lots of people after being flat out at work all week (already draining!) It's cut pretty much all of my stress since I broke up with the newer person, we function much better as a metamour team and it's much much less draining.
I have the same set. It's basically indestructible as long as you don't do anything dumb with it. My wife scorched the hell out of the 12" pan and made it worse by putting it in the oven on the self-cleaning cycle. But, some Barkeeper's Friend and a couple hours brought it back to almost new.

Use them to find the flight that looks best, then go to the airline site to book. If you're lucky it may appear there too. If not, I would not take the chance.I never book on the discount sites as I always do as above. Usually I can get the same deal with the airline.
Last question, I assume the curved path on the outer casing leading to the top left of the charge board (above the barrel connector) is for the LED. Is there a solid light guide sealing it closed? At this location, it seems very susceptible to leaking juice ingress that could damage the board.
Yeah, it was recently. I read the headline but not the study. I'm going to go and find it now, because people don't look particularly happy there when I go back to visit family.
Ffs, Id be facepalming so hardEDIT: Also good on you for realizing that being risk free isnt what makes this game fun, you should go find a group of people to go blow up other people with
The Capitals to win their first cup, and anyone playing the Blackhawks.I don't particularly want the Rangers to win, but I feel like they have the best chance of taking down whatever team comes out of the West.
Well it's not a gender issue if it's simply violence. If it's targeted at them specifically due to their gender it is a gender issue. And honestly, do some serious research about the wage gap. I can find very, very few instances of people doing the same job for the same length of time with different wages to women.
I'm looking for a home! Currently in a random Alliance but would love to join a proper one. My name is Based Benjen (not sure if there is a space or not I can't get on at the moment because I'm at work). I have 12 or 14 champions I think, I've only had this game for like 3 days so I'm relatively new but I'll definitely keep playing. My PI score or whatever it is is only around 3000 I think.
What are everyone's thoughts on Ryback? I've been enjoying him since he returned earlier in the year and think he has improved a lot. Would love to hear what everyone thinks about him right now, not necessarily the feud he's in, but just Ryback as a whole currently.
Is avoiding alcohol in general a good practice, or is it mainly for those with sensitivities to it? I've been researching sunscreens recently, and was wondering about this.
It did cause inflation though. It flooded the market with supplies and killed demand. I have $6M on my RS3 account which I recently learned is not very much at all. Alchables alone caused that?See my comments about bones in the original post.

Something similar happens in the restrooms in my university's library.There's three stalls and two urinals, and every single time I go in there, there's someone in the *middle* stall. Meaning that if I have to take a crap, I have to sit next to this asshole regardless of which stall I choose. Not only that, but he's being incredibly quiet, which just creeps me out.
I have to say I'm glad this bill got squashed.  It wasn't one bill, but two.  While I do like both the bills compressed into this one bill, it should be two seperate bills.  We need to have alimony reform.  We also need 50/50 shared custody.  Tacking custody onto an alimony bill or alimony reform onto a custody bill makes it a very bad law to pass.
HEY you know what's gross? emptying your dog's anal glands... yeah that was... fun...Also, I went to the heart institute today and am officially carrying around a little holter monitor for the next 2 weeks.

Yes, I am going to edit and make a distinction in my post, as the wording is a bit misleading. It is a bit odd that they didn't make the warlock look like Osiris, if in fact that is what they wanted to do. It would seem that the middle armor is not Osiris, but could be another deity, or not even a deity!
My freshman year of high school, a coupon of challenged kids (one was born with fetal alcohol syndrome, the other I'm not sure, but wasn't any better off) ran into the kind of ongoing conflict that high school boys get into, and started fighting every day in PE. The teacher who taught PE that period ran my study hall period, and more than once mentioned he had to "referee retard boxing" later that day.
Yeah this is another example of how the USA's Christian background bleeds into every aspect of public life here. Back in the day, male sexuality was just as demonized as female sexuality. You would be publicly punished in Puritan America for having premarital sex whether you were male or female. I think in the more distant past though, there were stricter punishments for women than men. The reason Christian gender roles are so divided and strict isn't just because of a vague concept of sexism--gender roles exist for ritual purposes in the Abrahamic religions. Many atheists were raised by Christians, or have a Christian history in their family, as the separation of Church and State didn't completely exist in early American history. Atheists, pagans, other religions are all influenced by our Puritan background. 
I get more and more outraged and sick when I read the news about Baltimore every day. I don't want to hear a thing from a bleeding heart liberals mouth about by this. Behavior of absolute idiots. 
Sounds like it was a *Terry* stop, since in OP's story, the cop wasn't doing anything about the trespassing (i.e. he wasn't being arrested for it). The cop had reasonable suspicion of illegal activity, so he briefly detained OP to question him. And I don't see why the logic of *Rodriguez* wouldn't apply to a *Terry* stop of a guy sitting in a car. Whether its a "traffic stop" shouldn't matter.
&gt; emboliAh, thanks for explaining it for me. TIL. I had thought it was the tibial hooks that getting caught in the molt that kept them from molting. 
I just downloaded a save game.I did read about another solution:When using Michael to blow up the door of the train, don't select the sticky, but hold a pistol/machine gun and just press G to quick-throw it.If you do that, it shouldn't crash when switching back to Michael again, later on (or so I've heard, I haven't tried it myself). 
well in cs they have team stickers which you can put on your guns, and in dota you can buy team pennants and item sets which are "endorsed" by a team/player. I would LOVE something like team stickers in tf2

I used to teach many years ago at a small state college in a large state.One of the other faculty members - I'll call him Dick - actually wrote a memorandum to a counselor calling one of his students a "chuckle headed n*****".  Dick used the actual N-Word in the memo.  (I hate that word so I will not write it out.)The rest of us thought Dick would be fired for certain.  Nope.He was given a slap on the wrist.  A year or two later he retired and was given a laudatory write-up in the local paper.    Very discouraging.

Officially put me on the Reggie McKenzie has no fucking clue what he is doing train. His only good draft picks were Khalil Mack which fell in his lap (Like Leo did but he fucking blew it) and TJ Carrie who just pure luck considering he can't even draft decent CBs in the first round (See: DJ Hayden)

For starters, i really like the cut and sew technique style that your taking, it looks dope and it separates you from other starting brands.Both pieces are very simple yet effective, if the quality is good I would strongly consider buying the second piece.All in all I really dig the direction your taking. If i had any criticism at all it would be that you shouldn't be afraid to experiment, but from the looks of things, you're doing great.I look forward to seeing the rest of the pieces. 
I don't know how it is in other states, but in Indiana when you go to vote the first option it gives you is to simply select a political party.  Makes me sick, because every time I've voted and they had this option I see a lot of people walk up to the machine and walk out 5 seconds later.
If you are into Top Flite, play the Gamer line. They are 3-piece and affordable $20-25 per dozen. Losing 2-4 balls isn't bad. You should probably go through that many balls even if you don't lose them (scuffs, cuts, etc.) At $1.66 per ball, that's only adding ~$5 per round vs ~$2 for what you are playing or $12 for ProV1. But if you are a single digit, keep playing what you are playing. If you want to drop a few more shots, buy a better ball.

When I started I struggled to reach kd better than 0.5Gradually got betterNow my kd oscillate between 1.5 and 3.0I've seen too many players below 1 kd ragequitting to agree with you. There is no fun in being killed over and over by a person more experienced. 
Watch opponents core for signs of tensing, any slight turn away or step back on dominant foot. Make sure you land the first hit and make it count. Follow up on any weakness shown. Strike to the gut or groin should make them hunch over leaving their head vulnerable. Never take your eyes off of them even if you've "won". There is no honor, people will hit you when your back is turned especially if you just embarrassed them.
Yeah, your Mimzee is too high, it should be your Siya/Argaiv*.8, and keep your Argaiv the same level as Siya. Your Lib, Mammon, and Mimzee should all be the same level using the formula I mentioned above. Your doing good with keeping up with your Solomon and Morg.I was here not too long ago and once you get all your gilds on Sam you should be able to go to about 1000 in 20-45 mins depending on how active you are.

I am actually having the exact same problems, except I have ran all the diagnostic tests and nothing has been found. My computer also runs fine when I start it in safe boot but if I try to regular start it, it's a mess and will freeze. 
I thought this would be a problem at my current employer but I actually don't mind at all. We can go up to 10 days negative on PTO so I don't have to worry about keeping some in the bank for getting sick. We can work from home whenever which covers most sickness without taking PTO, and the employer provides short term disability so if you you would never need more than 5 days PTO for sickness.PTO including sick days can be bad but it doesn't ahve to be depending on the policies around it.
Don't think this qualifies. Biceps daily visible. Lacks bullfrog chin/throat. Think this is honestly just bad angle/motion with unflattering clothes. I'm the last one to justify/sympathize, but it appears human to me.

You could compare rich pricks who think injustice is the public being able to walk on the beach in front of their 8th vacation home vs poor people who'd just like to eat and protect their kids. One of those I couldn't care less about, the other actually deserves attention. That doesn't really dispute your statement, but what I'm saying is the definition of "injustice" is relevant based on class for a number of things for a number of people.
I imagine this could only be the work of the person who scripted Squire.  Like, automating to demonstrate it's power at the sacrifice of someone's clicks.
Come on man... This post is one down from the one we're in now...https://www.reddit.com/r/gloving/comments/349999/the_open_source_microlight_osm_kickstarter_is_on/
Does Brazil have universal healthcare?  How would a homeless person pay for their treatment?    I'm an American. Here the hospitals would basically do the bare minimum to make sure you're not going to die in the next few days, then discharge you and hound you for the rest of your life for payment. 
Hey, former area director for outdoor skills at a Boy Scout camp in California here. Are you allowed to take things in your pockets? I.e  a Knife. If I were you, I'd grab a tarp, paracord, a space blanket(if it's cold), a few sources for fire making(lighters are the way to go), maybe a few water bottles and a metal container to boil some water to make a cup of pine needle tea.With a short trip like that, I'd bring the tarp and rope for a quick no fuss shelter (you could even forego the rope and just wrap yourself in the tarp and it'd be probably be plenty warm.) Edit: I didn't think of it at the time, but definitely bring a flashlight.
My best advice would be to keep the idea of the corny joke, its like a math formula.  But if you keep a pen and paper or phone with you at all times, take what you observe or think of and then jot down every possible punchline or angle that makes it unique and funny.
But, he is a smart competent mother fucker? He hasn't always gotten what he deserves, but I feel that's on its way. I think Jorah is gonna die, not this season, but eventually and when he does Tyrion will be Dany's Hand.
that was the whole point of these.  Collectors items because they couldn't sell the whiskey enough.  I see these containers at Goodwill all the time.  
I won't be surprised when SC's persistent universe is released late next year or early 2017 nearly feature complete, and FDev hasn't released walking around stations yet."Sure go on about alpha but I'm gonna act like the game isn't in alpha"
Well sometimes they do match. Nina is probably one of the most congenial queens to ever be on the show, both on all stars and her season and was listed as MC if i remember correctly.
Hello bud,I'm interested to trying out beta for 3 reasons:1. I like to try different builds (2much rips on HC) and usually take the time to full clear maps and explore it all. I also loot every rares for currency lolol.2. At this moment I've tons of free time and I invest them on playing PoE and drums IRL.3. Honestly, I consider myself a competitive player, so I like to tryhard most of the time.
I was in an open relationship. This girl knew I'd fucked other girls. She even told me about 1 dude. Then I found out she lied about another. Why!??? I was still hurt like I'd been cheated on. Weird. 
Yeah I don't see what the problem with him running as democrat is. This is a move which is sure to increase his exposure and his chances of winning. Nobody pays attention to independents or GP candidates which is why this strategy makes sense. So what does it matter which party he's running as? 
He's asking about how big the difference in pay is between a first round and say a fifth or sixth round player. There is a clear answer to that, and it's about 5 million or so. 
Not really a fight IMO. I admit Nvidia making G-sync most likely led to amd turning freesync into an open technology that will be the display port standard. But that's the thing, Nvidia made something proprietary, AMD made something that does the same thing that will become the standard in a year or two that everybody will have the ability to use for next to no cost. Same thing with OpenGL and Cuda cores. OpenGL is open to everything, and is also becoming the more used option.Mantle was also open to be used by nvidia, It gave really good performance increases. Nvidia didn't want it. AMD gave out the source code, and we have the vulkan API and DX12 improvements from it. It baffles me that nvidia has so much market share with the way they've been acting lately, all of the above and the 3.5gb 970 issue. We should be supporting the developers who are open with everything, not closed. It will be way worse if AMD goes out of business and nvidia has a total monopoly. 
So far, nothing. But PC launch had the same problems thanks to item duping. ZOS could easily enforce a gold limit on the transfer, or just sit back and see how it unfolds before taking action.
Both are indeed steel nibbed. The Young Profit has a nib that looks very similar to the Sailor 1911Standard nib (except no 14k written on it) and writes similarly as well, just slightly more rigid. 
And you've never considered the possibility that he made that up? For god's sake, you were in elementary school. And who says 'like talking to a shoe' other than a small child?
eh? you can turn data off completely and all the tracking apps I've used will work fine like that. only needed for uploading, which I do when back on WiFi 
I usually don't post things or reply much on reddit, but... IMO The entire english dub destroys the original japanese. Shulk in particular has a lot more emotional range than jap Shulk. Adam's voice lent itself to many scenes throughout the game and his delivery of the battle lines are in particular really good.

&gt;They'd have to deal with the International  and domestic community who are sick of wars in the middle east. Did I claim otherwise?  If I did, obviously I misspoke, because I agree with that statement.  It sounds to me that you are actually *defending* the idea that the US *isn't* doing this as part of a plan to fuck shit up.&gt;&gt;they wouldn't need to follow around merchant ships to do it.  Stop being a retard.&gt;Such a persuasive argument... Am I wrong?
Usually there is no distinct signage. Asian (Korean) markets I've been to were small and niche places, and they weren't concerned with bullshit Tumblr privilege arguments. They were concerned with selling Korean goods to people.There was very little "western" goods except for produce and maybe some candy stuff. Mochi is delicious by the way.
well of course.  standard workflow management and all that.I was just trying to communicate as best I could what I perceived as a disconnect between the requests and reasons the community had for the standalone client and the response from you guys as devs.  The community views the standalone client as a huge factor in growing the community.  From the developers we hear a desire to grow the community sooner than later but create a standalone client later than sooner, which seem directly at odds with each other.
Interesting thought experiment.  Two possible scenarios spring to mind. 1. If the mirrors are connected i.e. by being in a room connected by a floor, then the momentum of the whole room will go back and forth in equal and opposite momentum to the photon. Each time the photon hits one wall, the entire room system will change in momentum the opposite amount. 2. If the mirrors are not connected, they will be pushed further and further apart with greater and greater momentums as the light bounces but their momentums will be opposite and so momentum is conserved.  Nice try but you will not disprove Newton on Reddit. 
It's definitely a light material, but it pretty good quality. I've had my jersey for a few years now and it's held up well. Here's a photo of the stars on the front which are the same as the ones on the sleeves. http://imgur.com/mjv1yZI
Mayweather is a despicable piece of shit, so not rooting for him.But also not interested enough to actually watch this fight like I would've been five or six years ago.
I would try the panaracer pasela in 700x38. I use them on my touring bike and they handle gravel roads without a problem. They come in a tour-guard model which has good flat protection. I also have a pair in 700x32 but I like the cushier ride of wider tires. 
I know I'll get a lot of hate for this, but they don't seem like natural human beings to me. Being gay isn't how people are supposed to be. It's just disgusting in my opinion. 
I've been paying particular attention to the rumors that the Saints are interested in Petty, because I'm a huge Saints fan.  So I'll be on the edge of my seat for that pick.I think you're right about Hager, he should go high.  Especially for a team that needs a natural leader on the defensive side of the ball.
I agree with this very much. We're progressive populists, right? The whole cult of personality thing is kind of at odds with that.That said, I've decided to start calling myself a Socialist and owning it,   since the right wing likes to use that word as an epithet. I look forward to at one point saying to someone I know well: "Sir, you're *talking to* a Socialist!"
What do you think Brazil or other countries should do to prevent scenarios like this? More and better healthcare? Or something more specific, suited to the scenario there?
It makes the difference especially if you are transporting a lot and having more than just your keyboard in your backpack. the 1up has a special liner on the outside that prevents any type of fluid to get into the inside and all three are very "cozy" on the inside. 
The thing to do now, is ask him to recognize the lesson, and ask how she, the Mom, can help him "turn this frown, upside down."He is a hero.  He is a young man, looking for success.  He's looking in the wrong places right now.   And it's up to Mom to say, but here's what you can also do...You can talk to other kids your age, about what made you throw rocks, and go off on the Police.Was it right?  Was it wrong, Why?How can YOU make this perceived injustice better?  Fighting on the street?  Or speaking against the problem in the various municipalities that exist.Become a neighborhood leader in a positive way, and watch it grow into a chance at becoming the President of the United of America.
Remember right after Obama was elected in November of 2008 and the whole country was going - C'mon, DO STUFF!  People forget how bad things were.  And it would be a few more months before he was even inaugurated.  
of course not. It can however be given as *part* of the diet, as long as its lean.  The rest of the diet should be other protiens and veggies.I can see now that I neglected to mention that.
Dafuq? Thanks for the in depth analysis, but this was like 4 months ago now and no one thinks worse of me for doing so. It's not like I'm hated in this community because I stepped down from reading donations at AGDQ this year when I was told to step down by staff members lmao
Why warn you? It's extra trivial lore if you're into that. It reminds you that you have your creepy soul powers and doesn't break the fourth wall outside. It's obvious they serve no utility after your first couple encounters with them.
I used to chat with people a lot when they had the IM function. Had lots of fun with that, but they all chickened out when it came to meeting up and wanted to 'talk more' to be comfortable. I dismissed them like the scared chickens they were. 
I honestly don't know if 'curing' it for a week would do anything... my rosin doesn't sit around for long ;) but I can say that I have found some strains of bud just produce shatter-like rosin, while other strains produce really oily, sticky stuff. 
I'm pretty dissapointed with comments on here..people seem to be missing the point...What people should be taking away from this graph is that there is WAYYYYY more fat people than gay people. Christians consider homosexuality a sin AND gluttony.  Should lead to the questions-So why aren't christians combatting gluttony?
I'd never heard of barrel racing before, and only figured out what it meant upon reading her bio a few weeks into the season. She mentions riding horses in it, and that's when it clicked.
If he can build a wall on the Mexican border and make Mexico pay for it, he's a genius and deserves to be president even for this one thing. All this Trump hate but Hillary is running? Hillary is the devil in flesh form.
I knew today would be like this. So many Babcock posts. There's no secret message behind these words. Their meaning is written right there in between the quotation marks. The one thing that concerns me is that what he said is right. Nyquist and Tatar will be 30 goal scorers, possibly 40, Sheahan is putting up numbers better than Pavel in his first two years, so you can't count him out, and DeKeyser and Ouellet will both be top 4 defenceman, possibly top 2, and Saint Petr is our future starter, yet outside of that, we have Mantha, Larkin, bottom 6 guys like Glendening and Ferraro, and that's about it.
There are no serious third party candidates because too many citizens dismiss them without any consideration.  Without a third party in 1992 there would have been no Bill Clinton presidency at all.  The third party that you claim is irrelevant received 19 million votes. Clinton and Bush received 44/39 million respectively.  The third party was VERY serious. 
I can relate. Apathy is the destroyer of progress. At least that's how I see it. That's the feeling I get. It's not a feeling of sadness. It's *nothing*. The feeling of emptiness and life's borders growing beyond your grasp. I 'cure' my feeling of inadequacy with alcohol (like right now). Is this depression? I really don't know.When it comes to motivation, I've found that no one will give it to you, but yourself. I hate that fact, but that's what it seems like. I have little of it myself, but the little I muster up for the absolutely essential shit all comes from myself. Use it sparingly and use it wisely.(I have no idea if this is really helpful. It's my first time posting on this sub-reddit.)
I'm inclined to agree. Much as I love the extra mature, it's too strong and generally too greasy when in a recipe.Just have it with some decent pickles. 
I love the game so much I had to track down the Wii version and the red controller. I got up to the Bionis Leg in two sittings / 10 hours, but I'm too far ahead on the 3DS version. When I complete the game (later this year?) I'll replay it on console, on a huge TV, before X comes out, it'll be brilliant. Wonder if I'll have time for anything else?
What I normally hear in my head when I use the bathroom. " Wow, you are peeing loudly... like that's fine... but this *is* really loud. What if everyone is judging you right now... they wouldn't right? Try peeing on the side so it is quiet... It's still loud! WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG. OH MY GOD THIS IS LOUD. THIS IS SO LOUD...did you just fart a little?"
While we're at editing dota_english.txt, you people might as well want to change each Dagon's name to their level (i.e. "Dagon" -&gt; "Dagon Lvl.2"), so when someone alt click it you'll know which level their Dagon is at. Same for Necronomicon/Diffusal Blade.  Edit: [Here's my version of it](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B38EXhAb9PX6NHdybXZDVlZmeDQ/view?usp=sharing).  Changes from /u/365365's version:  * Dagon, Necronomicon, and Diffusal Blade have their levels shown (in roman numbers)* Necronomicon Warrior/Archer renamed to Necro Warrior/Archer II/III because the full name + level made the text on their names too small.
MM is thrown into a fire. He doesn't have any help. Forced to do too much and doesn't have the career he could have had in other spots. Frankly I'm just pissed he's a Titan. Any other team would of been cool.
Definitely not looking to make moves to specifically get him. I was just saying if the opportunity arises it would be a solid pick. He only had one ankle injury. Although Shanahan does like to run, we wont be neglecting Julio and the gang. I believe the passing game here is more developed than Gurley ever experienced in Athens and he won't be the only guy running the ball. Devonta will be sharing the load if he turns out to be half the RB we think he is. He was also playing against guys that will be/are already making tackles in the NFL this year, including Dante Fowler, Beasley and Clowney, so I think he can take the hits. 
You could message Bret on the Adept Press board (there's an email button underneath his name in this topic: http://indie-rpgs.com/adept/index.php?topic=108.0) or on Story Games (where he's Bret_Gillan).I'd be very interested to know where Final Girl is at. It was part of a Bundle of Holding in 2013, and seemed to still be available in early Jan 2014.
You're doing everything right and I'm full agreement with everything you're doing. This Minecraft book would not be a good addition since it ignores large portions of the Bible, sugar-coating the stories and emphasizing the need of a god to be good. Does that help contrast what you're doing and the point of this book?
Have you looked into any Aerie bandeau's? Also, check out [Coobies](http://www.shopcoobie.com/)! You are within the size range, and they make super cute bras and bandeau's that are amazing when they fit you. I don't fit into the range unfortunately, but we sell a bunch at the bra boutique I work at! Also, maybe head over to /r/ABraThatFits to both make sure that you are in the correct bra size, and also for other bandeau suggestions. They are a great community :)
Oh I'm a fan of Paul Blart Mall Cop! You don't have to worry about that, I work in the mall/retail so its hard for that kind of stuff to fly past me ;)
A friend of mine said that .22 was hard to find as well. I don't get it, just about every store that could sell it has tons of it where I live. Is it really so rare?
The grievance process is about procedural fairness and not about assuaging hurts.  There's a world of difference between my boss is a dick and the system has failed.  Redressing a PER is an extremely difficult task - and unless this is going to get you promoted, rarely worth the effort.  You have to go through line by line of which bubble you want moved and provide proof that your performance (or potential) was at that level during the entire reporting period.  That's not just one or two examples.  We're talking a dozen or more, verified by a reliable source.As for the charge, I can't remember if a person on PATA is subject to the Code of Service Discipline.  However, disciplinary action isn't the only avenue your chain of command has as they can initiate administrative action.  Fortunately, you're versed in the grievance process.As for assisting member, don't sit around and wait.  Take the online training and assist yourself however much you can.
No... It *is* 1. It's equal to 1. If I have 0.9999, you can add one more 9 and make it closer to 1. This happens with any finite number of digits. There can't really be a number that is the closest to 1 without being it, because you can *always* add another digit... Unless you have infinitely repeating digits. 0.999... = 1.

I think you will find it difficult to prove that people have a disdain against the idea of paid mods,  while seperating that from their criticisms, and the modders themselves are probably not numerous enough to dissaude valve without support. 
You know what? I agree that this was the wrong move. But you know what? This is the pick we've made, and being negative about it isn't gonna help anything. There's a reason those guys who know much more about the Titans and Mariota than you and I picked him, so I'm putting my trust in them. If it doesn't work out? We move on. It's okay to be upset by the pick, but we have to get behind them now. If you don't, you're not a true fan. 
Why is Amari Cooper a bad pick for the Raiders?Edit: I ask because in the r/nfl Raiders 4th pick thread they are making it seem as if the raiders dropped the ball. Went all Al Davis and got him just because of his speed.  
How is it even possible they think they can get away with this?Home/personal service, I understand (to a point..) but how can a business possibly run on 3mb...that is just insane.
He's read White Fang! But that is a great suggestion. He read it in Spanish as a kid. He's also read Hemingway (in Spanish), Catch-22 , lots of Poe. These are great suggestions everyone. Thank you!

Hey, can a Gator fan talk me up/sell me on Fowler? Hitched my ride on the Leonard Williams/Trade Down post and I'm now trying to talk myself back from the cliff.
This. The game needs more variety like crazy from where it currently stands, and the beast mechanic would have helped a lot. I hope they add in a true beast mode and beast related covenants to fix this later, like Dark Souls 2 is currently fixing the degradability bug problem and how it has made the torch mechanic necessary with Scholar of the First Sin's release.
Yes, but that doesn't apply to most simple aesthetic mods. There are a LOT of aesthetic additions that a lot of people want which shouldn't be too hard to add to the game at all. It's ridiculous that it took until 1.7.2 to add stained glass with how often it was requested.
That shouldn't be necessary.  It looks like a regular packet storm, and just the traffic from one machine should be enough to figure out what's going on.
I feel like they should have gone more in the direction that ant man did.  That opinion is just based on trailers of course, but Ant-man seems to have a little humor and embrace the general comic-ness of the story.  Maybe this will be lighter than it seems, but it looks pretty serious
It's wrapped with a bunch of lead wire, medium-quick strips should do the trick. Then again, I've never fished one particularly so I can't be positive 
Even better yet, why not just have these ward skins usable whenever? I find it to be incredible bad taste for Riot to even be considering selling a ward skin that people who pay money to use cannot use whenever they want. Doesnt matter what split who is in, I should be able to support my team whenever I wish. In what other actual sport does this happen, in which a fan cannot wear and showoff their favorite team in any sport related function/event/setting? Thats like telling an 81' Lakers Fan they can't wear an 81' Lakers hat they purchased years ago at a current lakers game. Rito pls
Post another of how the handle connects to the pan. That will help identify it better.  Also, it doesn't look like there is, but if there is no 4 or 5 digit mold number right in the center of the bottom of the pan you can be pretty sure it's pre-1900's 
Stock DRE really had to be abused to make parts blow up, it didn't do much with standard settings.  I changed the config parameters to make it harder, so a LEO re-entry was fine but a direct re-entry from higher orbit would burn up.Re-entry should be hard, but I wouldn't say it's brutal.  You can still bring a Mk1 pod in from LEO without a heat shield, so that's a pretty good balance.  Bigger,heavier craft will need a shield.
There aren't really quick ways to get magic xp before 70. Before 55 just spam camelot teleport or superheat.  At 55+ you could high alch and firebolt iron/steel dragons at the same time (you cast high alch in between firebolts).  Bring multiple extended antifire pots (12 min per dose), antidragon shield, some food (just in case), smoke staff, chaos gauntlets (family crest requires 59 magic but it's boostable), the best magic gear you have and of course tons of runes / alchables.If you don't care about cost you can bury the bones so you don't have to bank, you'll be able to stay there for a very long time. You still get some decent alchables, clues, some stackable stuff to sell, sometimes dragon legs/skirt and of course a chance to get draconic visage.Downside is that it requires full attention and it's not *that* much faster than just high alching.
Worker's councils, direct democracy, voluntary industry federations and cooperatives.  There have been many political science theories put forth on how workers may exercise direct control over their workplaces in a non-coercive way.  Emma Goldman, Mikail Bakunin, and many other libertarian socialists have contributed lots of reading material on the subject of anarchism, and especially anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism (which for all intents and purposes is pretty much the same thing).We libsocs disagree with a violent government being capable of implementing socialism that would work for the masses.  Governments, like capitalism, only manage to do one thing really well.  Grab more power and more influence over people until they become so bloated they kill themselves and another takes its place.  Thus, I advocate statelessness for the freedom, and socialism to make sure nobody gets left behind in life.
This semester I just helped a classmate with her homework, and she didn't know how to do this either. What blows my mind is that it would have been required knowledge for a previous class. With homework assignments. I more or less gathered she just googled solutions to the problems assigned from the book and copy/pasted them.Then again, I occasionally hear about people applying for programming jobs that can't do a simple fizzbuzz problem despite having a college degree. Makes me feel a little bit better about my job prospects despite the fact that I'm only getting an AS CS degree instead of a four year CS degree.

Blue is really good for counterspells not really good at creature beatdown like you want to do. You might want to consider switching to a different colour (like black, red, or green) ; but if you want to make this deck better you should take out all of those artifacts, they aren't very good. Take out solemn offering as well and move it to sideboard. Try to get some more counterspells. Two more things to consider: try to lower your mana curve (esentially your spells cost a lot of mana) it is good to have a good curve in magic, you will probably die before you get to cast most of those 5-6 mana spells. Also try to tail your lands to the type of mana in your deck. That website has a pie chart that says a majority of your deck is blue, but you have a 50/50 split of lands. Also picking up some cheap duel lands like guildgates or tranquil cove will help a lot. Good luck.

Absolutely, if I sound short/impatient it's my own frustration with my situation coming through, nothing personal.I actually feel like I have more energy if I skip the med for a few days, but if I go more than 2 days or so I start getting withdrawal symptoms (brain shocks, irritibility, anxiety attacks, etc)But if, for example, I'm planning a special date night with my girlfriend I might skip a dose or two of the med, that way I am more energetic and having fun that night, and my sex drive will also be higher afterward.Same if I'm going on vacation. I recently went to a concert, I skipped two doses the day before and the day of the concert, so I could actually feel some emotion from the music, rather than just stand there and worry about my feet hurting.

Gems conquer worlds with adequate supplies of gems that they can turn into Gem gems; once a Gem's gem has been produced in a Kindergarten, it projects its Gem's body using the magical gem properties it is imbued with during the Gems' gem-making process.
I moved cities when my dad changed jobs when I was 5, this school in the new city had a really thorough testing process for kids looking to join. I got a really bad score on their process. They told my parents (in front of me) that I was too stupid for 1st grade and maybe some other school would take me in for UKG (Upper-KinderGarten, that's the year before 1st grade here in India). My dad pulled some strings and got me into that school (and in 1st grade), I was always among the top 10 out of roughly 250-300 students for the next 12 years in that school, and when leaving school I had by far the highest score on college admission tests. And I was a semi-slacker all through school, so its not like I overcame my lack of skill by hardwork or anything. Goes to show how even so called "scientific" and complex tests are bullshit.
When I was student-teaching, I sat in on a meeting with 4-5 senior teachers, and during a conversation about special education students, the senior most teacher said that these students need to get home on their "tard cart."
I still say they should have gotten Tebow.  Not even because he would have been a good player, but ticket sales.  At least they would have sold tickets.  Gotta be decent at something.  
Hey transtrendiest,Yeah, I never got on with the drugs either. Still struggle with the anxiety and panic attacks, but not to the same degree as you it sounds like.What do you feel brings on the attacks or perhaps makes them worse? Mine was always relationships, still does in fact. Joshy
No, if every product I. America raised their prices by 1 cent for every dollar, that is a 1% cost increase overalls. That means that everyone would  spent 1% more in expenses. Minimum wage employees, however, have their income increased by 50%. That is a 49% gain for them.  Everyone else would see inflation of 1%.That's ok because the increases pay to minimum wage employees goes right back into the economy. The increase in business and prices will let the companies pay the minimum wage increase. 
If he's smart he'll release it as a series of novellas. On kindle store standard price for 5-15k words is 2.99. Standard price for a novel it only a couple buck more. 
Thanks for the detailed response.I have one last question that maybe you can answer.I see a lot of headphone "Amps" and I'm wondering what might be a good one? Maybe one that isn't crazy expensive.Also, is the purpose of a headphone amp simply to amplify sound, or does it serve another/other purpose(s).Either way, thanks for answering all my questions, even if they were dumb.Cheers!
its true but the thing is in situations like these, its extremely hard to get something new to catch on. Steamrep (and other sites with alot of say like backpack.tf) thrive on their popularity and reputation as the "go to." Its an extremely hard thing to get over because it required cooperation from a majority of people, and the majority of people generally dont care at all/dont see the need for change. Best we can realistically hope for is benevolent and caring moderators who actively work to make positive change from the inside.
Oh, o "trabalho" a mais que tens é mínimo xDO streaming na minha opinião é, por enquanto, muito inferior devido à sua qualidade ser inconstante por estar dependente de várias coisas. Mas cada um é que sabe o que o satisfaz! Não tens de quê ;)
You know I always thought these were stupid and you'd have to be an idiot to buy these "quick slim" products but then I realized that these are exactly the products that appeal to fat people. I bet the people behind these products are a bunch of shitlords laughing at the money they're making off of the fatties. 
I've added like 5 people and they haven't responded for a couple hours. All the competent sellers use BTC or Skrill, I guess.I'm not out here to make a profit, so paying an extra few dollars to get shit quicker is fine by me.
Ha, I got the opposite when I was in the US:"Oh! You're from England/New Zealand!""Nope! Australia!""are you sure?/really?" *suspicious look*I figured it's because I don't speak like crocodile dundee (most of us don't...)
I'm 35, and I definitely find that using cannabis is a million times a healthier and happier practice than guzzling coffee. I think if you start working with psychedelics it's easier to see how destructive coffee is on mood and health and clarity of consciousness.
That sounds exactly like my job, I'm also 18 and have been here nearly nine months.My suggestion: Buy comfortable shoes and whatnot, it's only been two shifts as you said, the first month is the hardest on your body, after that you get accustomed to it.
Not really. Every time I drive an automatic it's just... boring. At least flappy paddles give you something to do. And are faster. And make downshifting SO FUN. Almost as fun as the perfect heel-toe downshift. 
If you just want Rippers, why not do subquest runs? Break claws and end via subquest is much faster than a full hunt, especially if you have one or more HBGs.
No. Just because there were more than a few movies on top of the series, and I watched them all together. So the line of exactly how many movies I watched is blurry.I watched everything I could find at the time.Honestly, I can't really remember the ending, but I do remember a lot of stuff leading up to it.
I don't know the full details since I left way before this happened but a teacher tried to sexually assault a girl and said "go and tell. No one will believe you because I'm a teacher and you're s student". He ended up going to jail because it spanned over 14 years in other schools and maybe as his previous job at a priest.I didn't get a nice vibe from him in my year 7 R.E class either since he would separate boys and girls because of "puberty" and only speak to the girls in the class.

I do not have anything to say about the fight as I know very, very little about weapons and struggle to visualize their motions. Hand-to-hand is my thing.The monologue is...ugh. And why did One-Ear not rush Ormal whilst he was drinking; he likely would have choked or tried not to, making him vulnerable either way. That is what I - or one of my more devious characters - would have done, part of the reason why I am not fond of the monologue. If anything, it would be a subtle way to point out how silly villainy villain speeches are and if the story did not reveal it or hint at it up until then, it would reveal something more dangerous about One-Ear. It is one thing to be brutal in self-defense. It is another to force someone in a losing position. Again, this is not a critique on how the fight played out - not my preferred method of combat and I simply don't know enough to comment on it - just how it started.
I would love to get Animal Crossing so I can give to my sister. She just got a 3DS and it would be nice to play Animal Crossing with her and have fun since it's her first handheld. 
Sorta depends upon whether we're also respecting a woman's desire not to taste her own ejaculate or juices because they're hers or not without then saying that she doesn't deserve cunnilingus, I should think.
Well Williams is a DT so it wouldn't really affect Mack, plus WR is a deep position in this draft, coulda grabbed a talented player later on, not as good as Cooper obviously,  but still a talent. 
It's a cool idea :) What sort of skill range are you looking for in mentors/newbies? As a diamond player, I can't give tip-top advice, but I'm also pretty far from a new player.
I'm surprised they haven't fixed a majority of the cheater problems yet. Speedhacking and teleporting should be VERY easy to fix. ESP etc might be a bit harder, but those are less annoying... 
Pretend to be a fan? As opposed to what, not being a fan? How the fuck does not cheering and being deflated when your team gets utterly shit on somehow take away your fan card? Fuck that shit.
I see you listen to NPR! Heard that bullshit on my way to work this morning. Also heard AAs attempting to justify that behavior. Those people were given a pass (not called out) by NPR.   Funny how different standards apply to dumb rednecks who want to wave the confederate battle flag. Those crackers get called out!  BOTH groups should be called out, because they're both racist.
No sympathy for anyone who DUI's. The fact he has 6 kids just makes me sick even more. He'll now go to prison for years, his self-admitted useless wife will now have no money and 6 mouths to feed, and here is this sperg giving gaffots "advice" lol. Yeah no shit, dickhead. Most non-morons learnt not to drink and drive before they were 10, so you're hardly fucking Moses.Good luck indeed, cunt.
Increase the camera speed a little bit and get used to pressing f1 (or change to a button that u like) to center it back on your hero. But yea, you get used to it with some time.Read some of the guides posted by intolerable-bot :)ps: new BIG patch just arrived so there are many new things, but you can get the basic from the guides still.
Motherfuckers. Fucking assholes with their flash bang grenade. If that happened to one of my girls, I would raise all hell on the cops responsible. I don't live in the US, but from all the stories I've been reading over the last year or so, it seems like many US police officers are complete fucktards.
eh no matter how much i like a game it never affects how much i enjoy others, sure last week my hype was so high i was just pacing around my house cause i literally couldn't do anything without thinking about witcher 3, but thankfully i got over it, as for what i'm doing to pass the time i'm currently rewatching doctor who while playing through dragon age inquisition then i'll probably play through dragon age origins again......then i have no clue what i'm gonna do after that :(
seriously. we freed up a lot of money by trading Latos and not paying Simon, but we kept Cozart (after last season, that seemed like a horrible thing to do), signed Byrd who was only beginning to look promising, and got Gregg who costs 3x's what LeCure cost for the same horseshit.Worst off-season moves in the league. To make it worse we are probably going to lose Cueto and Chapman at the end of this year while we keep paying Bailey to be hurt and/or pitch like a AAA starter.I'm really unhappy with the management.
If we don't take him i will be pissed. Scot does say BPA so why not best pick in draft. I am all for more picks but Leonard is the way to goEdit: wtf it shows we took sheriff on the Redskins web site
This! Adopting children from foster care is great not only for the children, but for the family. Working in the counseling field, I'm frequently interacting with foster care children and agencies. I did a lot of volunteer work with this demographic as an undergraduate, too. There are hundreds of thousands of these children in need of permanent placement. Also, if you choose to go this route, some states will even help financially (though it is often less than if you're a foster parent, in the long term, adopting these children changes lives).Without adoption, many of these children will struggle without the help and stability they need. This in turn leads to some of these children winding up in jail, on drugs, et cetera. This creates a cycle that often leads to more children in foster care. 
I think that it's too much stuff, the self summary is long!It's kind of a double-edge sword b/c it shows you are taking this quite serious but I think 1-2 paragraphs at a max is enoughYou have a lot of puns and little jab jokes which I think make your profile shine and I can see that side of your personality through that text without you saying "I'm funny!" Swell job, and goodluck!
&gt; They will only respond in kind if what we are selling isn't desirable or doesn't add value.International politics is very much tit for tat, and to think that other countries would allow us to block their imports without any kind of response is naive. 
Mine said that too.  I took it to mean that if I activated and used 10 mins.  I couldn't make any calls, if I tried, I received Iwireless inviting me to sign up.
None! I follow the rule of "Keep one, best type possible, of every RS unit".I wish I can pull Lava soon. I pulled Loch, Edea, Kikuri and sefia earlier. They're 6* and ready.
I, honestly, try and not download each and every one of these for future amusement. There are so many, and I don't need THAT many Spuran Spuran gifs/pics.Then I realise how silly I am, and that I definitely DO need everything Spuran Spuran I can get my hands on.
Well, thats one of the few edits he's done that isnt just a text response so.. I guess by default it's one of his funniest.I guess? Eh, anyway, I dont think Kevin's a bad guy going from the episodes of Steam Train he was in, but he's not the best editor or comedian.Sorry Im not trying to derail this topic.
I like Beasley but I doubt we grab him unless we trade down. He's a great pass rusher but he's certainly not a run stopper or a hulkish OLB. One dimensional players stars usually draft in mid to late first. I see bears going White or big time Dline/Olb with a WR in the 2nd. Curveball pick would be Scheriffedit: just as I post this Scheriff is gone
My Dad cut the power cord to our TV off and wired on a new cord with a plug that wouldn't fit the outlet. He had an adapter that he would plug in for one hour a day so we could watch the CBS evening news and one other half hour of our choice.We figured out where to get out own adapter so he wired it so he could turn the power on and off with a key.
OP, have you experimented with using pet pheromones? I've used Feliway with good results with my kitty who had a ton of anxiety, there appears to be an equivalent product for dogs but I have no idea how well it might work. Might be worth trying though, sounds like your pup has some rough times.http://www.vetinfo.com/feliway-for-dogs.html
I should win them because I was there when they fell in love. She was a Yoga instructor, he was the loner-maintenance guy, I was the overweight guy failing to do a sleeping crane position. They bonded over my cries of pain, the soundtrack to which their hearts soared. Please, let them join me in my home where they can laugh at me forever, together evermore.
&gt; Walter started out with an ambition to benefit his family when he realized his death will be imminent due to cancer.Not sure if you finished the whole series yet? (spoilers...)But didn't Walt essentially admit in the end, he never really did it for his family, even in the beginning and that he really did it all for himself?
Hey haven't finished it yet been stuck with college work but I'm at the second H scene is where I stopped so I'm guessing I'm getting close to the ending, but when I do I shall inform you of my opinions immediately :D
I don't mind the cream colour itself, it goes well with maroon. But you can't have light coloured pants. It just looked terrible and out of place in today's NHL.
The issue is, if you're going to have minimal spend on players, looking for promising youngsters and unknown bargains, then you have to ensure the administrative and managerial side of the club are run perfectly. On top of this, you need a manager who can work with limited funds, and who knows how to be an effectual motivator and 'Head Coach'. Pardew and Carver just aren't that sort of coach and that's hurting the club badly. 
This reminds me of how some people reacted after Obama was first inaugurated. I remember storeowners insisting they could no longer make a profit, protesters chanting about how they couldn't handle their higher taxes - and the guy had done *literally nothing*. He couldn't have done the stuff they were claiming in that timeframe even if he intended to.
Because Bray haunting someone as a protector and corrupting his message (Bo!) would be too complex a story. Likelywise with Bo becoming a disciple but also keeping a warped version of his attitude. 
So far I have two 5* - Ramagos and Wind Sky Dancer.I was going to 5* Raog next, but I also have Wind Samurai which has some great new abilities. Other possibilities: Water Raksasa and Shannon (Wind Pixie). http://i.imgur.com/KGl2Bog.pngThoughts? Thank you in advance, you guys are awesome!

cwc was never a fur iirc, but i could guarantee he's probably reminiscing over '90s sonic porn.ffs, he made some questionable stuff in his sonichu series
Webspinners for midrange hunter, Dark Cultists for priests, Death's Bite for warrior, Void Caller for warlock, Zombie Chow, Haunted Creeper, Mad Scientist for face hunter and mages, Unstable Ghoul (thanks to Grim Patron), Nerubian Eggs and Kel'Thuzad are all still played.
IIRC there were issues with the SBMM video he did. The main thing was he used like 15 people total to get his info which is no where near a big enough sample size to say anything. 
Mothers in the US - Is it normal to give birth in this position? Like with the stirrups and the whole area on show? It's just so very different to how I gave birth in Australia and New Zealand.  
Is this homework?  If so, you should really show an attempt.  I'll only give hints.Dictionaries are unordered, so you can't even begin to speak about the middle of something that has no order.  You need to get the values in some type of container that is ordered, such as a list, and then you need to sort that container, and then you need to find the index of the middle element of that container and use it to access the corresponding value.
Yes. It was chosen on purpose for balance; the goal being ensuring that more often than not, AI countries can replicate vaguely-historical results unless players intervene. Its not perfect, but far better than in EU3. Ottomans expand more than they used to, Spain and Russia typically form, as of next patch we'll see the Netherlands forming more often, etc. The idea is to balance the initial setup to lessen the odds of everything going utterly crazy, while leaving some room open for ahistorical options. 
Completely agree with the music part. Before my root canal I made up a playlist full of songs with heavy bass and drums and it really helped drown out the drill! Be sure to ask your dentist if they're ok with you listening to music/having headphones on since it can be hard to communicate with you at times if you are.

I switch people I care about to firefox on their personal computers. If it's a family laptop or it's somebody I don't want to bother troubleshooting with in the future I give them Chrome. Especially if kids are going to use it too.I gave an arguably [technologically] moronic individual firefox+noscript+adblock. I set up his favourite sites on noscript, and he hasn't touched it since. He's on my Good Boy list. Everything updates itself and I don't have to worry about anything.

I think the main issue is that the rented servers have to offer something the normal servers do not, and we have very little control over what we can change on the rented servers. Hence if you're running a normal game mode server with a slight tweak like increased tickets or hardcore, your server falls into the majority of rented servers and is likely not going to be seen. The only ones I see filling up consistently are servers with unique (but sadly unenforceable) rulesets such as "pistols only", "melee only" or hotwire boosting servers. Unless you are renting a server for your platoon to host matches on or running a boosting server, there aren't many reasons your average player would seek out a rented server to play on :(
No, it is not okay to have sexual relations with an individual when they are so drunk that they cannot comprehend if their actions are right or wrong; they are unable to consent to what is being done. 
Type one diabetes is a rough thing for a kid to deal with, and we could be pretty close to solving the issue for future kids that shouldn't have to deal with it.JDRF.ORG is a cool place to look at for more info/to donate if you decide to.

Depends on how you write the letter. If you want to be nice, write the shortest letter possible while getting the point across. Thank her for letting you shadow her and let her know you are also interested in neurology and ask if she has any colleages that wouldn't mind having a premed shadow them. 
Do you view that also as a benefit when writing for Better Call Saul? Meaning, since you already understand Bob's style you can revolve the story around his characters?
Just saw the movie, overall very good, but had one big problem with it.Caleb's first meeting with Ava, he clearly witnesses the cracked glass on the enclosure, that looks like it was punched or damaged by some impact from the inside. An inquisitive person's immediate questions: "How did this happen?" "Did you do this?" "Are you confined here?" "Are you unhappy about that?"And the immediate question for Nathan: "OK, so you're claiming this is an AI. It's claiming to be sentient and wants release. What gives you to the right to confine it?"It just seems as though *right off the bat* there is clear evidence of a violent act, and clear moral issues with the confinement. The fact that this apparently just sails over Caleb's head at the beginning really bumped me. Is he just supposed to be dumb and have not considered the moral ramifications of anything here?
Dude. At your age it might not seem like a good thing to be "babyfaced" but in a few years women will be hunting you down. I think your chin looks like any other chin ;) I used to hate having a butt chin but I think I've finally grown into it.
I like his face and his beard is obscuring it. Also he has sacrificed flow length for additional beard as if he's only allowed so much hair and I'm just not okay with this at all. 
I have some high level alts that are pretty rushed in lower leagues (bronze) just living on collectors. Now they are getting smashed on defense because only other high level bases are landing on them. I think that getting rid of the th out for protection thing is what they are going for.
I still say, Williams is more athletic, but Fowler is the better fit for our scheme.  He's played the LEO position in college (shoot you can line him up all over the defensive line).  He's familiar with our formations.  Looking forward to seeing what he can do for us next year! Duuuuuuuvalllll!
No one does. Not even white people because that would make them racist. If they did, they'd realize that they're the worlds minority and losing their nations to hoards of immigrants and "minorities" that are outnumbering and outbreeding them in their own cities and soon to be countries.Bye bye you racist oppressors.
Oh you poor solitary creature, I know how it feels to be alone! But we can make babies, beautiful, sword-wielding, immortal babies, built to live in this new world. We can *combine* our talents.

I will find you, love, I hear you have headed East, so there, I will go!
Not an MRA, but I am a film lover. The premise is that it measures "female presence in film." There are multiple examples showing that it does not. Silence of the Lambs is about a woman making her way in a male lead industry, and it only just nearly passes if at all.The original Star Wars movies fail, the prequels (AOTC) pass. Five will get you 20 that Lea is seen as the better female character. By men and women.It just doesn't work except to find out which movies pass the Bechdel Test. Plus, as someone below points out, it comes from a fucking comic strip.
Tournament is for all skill levels! I encourage anyone and everyone wanting to play to just sign up and try it out :) really get a feel for what comp titanfall is like
Irish: Fled famine, came to the U.S., worked primarily as servants.  Chinese: Worked for a pittance, lived in hovels and viewed as inferiors and a threat to U.S. culture.  Mexicans: Work for low wages in jobs 'no one else wants', treated with scorn and in some cases cause legitimate problems with businesses (that can't hire non-illegals for the same wages that competing companies pay illegals. Always under threat of deportation.)  Oppressed Bohemians, Germans etc. moved to the U.S. and established themselves.  Japanese were interned in WWII.  Even the crazy Mormons run their own state.Nigs gonna nig and the only Oktoberfest you'll find in black areas occurs when liquor stores are robbed.
Your argument about no one recruiting NA players is pretty pointless. CN and KR don't need NA players. They don't need EU players either. NA simply saves the EU players that have promise if a horrible fate of playing in EU games where everything is just a bloodbath with very limited strategy. And EU and NA being on the same level? Good joke man, maybe last season. One deluded EU fan boys even think EU could stand up to any other region. 
Just want to say that all the information so far has been absolutely phenomenal.  I'll be putting an application with Bridgeway.  Here's to hoping for smooth sailing as far as moving.Thanks again /r/acadiana!
Northern canada. It's a fucked up scene with the natives here. They like blow when they can afford it, but it's expensive here. They mostly prefer to drink over any other intoxicant.Meth is actually really uncommon here. There is one guy who has a constant personal supply, and some of us that know where to get things have tracked it down from out of town sources, but other than that there's not much at all.
A bit late to the party, but;When I was on a 6 month binge, I didn't have the horrible burning, itching, nausea (still nausea, but not where it consumes your comeup ), or feelings of regret, ect. I don't know what I did, other than a lot of other drugs and I was probably horribly malnurished. But I also took it, then me and some friends would walk, and come up before we reached our destination. Then we'd walk and skateboard  (not easy, takes practice) until we were sober. Best trips ever. The comeups during this period were the most introspective. 
Ive had this problem before, even more recently ive had a girl make me seem the man she would marry, then she cheats on me and moves on. Not all women are terrible or just full of shit but honestly i just feel thats the case for you. "lets be still be friends" never talks to you or attempts to. "its not you its me" no they obiviously are just trying to be nice so they can spare your feelings knowing youre a good person and their about to go do something shitty like date someone two days later. But besides all of these facts id urge you to not give up! You sound like a good guy with a good heart but just getting screwed comes with relationships. Youll find the right one, one day, and when you do youll know. Keep your head up!
I'd definitely be cool with Sunday at 9, just make sure if there's going to be a significant number of people that not everyone parks in the lot I suggested.  For instance, I'll go ahead and plan on parking slightly farther away from the entrance to leave room for others in that lot.  There's a picnic table in that parking lot, I can meet people there OR if we wanted to be super safe everyone could cross the bridge into Turkey Mountain individually and we meet on the other side of it at 9.  
Bus mechanic here. The reason why your bus driver seems bad at driving that bus is because they aren't used to the braking system.From Mercedes to MAN to Volvo and all in between, new and old, have different systems of braking.Z cams, s cams, EBS, hydraulic over air, straight air, 10 bar, 8 bar, 7 bar.Fleets keep buses that are 20 years old and also brand new ones side by side.Bus drivers don't drive the same bus every day, but they drive every day.And then on the way home they drove their own cars.It really takes a while To get used to the different brakes, and they usually have 2 or 4 hours with each bus.
I'm 142 pounds, 5'6" (Yep, 3 pounds down from lowering my daily intake and removing midnight snacks) and I have low stamina.I was also born with a heart condition though. My point is, I'm extremely unlucky.
I read the article, thanks.  I don't think you're crazy, and they are clearly doing what they can to catch the guys.  But yes, you're right.  He used poorly chosen words and made him look kind of shitty.  
Well I mean...PG is a by-product of crude oil processing. Something weird being in the manufacturing process isn't necessarily cause for concern.I've been informed by many qualified folks that several nicotine extraction methods require fermentation, and diacetyl is produced during fermentation. Because of this, some nic bases can test positive for diacetyl depending on the extraction method used. I'm academically curious about the process used in Zemea production and how diacetyl is avoided.
just remember to be patient - as the tarantula will take up to a week or so to come out. Next tip: try to turn off the lights and let her come out when she thinks it's safe. Take a flashlight and be quiet when you check on her so you don't scare her and she flees back in her hide. Try using a tweezer to get the small container out as she will not like it to lose her old "home"...

During one of my placements, where my job was to observe the teacher and occasionally teach a part of a lesson, I had a pig for a teacher. The first day he admitted to me how much he hates teaching at the school but made too much to make it worth trying to get a job at a different school. During home room a girl walked in wearing a dress with an underwater scene(fish, coral, etc.) the first thing out of his mouth was "I didn't know they let whores at the aquarium." She asks if he called her a whore and he replies "no, I just didn't know they were allowed at the aquarium." You could fee the awkwardness in the air. It was great. 
I had late lunch all through high school. People would laugh at me for literally running to be among the first in line. But I did it because I always wanted to eat. What is wrong about wanting to eat?What kills me is how concerned the school system where I work is about elementary school kids eating. Those kids get tons of time to eat. Once the kids hit middle school? Who cares. 
Obviously the expectation is that they should control themselves, but that doesn't mean they will. Toddler are expected not to bite people, but they might.Also college rape isn't always perpetrated by boys. 
Can you really empower them? If so To what purpose? They have no authority and thus can not enact any change beyond making demands of their representatives.  To change the system you *must* do it from within. To do otherwise would require destroying the system and to do that successfully you have to work from the top down anyway. Empowering the people to tear down any oppression they face without the support or at least consent of the upper classes always, *always*, ends poorly. You must convince the 50-90 year old men and women to vote for your cause. Otherwise nothing you do will have any long term effect. 
In the future you can mention the a users name like this /u/FrostiTheShoman in your other comment and notify the user with one less post.I'm not trying to be annoying, just helpful.
What the shit... bitch is looking super rough in these. After all the photoshops posted lately, I thought I would be more prepared. Alas, nothing could have prepared me for that... thing.
This could have gone wrong so easily. If your friend was entitled, he/she could have retaliated about how the cashier has no right to comment on the shit he/she buys
Yeah! Saw that, sounds like Keepers is a great group. I wonder if there is an opportunity for them to coordinate with those same city parks staff to add support to their effort? 
Next month, the Linux Cluster Institute (LCI) is hosting a workshop at the University of Oklahoma for admins just like yourself:http://www.linuxclustersinstitute.org/workshops/
This is not just one group.  The experiment is being duplicated everywhere. Something strange seems to be exposing our ignorance of physics, and that is truly exciting. 
Iran is a constitutional theocracy with both democratic and totalitarian elements. The interaction of stakeholders in Iran is complex and cannot be simplified merely because the Ayatollah has overall authority in theory. In practice there are significant constraints on his authority.
I feel like the Elegy is hands down my least favorite car. The handling even fully upgraded is like the adder to me, very very wet and sloshy feeling. Can't corner to save a life. The entity on the other hand is fantastic
&gt; At that point, it becomes a fact, not a theory.But scientific fact does not mean the ultimate fact. A scientific fact actually means that we know it well enough to be pretty sure that you have this predictable outcome. A scientific fact also does not guarantee you that in the future that fact might be altered. It just means that you must come out with pretty convincing proof to change that fact.

Also, the writers know how the story is supposed to end. So I imagine they prioritize the threads that will be most important to the endgame, and either combine the leftovers with those plot lines or leave them out entirely.
They could stun(with access to heat wave and tyrant's throes), search the whole deck out, massive drawing power(liberary), XYZ spamming(Not so good tho), Synchro Spamming(soon) and can OTK consistently. They are just amazing.
Yeah, I get what you mean. I used to be the exact same way until I realized that nobody really notices. I don't really wear makeup though. Maybe mascara, concealer, and lip crayon if I'm going out somewhere nice. That being said I also love pantyhose, and it won't show through at all with them on. I tend to wear dark or patterned ones which covers it quite well. 
Just picking up Xenoblade for my Wii and playing it on my U has really helped me restrain myself hahaI'm only 35 hours in and got plenty of game left to play through so that should tide me over up until just right about X hits NA shores :)
The damage that you could do to the imperial battlegroup when they have the jump on you isn't worth the cost. To win the rebels had to pick their battles well.

So have YOU bought a multi billion dollar musical to the table? Because if that's your basis of "having a valid opinion" then doesn't that make you subject to it as well? I think the music in Wicked is good, but I think the story is simplistic compared to the book it was based on. They basically wiped out all of elphabas "bad" traits to make her more sypathetic. But it's easy to understand and connects with audiences, so it was a hit. Eh.
Ages ago the History Channel had a documentary on Boadicea and they talked about the combat rotation. I believe they stated that each front line soldier only had to fight 10-15 minutes, and then go to the back of the line to rest up.

I am not arguing how it is now is right. I am arguing that people who are in prison because they harmed innocent people do not deserve sympathy for whatever happens to them. 
I'm not saying I agree with the sentiment. I'm ELI5ing to you how this comment stood out. He did take it a little too far with that comment, but I don't believe anything illegal personally. However, there are powerful forces in this world that have killed people for less.
I'm not sure if this is your point or not, but I really have a problem with the argument that we need majorities to "get things done".Sure, it may be true that majority governments do more stuff than minorities and spend less time debating (citation needed, I'm just guessing without a source). My issue is that in cases like 2011 where a majority government is elected with 38% of the popular vote, the majority government is "getting things done" that *most Canadians did not vote for*. To me, that's not democracy.

Anecdotally though, my dad died on the 13th, I got in a car accident on the 13th and Pope John Paul was fucking shot on the 13th. (You'd think he'd be covered, with all those crucifixes.) It bothers me so much that every 13th I consider myself lucky if I make it through the day without incident. 
If you're watching it in chronological order, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya's ending episode was fucking awful. The movie is great though, so all is forgiven.
I don't know what your particular interest in Tuscaloosa is, but I you could drop that or were willing to add a few miles, you should really cut into MS more and hop on the Natchez Trace at some point. Maybe ride it down to Natchez and spend a while looking around. It has quite a few Antebellum homes that are interesting. Then maybe just follow the MS river to New Orleans. Also, just a heads up, decide if you want to see New Orleans as in the actual city, or if you are more interested in the festival of it all. On weekdays it won't be quite as crazy, especially Bourbon. 
This! So much! When I was little I saw this movie with my dad at the theater. When we left I said I really liked it but I didn't understand why Max was so mean to Goofy. My dad said that kind of attitude was something that would come along with being a teenager. I told him "Dad, I'll never be mean to you!" He got a tear in his eyes and smiled.Sure enough I was a dick at points through my teen years but we're all nice and moved past that. As a child it made me sad though, to think that Max couldn't find happiness in having Goofy as a dad. Now having grown up I understand what phase of life that movie was focused on.
Just to add to what Zheng Wang has noted, you may want to keep an eye on the upcoming August 15 *shusen kinenbi* (終戦記念日), or End of War Memorial Day, when Japanese leaders (contrary to popular opinion in Korea and China) traditionally issue the *Murayama Danwa*, or Murayama Statement, apologizing for past aggressions. If Abe does not do so this year, and if he follows that up with a visit to Yasukuni Shrine, we will certainly see an immediate impact on Sino-Japanese and Korean-Japanese relations.
Right, but I think he's saying (or at least, I'm saying) that it's better to go say, 3/5 in the Finals than it is to go 2/2 in the Finals. Getting to the Finals is a major accomplishment, and losing in the Finals shouldn't be used as an argument that a player "isn't clutch"...the player showed he was clutch just by getting that far. Granted, if a player Buffalo Bill'd it and lost four out of four finals, that might be different.
She's credited as appearing in those episodes in IMDB, though IMDB is notoriously unreliable. Beyond that, here's an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMDejjIkmso) she did back in October in which can neither confirms nor deny's being in Season 5.
The head ice tech is in charge of everything the happens with the ice and everything at ice level during the game.  You do need some specialized training, which can be received through mentoring (which is kind of what I'm doing) or by attending classes hosted by STAR.  Obviously if Bob's been there for 40 years and he's doing a good job, there's no reason to replace him so he'll keep doing it for as long as he wishes.  He could probably teach any regular zamboni driver everything he would need to know about being the head ice tech as his building.  There are little variances in head ice tech responsibility from building to building throughout the league but most of the core stuff is uniform.  
There's a huge statue of him outside the Bangor Civic Center, right in front of where they hold the Bangor State Fair.I also grew up in Maine, about 20 mins from Bangor.

You've just answered your own question. If a person is sufficiently drunk that he/she can't exercise judgement, then he/she is incapable of consenting to sex.And if someone doesn't consent, it's not okay.
Lyrics for the uninformed: http://genius.com/Slick-rick-treat-her-like-a-prostitute-lyrics"Treat Her Like A Prostitute" is an easy song to point at as a prejudiced track purely by name. While Rick says it crassly, he uses this song to talk about his struggles trusting women. It's hard to find a hip-hop album from this time period that doesn't ever classify women as promiscuous.
dont quit school until you have an org offering a salary. you are no where near there. it doesnt matter how hard you can frag because you need to prove you can play on a team and work toward the teams goals instead of making plays yourself. stay in school, enjoy playing the game and get better when you can, join an open team.
Thanks.  Maybe it'll be uphill from here?  I sure hope so.  I'm sorry you've been down this crappy road too. Mothers day is going to really be awful for me I think.  
Where is your evidence that makes it 100% certain that aliens have to be incomprehensible and that there is literally zero chance that it could be otherwise? All I'm seeing is a bunch of baseless assumptions. And wrong ones at that, considering that the aliens would be bound to the same laws of physics as us, meaning that, while they may be very different, they will certainly be comprehensible.
&gt; Go back and reread it. I did no such thing. You brought up the cap-era.I see what you mean now. I was referring to the time period of 2006 to now, not the salary cap itself.&gt; Guys like Kris Draper and John Madden, Guy Carbonneau and Jere Lehtinen used to win this.The game has changed a bit and very few players play the roles that those guys did. Modern hockey is very fluid and helping sustain or create possession through checking in every zone like the recent finalists is an increasingly important defensive skill for both forwards and defensemen. &gt; Two-way play counts both defense AND offense. Two-way centers are the only ones who get nominated for the Selke any more.The Selke is really no different from the Norris. Historically, high-scoring defensemen always win the Norris, because they play great defense which always generates offensive possesion as a result. Same goes for the Selke winners since 2006.

In middle school I had an asshole  gym teacher that would rip on us and make us run and do a bunch of random shit for no reason but honestly it was hilarious
Had my theatre exam today, and my team accidentally skipped my monologue, and my grade will suffer from it, but hey! It was my last exam. Also forced myself to call that school i wanna work at, and they are calling me back on monday.Then I went shopping and installed Project M on a friend's Wii. After we played that a bit, we decided that he sleeps at my place and we installed PM on my Wii as well. Now we're just sitting here, me browsing reddit and him playing PM. Soon going to sleep though as it's nearly 3 a.m.

&gt;  5. It’s Not Always the Big Dogs Who Will Bite YouI'd amend to:  It's rarely the big dogs who will bite you!I've had way, WAY more small dogs nip at me than large dogs.  The only dog I've ever been bitten by that broke the skin (or didn't break the skin for that matter) was a small dog.  And I always volunteer for the big dogs, even the aggressive ones, for that reason.  They're much safer.  
I have told my friend this so many times. They should get rights to things for legit skins. They could flat out pay or give a portion of each purchase. Idk how buying rights works. It would be a great way for companies like Nintendo or Funimation or something to get money from a source they wouldn't we've get money from otherwise.
You know.. this is an odd thing for me, because up until a month ago I never cared. Timing a vine felt too much like treating my account like a job, or that it was an indication I only cared about the success of a vine rather than my desire to post it. But then I started thinking about it, and I realized.. well, I am an entertainer on here, so shouldn't I consider the time most people are able to be entertained? I'd be a pretty bad entertainer if I posted what I wanted people to see at a time most people wouldn't see it. ...with that being said (sorry lol), some time around 1-3 PM Pacific Standard Time US. That's what *I* would say. There seems to be a surge in activity around that time.
&gt;Edit: A lot of you fine gentleman are probably wondering "app? pornhub has an app? This sounds difficult and complicated to install." yeah they do (or so I've heard). Go to the mobile site, click the three orange bars in the top left-hand corner and at the top of the drop down you will see a link for the download (not that I would know).&gt; &gt;Android users: go into your phone's settings, select "security (or equivalent)" and enable "Install apps from unknown sources." Go back and download the APK. Happy Fapping! If you want to rename the app use your launcher, or a file explorer and if you are rooted you can change the icon itself  (Nova Launcher is what i used). If you wanna change the icon you can use a file explorer with an archive viewer (FX is what i used), open the apk, and replace the file "Pornhub_2.4.2.apk/res/drawable-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png" with something else.&gt;&gt;iPhone: You will need to Jailbreak your phone if you want any non-appstore app (lel).&gt;

No offense but it's pretty irresponsible to not insist on using a condom if you know your FWB could be sleeping with other people.  Actually unless you have a monogamous LTR you should always use a condom.    No need to make a big deal about it with your FWB but I would insist on condom usage from now on (you know...for safety) and get yourself tested STAT!  See if he's willing to get himself tested too is also a good idea.  If he's not willing to use a condom with you then stop sleeping with him.  No exceptions.  Also, I'll repeat what others have said /r/redpillwomen are solid.  I lurk there and have a lot of respect for those women.  They probably are going to give you some tough love but they're going to tell you what you need to hear.  My guess is you're afraid of what they'll say and that's why your here asking us men.  But you really need to get the advice of some women in your life.

I think for BoR and LCoil GGG could have easily prevented legacy versions. With CoD losing a modifier that could have been a little more complicated i guess. However it's completely up to GGG what they will do. With Acuities they showed that they can easily scale down a mod from 100% to 60% as long as this mod can only be found on this specific unique.With LCoil the problem could have been that there is a generalised mod "X-type damage taken as Y-type" (Cloak of Flame has a similiar mechanic), which they were not able to change without effects on other items with damage conversion effects.
Do you plan on doing a flat/satin color or gloss? Are you applying clear coat if you use gloss? Are you sanding to the bare metal and using primer or just down to the base coat and painting over it? Sorry for so many questions, just curious to see how you plan to do it.
He probably sprained it because his downswing technique isn't right. He is probably digging in before the club even gets to the ball. We've all been there. He just needs to lay off it for a week and then get a pro to watch his swing and help fix his balance.
Well obviously anything that can heal and dps has to do less of a job at both than a pure healer or pure dps. If a fistweaver could put out as much damage as a hunter while healing as much as an rdruid, why would you bring anything besides fistweavers?
My feelings for this song go beyond love. It's objectively a good song-- it's poetic, powerful, somber, musically interesting in its structure, and that's not even going into what it means to me as far as memories are concerned. I first heard this one summer sitting with my dad on our porch, he used it as a demo for some new speakers. Sitting there, sipping beer, absolutely floored by this sound... perfect. And later in college, I managed to introduce some friends to it, and one kid in particular (Matt, if you're reading this, yo-- I miss the shit out of you man we should visit sometime. Drinks are on me.) really took to it and it became the one song that he associated with his sophomore year.I love this. Thank you for posting it.

I think you are in the wrong genre then.. open world is just that, big open world, not a tiny box with hack&amp;slash :D Anyways, I think the right thing is to balance between many aspects and as far as I have seen in the videos and whatnots I'm pretty sure Witcher 3 will do just that! 
Raising the flop isn't too bad since you're it can look squeezy and it represents something like KJ+ and basically any A which could get calls from plenty of worse, but I'm not *too* happy with the 4bet. Yes, you have a set, but it's *bottom* set, especially with both A and K on the board which SB and BB love to flat preflop. I know that's monster under the bed territory and I would never fold there unless SB was a complete nit, but I'd flat the 3 and not re-raise it again.Once he 5-bets your 4-bet for nearly FOUR TIMES THE FUCKING POT that's a fold unless he has some wildly loose stats. Yes you won this one, but I really don't see that as a profitable play in the long run.

We blocked out the last name... but Shadowgar sent this to EG membership and then bragged over Teamspeak about how he found his real name. Notice how we blacked out the last name? Shadowgar sent it with full First and Last name. So please talk more about IPs and post some wiki links... but most of all address the accusation on the floor. You are acting like you banned GlyphGryphs IP and that was it. You have seen that picture before and you received it in your inbox when Shadowgar sent it out. So dont play dumb and act like we are accusing you of doing something as normal as blocking his IP from your TS.
Ah, Germany. I plan to binge-learn (yes, that's a thing now) German this Summer. We're going to have German lessons in the tenth grade, and I should already speak the language pretty well before we'll have our first lesson. Gotta get the top grades, you know. I speak it to a certain extent already, so it won't be that hard either (my pronunciation is probably a bit rusty though).And trust me, you should still watch it. It has comedy elements too, and not everything is as feely as everyone is talking about. Like, there are no "feels every second", so please give it a try!

You have to let each community come up with its own representative hashtag. They deserve that right. You can't impose a rubric, and even if you do, it won't take, anyway. A common tag among all communities is the most we can hope for.If we had enforcement power over every member of every community rising up against SJWs, your rubric might work, but we don't, and this is actually our strength. We should respect that.

Very good news for motorbike riders.Plenty of other countries have shown that having more motorbikes/scooters rather than cars helps cut down on congestion in a big way.I went to Vietnam last year, and 95% of the cars I saw were taxis - other than that, pretty much everyone was on scooters. So many people are able to get around very easily and they cause little to no traffic jams.And more parking spots in the city dedicated to motorcycles &amp; scooters will be a big help. Even though bikes can park on most footpaths in the city, sometimes finding an empty spot to park can be a pain in the ass.Can't wait to see how this pans out.

According to my religion? No firm dogma. According to me:I suspect that the deceased spends an intermediate period of time either haunting the earth or exploring oblivion. They may be invited into the halls of the gods or their ancestors, but that's not for me to speculate on. Eventually they will be reincarnated, just like everyone else.
If you're still feeling upset, do something to take your mind off of the round.  If you've gotten over it, make it a learning experience for yourself. Look back at the round and identify what the problems may have been, and what you can do to improve upon them.  Definitely don't beat yourself up over the mistakes, because that's not going to do any good.

I'm not a doctor but I would be amazed if there was any viable treatment plan, I would think you would mainly focus on keeping the patient as comfortable as possible and admit them to long term care 
I realise this is ad hom but I really wouldn't bother getting into it with Bobby. I'm pretty sure he's a troll, he once said he doesn't tink women have historically been oppressed ever. So having a conversation with him about race is probably not going to be very productive fyi. Continue at your own risk!
The main factor was DEFINITELY not Fabregas dropping in form. Matic was essentially a passenger in January while Fab was injured at the beginning of the year. To top it off, Oscar fell out of form as well forcing Mourinho to play Fab farther up the pitch. This along with Costa's injuries. Your statement was that since United's 2011 season, the BPL has not been as good which is completely false. That same year Chelsea won the CL and the next year won the EL. To top it off, teams in the prem have consistently gotten stronger between that period.

Official is in the manga, Non-official are in the anime fillers, movies or games. SBS is the segment in the volumes where he answers questions. Sometimes, he creates devil fruits there but they are jokes.
Not to nitpick, I was slightly confused by the wording.  I thought it was referring to active NBA players and their age when they won the award.Maybe wording like "At age 39, Tim Duncan is the oldest active player who won Rookie Of The Year.  Who is the second oldest active, former winner?"I love what you're do though, it's hard to come up with good OC.  I hope you continue doing this, just trying to help in a very small way.Maybe I'm alone too.  If I am, disregard this.
I'm pretty sure this is before she died, similar to how her appearance in Convergence is due to their city being taken from their universe before it died. However, I'm not sure when exactly this takes place in relation to Convergence, though it's likely before that event. 
Under windows power management, your system might be set to "passive" instead of "active"what this means is your computer will throttle the CPU before increasing the fan speed under "Passive" mode"active" mode instead increases the fan speed before throttling the CPU.Its not the actual temperature, its windows keeping your computer safe.

Faulty definition of "terrorist."A true terrorist is someone who *uses terror* to accomplish their objectives, especially by targeting *civilian* targets rather than *military/governmental* targets.Under this definition, the Empire is a terrorist organization and the Rebellion is not.---Another way to put it is that "authentic warfare" attacks only the "skeleton/muscle" of the collective enemy, not its internal organize. The goal is to destroy your enemy's ability to fight, rather than absolute domination.
That's a generous offer, and I appreciate it.  However, I'm still going to be better off if I pay full price and get free shipping.  Maybe someone else in this thread could benefit in my place.
Skyrim's engine is an old piece of shit that can't even properly process shadows.Second, look at what amazing work has been done with the cryengine sandbox that came with crysis 2. You can't tell me it's a terrible game for modding as a result.Edit: you didn't say that. Can you source it, please?But I expect that modding witcher 3 will be a big deal. the past two games had problems with mods conflicting, and they weren't open world.
Not sure about Android, but I know iPhones will continue to search for a signal unless they're in airplane mode. Unfortunately airplane mode disables the GPS functionality as well. I think you can jailbreak a phone to enable GPS without searching for a phone or data signal.

What you are dealing with is Galvanic corrosion. It happens with aluminum and steel. I currently have 2 bikes in my co-op with the same problem. I am trying the vinegar process. It takes weeks, but supposedly it slowly breaks through the corrosion. You take off the BB, seal the seat post/seat tube however possible, then flip the bike over and fill up the seat tube. Let it sit, come back the next day, drain, fill again. Repeat for a couple weeks. This is the only way I know to cut the galvanic corrosion. You cannot use any of the other Sheldon Brown methods on an aluminum seat tube stuck in a steel frame. 
I would think that there would be a decent technological improvement in 276 years. I don't know what those would have been, but they should make a difference. I mean, wars fought after 476 weren't all fought with legionnaires, so obviously there was something better coming along.Same reason for the bonus but an even bigger loss for Peak Rome. Peak Byzantium, whenever that was, is even further in the future compared to 476AD.

It is great. They do make bigger bottles, though. A shop here carries both and charges you the same price as the large bottle if you buy two smalls. I think it saves you a dollar.
Did a sketchy acquaintance you don't really know spend all day with you, use your car and phone and tell the police you killed your husband?  Do your cell phone calls contradict your only alibi story?  Did you tell a potentially incriminating story to police, confirmed by other witnesses, then tried to change that story and claim every one else was mistaken?  No?  Then you're probably ok.

As much as I loved the idea of a big trade, I don't see Joe you don't do this as the Titans. Especially with Whisenhut at the helm to groom him. Best case scenario they have a watered down version of Montana/Young, Bledsoe/Brady, or Favre/Rodgers. Worst case scenario both QBs play poorly, but maintain trade value over the next couple years based solely on their potential. 
Too bad this wasn't mentioned higher up in the comments. Seems like a lot of people took the bait on this video, with its emotional music and frankly unbelievable story (trying to burn him alive shouting "fire him", only 'torching' his store after he fled?). Somehow some unknown right-wing journalists from an internet site known for "mastering social sharing” found this story involving psychopathic protestors and a [message of needing guns](https://twitter.com/Banshee308/status/593458032547246080).

Had a windows phone pre iphone time. And it actually was useable quite well, using the stylo was the only inconveniance, but it was at the level of its time and if youd use an iphone 1 now, youd propably go nuts because how slow and bad it is by nowadays standard.It was a user friendly design and very good marketing (brand identity...) that made it so popular, but it was not innovation on apples side.

Hey, whatever works. My job is to prep and distract children. Half of them want to know as much as possible, half of them want a visual block put up so they can't see what's going on and to do something completely different to distract them. I can't imagine adults not being the same way. :)Next time you have to get something done, try playing a game on your phone to distract yourself. Works wonders for the kids on the tablet, can't hurt to try.

Color Change: Also changes type when weather is in effect at the start of the turn, to the type of the weather.This gives Kecleon a small niche with the Color Change ability, but it lets it resist the main types of the weather (except Rock because that resists barely anything).Defeatist: 1.5x Attack and Sp.Atk while above 50% HP, 0.75x Attack and Sp.Atk while under 50% HP, instead of just losing 50% of its attacking stats at half HP.Slow Start: 1.5x Defense and Sp.Def while it's trying to get going. Assault Vest or Wide Guard Regigigas should definitely be usable.Truant: Attacks from the user go through Protect. Makes Slaking actually usable, at least in VGC.Mummy: Instead of changing ability, inflicts the effect of the Ghost-type Curse on the opponent when it uses a contact move.Swarm/Blaze/Torrent/Overgrow: Increases power of the appropriate attack type by 0.75% for each 1% of missing HP (for a max of a 74.25% increase).
I understand that! In fact, eventually I always end up changing it back anyway, because having it in days is just more practical. But I think it's fun (at least temporarily) to think in hours! Especially when the end date gets as close as ours is now. (I know, only 10 days!!! I'm exploding with anticipation!! :D) It also gives me more milestones to take notice of (like 1000 hours, 100 hours on top of the day/week/month milestones) which I find helpful in making the time go quicker. Somehow working toward a bunch of little milestones instead of one big one (the end date) makes the wait seem faster to me. 
I don't know too much about New Jack all I know about the Mass Transit incident he seems pretty popular besides that. What else has he done to deserve that? I'm not trying to call you out or anything I really wanna know.

I'm personally more interested in Babs when talking about trading with Detroit. Apparently he and Hitch are close.

At this stage in the game, anybody who consciously makes themselves aware of the instincts of their sex is exceptional because of the nonsensical "anti-patriarchy' tilt of the public conscience. 
Similar to what we see in humans. Congestive heart conditions (and failure), with unspecified peripheral vascular diseases, increased respiratory problems (usually due to fluid build up in the lungs secondary to congestive heart problems), etc.OP, if you are not comfortable/capable of popping or probing a snake to determine the sex of snakes, I'd look into finding someone in your area that is capable.Otherwise, if indeed male, the ball python is certainly within an acceptable and healthy weight margin and would not necessarily seek out higher kcal/g / lower ASH feeders, but instead manage the snake's diet to include increased mass intake at a miniscule level to slowly increase overall intake and therefore metabolism.
Elizabeth also had Francis assassinated to distract attention from the Cypriot oil resolution which was potentially going to be renegotiated as more information leaked. In having FU assassinated she protected the Urquhart share of the cash- since Claire has left Frank it's not entirely clear how preserving the Underwood estate would necessarily benefit her, especially since Frank could easily Will his estate to someone else.
To add to this, I recently made a great maple/red wine vinaigrette. 1 part maple syrup to 2 parts red wine vinegar. Goes great with most of the salads I eat on a regular basis.
Sounds to me your story doesn't have much to do with the difference between gay or straight people. I may be wrong, but that story is just about a guy in love with a bitch. It's sad, for sure, but has nothing to do with sexuality, just personality. She's a bitch, he's a poor sap. Could just as easily be two women or two men.
There's differences in how it's utilized. Blizzard severely restricts what you can do with the token, Eve online treats it like any other virtual commodity. You can buy it, sell it, trade it, squirrel them away, give them away, jettison them into space and let others discover it, etc.Blizzard only allows you to buy it, then auction it. No other bits about it.

You could but honestly I'd just leave it out.  It adds some complexity but it's pretty hard to pick out that there's pear in the mix.If you have another fruit flavour that has that same sort of tart dryness you could sub it in.  Maybe apple could work but it's not as potent as pear so might get washed away by the other strong flavours in that recipe.I've never used guava flavouring but the mix of dragonfruit, orange cream and pear in that recipe reminds me of feijoa (same family as guava).  If you have it maybe you could remove those three and and swap for 0.5-1.0% guava for similar effect.

I think sex with condoms is pretty awesome, because I can have it with women I'm not in love with/don't trust implicitly.

I'm saying that, as someone who likes fucking different people, I'm happy to use them. It's not a disaster.

When I was student teaching I heard two fairly young, female teachers say, in a group conversation that I was a part of, "SoandSo is so stupid.

I don't think teachers should hold beliefs like that about their students.

Well, that's why we're all allowed opinions but I thought her win with Trixie had less to do with her, more about keeping Trixie. Even in the reaction thread, people were happy for their win but the Katya/MKD was a strong contender for potentially beating them. But that doesn't gel with the storyline, does it?The other win was another team effort involvement, which doesn't suggest - to me - a strong individual Queen that's going to blow my socks off. Does she have her strengths? Absolutely! But as a viewer, I'm not *seeing* them, which is pretty paramount on such a competitive situation, surely?

One word. Ironman.Edit: Instead of deleting this I would like to clarify all I meant was being an ironman adds value to skilling.

You're right. The character part is so much more important than the joke writing. Every great comedian talks funny, and figuring out a unique and funny voice is the best thing you can do. People don't like to believe it, but it's really that simple.

I have social anxiety, although it's getting better with time and work (although I go back to square one at times). Actually I have anxiety in general but it is worst in social situations. I thought it was just the way I was born for the longest time, then learned it came from being shamed my whole life (for existing, being told I'm wrong, I'm incompotent, I'm a burden, I'm worthless, and so on and so forth,) and just last year finally discovered the real root of it.. NPD mother did all this. I would be surprised to learn the child of an NPD parent did not develop some sort of anxiety problem, social or otherwise. Too bad I don't believe in hell because it would give me great pleasure to know there's a special place in it reserved for the parents who knowingly cripple their children from being able to function like normal human beings. 
As an 18 year old I believe this works for me, and I know I'm going to get massive down votes but I still believe your wrong. As an example, I used to shave every day, and I got 5 o'clock shadow every day. Then when I stopped and started shaving once every 2 weeks, I wouldn't notice the stubble come in until two days after I shaved.Edit: down vote me all you want, I'm working from past experience 
I think the redhead at the beginning was taken out of context. She keeps saying its unacceptable and these hackers should be banned. Which is true if you are hacking an online game you should be banned but and that she doesnt like the verbal abuse (which in reality is a big problem in online gaming if you are a girl). No where does she say shes mad about the "virtual rape"

I don't disagree with you. I meant the kind of person that would put that bumper sticker on their car is probably putting it next to a confederate flag. I know the cartoon thing is about free speech, but the people concerned with that don't have a huge overlap with the bumper sticker crowd.

I must admit that we don't say cunts as much as we lead you to believe we do.But also, having travelled a fair bit, I find that people don't understand us when we abbreviate things like arvo, doco, sanga, barbie, and that sort of thing. I always get double-takes. It's funny but.
With Daniel Bryan out, i'm inclined to say Harper is probably my favorite wrestler going. SOME character development would be cool but i'm afraid WWE's idea would be to repackage him as Brodus Clay 2.0
Not surprised.  Walter Football was saying Leonard Williams would fall, saying an insider said he wasn't highly valued by teams.  He got  similar information about Teddy Bridgewater
$29 to be fabulous or $40 to be bland with the potential to be whatever you want. Decisions! Still kind of pricy but it's a bitchin' kite so it's probably worth it.

I'm tired of people barking on and on about total and utter nonsense, and then sitting back and winging about 'freedom of speech'.   Freedom of speech was intended to protect citizens from government censorship (among other things), and wasn't much of a protection to allow people to spew hate or garbage.  In fact, there are noted exceptions to freedom of speech....

I've only had to buy 2 since they started stamping flight numbers on em, and they were star AJs. I have a PFN champion one that's is clear blue and is the most over stable distance driver I have ever thrown.
CV is another word for resume.Like I said, these programs tend to be pretty good. The  "creative" format of your CV may be preventing the data from being retrieved properly. Not all websites use that kind of software though, so it might unfortunately be the case that you weren't what they were looking for.
She stopped trusting you when she saw you suggest to a girl who had a crush on you that one day you should see each other, while you were already in a committed relationship. She saw you not even mention you had a serious girlfriend. Sometimes once he trust is broken, it can't be fixed. She's gone nuts because she can't trust you. Time for couples counseling, like, yesterday.

I'm not saying I'm glad he got fired. It was surprising to me, but not surprising that he got called out for it, which some people can't seem to comprehend.

[Here is the video of the actual interview](http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/video/2015/04/29/raul-cosmos-real-madrid-champions-league-la-liga), in English.  I have to say, that quote sounded kind of fishy and like it might be out of context, but it is pretty much what he said -- that Messi plays a professional match like he is just playing with his friends in the street. He also said that Maldini was the toughest defender and Oliver Kahn the toughest goal keeper.   And he tipped his hat to Giggs at the end there.  Seems like a very nice, low-key guy.  
The US (at least in naval circles) had a very strong appreciation for the abilities of the IJN. They had spent 25 years planning a war against them through the versions of War Plan Orange. Though that did not prevent inset racism and other assumptions from causing them to be underestimated in certain areas such as night fighting and the capabilities of their aircraft. The Navy had a strong sense that war was coming, but fully expected it to begin in the Philippines and did not truly have an appreciation for the power of a massed task force of carriers and their striking power as the US had rarely even had 2 together where as the Pearl Harbor attack force had 6. 
The better question is "how soon do you expect to die that your amortization schedule allows for that scenario"? Regardless of the amount of OP's loans, they all have a fixed timeline for payback. 
Agree! This is really a wonderful, accessible book. And if you are lukewarm on King as a person, you will love him after reading this book. Only criticism: i was really interested in reading his thoughts on plot, because that seems to be where a lot of new writers go wrong, and he totally skipped it!! Honestly, he says something like, oh, don't worry about plot, it'll just come to you.No, Mr. King, you are gifted, that's why it "just comes to you," the rest of us need help!!!(And frankly, sometimes it hasn't "just come to you.")
So, give NC a mini lasher with the SAW's muzzle velocity and accuracy?  Are you nuts? Hell no.I could see giving the GODSAW something like no damage dropoff (200 damage at all ranges) and/or double flinch effect against targets.  But not the monstrosity you describe.
If you're on PC - I highly recommend the mod AFT - Advanced Follower Tweaks.  It allows multiple followers and forces them to gain a level every time you do!  - You can even tweak what perks they have and teach them new spells.***If you're on console... I *believe* that the latest patch allows a follower to level up as you level - however their level is set at your level the first time you encounter them.  So some might be much lower than you all the time.  (I could be way wrong on this!).
Ya but there are far less condescending ways to say something like this. Instead of "clearly this = that" the author can say "it can be easily shown that this=that." A few extra words, but I think it is worth it.
Or even something like rejecting orientation altogether, he does attribute it to having spent too much time spent with the trolls, and they dont think in those terms.

You think the US is going to wait 10 years with their flag being transformed into another one? The Japanese guy  would have barely the time to get back on earth that Abrams tanks would be deployed on there. 
Some (rich) people had portraits made before then, which I guess could have been done with their eyes closed, but (a) probably almost never were, and (b) you'd have to trust the painter.

I believe the only cop who hasn't given a statement on the record is the vans driver. It's quite feasible that the five other cops did not know about it because they ended all contact with the van after it drove away from the arrest scene. 
This is such great insight. The film community in this country is stifled. I think it also doesn't help that the industry here is very insular. I often wonder where are our Tarantino's and Scorcese's and P. T. Anderson's? Why aren't we producing unique voices in cinema? We seemed to have a good run in the 70s but then it just fizzled out.  
No instructors look at RateMyProfessors or any of those sites. Seriously, they're just for students to vent. Instructors don't bother looking at all.Source: I talk to college professors all day long, and have dated a couple.EDIT: OKAY OKAY SOME PROFS DO.

This reminds me of when my family went high-tech and bought our first DVD player. My sister and I discovered you could watch movies in fast forward and the audio would sound like this. Many hours were spent re-watching movies in fast forward. I had a strange childhood.
Depends on what they offer (if anything at all).  We'll have to wait for their Kickstarter to be posted.  Basically, depending on how much you donate, you can get better rewards.  Again, we have to see what they offer first.
While I've never watched Tokyo Ghoul A, the animation can't possibly be as bad as Wizards Barristers: Benmashi Cecil Episode 11. That is the worst animated episode I have ever watched, bar none. You kinda owe it to yourself just to watch episode 11 and see how bad it is.
Character development. Character development. Character development. I think the only episode that technically classifies as filler is Garnet's Universe and maybe Say Uncle.

I agree with this, however, I honestly think things like doing taxes and basic education on the tax code should be taught in school.  These are very important things, and people don't seem to understand the importance of even what taxes do.  They just think of it as an inconvenient way for the government to steal their time and their money, without giving a thought to WHY THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS MONEY.

If the poll is 20 points off on the eve of the election, as in the last BC election, it won't help you in any way. It can work against your intentions to even know the poll numbers. 
The cards themselves in the deck don't need to be cohesive. For example if you put The Sun and The Moon in a deck with neither Luna or Celestia that's up to you.
"In the shit" is a phrase I have heard describing someone who makes their living selling illegal drugs.  "Cookie" is a word I have heard to describe a disc of crack cocaine after it has been cooked up and before it is chopped into rocks.  I'm not saying that is what they are referring to, but in the context it seems possible.
I assume that there are apartments above many of those businesses. Mostly I'm going of the fact that the person specifically pointed to buildings and asked the cop "what about people that live there?"

I did try it earlier today in a couple of Heroics - albeit not the best testing environment, or a length of time considerable enough to qualify it as testing, and that felt a little too fast; specifically the switching between Eclipses. I'd barely cast 3 or 4 Starfires before I'd wind up pre-casting Wrath which is arguably great in some fights.Still, I've only been back a little over a week &amp; have plenty of time to get to grips with it all again before 6.2 hits. I hope. 
Remember the number of people that play league. 500 comments is still a vocal minority. There's also a good chance the majority of negative comments come from people who purchase very little.
I always figured it was dumb as fuck that they act as if the kid had no actual ability to make a decision to have sex. Either way, I'd just like a little consistency amongst the courts.
With mhrb people usually use STB teks, which aren't that good for acrb. ATB teks are what you'd use for acrb. Some people claim you need a defat step with acrb, but I find that the need for this relies either on the quality of your root bark or your skill with extracting. I've never done a defat with acrb and I never get nasty stuff in my pulls.
The way it was implemented by Valve there was a lot of issues where people would have to buy mods (free mod x depends on paid mod y for example) or in many cases people had no right to sell mods (copyright issues, people using other people stuff without permission). Sure, I support the position of giving mod author an option to put their work on sale, as long as its done in a way that is not harmful, but helpful to a community and a modding scene overall. But my personal opinion is that cooperation, sharing assets and learning experience is one of the key components of the mod scene and introducing any kind of paid system ruins those aspects. The only way to preserve those aspects is to make free availability mandatory, while leaving paying optional. 
Yeah - I mean I think I got there around 10:30 or so and thee first timeslot was like 1PM. Not a huge deal though - like I said you can spend a while in the museum and then go over and shop in the store and then have a nice lunch.

It wasn't actually server side, I noticed a small download when I opened up hero league for the first time today. Checked reddit, this would appear to be the explanation. 
I actually do have one already. Now with kids I find myself in the living room most the time now and already okay these games on a lower quality laptop. I wouldn't even be looking but my wife is taking mine and I'm getting s new one so I figure if upgrade a little bit but nothing major. I know I put 700 but I'd be hesitant to spend more than 600 unless it's a great deal. My current one has a Radeon 7520m, 4 gb ram, and a low end a6 cpu. I think it's a6-4400 or something 
I definitely agree that if a man walked into a woman's bathroom it more than likely would not be in order to creep on some lady. I'm just saying that if that were to be the case, that's when I would feel uncomfortable with a dude in the bathroom. Trans girls? Not something I would probably give a second thought to. She can come in pre-op or post-op, I don't care.On a side-note, you are also damn right about them being gross, women's bathrooms are for the most part the worse out the two which I will never understand. I worked fast food for too long and cleaned the bathrooms too many times to ever say that women's were the cleaner of the two. Why in the hell would someone stick a used pad against the fucking wall? Who knows, but it's a common occurrence.
To be honest this is not what Noble Knights need.  In my opinion, they need some sort of card that searches for the equip spells so that they don't need to run huge amounts of equips.
Yeah, I get a lot of flak for my war base because it is SO SO weak against air. But this last war was the first time somebody actually used air on it (successfully)...I usually get gowiped for 1 or 2 stars, lol. I have been meaning to change it though so this last war finally made me want to do it getting three starred :S people always scoff when my response is "I would change it if it got attacked properly" even though it's perfectly legitimate
I do not know how you have resisted drawing/put stickers on the front of that desk to make a hilarious face. Or make a grill over the mouth to make teeth.
0.5 is negative when gravity pulls down with a TWR of 1, Ariane 5 isn't even close to orbiting when the boosters detach.. Momentum from the boosters are extremely important during the launch because the core actually starts to slow down. The Space Shuttle did the same if I recall correctly. Both craft actually have a period when they lose height during flight while boosting into orbit.
I would love to win the elusive WFT because she's one of my favorite characters to play as, but I don't know if I really should enter because I already have an Ike . . .

Same here. I had stopped downloading music and was strictly using grooveshark. I had been compiling chronological playlists (Summer 2013, Fall 2014, etc.) for the past few years and now it's all gone :\ I'm seriously bummed that there are quite a few songs in those collections that I'm pretty sure I'll forget and never hear again.
Watch what women do, not what they say. And what the do, in general, is like men who are doing something with their life, not the ones who treat them nice like we're told to, i.e. catering to all their needs, shoulder to cry on kind of shit. There is literally nothing wrong with that guys comment, and I'm yet to ever here any sensible argument against the flirting/creepy rule. If I use that archeologist pickup line, it can come across as cute innuendo, as opposed to Phil Fish using it. Nice guy frustration comes from doing everything that they're told they should (being respectful, gentle, generous) and not being actually liked for it. If you're "surprised" you didn't see more of it in that thread, maybe its because men were making some good points. 
I think you are both wrong. &gt;“The laying of mines in **international waters is an act of war**,” Vice Adm. Mark Fox, commander of the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, said in a Feb. 12 interview.&gt;Whether an “act of war” or not (**the international rules — admittedly more honored in their breach than observation— do allow for peacetime mining of high-seas areas under certain strict conditions**. Iranian officials have threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz in response to U.S. and international sanctions over its nuclear program.Source: [USNI](http://news.usni.org/2012/07/17/iranian-mines-strait-hormuz-not-showstoppers). 
Does anyone actually think he's going to leave? I honestly haven't done enough research to make a real judgement on it. I'm hoping he would stay just because it's Detroit but many have said otherwise.
I can find one, but I feel like using Airbnb is more economical (Suppose I get $150, 150*15days/month=$2250, which is greater than what I will get for a roommate, and there is less distraction since they will be in the apartment for only 15 days in a month). Since they are mostly tourists, I don't think they will be in the apartment for most of the time. This is just my reasoning. 
So in that case, I would think we want you to dig up redpoe and role confirm someone else, assuming we want absolute certainty that you will end up town.Edit: As close to absolute certainty as we're going to get, anyway.
The weird computer vocals don't do anything for me in this song, I would normally like something like that but it feels kind of kitschy paired with the lyrics...
I think this question would go down better phrased as "What *seemingly* good character is actually a terrible person". Because right now people are just listing anti-heroes left and right.
So, it was a mix of things. I have good credit, I make decent money, and I saved my tax return as my down payment (FHA, 3.5% down). My boyfriend was willing to back me up with whatever I needed financially, but I wanted to do this on my own. Luckily, my realtor is AMAZING and got $5000 in closing help from the seller, so I didn't have to pay a thing in closing costs! I am very fortunate to have these awesome people in my life. Also, I wouldn't have thought about buying a house now except for the fact that I plan on staying in this area for the next 30 years for my job (pensions are sweet yo!), plus the interest rate I was given was pretty low (and for me, it's cheaper than renting). It was just perfect timing, everything about this. 
I don't consider myself an MRA, but I've never seen this neckbearded, m'ladying, friendzoned MRA stereotype people have. Though my only experience with MRAers is lurking the mensrights board and girlwriteswhat videos on youtube.MRA get a lot of flak for stuff they didn't do - it's quite ridiculous. Stuff like Elliot Rodger being an MRA, which somebody pulled out of their ass. In that context I can definitely understand the concerns MRAs have...

It's not easy because it plagues my mind every day too, and it's hard for me to help change 26 years of thinking which has caused this.Although yes there are triggers to have caused it. Right now there's no improvement and it's chronic so although I want to do all I can, I know it's up to her to change, I can offer all the support I can but I can't do anything realistically which can be equally frustrating on my part, I just can't let that show.
1) Yes, absolutely, he would be under general anesthesia. That also presents a problem in their care as these patients are usually crack cocaine addicts, and the rate of cardiac arrest in this patients when submitted to general anesthesia is pretty high. I've seen young, otherwise healthy patients simply die in the operating table because of that (I'm a surgeon by the way).2) I don't understand your question. Could you rephrase it (sorry, English is not my first language).
Yeah, I think that was datamined from the 2.5 patch? So I think as of now, the most likely candidates for the last zone are West Shroud and Coerthas Eastern _lands. (Though they could just throw in an entirely new zone.)

D'artagnan, for her high damage output and solid health pool. She's also a very versatile hero and can do PvE, PvC, WB, etc. with a variety of different team mates.
You're right, anafenza has no profitable blocks, but neither do any of your other creatures in hand.  Anafenza comes down as a sorta pseudo removal spell for their creatures, and it keeps them from playing surrak if they have it.  Deathdealer and fleecemane can't hold back surrak.  In all honesty it's a complex situation with a lot of options, that's why lsv picked this one.
I went to one of those colleges that doesn't require SAT scores and I absolutely loved my time there. (I didn't finish high school, I eventually got a GED, and I didn't start college until I was 24.) I also did reasonably well-- made the Dean's List in three of my first four semesters and ended up graduating with a 3.6 GPA. I hope that more schools move toward testing-optional status, not least because I'd like to have kids one day and plan to homeschool/unschool them and would like for them to not be summarily shut out of post-secondary education. (I'd *also* like there to be free universal education a la Europe, but I'm also a filthy commie, so.)
Are you European? If so, do tell me about the gypsies please? You guys are worse about that than anything that gets said about Blacks on reddit by Americans. The biggest difference is that tons of Americans argue with and downvotes the anti-Black shit -- while gypsy hate fests get almost universal upvotes here. 
Dude, I just made these and they are ridiculous!!! Thank you so very very much. My sweet tooth was getting to me and this absolutely satisfied. I can't wait to have another slice tomorrow! 
&gt; To be honest I was expecting something like K-On! but by no means is this any worse.Blasphemy!You realize K-On! is one of the most popular anime in Japan, with thousands of BDs still being sold five years after the show finished airing? They converted the whole city that inspired locations in the show into a tourist spot and people from all over the world visit it year round. I find it hilarious when people compare other show, no matter how good, to a classic.
No.  If someone is a poor candidate, then the more people talk about them the more people will see how poor they are.  If they a good candidate, then you don't want to be one of those people who were against talking about them.  Let them celebrate.
It hurts a bit passing on Williams, but I can't be mad at all with Cooper. I was lower on him than most, but dude is in a great opportunity to come in and deliver from day one.

I have bought and sold 3 RX8's. Drove them for years. Depending on the year, tranny, and trim there is a huge difference in value. We need a little more info on the RX8 to let you know if it is a good deal. 
Hiring a cleaning service once a month is not a crazy luxury.  It's not even that expensive.  When I was an undergrad, I shared a house with five people in NYC, and we would have a cleaning lady come by once a month, because it caused too much roommate friction to try to split cleaning responsibilities between five people.  It's not a big deal.
I should add, EH and Pandemic have *some* similarities. But a few things: In EH you will most likely lose even if you play smart. EH is story driven like an adventure if you don’t play out the story you will lose. Every time you solve a mystery, a new mystery appears which requires something different. Chance has it’s day in a big way in EH, in both dice, and all the thematic situational cards, if you think you’ve got a situation handled, *you don’t.* If the powers of shuffling and dice want your investigator dead **he dies.** Your “plan” is only good until the next Mythos Card comes out. Heck your “plan” may not survive the first player’s turn if things go poorly. And it certainly isn’t always clear what the best course of action is.
Man mine was a nightmare...I was stealth fattie for a long time... No full body pictures, listed as curvy....I also had a list of reasons you shouldn't message me.Probably my 2 worst infractions. I think I fixed both of them before I found this lovely place though.I was just a scaredy cat before.
this is stupid as hell.  they have one striker in that list. it means absolutely nothing.  at all.  midfielders at the top defenders towards the middle/bottom and strikers at the bottom makes sense.  throw in Sturridge and Borini into the list and it may have some substance to it but this is just more shitting on Balotelli for nothing really.  
There was this moment from All-star Superman.http://www.ultraimg.com/images/AyWmn.jpgAlthough, as someone in a forum pointed out, this scene took place on the moon, so the weight is actually 1/6 that.  Also, the whole plot of that comic was that Superman got an extra dose of solar rays and became much stronger, so this isn't typical.  
perhaps he ddnt realise how deadly 5e was and is still figureing out how to balance combat. if it happens again bail but if the gm is trying to learn the system and dosnt want to kill characters just becuase he didnt relize how dangerous combat was that donst seem terrible
Lebron just has to do what he does best  Kyrie just needs to play well and not do more than he needs to  I say the real battle will be between our front court as Gasol can actually hit mid range shots and we'll have to keep them off the glass, Bucks are clearly showing what happens when you don't fight for boards.
From what I understand, it's a bandwidth saving issue.It loads the video in slices, and it's tuned so the slices aren't too big. Once it's loaded the next slice it wont load further than that until it starts playing that slice. This way, they can save bit's of bandwidth from people who don't finish videos they watch. By and large you should be able to load SD video's and experience no pauses on a 5mbs connection or better. If you can't get that speed, or you have better than that speed but still experience problems, it's entirely likely your ISP is throttling your connection. 
&gt;  there is a problem in the industry of the big names just riding their name and playing a pre-planned set.I don't really see what the "problem" is here.  If he played a given set on the fly or he chose it the night before and then played it, it sounds exactly the same to the audience, so it really just sounds like people, once again, are finding something to be outraged over for fun.I just view going to shows as going to the movies.  Yes, obviously these people are not playing live instruments any more than movies have actors acting live on stage.  I'm at the movies for the better display/sound system though, not for live actors, so why would I care that the movie is recorded?  The same goes for this...if it sounds good and I like it, putting all this effort into being angsty about it being recorded just seems like a completely pointless waste of energy.
Tourettes =/= swearing.Saying swearwords out of nowhere can be tourettes, it's called Coprolia, and effects ~10% of people with tourettes. But Iroh in this video isn't just yelling random swear words, he's using them normally.
Thug life was a code of conduct for bloods and crips to follow. It was akin to a rules of engagement meant to help protect the innocent in the neighborhoods that were gang-ruled. It's commonly mistaken for glorifying the violence, but that was never his message. He was trying to mitigate it.[HERE](http://www.assatashakur.org/forum/open-forum/9011-code-thug-life.html)
Definitely one of mine too. Loyalty and integrity. If I get caught doing something I knew I shouldn't have done and took that risk, I will not lie to save face. Nor would I roll over on someone else to squirm out of a punishment. 
Yes. Not all gym teachers are the same. Mine was great, helped all the students learn sports, was motivating, and was also a useful sex ed teacher (for you pervs, no, she taught a real class). This was a public school. 
All of these suggestions about how to make it permanent are missing the point entirely. The reason they want them to be temporary is because they want players to keep supporting their teams split after split (a portion of the proceeds go to their respective teams).Icons sort of already work this way because they just slap a new year onto them.That said it still feels crummy in my opinion.
I recently purchased a fairly large collection of rocks, and minerals from an estate. Unfortunately, the specimens were not labeled. I identified the easier ones but am having trouble with quite a few. I'll post more in the future. Thanks!
Just about everything haha. It's my first bike (just picked it up about a week ago) so I'm not pushing it hard yet. So easy to ride though, I picked it up 80 miles away from home and had zero problems riding it back without ever having ridden a bike more than a few hundred feet before. Very smooth and predictable power delivery too. Just put 250 miles on it yesterday.
Wrong.  Adam and Brian provide context and rationale for all of their scores - every game, every round.  Here's Gina, on almost every guess: "Uhhhh...I'm goin with 43....".  You accuse me of ignoring the facts, but it is you who are ignoring the facts.
I'm sorry you are going through a hard time.I'm sure you have heard about vaping, it certainly worked for me.All the nicotine you choose without as much harm.
Alright Jets. Switch to a 4-3 and draft Williams, lol.Actually, just draft any offensive player. I don't care who. The Jets' problem ain't the defense.
Turns out it was just a temporary short circuit. As soon as I pulled out all of the ram, video card, etc and power cycled, then reseated it all it worked fine. I live in a house from the 20s, and I haven't been using a UPS unit. Which I will do from now on.
I'm hoping the Lions go OT first round**First OT off the board:**  Brandon Scherff (Redskins)Second OT off the board:  Ereck Flowers (Giants)Third OT off the board:  Andrus Peat (Saints)Fourth OT off the board: Cedric Oghuehi (Bengals)Fifth OT off the board: DJ Humphries (Cardinals)
Nah, the Ryder was a semiauto with an extended mag, handled more like a Stomper combat rifle with reduced damage than anything else. Really useless when you realize you could be using those sniper rifle rounds to feed something with a little more bite, like a Cobra, or Bessie.
Williams didn't even go 5th, maybe we were missing something, im not disappointed, i thought he was right but you know, we really did need some offensive help.
This is why we like cycling.  So much can go wrong so much has to go right to win.  Froome's bad form/luck just shows how fragile victory is in this sport.  We all know this but put it out of mind.  So much can go so wrong so fast.  Sometimes a whole year of preparation can be pissed away due to stuff that isn't the riders fault.
Hurricane Sanders will blow Hillary away from the east coast. He will give the GOP 3rd degree Berns. We will all dance the Bernie on election day. The fuel of students, the intellectual youth, and all those who want real, honest to motherfucking change, will not just melt, but Bern steel beams, dank memes, and jet seams alike. 
I completely agree with this. It's always nice to have that countdown- something to look forward to that breaks up the time between now and the distant end date.

My friend is a Titans fan. I think I'm going to live the most exciting season opening game of my life. I just hope that bith QB will end up leading their respective teams for a long time so I can enjoy that rivalry longer.

The problem is DLCs rarely go on sale so even if you get the base game on sale at $20 and there is $40 of DLC, you'll still be paying full price for a five year old game.
IUPAC accepts both. "Aluminium" only exists b/c a random, snobbish person wouldn't accept Sir Humphry Davy's second choice of name (aluminum). Oddly, several other metals that had already been discovered ended in "-um". "Aluminum" is also consistent w/ "alumina" (as in the oxide; this in turn is consistent with the oxides of other metals ending in "-um", whereas those ending in "-ia" have oxides that also end in "-ia").
I think it's too early for Destiny novels, as Bungie needs to tell more of the story in game. Maybe after Destiny 3 will there be a substantial lore and story for novels.

I lived in Fukuoka Japan, SoftBank's home city in South-Western Japan, and that's where my wife grew up.  They are well known for having a very strong Baseball team but I never thought they would get into sailing.  Even with deep pockets, I'm sure they will need a lot of expertise from Oracle.  Good find my friend.

I would agree, but given [how small those vans are](http://i.imgur.com/QqpJtiR.png) I don't see how a man can enter a van without a severed spine, but leave with it 80% severed, without something malicious taking place. It borderline defies the laws of physics to say he inflicted that kind of injury upon himself, especially considering he was restrained with his hands behind his back and in shackles. 
Honestly Shovel Knight was one of the best games of 2014. I already have it on the 3DS but I'm considering buying again on PSN so that I can fight Kratos.

Lucifer Dredd chuckled. *how dare she threaten me.

Hey there BMRr! Are you looking for meal or dessert recipes? If it's the latter, my wife who's a trained baker came up with a recipe for [Pumpkin Spice Praline Mousse Cake](http://www.mywifemakes.com/2014/10/26/pumpkin-spice-praline-mousse-cake/). It tasted GREAT (one of the best cakes I ever had, no bias)! But was also really time-consuming to put together. It requires a little bit of technical knowledge but isn't impossible to pull off. Maybe this will be the kind of challenge you're looking for?If it's meal recipes, I think I can put together a list of stuff I came across from the Internet and post them here! Let me know. :)
Haha, you really don't know when you are not welcome, do you? Fuck off, and don't try and redefine words that are in the dictionary to support your racist ideas.
This games population is going to surge when the movie comes out because there are going to be only 2 other Star Wars games released this year.Star Wars: Battlefront is a battlefield clone meaning you play as grunt 12345 who just got exploded, no lightsabers(for you atleast) y'all, fun if you want to be a grunt IMO though. Ok, this game could really fun(others were) without the lightsabers I'm really not trying to ride this one.Star Wars: Battlepod, an on rails arcade shooter, which I'm also guessing no lightsabers for you.Then you got a f2p, you don't even have to pay people money, Star Wars: Knights of the Od Republic. Free + lightsabers = I hope you guys are prepared for The Great Marauder/Sentinel Uprising of December 2015.
The dismissive categorisation made me uncomfortable, especially as a lot of it came from an implied position as a spokesman for the community as a whole. I don't know if he got caught up in the moment, but some of the things he said were rather extreme. It was getting to the stage where they were almost saying that only their approved categories of people should have a voice and that voice was being fully represented here, but thankfully Robin pulled it back from there a bit.

The ipad mini version is lumped with the ipad air. Until I get a device to develop on, there's nothing I can do. The funding campaign for this is the giant red thermometer on the right. I am not sure if xmod has updated yet to accommodate for the latest version of clash of clans. Try checking your cydia to see if they have pushed out an update for xmod yet. 
Stop acting like it's so horrible think how much more balanced our offense if gonna be now?! And these coaches will be able to get the best out of our defense even without Williams! We still won!
Yep. Yes he could be a bust, he could be a future Hall of Famer, we don't know yet but if our staff has enough trust in him to draft him #2 overall and turned down all those trade offers we were supposedly offered then I'm sold.
Class of '10. Worcester is full of great food and is worth exploring. Don't be scared but don't be stupid. The work is as hard as you want it to be and expect the results to equal the work. If you can, get the Hughes suite 150 and live in the room second on the right. There is an air duct access vent in the (as you enter) far left corner of the room that can be popped open and gotten into. The correct combo of doors/windows opened/closed make a rather....advantageous air flow. General college advise: work out, do your homework, and the only thing stopping you from having fun is you. Seek out as much stuff as you can and keep and open mind because who knows. Edit: according to a commenter below if you're not into community service you don't belong. That is boohickey.Edit 2: second on the left as you enter the suite. 
I'm fairly new to bass fishing so I'll pass along some of the tips I've picked up. Any color worms or green baby bass lures seem to work pretty well for me. You can pick them up from Walmart. You may also want to get very small circle or cone weights. I like to switch it up between no weight and weight to keep the bass on their toes...

Galatians 5:4 "You who are trying to be justified by the law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace." Here, "the law" refers to the law of moses. From my understanding of much of the letters in the new testament, the old law is sepererate from the teachings of christ, so it might be right to separate old testimate teachings from Christian doctrine. (ie Christians can eat shrimp despite it being against the law of moses)

Unless you convince people to work for india level wages, manufacturing is never coming back. No western country has ever been able to convince manufacturing to go back. The only manufacturing that will come back will be done either by robots or automation. 
I am really confused about this regarding it's value. I had this and JBLU in my portfolio because I like their model. But the strange this is despite the fact that they both pull in similar numbers (percentage-wise), JBLU is doing much, much better than VA. I was going to sell last friday to cut my losses, but I was absolutely positive that VA would beat estimates. To my horror, they went down 5% :(You win some, you lose some. I'm just gonna long this.
As you said in your title, you are looking at circular motion. How would the centripetal force be changed by a change in mass? How would this change in force affect the centripetal acceleration? Yes, you will need the law of universal gravitation. 
I just wanna be able to brofist the bot before jumping out of the carrier. Maybe in single player theres more background to the specific bot or relationship to the main character and he gives you varying dialogues/gestures of encouragement.

Learn to love watching this team even when we're losing by 30. Because we're going to be losing by 30 a lot. Seriously, the only thing that I ask of any Titans fan is be supportive of our guys past, present, and future. We are a small family, but we are fortunate nonetheless to have guys like Delanie Walker going out there and busting it for us every play. And fortunate to have new fans like you coming in! 
Calm down.  They are going to sit on him until whatever round they can get in exchange for him in addition to other compensation.Hoping anyone else with a lower pick offers something better.Or they legitimately want him and then philly never had a shot anyways.

Hmmm.... Isaac being voiced kind of removes a bit of player identification. It would have worked better had he remained silent except for screams as in DS1.
Over the years, I have become desensitized to the "humor" that is on the internet. I laugh occasionally, but it has to be the right thing. I *never* laugh at pictures anymore. The only thing that can sometimes get a laugh is a good video, like many of the ones in this subreddit.
But they're still not that great - and they're more expensive! And you have to go and find one after you've done your grocery shopping (and it's America, so you'll probably have to fucking drive to it). Yes, I CAN go to a bakery to buy good bread - but it's a pain that I have to, when I'm used to getting it at the supermarket with everything else. Even the shittiest, cheapest, store-bought, supermarket value bread is much better quality than good quality supermarket bread in the US. We're not trying to be snobby about it, it's just true. Your bread tastes like air.
I know that, but I'm a curious person and I've loved the Terminator franchise since I saw the first movie.  I saw Salvation several times, and that still flopped, so...
Not necessarily if I hop in a st14 bubble from behind the titan I can shotgun melee him if he is running weapons of light or even blessing of light. Awareness is key I win 95% of those encounters. If it's armor of light bubble then it's a 50/50 shot with that tactic if I'm using my felwinters lie with final round. If i have a teammate with me and we're playing control sometimes it's worth it to sacrifice one to get rid of the bubble. So saying jumping into a st14 bubble makes some one a bad player is just a dumb thing to say.  
I hate, hate, hate this, burgers are not inherently unhealthy, it's beef, bread, and maybe some ketchup, mustard, onion and lettuce. Like $1 buys you a 250 calorie McDonalds hamburger, sometimes I will grab three of them for lunch if I am feeling lazy/in a hurry.A burger is fine, eat burgers all the time, the only issue with burgers is when you load them up with cheese and special sauce and order a big fry to go with them.You want pizza? Pro-tip, go to the grocery store, fine the cheapest frozen thin crust pepperoni pizza, peel the pepperoni off and throw it in the trash, That pizza, the entire pizza is going to probably have around 800 calories give or take. Pizza is only a problem when you get one of the greasy, bready, cheezy, oily monstrosities like a plain cheese pizza or Pizza Hut or Domino's or whatever. Light breakfast, healthy lunch, 30 minute workout and you can put the entire fucking pizza away for dinner and stay under 1500 net calories for the day.
Haha I maintain that my butt isn't that big, it's my legs and hips and the butt is just part of the package!  But yeah, I did the same as you for many years.  It's nice now that I don't have to worry about my pants gaping open in the back when I sit down.
Only 5 matches completed, so far it's been OK but not great.  Almost got results against 2 of the 3 best teams in the league, though we were a bit lucky to be in it against Roseborg.  Still, 3-2 away to the top club in the league isn't too bad.I'm worried that we'll spend much of the season fighting to stay above the relegation places.  Hopefully we'll be able to put some space between us and 14th by mid-July.

well looks like there is an adaptor available that'll let you hook up regular speakers which is nice http://www.ebay.com/itm/6c-sony-home-theater-speaker-cable-wire-plug-connectors-4-2mm-CheckCompatibility-/220825835959 and probably best optionI think if turntable is all you can upgrade now, I'd still go for it.  Likely you'll hear it sound better. If not, then, down the road, you definitely will if/when upgrade speakers. I recommended the debut carbon which is like, $130 cheaper on massdrop so maybe that opens up budget room for vintage speakers or something.

Budgeting in 5 easy steps.1. Get mad about your situation, mad enough to change it.2. Compare apples to apples of your income vs bills.3. Look at your income as a tool.  How much of it will you dedicate to everything you owe every month.4. Roof over head?  Food on table?  Pay YOURSELF first!  Who cares if you eat out from time to time if you have the money to do it with out loosing your roof /shirt / food?5.  Build savings as a monthly expense that you MUST pay, not an option of what is left.Those are 5 easy steps.  Not the only steps, but some easy ones.
My local salvage outlet just got a whole pile of stuff pretty marked down. I bought quite a bit of it in hopes of reselling it. All the craft stuff is 'buy it now' but if you message me with the code I'll refund 10%. Hope you find something you like! 
There are a lot of elements in ME3 that suggest the Reapers are attempting Indoctrination as it was described in the novels. The ending isn't a dream, though. Indoctrination isn't some complex metaphorical vision where a choice you make in a dream correlates with some other thing happening in reality. Indoctrination is about changing a person's beliefs and values through subtle manipulation.I think people went searching for excuses to discredit something and stumbled onto a real subplot.

Conservative here. Bernie winning the nomination would be good for the GOP. Hillary and O'Malley are better choices for the Democrats if they are interested in winning. Sanders for President has McGovern/Goldwater written all over it, at least as close to it as the current map would allow.

Yeah, I've heard some reviewers say the writing is awkward but it never really seemed that way to me. Essentially,  their writing style is very similar to *Hard in Hightown*, which I guess is supposed to come off as poorly written too, but I wouldn't notice the flaws if they weren't pointed out to me. (I'm guessing Gaider wrote those codex entries.)
Huh.  I think I get what you're saying, but now you're saying something that doesn't make sense to me no matter how hard *I* try.I can think of a bunch of reasons why people would do this (desire for attention at all costs, money, etc).  None of them are things I am willing to consider because the trade-offs are too great (as you point out).  I think it may be educational and/or entertaining to try and imagine what someone's life would be like to make them want to lie to people they care about, via meaningful topics?Either way, I can see possibilities that make sense for others, none for me.  Is that what you mean?
Jets have the best defense and it arguably just got better. Rex Ryan is wondering if he can get his old job back. They're getting best available and filling their need.Wow.
I'm shocked that a dealer gave that much run around. I had presumed it was a private sale so I was wondering why you were even paying them for the title costs in the first place.  Even waiting until AFTER the sale is closed to say you owe another $350 for title and registration costs instead of charging it at the dealership with the initial paperwork sounds pretty scammy.  I've bought lots of cars over the years (although none in your state) and the title and tax costs for purchases from a dealer (new or used) have always been included on the same final invoice for the car that shows the total due on the bottom of the page.I'd sue him for the $700.  If you thin you should go ahead and include the $350 then be my guest but I think that you're going to have to pay for at least one set of title costs and I don't think it is a good idea to beef up a claim for stuff you're not entitled to.
Nah. Mayer is a juggernaut when it comes to his prowess at playing the guitar and blues, it doesn't excuse him being somewhat of a douchenozzle though. 
Why does it suck? Ambition has classically been a negative thing and detrimental to anyone without the means to achieve their ambitions. It takes a larger-than-life individual to thrive from their ambition.
Active force in public. Riding on a bus is my favourite.  You can close your eyes if you want and not look too out of place, but you learn to concentrate and hold your tulpa in focus no matter what else is going on.  
Empathy that we evolved to have as a cooperative species. Same reason certain animals help each other out instead of just fending for themselves, like the story on the front page this week about the study involving rats who will stop pressing a button that gives them food, once they realize that it seems to hurt a nearby rat when they press it. Plenty of studies like this have been done. Animals foregoing their self-interest for the benefit of others is not a specifically human trait and thus seemingly does not need a magical soul from God in order to be that way.

Idk how recently this was in effect but he said in one interview that he went abroad and tried to shut out all music so that he wasn't influenced by anyone but himself. That's why he has the line about the beeper in LPFJII. He literally got rid of his phone and carried a beeper to disconnect from everything else. So I'm not surprised he hasn't listens to to pimp a butterfly yet. 
I quite agree with you on all of that. I was just trying to think about what she literally stated there with regard to the larger scheme of things rather than focus on her feelings.Those little things you pointed out are all good, I noticed a few of them at the time but forgot later.
Since when have you been using logic?In dollars, just how much do you think a pound of beef  or sugar would go up without subsidies?This is going to shock you, but we don't live in a world with level playing fields.

i get that dave's talking about the complexity and.. nebulosity? of sexuality and what not.. but it'd be nice to get some kind of clarity about his personal deal and the whole davekat thing because it's still being danced around imo (idk i might need to reread this part)but still, gr8 upd8 and if we get this for ALL the character select options i'm hyped as fuck
Women never fucking flush the toilets in public restrooms and always leave dribble on the seats too.   Source: I'm a female who has to wait until I get home bc the public restrooms are too disgusting.

Yup it was bullshit. As much as I love Ferraris, they are a bunch of uptight control freaks. Bunch of pussies who won't allow a test with the 918 and P1.

If he doesn't care, then how is he having fun?Also, all four of them said at one point that they just don't like Mario Party 10, so there weren't different opinions, just different attitudes.
&gt; fire all but one of his employees and the citizens will notice no difference in the rate of crime in that countyhaha. Actually, according to the NC FBI, fire all but one of his employees and the crime rate will go DOWN!
Who are you going to play there, Tejada?  He is a much better defender than Flores (as most competent MLB players are), but he's still not a great defending SS, and he can't hit.  While Wright and d'Arnaud are out of the lineup, it would be tough to slot Tejada in there, too.Flores still leads the team in HRs.  But, I'm sure he's also leading the team in games lost because of his inability to play baseball.  I'm hoping this one isn't another notch on that stat.
My problem with OWB is that it gives too many perks. Like way too many. I feel like played DM with them would take away from the cramped, desparate, "oh god, oh god, oh god" feeling that it supposed to have. 
Parity also means that when MLS finally catches up with Liga MX, most of its teams would have caught up with it too; making MLS the better league, in general, of the two.
It actually looks awesome.  A lot of artists go out of their way to fugly-up their lines when doing medieval-style things and don't get it half as right as this.
Threw a soul vortex at a guy when he spawned in for a duel, he rolled with it instead of away. One more soul spear and he was finished.Sent me mail saying "wow, what a noob"I replied "Don't be so hard on yourself, I think you did okay"....I got a kick out of it at least 
"but even when using a stock car, players have the option to have a paint job the color of their crew, so every color is possible on a stock car, in a race."
Feel free to ask me anything about the Nexus 6.  I'm just flashing the 5.1 update and charging the phone.  There shouldn't be too much to ask since it is an upgraded version of the Nexus 5.  Stock Android is almost functionally perfect.
I didn't say shouldn't so idk why people are getting that from itA guy can wear the same suit everyday like that aussie news anchor did but how women dress is overly scrutinized because we're expected to care about fashion.People on this website are obsessed with down-voting anything that doesn't perfectly align with their world view.
That's one way to interpret the character, I suppose. I always thought his desire to impress his father was just to avoid punishment and continue to be allowed to do the (horrible, fucked up) things he likes to do.
&gt; Seeing a law we disagree with and just breaking it.Pretty sure they are trying that in Baltimore and Philly right now. How does it look like that is turning out?
I used the values from [this page](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/drag-coefficient-d_627.html) for a rectangular box.I used the formulas from [this page](http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Terminal-Velocity).
yes, I have tried it and did have some immediate success. It didn't last but I realized that I think this is a med that needs to be cycled (i.e 3 weeks on 3 weeks off kind of thing.) I'm thinking of trying it again. Has the success continued? I hope so. I'm very curious to know. My main symptoms were bloating.
if you're playing an FPS and some texture stupidity brings you down to 16 fps, then you are going to want that 16 fps.  35 Hz is barely 1 dropped frame.  This isn't very good execpt for the most stable FPS games.
Folks at my local hackerspace were discussing it with some fervor, decided to check it out."Obtained" a copy to check if I liked it and if it would work on my (linux) system, bought it at full price within a few days after becoming firmly convinced that it was a most excellent game and worth every cent...In fact, I've bought it a few times now, usually via giving steam keys to folks because I think Squad were under-selling themselves for a while there ;)
Actually, it's not odd at all. A big part of fear is fear of the unknown - you conquer that when you learn a bit of the physics around flight, how controls work, and how the plane reacts to them. It makes perfect sense, to me!
&gt; I get the exact point, its not that complicated. My point is the stereotype is objectively true, despite it being politically incorrect to say so.Tell me what this means: "The standard deviation for scores is far higher than the disparity of the mean score between men and women."
Oh sweetie, no, just no. 15 year old girls are just as interested in sex as 15 year old guys are. What you're actually spitting out is a bunch of tired stereotypes that have been repeatedly disproven. Sexual roles in society are not predetermined. It's honestly sad that you think so. Men can be great parents, women can be great providers. If seriously think this way, you're holding yourself back. 
TIL Canada are cucks to SJWsWTF the police are involved, Jesus if this was back in the CoD4 days I'd be a sex offender for being a serial Tea-bagger 
My little regional bank got whacked (and I told their VP for personal banking it was coming like two years before it did), and I got the whole 500 they screwed me out of! =)
Stop spreading lies.  This guy was not banned for "bringing a negative image upon Magic" and no amount of quotation marks can make it true.  He was banned because he took candid photos of people in compromising positions and publicly mocked them on the internet.  He did it without anyone's consent and did it to make fun of these people.  Whether there's too many ass cracks visible at Magic tournaments doesn't make what he did alright.  
Well, no, I pulled up those stats because you wanted to talk about Zambia and their city is more comparable to our cities than a remote area where the chief has a two-room hut. I shouldn't have, as it's such an absurd reply.&gt; A: "Poverty breeds violence."&gt; B: "Not in the wilderness of Zambia!"
Michael Jackson was supposed to record an album with Freddie Mercury, but he wanted to take his pet llama with him into the recording booth. This was too stupid for Mercury so he cancelled the whole recording. 
&gt;and called me a liar when I told him I'd never even considered cheating on him because "Everyone thinks about it."He is totally projecting on you. He probably thinks of cheating regularly and he doesn't want to feel guilty for it so he has to say "everyone thinks about it!!!" 
I have no assumptions or expectations other than looking for a good story. I am simply enjoying this series.I do not let science, physics or rules get in the way of a good story. These were meant to be enjoyed the way they were told. I may ask questions, but merely from curiosity or related to the story plot.That is what I am doing. Otherwise I'd probably read very little posted here. PS: How could anyone miss the firefly references?
So let me get this straight, Men get paid more then women on average only because they take different jobs, but in the SAME job women get paid more then men? 
When you cleaned the yellow gunk out, you removed too much of the beneficial bacteria. Then the pump stopped working so the remaining bacteria couldn't get fresh water and compounds to eat and so they died. The cycle crashed and shrimp are more sensitive than fish. Betta likes fresh water and confusing you so he made a bubble nest. 0.25 and 0.5 isn't extremely bad. Fix pump, check levels and change water often. It will have to cycle again.
I'm quite new to this, but hopefully someone can give me a recommendation. I'm looking for a species that can grow relatively well in my office during the week. Meaning purely fluorescent light during the week, while I plan to bring it home over the weekends. 
I'm assuming that you're in high school by your post. If that's the case, see what clubs there are on campus! It's a great way to get involved in your community, but also to fill your lunches. You can also volunteer for marathons and other races. If there are any nursing homes, pet shelters, or homeless shelters nearby, they all accept volunteers. You can call them up, and find out what programs they have. Regardless of Reddit's opinion of religion, churches often have tons of opportunities, as well.
This might be an unpopular opinion but I take it only when drunk or high. When you're buzzed from alcohol I take like 0.5mg and from there till I'm where I want to be. Benzos and alcohol are not that dangerous if you know your limits and take it slow. When I'm high 0.5mg xan are a must for my anxiety which is sky high when I smoke (yeah I'm one of the paranoid ones). Just take it easy and it won't be any of the horror stories you read online
Im a little late but this has been my favorite combat video. Can't see much of anything but just being out in the middle of nowhere with a minigun on your humvee seems intense.  https://youtu.be/gyAaIKF6tSQ
I've found that straightening the wrists, so that you are using the area along the bottom of your palm and the base of your thumb to hold you up helps.
I did that... with four bags in a 55 gallon.  I'm pretty sure someone has done the same in an even bigger tank.  I didn't have a python and was nowhere near the outside or a bathroom anyway and had to clean the whole thing with buckets.  Fun times!
You need DL, ILB, OLB, CB2 just off the top of my head on defense.  WR is also a need as you guys only have boldin and TE is something you might have to address considering how horrendous davis was last season.

Honestly I just didn't know. I've only ever had my wisdom teeth cut out by an oral surgeon referred by my dentist and did get a few percs but I didn't know. 
The incident that happened to your party was unfortunate.  I will see that an investigation takes place to see what exactly took place.  You are very mu ky to have escaped in good health.[M]Thanks for the update.  This president is pro democracy and all that jazz but doubtful he will apologize for what someone else was responsible for.
i hope your parents told everyone to send "It's a girl (with a penis)!" balloons. i know that's how they'll describe you to everyone even when it's entirely unnecessary. or maybe the balloons should say "It's a ???"
My son was given the TDAP and MMR *three months ago* and is still running at least a 99.7 fever each and every day.Despite probiotics, he has also had diarrhea **each and every day since the day the vaccines were administered**.My fiance made the decision to vaccinate and not a day goes by that her bad decision doesn't bring her to uncontrollable crying and tears. She thinks  that she damaged him for life.We'll have to see how severe the autism is (God forbid) once he's old enough. I'm pretty sure that he has it because he woke up the next day as a **totally different child**; distant, not continuously happy, etc. I'm documenting every day that goes by since he was damaged by the shots.Parents, why take the chance to have what happened to my boy happen to yours to prevent some basically non-existent 19th century diseases that are readily cured with conventional medicine? It's asinine...nothing more than Russian Roulette with your kids' mind.
Without the content ecosystem this read isn't the best deal ever. The RM170 price tag is quite steep, and why not launch it over Google Store instead of a local carrier? 
I think it'll be more of a drama centered around the main characters' families, but if they're going to appeal to their core audience (e.g. us) they'll have to show some catastrophic, apocalyptic shit. I can't wait. 
There goes the player that I was afraid we'd get who I wanted the least. Thank God! Scherff sucks at pass blocking. He does make plays run blocking, but he misses assignments too. Not feeling bad about missing out on him. 
I personally had a lot of problems with the administration at Clark, and had no particular love for the student culture... so I'll keep my advice academics centered. As a history major: if Doug Little is still teaching courses (administration may have poached him since I was there) you should definitely prioritize his classes when scheduling. His course on American Policy in the Middle East is probably his best.If you can convince the history department to let you count a course in the screen studies department as one of your in major electives, definitely take a course with Hugh Manon if he's teaching a film history overview. He was by a wide margin, hands down the best lecturer I had at Clark. PM me if you have any specific questions about the history department at Clark. 
Well I haven't found a video which finish an interrogation match quicker than mine so for now this is the quickest interrogation match. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7glBTQ5JSo
Of course it's subttle! If I didn't want to be subtle I'd have been straight forward and just told them "Hey guys, I'm gay.".They noticed it pretty quick because, like /u/HankMardewkus said I put a lot of shitty cars to make the colors when usually I only have the red motorcycle.The title would probably have been better if it was "This is what I used to help me come out to my gamer friends".Anyway, the only important thing is that now they know and are totally OK with it!
Aha.. Yes you are right. Thanks a lot for the feedback! I guess i could put some EQ on those parts to make the vocals stand out more. Or any other tricks i should consider? Right now its just a compressor on the master channel. Thanks again!
&gt;Tired of all the anti-science nonsense in the media.&gt;As far as corporations go, Monsanto is actually pretty great.Wow, how science-y of you.

 "Perhaps they did." *A crooked smile haunts his lips.*  *The girl's smile is as bright as the sun, yallow and blinding but gladly not as blinding as the Janus child he'd bump into. Recalling if the last few events, he lets out a slight dismayed groan.*

**[Gotta Watch WHAT?! Episode - 01A: Alien](http://gottawatchwhat.com/?p=65)*** So after our Prometheus podcast we sat down and watched Alien together and recorded this quick conversation right afterwards. This was Jake and Mike’s first time viewing this sci-fi classic. Amazing how timeless Alien is and how dated Prometheus already is.
I love how all the armchair experts that took a couple glances at a mock draft are saying all of these teams that spend months and years watching players are wrong
He's actually literally Luries. But we'll take him. We don't usually get many picks early in the first round, so we'll see. You'd think with all that practice, the Jags would be better at it as well.
the biggest thing they will ever do for load times is get off the single threaded decompression. i think we are all looking forward to the end of "loading commander". lol! the sooner the better! i hope the next patch has that! (v1.1.2 PTU does not)    to be fair tho, i can already tell you its not a huge improvement in load time. (one of my accounts has 18 ships &amp; many weapons, the other has one aurora). spawn time between the accounts and load outs does change, but not by that many seconds to be a massive improvement. (fwiw OS is m.2 xp941, SC installed on raid-0 mushkin scorpion delux pcie SSD's. even then its only about 20 seconds faster than my laptop with two slow raid-0 msata ssd's).
i dont get it, even with rekkles they cant compete with eastern god adcs, why cant fnct develop steelback, this is his first split ever....and also rekkles just been rekkles he is not getting better the only possibility is hes getting worse or stay at same level...
Maybe not you, but what about all those vulture VCs? What happens to those patents if BitGo goes out of business and sells off those patents? You can't guarantee they won't be used in an offensive manner. You're piggy backing on open source software, benefiting from the hard work of others, but now you want to shut everyone else out using archaic patent structures which you know damn well will be abused. 
"Comrade" and its equivalents are often used by Communists, but its not a Russian thing in particular (and they wouldn't even be saying "comrade", they would say "tovarich". "Comrade" is the English version). I still upvoted though because it is funny.
The prior episode may have been an error but the window on that side of the house was not the EoP/Bill when shown and the window wasn't show in NWHS so maybe the most recent is the most correct design we saw? There were plenty of things in earlier episodes that had to be fixed like the stairway error.
Pillows! Afterwards I'd swan dive into the pile. That's safe right? Worst case scenario, I start the most extravagant pillow fight in New York history and bringing it to an end when I splat on the ground.
Well the concept of religion has been present since the very earliest humans, there's no way to know how old gay sex is but either way it couldn't be older than religion.
Well today I found out someone stole my Ned Stark figure from my desk so I informed them that until my hostage was returned one of them would be put to death each day.All jokes of course before the one person who doesn't understand sarcasm submits this to the news.
I noticed that the player count went form 15,000-20,000 all of a sudden to 5,000-6,000.Most of my friends told me they were playing GTA instead...other than that, I don't know what happened.

Yes. in the picture the white wire is positive soldered to the pin the black wire is soldered to the box. The chip in between the battery sled and the 510 connection is the charging board. Notice with an atty screwed down flush the positive wire smashes into the charging board. There is tissue paper or cotton taped over the charging board.

The artist's [deviantART gallery](http://lakehurwitz.deviantart.com/gallery/) and [website](http://www.demonui.com).Magpies are notoriously opportunistic birds, brazenly going about collecting any and all interesting objects that come under their gaze. [According to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-billed_magpie#Relationship_with_humans), "When Lewis and Clark first encountered magpies in 1804 in South Dakota, they reported the birds as being very bold, entering tents or taking food from the hand."
I believe so, but I'm not sure.  Don't quote me on itI do know that the PS4 sends an authentication challenge to the DS4 every few seconds.  The controller has to respond to this authentication challenge with the appropriate response.  If it doesn't, the controller is disconnected.Whether the response is generated from a separate chip or not I'm not sure.  But either way... this means a controller has to be officially licensed by Sony in order for it to work with the PS4.  And I'm not sure if Sony is licensing third-party controllers yet.---There is also a huge addition to the DualShock 4 that third-party manufactures never had to worry about before:  The touchpad.
As long as questrade is offering free buys it's going to be cheaper regardless of your investment amount.  I believe the CCP recommends these more expensive options because complexity scares people away.  They would rather recommend Tangerine and have people actually invest then try to set up a Questrade account get overwhelmed by the options and decide not to invest at all.If someone doesn't want to use Questrade or virtual brokers for whatever reason then trading costs become relevant again as most brokers don't offer free etf buys.
I think the biggest problem with Valve is over the past 5 or so years, they've really distanced themselves from the community it feels. The whole mod debacle shows just how disconnected they are.
But another apartment complex? I agree, not a fun area. I drive down shitty grove/gore, destroying my shocks, to get to bridge street just to avoid the lights and idiots between there and Russo's.
"When i grow up i want to start a Cop-Killers group:D we walk up to them from behind with a suppressed 9mm and shoot them in the neck or the back!:DD specially the fat ones, those are the best to kill because the bullet makes less contact sound because of the fat.

First of all, register for a flair, second of all this is sketchy as fuck.Paying 95% of market in cash."I like transacting quickly, so don't be slow." Go fast men ))"I don't care what skins they are as long as the $50 is divided up by at least 4 skins and each skins is worth $4+." You dont care about what you're buying at 95% market price in cash? Why even buy it then?
Different time; less mollycoddling, fewer lawsuits, stricter schools, better behaved students.The gear change left no bruises and did no damage at all, it was an excellent punishment.
I'm worried for him. He could be successful for you because you have a lot of young talented receivers and a fantastic TE in Walker but your O-Line might just get him killed like Locker and Mett.

Yeah! How dare they agree with the economic views of someone who doesn't share all of their views on all issues. Why do people so readily assume that everyone has to fall in one camp or another? Your comment represents everything that is wrong with how Americans view politicians. 
Amiibo: RosainaIn Box or Out of Box: EitherPackaging (US, EUR, JP, Doesn't Matter): Doesn't MatterReason: She was the first Amiibo I couldn't get after starting collecting really late in the game. I had no idea these things were so hard to find.
Most of the time yes, however sometimes it's just wherever you can find a space in the crowd.Also we stand on the right on escalators, let people walk up them on the left.
I reported it when it broke, not sure why it was never fixed. It's obviously a bug though :-). Archer/Bard are 60 second warmup, as stated. Rogue shouldn't be any different.
I have a teddy, he is my lamby (he is a lamb btw, not just called lamby). My husband bought him for me, and he is my bedtime pal. I will look for him before I go to sleep, calling out 'lamby, lamby? LAAAAAAMMBBBYYYYYY' when I find him, then get into bed, under my dragon blankie, cuddle my lamby and my husband and go to sleep. However, my husband has told me, on numerous occasions, when he gets up to go to work, I will hunt for my lamby in my sleep, and call out 'lamby' when i find it, snuggle it, and go back to sleep I actually forgot one thing we do together...we have our own growl language, we'll growl at each other, understand it, then carry on 
Well, i worked at a beer restaurant/brewery for 3 years during college (it was full of tourists all the time) and i have yet to meet any person from europe who actually likes american beer. 
Depending on which version this was, if this was the 30 stamina version, I recommend inserting him into your team for his special.  Will cut down the fight time significantly.  I plan on keeping a lvl 3 Mihawk in my roster for that very purpose for when Monster Chopper and other event isles show up.

18, work as a housemaid 40 hours a week since november. I have never had a problem with my feet hurting but I always make sure my shoes are super comfortable even if they look like shit. Even crocs suffice (ugly as fuck but way too comfortable). I stretch quite a lot too, even my feet. I exercise often, lots of running and also snow sports, so my feet and ankles are used to the behaviour. Hope this helps
Unfortunately, sometimes it can be interpreted by your brain as "Something is wrong, I need to press the brake harder to stop" instead of "Maybe I'm hitting the wrong pedal" for a little too long. Sometimes you catch it early, sometimes your instincts take over for the worse.
I'm 20 hours into the game. I still feel like I'm complete shit and so bad at the battle system.The normal encounters are fun and good but whenever a bossfight comes up I'm just like "Holy shit. I deal *NO* damage. Am I really supposed to beat the dude?" and it ends with me bullshit-tanking the boss for what feels like 30min...
If they don't have enough functionality for you, don't buy them. Amiibo tap is a good way for someone who only knows Mario to play classic games from other franchises for free. Yes, free, you paid for the amiibo, not the demos. 
I often compare it to hell because I suffered a mental breakdown at the time.  Not sure about cause and effect.  No worries.  Like I said, it all worked out.
Yeah, you recall correctly. I believe he said that the reason he didn't do a larger sample size was because of how the data process was manual and extremely time consuming.
I only work about 5 hours a week as a engineering consultant for nasa.   The pay isn't great but my wife is running for congress so I get to help her with her campaign.  So that's kinda nice.  
I have a brother sister set from the same litter who I adopted together because I thought being litter mates would automatically make them bonded and love each other. Nope. They only just tolerate each other and haven't snuggled together since the first week we brought them home.
All is pretty good here.  I even had a case in which something that went in an unplanned and unpreferred way worked out for the best - in coming back to write the rent check I noticed that the water heater was leaking, so I could let the rental agency know when dropping off the check.I'm home and settling in. Will get to exercises shortly.&gt;You inspire me to find all the fun I can in things! I bet you make everything more fun.  I know that *I* would have more fun doing anything with you :)
Steal a bike, paint it a different colour (which you will have bought with the $10) and sell it for half its market price. Now you might have over $100.

&gt;Then why not share the link in the post you just made?Because I don't really care to go back and edit it. Why does it matter where he link is? It doesn't, you are doing the same thing the other smacktard is doing, you had your mind made up from the beginning and don't really care.&gt;But that's fine, I'll trust some random dude on Reddit who can barely write in complete sentences, citing a (possibly non-existent) source on YouTube instead of the CDC.Sargon is actually a fairly famous YouTuber, maybe you should look him up instead of continuously talking out of your ass. Why would I source the CDC when **their study is the faulty one**, that makes no utter sense. The articles I gave you cited the CDC and gave examples of the issues and even has screenshots of the issues from the CDC report.I don't know how someone can be so obstinate despite the world of evidence showing their opinion is wrong and their logic is faulty.
I live in an area with rather hard water and I do wash my hair, just not as often as I should. Fads often are the worst though... I still remember that "skinny tea" or whatever that was actually a laxative. 
That doesn't explain why the Americans would be dropping them on the Soviets. If they'd included them in the toiletries packages they were apparently sending, that would make sense. But they said they were just gonna air-drop condoms. 
I really wish they'd talk about all figures this way. No more spending XX billion here &amp; cutting XX billion there, they should be saying increasing the budget by % of the total. Everything should be done as a percentage as absolute figures are totally meaningless to most people. 
&gt; Perhaps the California-style turn would help.Sadly it wouldn't. I was right-hooked in California by a driver who turned suddenly across the bike lane with no signal. Who then proceeded to attempt to hit and run; and then after I took his photo, got out of his car and screamed that I'd dented his car.Laws don't guarantee compliance. I'd rather just see physically separated cycle tracks with a plethora of bike-only signals and no right turn on red for cars.

No I never drive high. I think it is immoral to endanger another life because I took a drug. I was asking if YOU personally believed that non-violent drug users deserved to go to prison for their drug use?  
Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/kikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.****2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.****3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.****4.

I mean what the actual fuck... People were clearly hacking and they get caught after getting 5 kills. Then YOU /kill him and someone gets all his stuff? What the actual fuck dude, theres something called a ban, which would get rid of his stuff. You fucked everybody over in that game by doing that.

I have diagnosed tourette's and OCD - I can do my job but rest assured I will be the guy everyone hates. Just started 3 weeks ago and I'm trying not to give people a reason for as long as I can.
Just tossing this out there, not trying to be an apologist.  That being said, there are crime ridden areas which companies do not serve due to high crime crime.  Possibly the company has all the best intentions, however an employee, a fucking idiot at that, missed the reasoning and is stuck in 1950.   A quick googling around shows this neighborhood is crime ridden, with apparently a high level of gang violence.  http://www.denverpost.com/ci_18958823The crazy thing is this very much surprises me.  I haven't been to Denver since I was a kid, for some stupid reason I would have concluded Denver a city with lower crime.

Siphon it all out, pull out the substrate and rinse the substrate.  That's the step you missed.  It'll take almost a month to clear up otherwise and every time you disturb the substrate it'll turn cloudy again.
I think it's impossible for us to know the extent of your wife's motivations for this behavior, but regardless of her meaning and fears, this is extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive behavior. It's hard to know if this is 'the real her' showing, or if she's having some sort of mental illness struggle, but individual and couples therapy is one of the few resources you will find to figure that out.And, personally, I believe that the only time jealousy can be healthy is if the person of interest feels no pressure from it. Any decisions made regarding it should be mutual and out of respect--any time a decision for a partner is made out of anxiety for setting them off, that is never healthy. If you ever feel anxiety over your partners jealousy, no matter how small, it's a problem. 
It's basically a Ponzi scheme. Everyone's buying for a little more each time, until it collapses because there's no buyer.Except in this case, only the last buyer gets owned, I guess!
I have that build in the image.I originally compared it to the old devo build. You do nearly 50% more DPS early, your HS+Asi costs the same as their Devo+Boots.  When the Devo build finishes Ichaival, they outbox you though, since you build boots as third item.But since you can probably use your early advantage to snowball over the devo builder, and since devo is currently not popular at all, this never happens, so your slightly slower build works out.
You can, but you sound as ridiculous as that woman in *Jesus Camp* claiming *Harry Potter*. You are every bit as insane as religious zealots, congrats.
i have seen the system i described before in several places but i figured why not have more people involved! besides, 1 book a month is slow for me. i want moooooore!
That's definitely an abusive relationship. Many things in this post are exactly what my abuser put me through, and I know that you know it isn't right. Even if you won't admit it to others, even if you won't admit it to yourself. I hope you find the strength to leave her. It'll hurt and it'll be hard, but you'll be a stronger, happier, better person without that negative influence in your life.If you feel like you need someone to talk to, feel free to pm me. Or hit up r/survivorsofabuse. They're very supportive over there.Good luck. 
Similar with metalheads too. We're mostly a bunch of average joes, who slap on some band shirts and smash each other in the pit to take our frustrations of being said average joes.
It is definitely a scientific field in terms of how research is conducted, though that varies a bit by research area. But I would argue that it's a broad enough field that some aspects of it are much more scientific than others. Not that it matters--the fact that it is not as hard of science as other branches doesn't take away it's merit by any means.

The SL5x5 rule is 50% of your 5 rep max. Before you start it might be worth while to go to the gym and see around what the best you can do at 5 reps. Strength in some muscles may not translate to strength in others. Actually see what you can squat before you assume you can do more than you can.

I really, really don't like this draft so far. The best tackle prospect is gone, and it looks like Chicago is going to snag either Kevin White or Leonard Williams. 
I've got a couple regulars that pop by to leave comments. I like to think that if I ever get huge, I'll search my inbox for their name and continue conversations just like the old days. I have conversations with other youtubers as well, but organic fans mean the most. Sorry youtube friends :'(
\&gt;mfw i speak English as good as Dutch. Well atleast write it as good.(am 21 btw)English is way easier, and since we have this ''a 5,5/10 is good enough culture'' it's pretty obvious that kids these days are better at English when compared to their parents. Since kids these days are learning English sooner, even though they aren't even trying.And that Dutch music is horrible by default, and that people watch movies without subtitles, and browse Reddit etc.

even if others find your answer harsh, it's the fucking truth. our ERs cannot expand their roles further to accommodate the depth of counseling and assessment required to know if someone is in a place to begin substance abuse treatment.
It would be easier to find if the modified M2 .50 cal. was not given the same designation as the American version of the HS.404 20mm Hispano cannons, both called AN/M3. Thanks 1940s-era US military naming conventions.The M2 and M3 are also externally almost identical, with the bolt and buffer being the main parts that are replaced. The diameter of the buffer backplate is the easiest visible difference, [the M2's is about 3/4 the width of the backplate](http://gryphos.com/fiftyparts/IMGP1501.JPG), where [the M3's is about equal](http://www.bmgparts.com/products/m3flexbackplate.jpg). The aircraft versions would not have the grips or trigger paddle, of course.
Well, I interpreted it as the angels' wings were damaged in the fall when they were forcibly expelled from Heaven and their graces were damaged, causing them to be unable to travel in the usual way (i.e. wings) and some died, etc.  Cas was separated from a PART of his grace (Metatron specifies that it's only part of it) so I would imagine a partial grace would present as damaged wings as well. 
Yeah, my brain has been saying it's Bradford since they made the trade but the heart wants what it wants.  If Bradford stays healthy, I think he can be excellent here.
I guarantee, this is how 99% of the dominant race thinks whenever they see a non-dominant race on the news.Not just the US; Europe, South America, Asia are all the same way. Hell when I was in Malaysia I was watching news with a Malay family, and when a story came on about an African immigrant committing killing someone they referred to a problem with all African immigrants, but when another story came on about a Malay man killing someone with a machete he was just a bad apple.
&gt; You can look at their base but you can't look at their traps and CC troops. That's exactly what I'm referring to. You agree with me. Reread the thread.They can stop you from viewing the CC and traps, but they will never be able to stop a sandbox attack on the base layout (excluding cc and traps) unless they stop the server from sending the layout itself (as in not letting you look at their base before you attack)
You got a knife? Get a bigger one. Then fuck that and get an even bigger one. If you don't have a tactical claymore by the time you're done you might as well go home. 
Between gpu manufacturers designing with VR in mind, software designers creating with VR in mind,and game engines optomizing for VR, the high requirements of today will be decimated extremely quickly. I find it pretty impressive the amount of work going into a field that technically doesn't even exist for regular consumers yet. In just a year or two people won't even consider VR gaming as having heavy requirements....just regular gaming requirements. (dedicated gpu, etc)
Maybe it's an anagram like the images that were found on the site? Can't make the words, snake, santa, zero, escape or akane, not sure what they will turn into.. Once this is all over, we'll all be wanting to shoot ourselves in the foot for how obvious it will all be.
My apologies then. Everyone seems to be so hostile towards the idea of work places paying their workers that I saw pretty much every response as an argument. I might have to zip back through and see if there's anyone else i've had a go at for no reason! And I get you, I still tip. Almost always. Unless it's maccies or something. I'm just concerned at the amount of people that seem to think tipping only happens in america, and that staff that are actually paid what they're meant to be just won't get tips. 
Nice! I found a 1300 Defender with synthetic stock/forearm for $200 at my LGS last year, and it's excellent; smooth and fast action. I like the look of the wood furniture, but I'm happy for the price. Is yours blued? Mine has a matte finish.
My guess is that it was not uploaded by the copyright holder, so it was sped up and has the weird bright section in the middle to avoid it getting automatically flagged and removed. 
It has been down for three fucking days man this is a fortune 500 company with billions of dollars invested in their information system architecture. This should rarely happen anymore in 2015 with modern server arrays and proper redundancies in place. In August 2013 Google went down for *five minutes* and the overall web's traffic went down 40%!! I don't buy the "these things happen" excuse in 2015 *and* not letting customers know precisely why the site is down. Also for the record, Google obviously drives much higher volumes of traffic, but T-Mobile has payment systems in place. For institutions that facilitate the handling of monies in quantity such as banks and cell phone companies it simply is not acceptable in the web 3.0 age.
You don't "get even fatter" however your body does start working extra hard to conserve which makes your attempt at weight loss that much harder. That is proven science. This principal is why the 5-2 alternate day fasting diet is so effective. By the time your body realizes you are taking in less calories than you need to sustain your weight, you are back to eating normal intake the next day. So the "starvation mode" thing never kicks in and pounds drop off at the rate of about 1 per week. Source: I dropped 15 pounds in 4 months. (and ate plenty of donuts along the way, just not on fast days)
I can't really say, because what you saw, is not in the spiritual realm, it's the physical realm. When they take the time to appear as orbs in the physical realm, it's different from what i'm talking about when I say they look like black orbs. Thats what they look like to us when we see them with our spiritual senses. So I don't know what that white orb was. I don't particularly have experience with that. However when I pray, a lot of times my friends say they see many bright white orbs around. So could be angels.
My list of people I wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley has another addition - this guy. I'm surprised he could fit through the door to get into the draft. 
What you're looking for here is a process called tokenisation. Basically, you want to take your line and split it up into a list of all the words that appear on that line. A very simple way of doing that would be to use `str.split` on your line to split it up at the spaces:    &gt;&gt;&gt; line = '’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\n'    &gt;&gt;&gt; words = line.split()    &gt;&gt;&gt; words    ['’Twas', 'brillig,', 'and', 'the', 'slithy', 'toves']    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'the' in words    True    &gt;&gt;&gt; 'he' in words    FalseThe only problem with `str.split` is that it doesn't deal well with punctuation or word variations. You can try to handle that by doing something like trimming unneeded symbols from your string, but if you're really serious about doing this kind of analysis properly you might want to look into [nltk](http://www.nltk.org/).
Yeah... No.... My point is that people can and do type with it daily and really like it. So the idea that every keyboard needs swype is kinda a lazy argument. You didn't even say why you like another keyboard. 
Okay, so a bunch of white people are destroying New York City. "Don't target the white businesses," they cry, and then proceed to burn Chinatown and Harlem. Is that fine? 
That is fair enough. When i bought mine it was the best option for a hand held all glass airway vape that could also handle concentrates. But there are so many other vapes available i wouldn't be surprised if you could find sonething cheaper. What are some other all glass air way portable vapes that you would recommend?
If the engine isn't working properly and is around 100hp down on the Mercedes do you really think they'll be scoring points? Everyone knew that McLaren-Honda would struggle going into this season, its a first generation PU going against second generation PU that have had a years worth of on track data to improve upon. Honda also started development of their PU later than anyone else so they've had less time to develop in the first place. McLaren's current performances are 98% because of the engine. If the engine produced more power, they could put a higher flap angle on the rear wing which would increase downforce through the corners and not leave them sitting ducks on the straights (Red Bull are having to do something similar). How you can say that the aero is shit when it can keep up with some of the midfield cars that have significantly more power than them is beyond me. 
I went there to. Stayed in a 4 or 5 star hotel. In a tent. It was kinda nice because you could get a legit massage and great food but didn't have to pay a fortune for it. Don't know how much it costs though because I was on a tour. Would recommend though I didn't see a giant fat guy over the falls when I was there.
It's complicated for reasons of history and social construction of gender and sexuality. So it's best to treat gay, lesbian, and bisexual as fuzzy clouds rather than logical categories. Because they're all attempts to lay down fences on quicksand. 
She definitely would like to have a bigger diamond rather than a smaller one. She has expressed interest in a ring with a halo because it 'makes the diamond look bigger'. Which makes me think I should just get her a bigger diamond. She also really likes sapphire accents on a ring.
For those of you surprised as to why Williams is sliding, this is something most people had figured out a while back. Williams aint special. He's just the prettiest girl at the ugly bitches ball.

I'm right there with you. I think TB is pretty accurate about people being more mad because the discussion didn't go along with their thoughts. I personally just took the discussion as more perspectives about the issue in general. I also didn't take the things that Brumbek said as being cunty or anything of the sort

Sometimes it feels like Curse has secret positions that aren't on the web site.  It's common for new employees to show up at the office from other parts of the country for positions that weren't even advertised on the web site.They also just lie about a lot of stuff like this because they want Huntsville to feel like they care.  Remember that they received money from the city to move their headquarters here, so they need to have the support of the local community.  This news provides press and local support.  With how many people will line up for items like Curse t-shirts, it seems to be working.
You should make several tiny corrections during the final orbit before rendezvous. Play with the maneuver nodes, make tiny adjustments with all the vectors and try to get the distance below 2 km. You have plenty of time to plan and make corrections. Burn slowly so you don't over-do it. Shouldn't be too hard or frustrating to get it right.
Single bottle cook methods are how most meth is made in the US.  Lithium ion batteries are used in making it.  There are some superlabs like breaking bad, but they're in Mexico where the chemicals are easy to get, or in Canada where you can only be charged with making meth if they catch the lab while in use.  Not saying it's right, just saying that a lot of meth in the US is made with lithium.  I don't know if it's different in labs, I'm only trained to notice things that might be stored in a house in the US that could warn that there are 10s of gallons of highly flammable solvent around.If you see red phosphorus, sudafed, drain cleaner, or lithum battery containers, around a burning house you don't want to be inside it

What on earth is a "marital baseline"? Is it like a linear equation for a marriage. Like, do you have to graph each spouse's baseline on a chart and find the intersecting point?
I sell fitness equipment for a living, and generally speaking my advice depends on the person and injury. For knees so bad walking is an issue, I usually suggest recumbent bikes. Ellipticals do have very low shock on the joints, but your whole bodyweight is still on the joints. If you can still walk fine but just need something softer than concrete to walk on, ellipticals are a good bet. Treadmills (depending on suspension/quality) are also generally better than the sidewalk.
Yeh, i should have finished off at the end by saying that whereas static characters fan still be awesome, characters that are more dynamic are more likely to be better characters.

In the sense that a waiter/waitress can easily live off of tips, they are a living wage. I don't particularly like tipping, but most waitstaff make enough off of tips to live on. It doesn't have to be a reliable income, and you don't have to agree with it, for it to meet that very minimal threshold.
I don't think you can give consent in an impaired state:&gt;When intoxicated, an individual cannot legally consent to sexual activity. Forcing sex on someone who is too drunk to give consent is still Criminal Sexual Conduct in the Third Degree. Rape is a serious offense, and people who commit crimes while under the influence of alcohol or drugs are not considered free from guilt.[Source](http://www.stsm.org/myths-and-facts-about-sexual-assault-and-consent)
I can define abuse just fine. There is systemic poverty in this country, and the government programs starting with segregation on up through welfare and the war on drugs bear a lot of the blame. There's also a huge cultural divide, which is part of the issue.Random violence is far from the answer to any of it, however.Now, explain to me why it was so urgent to you for me to write that, if you are able.
I had a friend who was agoraphobic. He said Amazon was an agoraphobics best friend. You can even do your grocery shopping there. He wouldn't do it because he tried to push himself but it's cool to have that option  I also worked at a grocery store and we would take shopping orders so the person only has to pick up the food. 
Physics.Always getting amazing grades and understanding stuff and all, but even with that I still dislike it deeply inside of me.I'd rather code unicorns with x86 assembly.

I've been trying to write plugins using libraries and tools in Composer. Actually works out decently; I'd say a lot of it is just wrapping Collections and maping/reducing over them for front-end display.There's a million ways to do it, but I guess I just look at the source for some of the more reputable plugins and themes to see how they handle things. See what patterns emerge from the problems they're trying to solve.OOP for *everything* is a bit of overkill in some situations, though. I think running full-steam ahead at what you think is a coding problem/challenge could potentially be solved more quickly and elegantly by some simple research into the provided APIs and some simple closure functions.
Okay wait, did you know that oral is how she primarily gets off, or is this information news to you? And also, did you ever straight up tell her that you didn't like to go down on women, or was it never said?
I've been running legend because that gives me at least one rank up a day, but I need gilgamesh to invade for sephiroph skill ups. Should I still go for legend? 
Are you trying to be good at this game, or are you just trying to stage things for humor?  If you're really playig, the game automatically records matches, so what I would do is just play and play and play and then save a recording that you think was particularly cool and would work for the format.  Maybe a "less is more" approach with fewer bubbles but more action.  That way you can potentially attract people who are going for a laugh and fans of the game as well.
What's wrong with controlling your fertility? I was raised by a religious, Repubican, and Mom taught me that it was normal for a couple to control fertility and plan their children. It's not healthy or wise to have all the babies your body could possibly make. And I'm betting that the great majority of these wierdos don't have 15 kids. When did birth control get controversial??
&gt;The lawyer I spoke to said it would cost me $4,000 for pre-trial services. I'm not sure if this is a normal rate, but I really think I should weight the cost/benefits of the situation. I'm going to be brutally honest here: I would never, *ever* hire someone with a recent conviction for "battery on a peace officer". It screams violent and unstable. Many employers will frown on this conviction and hire someone else instead.I also wouldn't let someone with that conviction work on my house, babysit my kids, walk my dog... It's not that I think you're a bad person, it's just that it's not worth taking the chance! If you'll *attack a cop over a parking ticket*, for god's sake, maybe you're liable to freak out and get violent in general. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I'm just trying to emphasize how incredibly serious this is. Normal people getting a parking ticket *do not* jump out of their cars and slap the clipboard out of a cop's hands. 
Alphabet car ride games. When we do long road trips (usually Phish shows or other concerts) we play this shit constantly.Starting with the letter A, name a band/musician. Next person does B, next person C, and so on.... Four people in a car can go on for hours and hours just with musicians. The loser is the first to fail to name a band/musician for his assigned letter. You can play this game with vegetables, animals, movies, cars, foods.....just about any category. 
The 2 playstyles (dancer/phantom) near the bottom are archetypes to the top 4. If you put on Windproof(Hi)/Tremor Resist, and HG Earplugs, you could potentially be always under the monster, you move with it, it would never face you directly. Even pesky enemies of the SnS that fly can usually be brought down with a flash bomb immediately afterward. A SnS user can run a super safe set for things you really don't want to die on like Evasion+3 and Evade Distance up. One of the cool things about SnS is that unlike most weapons that merely sidestep you can do a roll in almost every direction (you can't roll backwards) and rolls cover a larger distance.I've never seen a SnS user with Sneak but it sounds like it could be worth trying for fun.
I have 222 hours played since Steam release and I have yet to see any bots. There have been a number of people that have disconnected during load and never come back. There have been multiple people that afk out for 5-10 minutes some time during the match, but not one single person has joined a game and just gone afk. I have noticed that a lot of people claim someone disconnected is afk though.
Its not hard to be happy, but its hard to accept that we will not get the leo and mack combo. I trust Gruden when he says hes a future "tim brown" im ok with that
About 4000 new churches open every year in America, outnumbering schools, stores, and restaurants. I usually strive for the live-and-let-live policy in life. But don't they have enough already? They believe their god can hear their prayers from literally any place, any time. Why do they need to do shit like this, and turn a family's life upside down to add yet another god-station? When Christians ask why we seem angry, it's because of shit like this. Because they're inflicting harm on other humans' actual lives, for the sake of this unproven nonsense that they consider the greater good. Seriously, fuck them.
One point that is often forgotten though is that to have an healthy diet without any animal product, you need to eat plants that can't naturally grow on the same place.it would be impossible to have an healthy 0% animal product diet without modern transportation, hothouse farming and decades of plant breeding to produce "better" and healthier plant sub-species. Not forgetting of course the progress of medicine to know what you actually need to balance a vegan diet. A healthy vegan diet is a modern first world possibility, it wasn't possible two century ago and isn't as cheap/easy as eating some animal product to compensate for what your local grown plant can't give you (of course you don't need to eat  as much meat as we do to balance an omnivorous diet)Btw there is also some study that shows that you could have an healthy diet eating **only** meat, milk and cheese. So I guess we should stop killing plants that produce oxygen for us and only eat these plant killer animal (/s)
The random sea could be useful to test wave counting equipment. I know a PhD student who had an algorithm that counted waves from satellite imagery looking for...something (I forget what the point was).
That was the worst part of having a daughter. Learning to wash the vaginal during bath time. I just made my wife do it. I just didn't know what to do. Like, do you have to wash the inside.My boy is soooo much easier. At first the wife said washing a pens would be harder, because she doesn't have one (that I've noticed), but I told her it's all out there on display. She finally agreed after he was born.
[Happened to Alexei Cherepanov a couple years ago.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Cherepanov)[Also Mickey Renaud.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Renaud_Captain%27s_Trophy)No, I can't explain it. But sometimes it happens. Fucking downright unfair when it does.
That's a lie. I went to uta for cap and now im at ut and I can tell you firsthand ut is superior. Also, you get all of your core classes out of the way so it's not like you're taking useless classes
I agree on Hatred for the most part (per my YT comment).Co-Hosts have been good IMO. I really liked APL with you. You both work well together. Though something tells me APL probably wants to keep doing his own thing (Twitch, YouTube) not be a permanent part of IG. Other than him Elliot is also one of my favorite people on IGD. His voices make me laugh and he actually gets YOU GUYS to laugh as well. Overall I am very happy to have IG back.
If it's a private school, you may have some sort of contractual obligation to at least send an application. It's my understanding that some of the local prep schools do this, though I don't know the exact language they use.That doesn't mean that they can apply for you, though.
Being a nutritionist i have to say this: Your body will go into a kind of "starvation" mode that will burn fat. BUT getting to the point where your body is burning fat will take your muscle and the calories you eat first. This is not recommended as a healthy way to lose weight. It is better to go see a RD or LD (Registered Dietitian/License Dietitian) in your area so they can work with you even more. Also don't cut your calories because you are so young and still growing. As you say you are a "really fuckin' fat teen" it is best to find an appropriate amount of calories you should intake based on your height, weight, age, and activity level and stick to that. You will lose weight down to where you need to be to become healthy while not losing the calories you need to still grow. Google ChooseMyPlate to help get you started.
My memory is excellent for semantic information (i.e., data -- things I learned, faces, places) and terrible for episodic information (i.e., what I did). I'm constantly saying "...No, but I believe you," in response to "Remember when..?"Anyone else?
You were the first to do it, and it was funny. This is my take on all of the copycat posts that came after that. It's not your fault, it's the internet's.
That's exactly what I need. Now, when I ode45 my function, which now reads function [ S ] = bummer( t,x )global k m c fo syms zS = [x(2); x(1).* -k/m + x(2).*-c/m + (5227./m).*rectangularPulse(0,1,z)];end it's telling me that odearguments must float. do you know how I could get ode45 to work with rectangularpulse?
I wouldn't say it's so much as a scam, but more of a waste. I signed up for a free trial and I did get a few emails from some coaches, but you can save a lot more money and have a better chance of getting recruited if you email the coach directly.
Yeah I dunno, I guess I am in the minority but I feel ambivalent towards this movie. I wasn't really convinced going in that Pynchon's work would be filmable, and that's still how I feel. But I think PTA came as close as anyone could, and you can tell how much he respects the author. It had its moments, and the cinematography was amazing, but it also felt like they were trying to fit too much into too little. Some dialogue seemed to only exist in order to cram in necessary plot points.  All the best dialogue was straight from the novel. Good performances though, especially Brolin. All in all I think PTA was really driven to do this, and I admire that, but it mostly just made me want to go home and read.
Oh am I not allowed to worry about my choice until you think it's been long enough?Kidding, I know it can turn around, but I'm moderately regretting it because at this point Sam's next game needs to be spectacular to even catch up to BWP, assuming BWP gets no points next game.
Ah man, I've never had the ability to switch up my relationship habits like that. I'll hook up with another dude, but I exclusively date women. I envy you.
A little late, but in my opinion, you're a pretty young lady. Don't take the crap people say in HS to seriously, as difficult as that can be at times.As far as guys go . . . You're still young. Focus on you. Just have fun. You've got plenty of time!
Why Masai ? Pulled off one of the best trades for sending away Melo, screwed the knicks again with Bargs and somehow got an all star to sign with Toronto (Lowry). I wanna see what he's up to this summer.
especially since the cookie answer is wrong. it has nothing to do with the number of players splitting the cookie, it has to do with how the league has contractually set up revenue sharing. NFL has a hard cap and a pretty unfavorable CBA whereas the MLB has no cap, owners dictate how much revenue goes to players, e.g. last year the astros were #1 in profit, #30 in roster salaries. it has nothing to do with roster size....
Wow, that is a huge mistake by the Redskins. Scherff is probably gonna be a very good guard *in a few years*, but I can't believe they would rather have him than Leonard Williams, who would be a great fit for their defense.
It was worse in the beginning.  I'd rather deal with 50% downtime and security than 99% and a small gap in security.  At least they havent pulled an exit scam or been "busted" by the DEA, FBI etc like SR1.
Depends on how good a friend this person really is.  What happens if the "friend" does not pay for insurance on the car, gets into an accident in a few months, totals the car - and decides to walk away from the whole deal?

I think this little junket is supposed to be a response to this ongoing problem:http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2005/ArmyRecruitmentGoalsEndangeredasPercentofAfricanAmericanEnlisteesDeclines.aspxBut with everything else that is going on I am not sure how effective it will be.
I know! I was able to snag it sometime in the middle of the week on eBay. I was like, the only bidder and the price was too low to pass up, even if it turned out to be in shit condition. As a bonus, the listing also included a copy of *The Slip*, so that's my first duplicate record! Now I just have to convince myself to shell out the cash to get *Year Zero*, and I'll have one of every studio album...
There's just much more counter play against him than there was before. Thus, not making him as good with the removal of his silence.Personally, I think he's still good especially since there are Talon mains in challenger (1-2). However, he's not fit for competitive AFIK, especially with the mana issues and alternative being Zed.
Yeah, but in the "normal" office (sales, marketing, customer service, etc) dickbutt is stil novel. If some marketing guy appears to be printing a dickbutt once daily to like 5-10 printers people will just assume he's off his fucking rocker and avoid him in the break room.
Sorry,   misread what you were asking about.  Check /r/churning but I don't know of any real good offers at the moment that include 0% balance transfer for a period of time (hop from one to another as your period expires).  That would be the only way to make it better.  
To clarify in case there's any confusion, medical journals means things like Lancet, British Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, New England Journal of Medicine, etc.  These are all peer-reviewed scientific publications, and some of the highest ranking and most prestigious ones at that.  
they are effectively the same thing, they both mean Cantonese.粵語 is usually more of a formal term for cantonese as a language.廣東話 is more talking about the language of the region 廣東, however it is often used as an expression for cantonese in general.廣東話 is also similar to how the english word cantonese is constructed, as we refer to the region as Canton.
Totally ok. Our one year old has been feverish. So I haven't gotten to do much and also started getting a sore throat. Didn't want to cook. Husbands working overnight. Yep I ordered me some Chinese food! 
I would have rather had Amari Cooper or Leonard Williams. I really, really hope Gus is able to coach him into a serviceable edge rusher. His current skillset is worthless to us.

I despise my smoking addiction, but if I did manage to quit, I'd hate to lose the social aspect of it. It's amazing how 5 random strangers will just spark up a conversation if they find themselves out smoking together. I've met girlfriends, professional contacts, people that I still hang out with today by a chance cigarette together.
In my opinion, this is not how a healthy relationship functions. It does not sound like you would be happy with the arrangement he is proposing. I think you'd be better to walk away. I recently heard a marriage philosophy that was very interesting to me. "Nothing is a problem unless one of you thinks it is." Applied to this situation, I would take this to mean that this arrangement would be fine if it made you both happy. Since it won't, it seems that you should both look for something more in line with your personal visions.  
you have a good point. i think i was thinking of the suggestion as a weapon/tool like drills and gatlings, and you were thinking of it as a mechanism like rotors and pistons. 
Nu Wa's recolor which I got from a mystery chest. Fucking bullshit that they completely left out any mention of recolors being in those things, so I have forever lost 200 gems to the aether.
It's the eyes. I'm adding more hairstyles for him as well since he's rocked about 3 different in the last few years. The one shown. I'll be adding shaved and a messier look as well. So hold out for those as well.
&gt;hospital visitation rightsWhy the hell is that even a thing? Shouldn't you be able to just name a person or two on a form that can visit you even you aren't married? By what right can doctor's deny a person access to their SO if they're not in quarantine or in the middle of an operation? That issue always seemed to be more about hospitals being fucked up than gay marriage to me.
(Please remember to format code by adding four spaces at the beginning of each line.)Let's decompose the `while` condition:    i = str.find_first_of("*", i)This sets `i` to the position of the first asterisk at or after the old `i` position.    string::npos != (i= str.find_first_of("*", i))An assignment returns the left side (the new `i` here), so you are comparing `i` to `string::npos`, the special value returned by `find_first_of` and related functions when the character is not found.So, the condition is true when an asterisk is still found in the string. Put another way, the condition is false when no asterisk is found.    i++;This moves `i` past the position just retrieved.When the loop terminates, `i` is at the position immediately after the last asterisk in the string.
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this, but since Stern Show put this on their Facebook page, I've been walking  around with a huge smile. I feel like I accomplished something :)
I'm a finance guy and I wrote some budget templates for them. I thought they sounded like a cool company but I didn't get picked up for permanent work. Their office is super fancy and I believe they're still a French-owned company so you might get some travel to Paris. They had a ton of wind farms in Socal so they're not a small company.
I am an over achiever at school (current GPA 4.27) and I was really stressed during the last two weeks of school. I needed absolute laser focus so when this guy I'd been talking to for a week asked me out, I asked him if he'd be okay with waiting 10 days until my last day of school was done. I also would go days without talking to him sometimes because of how much I was focusing on getting through the last couple of weeks while still maintaining my ridiculously high GPA. We would text if I was taking a brain break though. Joke on me though! Because I made him wait, he met someone else and he literally cancelled the morning of the day we were going to go on a dinner and drinks date in the evening. :( Oh well, at least I have my GPA to comfort me. 
tbh by game, like the Ocarina of Time Wave with all the 7 sages and navi, a Majoras Mask wave with Skull Kid, the 4 giants, the 3 mask variations, etc etc, then end it with like 4 villains waves because Link has fought so many

Ducks, Kesler might not be the most liked in Vancouver but he busted his ass game in and game out for this organization and city. Would love for him to get rewarded. If Calgary wins it all I wouldn't be mad either, cup back to Canada and I like the way they played us. 
Interesting.  So really its no different than a military hospital having a poppy field to make morphine.  In that context, the title to this thread is incredibly sensationalised. 
That's not what a selfie stick is. A selfie stick is a Bluetooth enabled telescoping stick that holds your phone, with a button on the handle to operate the camera. A go-pro on a stick or tripod isn't the same. 
wellwellwell, If it isnt KevinCaution. Yeah, I know who you are. mYou're the one that said my post was too long. Too Long! well, now here I am, waiting for my moment to strike. Whenever you think that you are safe from an extremely long post I'll be there. You have Complained once to many and now I'll bring the shitstorm. I have over 50 (fifty) posts that you would consider needing a teal deer at the end, but I shall always deny you that simple request. Even now, my fingers grow stronger at the brush of the keys, they quiver in anticipation at where you will post next, always waiting for a retort to your demands. And as you rage at your screen, not content in the shortness of the post, I will be at my Station, quietly laughing.
I think I've said this so many times but it upsets me we never went for Clyne when we went up and Palace were there for the picking. Although under Pulis I doubt he'd have become the player he is today.
Pretty intense, I'd want to know more about the video before judging it. As an aside, why are the comments in /r/news always so stupid? I mean, no one can say anything that isn't jokey. Can't they ever say their opinion without trying to make it seem cute or ironic? I hate leaving this sub for other subs.
If it weren't for the sound chip which was not the absolutely wonderful Sony chip of the SNES and the lack of X &amp; Y buttons, that's basically it, yeah.
The guy told that reporter he felt like he had to come out and make sure people knew he didn't talk to the cops. Damn, that's rough. Again, they really have to stop leaking stuff- that is a serious problem and makes them look real inept...And yeah, I hope they pay him to give some good interviews. Those could be good.
My mate and I are duo-queue partners, and I run ADC while he is top/ jg trundle.  Trundle is incredibly broken, when built right, man.  He has a 93% win rate with like 16 games played as trundle, and like a 6 KDA. Then again, perhaps my opinion is skewed by his performance; if you're a good player, you do well as the champion you're good at.[\(his op.gg if anyone is interested\)](http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=Shinanaghins)
I see I got bronze on the last to main story mode missions because I don't want my game save to have Trevor or Michael dead. Can I reply SOMETHING SENSIBLE AND THE TIMES COME and still have all three in my game save or will that make them be gone after complete those missions 100%? And my hipsters rampage is only silver, and the last 4 S&amp;F missions aren't gold does that matter?
I don't even know if there was a choice, I just started coding, it got me money, but not enough, so I kinda have to learn programming. :C WordPress development can only earn so much and it's kinda boring.

First off: Great art! It's lovely and continues to prove that SU can crossover with literally anything.I am conflicted about Pearl as an airbender though. On the surface, the movement and fighting style totally fits since it's super flowy and graceful. On a deeper level though... airbending is all about freedom and being flexible to the situation. It's indirect. Those of you who have watched Legend of Korra know how hard a time she had learning air bending because it conflicted with Korra's blunt, straightforward personality. I think Pearl would have a hard time really falling into a malleable, indirect, free type of personality that you see with airbending. Waterbending though? That's all about direct, precise control and I think Pearl would be all over that kind of fighting style.I've put way too much thought into this.
I've been given the T/B/I combination 12 times in a row.

Christian Schools are usually pretty good schools, I went to one and the majority of the student were atheists. They try to teach you more about being a good person and help other people just as much as your learn about God.
Inward and local focus. Ignore national politics and culture entirely, they are worthless and aren't going to affect you. The most local 100k people to you provide enough politics &amp; culture for any person.
I don't have any links to the studies, but time and time again, it's been shown that people react better to rewards for doing good things as opposed to punishment for doing bad things. And with some Asian parents, "bad things" can be as strict as "didn't get straight As" or "missed a tiny dust ball while vacuuming the entire house".Sorry you have to put up with that. I know all too well what it's like being burnt out from all these expectations to be perfect and to get nothing but nagging if you miss it ever so slightly.All I know is that we can end that cycle of hurtful parenting.
Thats exactly my GM argument, but the leadership skill doesn't actually enable you to force them to do something, but instead manage / optimize their work, making it better.
I don't really feel the need to defend my statement since you got downvoted so hard, but I will anyway. The problem with your statement is that according to the way you think, poor black people and poor white people would have similar rates of 'unsmart' and uneducated children. Despite the attempts of affirmative action, however, this simply isn't the case. Black people still suffer amongst the least educated. Why? Because their culture doesn't respect education. In fact it is often even actively frowned upon, and even considered a 'white' thing to do.
Actually it does since the solar home still needs lots of electricity when it rains for a week or two or three. EV's might cover overnight. Because the solar plant is backed up by dirt cheep inefficient gas plant OCGT run inefficiently, it really doesn't even save gas over an all baseload alternative using expensive CCGT generation.If the $1Trillion, spent over the last ten years world wide on wind and solar reducing GHG's not an iota, had been spent on nukes instead the world would be coal free and 100 million folks now dead would be alive. The renewable religious nut thinks of those dead as a legitimate sacrifice to his cause and wouldn't give a sou for their souls.
His point about taking responsibility for actions. Looting and rioting due to "outrage" over someone they don't even know being unjustifiably hurt is ridiculous. It's ethnic tribal silliness, not to mention it only makes the communities in which this happens worse.

Don't take this the wrong way but it's blowing my mind a little that people on this subreddit are completely dumping retailers over Apple pay. Can someone explain a little bit what makes Apple pay that much better? I'm not trying to argue the other way, I'm just honestly inquiring. Does Apple offer the same benefits that a credit card would? Would it really be feasible to not carry your wallet around because the need for ID and that most retailers still don't use it? And finally, how much faster is it really than just pulling a card of my pocket?

New trait interface will have 3 rows: You can slot any "core" trait lines in all 3 rows, but the "elite" specialization can ONLY be slotted in the bottom row. If you want, say, Mesmer 1/5/Elite, or Ele Fire/Arcana/Elite, you can. 
I see, maybe I phrased it poorly or got distracted by this nice bottle of red.What I mean is that if the test holds true and the film industry is male centric, then it doesn't seem like it's important enough to enough people to matter one way or the other. 
Same here. If I were optimistic I'd say he's the one I trust the most, but as a pessimistic Englishman, I say he knows what he's talking about most of the time.
You should learn how to analyze the grammar of a sentence, but we have gone around the mulberry bush on that one enough. I will leave it to anyone else reading this to decide for themselves if there is any ambiguity in the statement "we have ascertained from the entire Old and New Testaments, that the torment is unending and the Kingdom everlasting".I have heard and read Metropolitan Kallistos on this, and heard and read a lot from Metropolitan Hilarion (Alfeyev). I have his book on this subject on order.If you are saying that you have more Fathers of the Church who taught universalism, I would like to hear who you have in mind.
No I usually offer to help afterwards out of feeling guilty haha! Having said that I get a lot of hate mail for closing shortcuts. The term "fucking brat" was used in my latest lol. Was hilarious watching him run for the boss only to find a locked gate. The guy disconnected which is the biggest dick move of all
Yes. Even if you've never felt it or seen in or thought about it, it's there, shaping your every underlying move. You have no control over your choices whatsoever and will give in to every urge no matter how irrational or undesired because that's what women's primitive brains do.
"American (insert food here) is terrible."    Especially chocolate, since Europeans think we only have Hershey's, and beer because they think we only have Budweiser.
Williams drops to Bears. Bears trade him to Tennessee plus next years 1st and this years second...and Cutty?because I JUST WANT TO WATCH THE WORLD BURN
You didn't grasp the concept. Two people have the same past history of stabbing someone. One person was accidental. The other person was with purposeful intent. Who do you think is more likely to stab you in the future?
It is more likely inflammatory than fungal. That being said, you haven't been given adequate anti-fungal therapy(terbinafine cream or naftitine cream may be needed to actually clear it). 
Current High school student here, I've heard some awful things said from teachers to students. One time my history teacher was getting very frustrated at my class for not doing our work so he said, "You guys are going to amount to nothing in life. Just a bunch of fast food workers. You're lives are worth nothing more than a bucket of piss." Let's just say we were silent for the rest of class.
Oh, nevermind, I just woke up and was reading all messages and mixed it up with something else. Forgot what these posts were about.   I still stand by my argument that Ash is better for melee. Actual health &gt; QT health. If you lose actual health you can just channel with life strike, while on Loki you need to restore energy.   Another benefit Ash has, he can use Rage efficiently because of his high health pool and his smokescreen stuns enemies, so if you quickly recast it you don't have to find a safe place, while Loki can easily die if he runs out of invisibility while in the middle of the enemies.   
Probably a better choice honestly, job stability and all. I'll probably step back from the market after I get into college anyways, journalism is really where I want to work anyways. Orlove better watch out cause imma steal his job XD
Did you honestly expect them to be able to differentiate? To most people, a uniform is a uniform is a uniform. And let's all be honest, security uniforms look similar to what the cops wear, which means to an individual who only looks at the uniform "This person is a cop, an authority figure, the enemy, what have you". 
I don't put my pants on in the morning, that's the beauty of being an unemployed pornographer!My favourite pornstars change over time, as they get older and I stay the same pervert.Right now I really dig Remy LaCroix, Chloe Amour, Veronica Rodriguez, and Isabella de Santos... I don't dance, I help hold the walls up. 
Have you asked them? How do you know? These are things we never talk to white people about.You seriously don't know what you're talking about. A lot of things I brought up go as far as Jim Crow and slavery.http://www.npr.org/2012/03/21/149060167/florida-teens-killing-a-parents-greatest-fear
This is purely speculation, but the one main area of 'drugs' that I can think of that rich/powerful people have a much easier time getting free access to than the everyman are pharmaceuticals. For instance (I'm obviously breaking the 20-year rule here but) the elaborate painkiller setup Michael Jackson had to help him sleep. Reading about some of that stuff reminds me of what I've heard about early LSD experiments in the 1950's, when it was so new and unheard of that there wasn't really any kind of stigma attached to it. Rich folks and socialites would drop acid under clinical supervision. I suppose in the future, as biotech becomes even more refined, we could see some designer drugs manufactured with the same safety standards as modern pharmaceuticals. Who knows.
I know it's dangerous, but I love my stock horn. It's a complete piece of crap that sounds like a dying moped horn, which is ridiculous coupled with the loud pipes. That said, I may try this upgrade, as I definitely need to do something.

All the best to your dad (and you too)! He'll be under the care of some of the most talented physicians in the world. Can't ask for much more than that.
Alright alright alright.  If we are going all in on the new GM, this is a great thing, right?  He only takes BPA.  BPA happened to be a HUGE need.  Apparently Scherff is the guy and he's going to rock out.
A few people have said this already, but no decisions have been made about mods, no-one's been called upon or even suggested as mods either.However I can confirm the first person to comment on this will be given full op perms once the server is up. That's what someone in the IRC said to me anyway...
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu!I'd make shadow clones and study in all kinds of fields (medical, engineering, philosophy, politics) then I'd become an ambassador for peace and travel the world creating peace. I'd eventually be a world renowned superhero with the ability to make multiple clones. 
I'll usually take one or two potshots across Poland and occasionally I'll get a hit or two. I haven't yet gotten a kill that way, but hey, potshots with a 57mm Russian gun VS a random volley from a Calliope. :P
It's not bad if you only have to do it once. It's watching the thing over and over and over that's annoying. And if you alt-tab out and the game crashes, you get to watch it again.
Played two games so far.First was Necro mid. Didn't even realize it was 6.84 until about 10 min in. Went phase &gt; Mek &gt; Bloodstone &gt; Aghs  &gt; OCOC didn't do much lifesteal wise. The CD's were great though. Not OP like I thought it would be.Second game was a solo support as WD. Went typical aghs build into Glimmering cape to forcestaff. Glimmer cape is awesome. I like it alot for supports. I saved my life and teammates a few times. Can also use during ult which is great. Had a BH and SB doom on my team so they got vision quick and it became much less effective. Still a great item for supports. Will probably build on every support.
ja, das wäre schon noch nice,eben shirts, die der eingeweihte erkennt, die aber nicht irgendwie hochgezogene Augebrauen verursachen.zb kurzärmelshirt mit #RBTV auf der Brust, 
I wouldn't go this far. A few people were abusing the hell out of this, and it needed to be fixed asap. Even if they have a patch ready for next week, it was better for us if this got resolved now.
Yeah, my brain has been saying it's Bradford since they made the trade but the heart wants what it wants. If Bradford stays healthy, I think he can be excellent here.
/u/Tiggr has mentioned that more diverse map rotations are something that will be looked at once the console CTE arrives, which should be fairly soon. I'll look for exactly how he phrased it, but it sounded like there was more to it than simply changing the rotation on the servers.EDIT: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield_4_CTE/comments/33mwwz/when_are_we_finally_able_to_mix_the_maps_which_we/cqmhhm2?context=3) is where he talks about it. Essentially, adding playlists with all the maps should happen soon, as it's being given higher focus. The console CTE team will look at giving server-owners the ability to control map rotation while staying "official".
But with locker it wasn't necessarily the talent missing, it was the injury proneness. Mariota doesn't have that issue to the same degree, and he also probably has a bigger upside. 
Any more specific details on what might have caused this type of wound? Even if this is much further advanced than you commonly see, you seem to see at least the early stages of this sort of wound regularly, is there any common cause that you've found? As a former medic in the US I've seen some gnarly shit on addicts and/or homeless patients but *nothing* like this. Fucking *nothing*.Is there a common pathogen causing the necrosis and neon green bubbling pus in most patients? Does the infection result from IV drug use? Looks an awful lot like the effects of krokodil/desomorphine use, any relation that you know of?
yeah I feel you. A global market would be pretty boss but I don't think it'll ever happen any time soon because of right holders and other legal issues.
Here in America wait staff is very often paid less than minimum wage, so they really depend on tips to make a decent salary. Why restaurant owners don't just pay them a decent salary in the first place is beyond me.
OP - If the choice is between Paris and Lyon, go for Paris. Lyon isn't that nice a town to be honest. Besides, as a 21-year-old you can get cheaper "Lyria Jeune" tickets on the TGV (high-speed train) from Geneva to Paris: currently tickets in May are available for €40 to €55. By TGV, you will be in the "city of lights" in 3 hours!

There's no such enemy making here. He literally admitted there were racists, then made a completely fabricated claim that people would call him racist if he didn't watch MSNBC.
That depends on your method of speed reading too though. The human brain is absolutely capable of taking in large amounts of info very quickly and retaining it. Many slow readers are slow because they are verbally speaking each word inside their head or have to keep stopping because they don't understand a word.Now sure really fast speed readers won't store as much but you can still read at a fairly fast rate and remember everything. 
Not gonna lie, that drink looks bomb.com BUT I've only been to Starbucks probably twice this whole year. Every other day it's just black coffee at home.
lmfao referring to weed as "paranoid schizophrenic shit" - you sir are funny as hell and certainly need a nice long blunt sesh before your sphincter tightens up any further.
If it's wisdom it's gotta be this: *"Being with a client is like being in a marriage. Sometimes you get into it for the wrong reasons, and eventually, they hit you in the face."*For sheer absurdity, I'm a big fan of Roger's rendition of Frere Jacques to Don: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPW7_RQmSCU
Man, I've never seen someone so delusional about something so simple. Just read the sources. Really. The only person talking to you is saying the same thing I was. He wasn't agreeing with you in any way.
I mean, someone's clearly pulled it if  they have these scans, so why not publish the whole thing? Could it be that perhaps the story is more complicated that a single log note and a one-sentenced affidavit that was notarized in Virginia? 
The loud ones are. Thankfully, they are only a very very loud minority. Not a small minority mind you, but a minority.Fortunately, there are feminists like Emma Watson who gave a great speech detailing what true feminism is which included equality for all genders, regardless of race. If I recall correctly, she also said that feminism needed men to succeed. That is what the real face of feminism is. People who actively work to raise everyone to the same level. Not dragging down the rest of us to their level. Thinking about it, I've noticed the fat feminists are almost unanimously included in the former rather than the latter, trying to drag society down to their level rather than raising everyone else up.
Just try to save 1/3 of what you make each month and don't touch it. Over the next 3 years you will easily save somewhere around $4000 assuming you work more hours when the labor laws are less strict for your age.
Sometimes the maxed out models are available in store, but only in limited supply. If someone was to buy that floor stock they would have to ship more. Are you picking up from your store or getting delivery? 
If they activate the laws concerning the national defense (*Puolustustilalaki* and so forth), there's gonna be new internal checkpoints to cross real soon.
I can still remember watching the race. It was one of the first times I was watching the full race with my dad, I used to watch the start and then go play outside and come back for the end of the race. I had made the decision to watch the full race for this one and then the crash happened.

It is very hard to take small children out to dinner. I can understand the restaurant's suggestion of moving the two of you instead of the family. Moving two people to the table of their choice would be easier on all parties, rather than moving a family of 5, with a 6 month old that I'm assuming was in a high chair. What type of buffet restaurant was it? Was it a restaurant that caters to families or an upscale place that has more expensive items?
Exactly what I'm thinking. What a fucking dumb kid. "Hahahaha I buy drugs from the bad kid in my Mom's class! I'm so edgy! I hide my drug use from my mother. I'm the best!"Whatever, hopefully it's something harmless like marijuana. Still a dumb thing to say though. I hope their Mom finds out.
"I HAVE ARRIVED." Reith announced to the campers. "I'm sorry but I will not be signing any autographs." He relaxed in his usual spot away from the fire. 
I'm actually about to try stun (or enfeeble, vulnerability) alching. I'm 75 mage so I can only use enfeeble, but I heard it's a lot faster than just alching. Soul runes are 250 each so it cost a bit. It's also click intensive. Idk what stun spell yiu can use at 50, but I've also heard the curse spell at lvl 19 is a good alternative until you can do one of the higher stuns. 
That's kind of a red flag. My advice is to stop reading books and get off reddit. Instead, go out and talk to people. This will provide lots of perspective on what is normal and improve your social skills directly.If you find that idea disagreeable, it may be a good idea to meet with a therapist for some assistance.
ALRIGHT! not expected, but every fan of every team always wants to improve their O-Line and always says its not a sexy pick. They are right but I got faith. Give RG3 the protection he needs.
At the elementary school I went to, you would have a checkbook and we had a bank. During the year you would earn money doing whatever tasks or jobs and you could make purchases (erasers, pencils, etc.; it was a little store) or not throughout the year. You would record them in your check book and balance it. Well at the end of 6th grade we would have a huge auction to spend all of the money you had saved up on really cool stuff. Anyways, it was awesome but I never again saw any financial responsibility activities like that after elementary school. It's a shame. 
does not surprise me with what the Eagles offered. We need so much more than a QB, aslo high picked QBs have a tendency to not work out. exception are those one in a decade ones like Luck or Manning, Mariota is not one of them thou.
Majel did 4 - Number One, Chapel, computer voice, LwaxanaMarc Alaimo has 5- a Romulan in TNG The Neutral Zone, the French gambler in TNG Time's Arrow, a Gul in TNG The Wounded(?), Dukat in DS9, and a government agent(?) In DS9 Far Beyond the StarsJeffrey Combs probably takes the cake as Weyoun, Brunt, several other ferengi, Tiron, Shran...anyone else?Since TAS isn't canon, James Doohan may no longer count, though he did do several voices in TOS.Do mirror counterparts count? What about holograms?What's the answer?
If you'd like to join my wandering or just say hi, I'll be there until at least 5:30.  Ask in (redacted)'s studio for "that ice maker girl" and someone will be able to point you in the right direction.
How will it?  I don't see anything wrong with it.  It's got all of the original roots, including composer Grant Kirkhope.  It's just not allowed to use Bear and Bird because Microsoft owns the trademark.
That how I read it at first. I thought I miss a news story about someone slipping past special agents just to chuck a pizza on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I was very confused, though the snipers up there might enjoy it.
I'm so sorry you went through such a terrible experience. I think it's a perfectly normal thing to think about. Your baby was wanted, you were prepared for a life that included her, of course it's natural to wonder about what could have been. It's perfectly normal to mourn a future you'd planned even if  children aren't what you want now.
I agree that there should be a debate, but unfortunately, the two sides do not share the same understanding of what constitutes as logic.First of all, this paper is specifically talking about disproving flood geologists, i.e. Young Earth Creationists; they believe that the entirety of the fossil record was created during the flood in the story of Noah's ark.  These are the kind of people who say that the bible is a holy book because the bible says so.  This kind of thinking shows a basic lack of understand of logical arguments and so trying to make the "best" logical argument isn't going to convince them any more.  These are the kinds of people who discard facts if they don't fit into their world view, as if somehow those facts don't apply to them by choice.It is the more moderate christians that you should be debating; in my opinion, these people are too far gone.
Don't patronize me. I listen to a great deal opinions I don't like, yet unlike the neutered modern progressive mangina, I'm not so open-minded that I go looking for wisdom, and nor do i expect any, in the words of people who self-identify as gang rats who can't even command the one fucking language they speak just because, AFTER some 20+ fucking years of every celebrity, church advocate, politician, tv personality begging these fucking idiots to STOP MURDERING their neighbors to no avail, that they finally cobbled together some loose armistice now that it's politically convenient for themselves.  You'd have to be the most self-loathing, oblivious, incompetent sucker on earth to get duped by these fucking project rats... Go fuck yourself, you dumb, fucking peasant.
We run two 500 series zams.  We don't use the laser level system, and personally I think it's more trouble than it's worth.  Nothing beats an experienced drivers blade control.
I wouldn't consider that "blowing" it. Especially with rumors coming in now that Leonard was flagged by a lot of teams for a shoulder injury.I would have loved the Leo pick but I still love the Cooper pick.

Quit forcing me too choose my career life so early, I'm only 18 for fuck's sake, I don't know what to do with my life and I certainly don't know what my "purpose" or "passion" is. Its a ton of pressure and I personally cannot handle it. *retreats to pillow fort*
I'm listening... LolIn all seriousness it was only in reference to the title itself, even though I'm a fan of the current balance. Auto rifles could use a little more love, but then they'd be too juiced and there'd be another subset of players whining about them again haha. As far as getting buffs, I think it's gonna happen again anyways like should do after a settling in period for new weapons and gear. I just think it won't be as drastic this time. I would expect to see it a few weeks after HoW drops. 
Tip is to look about locally where you live a few days before Pax or in Seattle. Usually, those who are trying to sell them simply cannot go due to whatever reason and want to offload the tickets.
No way in hell NC State goes to the SEC. Their football isn't up to par, and their two basketball games a year with Carolina would no longer be possible. 
No of course, I'm completely proud of him for what he's been able to do especially at such a young age. But the music he made before he became popping is what really hooked me, and although I've liked most of what he's put out after Innanetape, it's definitely not the same // doesn't give me the same feeling as before.But I guess that happens to every up and coming artist. People change, styles evolve, just gotta live with it. I'll always have his old shit anyway to bump anyway.
I agree on the fist bump. My hands really don't sweat and I dislike shaking hands with a guy who now makes me grab a towel afterwords. So thanks from a guy on the opposite end of the spectrum. Also with playing so many matches in a tourney, especially ones where people are coming from all over, you pass around so many more germs with a handshake. Always sucks coming home from a tourney and getting sick. So I too lean towards the fist bump.
By dismissing it as a conspiracy (with out anything to explain why) and calling everyone shit. That isn't respectful in any culture that I am aware of.Edit:In fact it's a literal shit post...heh
The first week at my university, they told about 100 times that if someone is drunk, don't do it. They couldn't stress enough that if the person can't give full consent, don't do it.
Haha, well thank you, I'm trying to contribute what I can.  It isn't my call on the sidebar, it has been added as a useful link in the official Sticky.  I'm going to repost it probably monthly, and closer to primary deadline registration time, potentially weekly, as I know that most people don't read stickies.
&gt;But, I was bored out of my mind for the rest of the movie.To be fair, I think that was a bit intentional as a theme for the movie. At the beginning of the movie that guy (I think) even says something about the moment you die seeming almost like an eternity even though it's only a brief moment. The movie is supposed to feel like an eternity.But yeah, I can't say I didn't get pretty bored by about halfway through.
&gt; Capri pants on men,Ctrl+F'd for Capri pants on men, was not disappointed.At the same time I'm pretty sure that seeing a guy wearing cargo shorts in Europe, or the UK specifically is also a dead give-away of an American tourist.
Is she a comedy character like Ali G or Borat?At first I though it was a performance piece by some bloke and we'll see it all edited down on some tv channel for the laugh in a few months time.Then I went to thinking she's maybe not quite all there, because mad people obviously do exist.Now I'm back thinking it's all a comedy character thing again, no way you'd keep getting on all these media/conference platforms if some people weren't in on the joke.    The Wu twitter gets away with some pretty borderline stuff that I'm sure no member of the public would be getting away with.Like the way Katie Hopkins gets away with things that would result in a normal person getting their collar felt.I don't know, it's started to feel a bit too outlandish for me now.    Can't help but feel someone is pushing it as far as they can now.
I mean for a game that's an actual game. Dota is something different, it's just a short isolated experience, it's easy to do microtransactions well in that.And why not? Besides for the dip in prices during the GCN/PS2/Xbox era, console games are the cheapest they've been yet development costs are the highest they've been (on average). If the developers/publishers can make extra money in a completely non-intrusive way, I say let them.
Are you eating at 1300 calories cause I've been sticking at 1500 because I've read as a male it's unhealthy to eat lower and because my fitness pal yells at me when I do. 
The ONLY way the FCC will ever know is dudes who got somethin' up their butts reporting people to the FCC. Unless the FCC is actually paying people to go to your local Airsoft field and enforce this (which would be a JOKE), I really doubt you'll ever get caught. And tbh I thought the fine was like $500. That means no P*, but it doesn't mean no life. lol
It's sad that your post, probably the most thought out one here, is buried below the typical Fox News-esque race analyses. Yes the situation in the video is atrocious, but that does not mean the circumstances surrounding them (and the larger issues at hand) can be understood in simple black or white terms.
Oh man... I wish I could afford a 'splash the cash' like that this month! Been eying that monitor since it was announced! Please update me on your experience with it... I have a GTX 980 and REALLY want to pair it to a great monitor (currently rocking a QNIX 1440p overclocked monitor, want GSYNC so bad!!).Have fun man.
This is cool.  I remember thinking awhile back that there wasn't really a good dedicated place to post anime collections, so I hope this takes off.  I will take some pictures of my collection and post them soon.
So as soon as paradoxplazam mod is updated to stop crashing, I  can post my shattered world always war mod. It works perfectly (except province defection is a bit wonky so I might remove that), but I can't post till ppm is fixed.
Think about the last 2 QB's we drafted. Vince Young had the legs, and can throw the ball, but not a good attitude and work ethic. Jake Locker wasn't too terribly talented, and was walking glass, but his work ethic and attitude was amazing. Now put the two QB's good attributes together and now you have Marcus Mariota. It's also a plus that Marcus isn't injury prone either. 
I'm sorry but the only conditions I can think of that would make flying dangerous would also make it impossible to get a drivers license.  Like vision, cognitive issues, etc.  I think one of the more ridiculous rules is that someone with ADHD isn't allowed to fly if they are on medication for ADHD.  Most ADHD meds are CNS stimulants and these are not allowed.  Sudafed is also a CNS stimulant in the same family as ADHD meds and its allowed because its labeled as a nasal decongestant.  Bureaucratic nonsense my friends.
+1 here, did basically nothing for a few months and faced a similar psychological paralysis after a breakup.  A mix of feelings: frustration, anger, loneliness, worry that I wasn't good enough to figure it out, worry that I'd never find relevant research, all contributed to my doing this same thing.I'm not really sure there is a cookie cutter solution to this problem: recognize you have a problem, attack the problem in any way you can, wash, repeat.  After I did this a ton of times things finally started clicking and I made progress again.  The shitty thing about grad school is that if you're in a bad emotional place you can basically coast for indefinite periods of time without many consequences.
Thank you for your advise.  But I believe I know my parents finances better than you.  I can assure you I have tried to get as much money as possible but I am not taking money out of my parents that could be spent on my siblings.  Again thank you for your advise.

So on a scale of 1-10 how likely am I to die. Since it was prewicked I didn't even think to look for oil and just threw juice in it and started vaping. I had a new flavor in it and thought the juice was just bad, vaped maybe half a tank on it.

It's clarifying the definition, not redefining it. Her argument is based on misunderstanding the term.No, women aren't supposed to help other women just because they're both women.But that's not related to Queen Bee Syndrome whatsoever, so.. irrelevant.
Pretty much all my settings are on Medium, and I don't think the settings are the problem because i tried both League and CS:GO today and both randomly dropped frames.

See the striations in the iris?  They aren't very easy to see in said photo, but they are a fairly certain indicator of *U. fimbriatus*.  That said, there is quite a bit of uncertainty within the genus, and professionals have suggested that there are quite a few cryptic species within those that are currently described.  But according to current knowledge, this individual is *U. fimbriatus* without a doubt.
"Wow, yeah that sounds like a pretty big deal..." *Jax says trying to think about it, not even twenty; hell he was already twenty and he couldn't imagine being a dad.* "Well I'd say you turned out alright, sure they're overprotective but at least they care, and thats more than you can say for plenty of parents. Lot's of the kids I grew up with were like that."
That's not even the most sigh inducing thing about STO. About every 4th Federation Captain is a Klingon or Liberated Borg flying a Scimitar that has aft tricobalt torpedoes and maybe some Jem'Hadar shields for the sweet purple visuals.
There's this girl. She's smart, ambitious, funny. She speaks Latin (not quite as well as I do, but there are few who can). She reads the same comics (We actually met because we obsessively follow the same webcomic.). I was enthralled with her before I even knew what she looked liked. Then, as we became friends, we began to skype. She was amazing. Long dark hair, full lips, amazing tits, and legs for days.It came as no surprise that when she learned what I look like, she lost all interest. 
Since the age of about 13 I have had a recurring dream from different angles.All in an alley at dark, I'm 27 and I'm shot and killed by a stray bullet. There wasn't any alley ways existing in the city is grew up until I was 21.I've had it at least 20 times, all difficult the exact same setting until I was 27. Then they stopped.
No need to panic, they're quite cowardly alone and are only at their most obnoxious in packs or behind a computer screen and even then they will shy away from any real debate and if you do get the odd one that does speak up you can shut them right down quickly enough.
Feeling for you, I am also a BCPSS teacher and am having trouble thinking about anything else these days. I have too many feelings to get out at the moment but we have to come as prepared as ever with great lessons, hang in there!
Best case scenario, you know someone or a personal experience you can relate to so you instantly know what to write about but one example you could use: make up a name, state that he is from the 20th century, explain how his pursuit of knowledge and specializing in specific surgeon procedures managed to save someone's life which would've been lost.I'm not the best at explaining but I hope this gives you of an idea of specifying rather utilizing a vague idea. It makes your argument seem viable rather than you are bullshitting from the top of your head. The SAT essay grades you on how "argumentative" it is rather than the actual writing skill.

On limbo:Focused control seems kind of pointless in a game about mowing down thousands of enemies though... Especially when you consider most of the things you'd want to banish either can't be (nullifiers) or are actually counterproductive (eximus auras).I struggle to see what he does in defense/excavation over an efficiency/range frost who refreshes bubble while it's in that hard 4s invuln time. In survival not beimg able to pick up life support basically kills a lot of his usefulness, same with protecting and powering extractors with cataclysm in excavations.In mobile missions he's a little easier to justify, but he just seems to bring less to a team than most other frames.I'd quite like to hear your reasons for liking him as I love his  concept and would love to be able to justify bringing him over anything else at the minute.
what the actual fuck? thats a bummer. Nothing like waiting for forever for your package to come in, only to find out its busted! I wonder if the seller just did a shitty job of packaging it. it should have had mounds of bubble wrap around that shit! and if not, i blame the seller. sorry about your glass. 
Well you can work it for us so you get both of our loads. One over your tight slutty ass and one over your face. As long as I get the same in return, it's only fair after all.
If you want to avoid random bugs and other possibilities the best approach would be to do a clean install with the latest iso:http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=522144 10074
Yeah. And semantics: they aren't randomized in the sense that everyone has mutually agreed that the word means with regard to RPGs; it's more like there are 47 puzzle pieces and the permutations of combinations may mathematically eliminate the possibility of getting the same combination twice in a lifetime, but those puzzle pieces are static and large enough to give way to familiarity.  See what I did there? I took a much more succinct and accurate statement about chalice dungeons and doubled the word count and made it less clear. I do that sometimes.   But you're right. I played Dark Souls 1/2 thousands of hours because up until the very end I never completely shook the feeling that: A) I had no idea what the fuck I was doing; and B) there was more out there for me to perceive.
I figure "how would you treat" is more of a "what would you do". Cover it up, vent the ambulance as much as possible, make sure none of it gets on me. Good luck to the ER doc
Have you considered that you are the one actually whining like a little child about how nothing matter, everything sucks, Hillary won't won, etc.?   I mean seriously, read your own posts.  Whine City.
What kind of phone do you have?  My G3 has a guest mode where I can disable any apps I don't want a guest to use.  Maybe something out there can let you setup a guest mode too.
You. You are one of the few, /u/turtlepancakes . I have you tagged via gender, like most females on reddit, and you are one of the few I have seen twice. Most vanish, the weight of the tag too much to bear, but you, wield it proudly. Go forth, and be female.
Ah. Well on this sub I think most of the people buy things for cheap to sell things for profit. This includes low balling people.also when I buy a car, I don't just pay sticker price. I pay what I feel like paying or I don't buy. So it's not even just flipping, it's just part of buying and selling used goods.
Water Bending. Want to kill someone? Just drown them by holding water around their head! That doesn't work? Just freeze the water inside them and watch them die horrifically.           There's healing too so that's pretty neat I guess
Dan Snyder: Ohhh I love being a villain! How can I get the people to hate me more?Redskins FO: Sir, I really think we should get Leonard William-Dan Snyder: Get Brandon Schreff. Redskins FO: Sir?Dan Snyder: Do it.
I feel sorry for the owner but there's nothing she could do and she would probably be better off anyway. Attacking the cops even legally is a good way for them to ruin your life slowly.

I'm personally not aware of anything shady CC does to their customers, and I do their tech support. Their leased modems are junk. Their service is fine. Their prices are terribly gouged.
Yes I think with Knight and the chemistry they had with each other. It was something beautiful to see. I think that trade was a shock for this young group and they just weren't able to mold together like that again. When they had Knight they played with intensity all the time. He was kind of the clear leader. Also it helped that he played with high intensity all the time. MCW doesn't have that same leadership. In my opinion a huge negative. It seems likea good long term move. I think next season they will be better or completely implode. Only time will tell.  
Onlyusemeblade is still making videos worth watching, although he has slowed down on how much content he makes for YouTube. He still streams on twitch a lot though and is still a chill dude. 
I don't think it's wrong for you to fell pissed off.  he gave money for your sisters wedding but not yours.   This would piss me off, and most other people as well I think.
gratz. my gf just finished her thorn bounty earlier this week. she did not enjoy the experience but was determined to get it done.as much as its painful to do, i think its a fitting bounty for a top tier weapon.
For those wondering about the name, I'm pretty sure it's a reference to visibility hacks for old games. I'm not sure what it stood for, but my brother used to use a "C.H.A.M.S." hack in Crossfire that would show other players through walls as glowing meshes just like this.
.....if you honestly think one of them could be the other's VP, you are seriously deluded. With what Bernie stands for, what sense would it make to have Clinton as VP?
Geniatalia has nothing to do with sex. Or gender, which is different than sex. Sex is typically defined by chromosomes, not genitals. I totally understand why that's not an easy concept to get, but it's one backed up by a majority of the medical and psychological community. If you're willing to disagree with the science that supports trans people, well, feel free, but that's feels before reals territory. I'm not really going to keep "acting like an idiot" until you give up.  I'll probably stop soon after this, I won't pretend I have better things to do tonight but arguing kind of sucks. I don't really need to claim victory, either. Nobody wins on the internet, but trans people are more than likely going to get these rights IRL soon enough anyways. It doesn't matter about clothes, it was more a shorthand to say that trans people are doing the same thing within a locker room as a cis person would. I get why that'd be confusing, so sorry. &gt;miss ultratolerantReally? 
I've had a dozen or so jobs throughout my career. Without fail, the day before I've started each one, I've dreamt about being being on a sandy beach watching a 40-storey tidal wave bearing down on the coast, but it never arrives. After the first few times it was freaky, nowadays I feel like it's more of a livid decision.
TM's have no colour so that's not a problem. If you want to add SlenderP for giggles I have no objection. This looks like a reasonable deck to try out. Someone is going to dislike you. :D
You can get a starter kit at Maggard's for around $50 ish. Or if you want to be uber cheap, Get a Lord L5/L6 for $10 on Amazon Prime, an Omega 48 for $10 on Amazon Prime, and a tub of Cella for $11 on Amazon Prime.
I have my own car, am married, have a mortgage, and just gave birth to my second child. Somehow I still don't completely feel like an adult. It probably doesn't help that I look like I'm 13 even though I'm 30.
Technically, it shouldn't be the Koreans needing to do anything.  Japan not alone in this - they and China for centuries used the Korean peninsula and people when trying to fight each other.  Plenty of blame to go around (ok, yes, the Japanese modernized faster than the Chinese and Koreans  and used the advantage).Korea has basically been the guy in the middle doing its best to survive for centuries.
I can ONLY IMAGINE the shit teachers say about me. Reading through most of these comments made me really appreciate the fact i got into A school. I mean look at me, i have my notebook to turn in tomorrow for a lab final, physics homework due tomorrow which i have to start and im on reddit...
We'd be insane to take anyone else. What are we going to take, a safety this early? Gurley? Jets could still use some help on the outside, the line is awesome against the run but more qb pressure would be huge.
I have an extremely vague knowledge of video games and do not think that mixup is surprising. I couldn't remember what Sonic was until you said he was a blue hedgehog and it clicked
I had a girl in my class who got pregnant in 8th grade. Kept the baby and had two more in 10th grade. Kept those ones too. Crazy. She lived in government housing and was proud that she had kids and could let them grow up there too.

I stayed in a dorm, we had our individual bedrooms with a common room and a shared bath. Maybe I had a "luxury suite"? All I know is my room wasn't much bigger than the space for a twin bed and a small desk and a "wardrobe" built into the wall, but I could close and lock the door. I'm sure that there have been bigger walk in closets, but it was a single room with a door!
okay boys, lets do it! puck goes in the net, not around the net, not into the crest, not passing into the other team's skates, and not iced into your zone.into. the. net.
In Starship Troopers 2, literally *everybody* is fucking.  Condoms are probably essential kit for the Mobile Infantry, though they didn't really go into detail about that stuff in the cartoon.
This sounds pretty normal to me. My younger is less on the "freak out if we leave" train, but his sister was that way until nearly three! And that "I'm moving and I don't like it" thing usually means they're about to learn a new skill. Around a year old, my daughter started to roll onto her back in her sleep--she'd never actually done that as a younger baby due to her huge size--and wake up *terrified* because she didn't know what to do. Keep in mind that this kid had been walking since she was eight months old. So she could walk, but not un-turtle herself. Good times.
Pure Pool. Mind you, it can also get frustrating, but it's a good game to just sit down with, listen to the smooth jazz soundtrack, and play some games of pool. 
Hey, I lost nearly 130 lbs.  So, yeah, I've been fat.I took it off by counting calories.  It has stayed off because I still keep an eye on calories and have banned things from my diet, like soda, fried foods and desserts.  It really isn't that difficult.
That's fair - I may just give a lot more benefit of the doubt to people, until I see a reason otherwise.But even so, I don't see such traits as something I should use to base a friendship off of. Nobody's perfect - and true friends help friends become better people all the same.
Lol its ok, I did that with the lucario figure on amazon. Accidentally ordered his figure thinking I got it for a really good price. Managed to cancel it before it got shipped though.
I don't understand why the hell people would buy stamps on the DNM when you can get a gram of fire for $160-$180. The math doesn't add up. For instance, I noticed that H-Train sells 50 stamps for $500.  He says that each stamp is around 30mg, so that 50 stamps buys you about 1.5g. Even if he's generous, maybe you get yourself 1.75g for $500.Or...you could get 3.5g of Panda Expresses FIRE for $580.  Or 2 grams of Dragon Cove's ridiculous dope for $420, and have $80 left to go buy paninis with.  Or whatever.  I don't get it. Can someone explain to me why people buy stamps on the DNM?

I always wondered... With all this heart-stopping sound, how much a risk is hearing damage? I find myself wincing in theaters occasionally due to the decibels. 
2500 + 15% = 370% Dust Devil dmg increase.With that extra damage you will kill the mobs a lot more quickly then they will be able to take that HP off ;)As said before either farm some more paragon levels or try roll higher VIT on your gear.
It's not determined, at this point. Lab Zero would like to do so, but there are things that need to happen with the publishers of the game (Autumn/Marvelous) first, for that to happen.
hey I mean you can't change it in melee and that didn't stop any of the metric crap ton of gods I could name right now who play that game at just an absurd level
Isn't this partly to blame on the fact that the Tesla's use the rear wheels for regeneration? Saw another post that said 15,000 miles is decent mileage on a set of Tesla rear tires.
Ah I understand that. One time some dude battled me FOR MY ARM REST. I was there first and he just kinda tried to shove my arm out of the way. I turned to him and just yelled "DUDE." in the middle of a packed theater. Needless to say he kept his arm crossed the entire movie.

Xanax by itself is kinda boring. Makes you feel kinda drunk and subdued but that's about it, it's a lot of fun while on weed though. That's just my opinion though.
Thank goodness she's alive! We may victory riot for now, but we have a long road ahead of us, Reddit. There are many more battles to be fought for our fellow TPP family member Tina.

&gt;You could start with the outfit of tacky pantyhose, horrible slouch socks, high waisted shorts. That alone is degrading .I just don't see how having to wear a tacky uniform is degrading.  Is it degrading to McDonalds employee's to have to wear tacky uniforms?  In fact their motto is "delightfully tacky yet unrefined".
I don't think he has to be great as a 2nd rounder.  I think he has to be good.  I think he could be a fine receiver in the NFL.  Deep threat and returner.  
I dunno, I think these new outfits still telegraph their personas. It's just that they've changed since we first met them. Amethyst going for so much black is kind of worrisome to me.
Hmm. Yeah everything I have read says that "Marijuana and all related byproducts are detrimental to child development during pregnancy and can have lasting repercussions after birth." But, it seems to me, that this is the same crowd who vilify weed in all instances. And, I can't imagine Cannabis products are any more toxic than pharma's prescribed "safely" during pregnancy.

I play PS4 to pass time and there are a few sites dedicated to whether or not the PlayStation network is down.On an unrelated note, I love call of duty, but it's so infested with niggers that it's almost not enjoyable.
It's funny cause it's really just 2 short verses.  There is not even a chorus.  It's kind of a musical painting more than a classic structured song.  That was a cool thing about Jimi. Something that not even every classic guitar hero could do.  Jimi could just generate beautiful sound.
I kind of wonder if it was misdirection from JMS. He'd have posted the Justin stuff before people really knew what Lorien was, so that would avoid saying "oh yeah the man in-between is the oldest being in the galaxy and he wants to help end the war." Spoilers and all.

The Very first time i played i thought the way to go was the Graveyard, and i got Killed there so many times that i Got Frustrated and made a new character, thinking i did something wrong, Then when i got to firelink Shrine on the new character, i Saw a bloodstain on the ground of someone Falling to his Death Near the Steps of the correct way you are supposed to go (you head right and up instead of left and down), and upon going that way i actually managed to play the game and not die to skeletons anymore! (at least until i was forced to go there but by that time i was ready for them!)
It's all over the place. The fancy pick is either RB Gordon or Gurley since it addresses the RB need. However, running backs can be found in later rounds, so possibly defense or o-line here IMO. 
Why, the answer is obvious! Greece is not a vacuum of Euros, but simply the entrance to a financial wormhole!

I do plan on working in the US at least once in my career, but am somewhat unsettled by some of the working conditions (high ratios, customer service aspect, litigiousness).This looks like this a precursor to staffing ratios. I hope it gets passed.
Oh goodness, I also was hit on once and when I was 25! Obviously, also by a guy who looked like he was 19 at best. He said he 'wanted to kiss me', but I 'looked upset'.

Focus on improvement over characters. It is very easy for characters to get stale or turn into tired shtick  which could prove problematic if you base your comedy and audience during your formative period on it. 
You're right that people often fall off their diet and gain the weight back, but the body doesn't want to store fat? Really? That's biology. Fat is an energy source when times are lean. Your body stores fat as a way to make sure that the body can survive as long as possible without food.
Quite a few, most recently with the guy I'm seeing tomorrow. Feeling interested in the conversation is pretty much my only requirement for accepting a date right now. 
I'd love to know what plugins you have.  Apparently quite a few ipage users got hacked around Dec 1 with the same code.  (including me).

Would not replace Rosetta with Colt. Colt doesn't have the spark buff. I would replace Maxwell with Colt or Kira though. Both Kira and Colt have the crit buff. Kira has ATK/DEF down while Colt has the 5BC/turn though. I guess it'd make more sense to switch to Kira since you're leading with Feeva, so maintaining BB/SBB spam isn't going to be an issue. 
Teams provide them. For Free. Players choose not to use them because it's like admitting that you overdid "fun." They think if they can drive themselves home, no one finds out how wasted they are, and it's almost proof that they weren't *that* wasted.
Well, if our society was particularly concerned about dog petting representation in film, I'd agree that there would be an equivalence in your comparison... but as it stands, media is a reflection of our culture. It seems to me that the Bechdel test demonstrates that it fails even basic representation.
I believe it's an add-on offered by most laser engraving manufacturers. Generally I think you want to get it installed with the machine so that the machine can control the rotation rate to match the etching rate.Edit: Googling brings up some stuff that shows you can attach the rotary tool when required, the assembly takes up space in the laser engraving bed so you don't want it permanently installed. http://www.instructables.com/id/Rotary-Etching-on-an-Epilog/

They're great, they're fantastic, they're in my top list, too, but man, what else can be said about them that doesn't make the whole notion redundant?

Interesting. This is something that I might consider doing just to get out and see another part of the world for a while. If you don't mind, about how much was the offer and was there any sort of relocation/signing bonus involved?
Enjoy it! It can be scary but that fear comes from a good place, it's more like excitement.  After the first few communicants the process will become natural but still exciting. Folks will find fun ways to confuse you but you are supposed to move slowly anyway so just take a breath and respond calmly.  Clean the cup, rotate the cup, say the words, it's actually very centering like prayer beads.
Really? I think I got mine on sale for like... $15? Not sure, but it wasn't much at all.I follow your thinking though. You're probably okay whatever you do. I also have a... not a Rigid, hmm, one of the other Home Depot house brands. Not simple, but a nice one with magnet and all. It's good too.
It was 50 years before we learned the CIA received a large part of its early funding from the $15+ Billion Marshall Plan......there are still thousands of files from the JFK whacking which are still secret (many are still heavily redacted as well)...So don't hold your breath--these fuckers know they can't allow the TRUTH to become public.

Not to hijack this, but should I give Brooklyn Lager another go?A couple of years ago I was at the closing down party for The Resurrection bar in Brunswick. The bar ran out of beer, so the staff ran down the street and grabbed a few slabs of Brooklyn and started selling it.I don't know if maybe it wasn't cold enough, but holy shit it tasted bad. I'm pretty down for a crap beer, but it was almost undrinkable to me.
Thank you! It's a birthday cake for someone. I was planning on making and decorating it all tomorrow and then giving it to them tomorrow, but their birthday isn't until sunday and I didn't want them peek at it until then, but maybe it'd be best to just go ahead and let them eat it before hand. 
The dead bodies on my bed at home have lost all of their lovely aroma over the years and have mostly turned to leathery mounds with protruding bones due to the cool dry climate of my basement. I may have to replace them soon so it feels like home again. The strange meat in my freezer, however, gets better with time -- contrary to popular belief.
lol yeah I noticed that. I knew the core was considered good, but never really why. Right now I'm experimenting with a M-Aggron Sylveon core with bulky Dragonite to cover their weaknesses. My M-Aggron has Twave, EQ, SR, and Heavy slam
You're right that the path of the object doesn't matter for potential energy; only change in height. Your energy equation is a little bit off: the ball has rotational as well as kinetic energy at the start of the problem and unless the ball comes to rest at the top of the loop, it will still have kinetic and rotational energy there in addition to PE its gained.
He can team fight, he isn't shit in lane, he helps other lanes with howl, he can solo rosh, he naturally builds a Vlad's that helps the whole team, he now has a 3k awesome evasion item, necrobook got buffed, he doesn't need a 20k net worth to do anything, he has a haste rune with ult (compare with movement nerf in metamorphosis), you can scout with invis wolves, deward and catch invis heroes with necro 3, the whole team benefits from Lycan's passive, the whole team benefits from the AC he usually builds......I guess that's all I can think of right now. 
Just a few things because I'm only 14 minutes in but will most likely fall asleep during this (its 2am, not the videos fault).That paint color in the kitchen, fine, fine choice by Jackie I'd guess.From what we got to see of the outside of the house and then what looked to be the guest house.. Dude I'm happy for you so much right now.And lastly, I never thought I'd get so much joy out of another man talking to me as he dropped his massive load in the middle of a field.
I never see anyone mention Bear hands, but if you've listened to them, could you imagine them live?! Alongside them, I wanna see vacationer, Fiance, Borns, and especially the Generationals. 
I just want to point out that the peaceful protests are not "black supremacist" rallies. It's literally people who don't want to be shot for their skin color. More than 30% of all people killed by cops are black in the U.S.. Black people are around 13% of the total U.S. population. They are killed at the highest rates, around triple the rate of white people (who are 60-70% of the country but make up 40% of deaths by cops). The rioters are just angry people. But there have been extremely violent and destructive riots by white people over *sports games* and spring break in the US that is only called "drunken revelry" by the news, and is barely covered. But if it's black people and there is a legitimate racial issue that they are protesting? Oops, better discredit all the black folk and make it sound like all 10,000 people are rioting and not just a couple hundred. 
I don't know if they would or not. Veterans Affairs isn't the DND, they are different entities.I am a VAC member, I live in the GTA though. The first office I dealt with was in Scarborough, the current one is in Kingston.
To clear it up, most of the "suicides" were forced by Jim Jones. They were often threatened (and shot) if they resisted, so there really wasn't any way to escape.

Well in this case (email, contacts and calendar) allowing data export is pretty much a by product of allowing third party access. I mean, it isn't really possible to allow me to load my calendar into my desktop calendar app without simultaneously giving me the ability to completely extract my calendar data.
Yes, they go DDD, F, G, and stop at H. At least in the Lane Bryant store that's near me, I'm not sure about stores in other locations. And thank you, I will give that a try.
Indeed, it's not really something anyone would *guess;* an east Asian country relying more on maize than on rice is pretty counterintuitive.The reason for it is that Kim Il-Sung decided that maize would help the PRK achieve self-sufficiency (a tall order since the South has most of the good farmland,) and mandated that communal farms grow it.I have no idea what his logic was, but I would imagine he foresaw either better production than rice or an ability to utilize new farmland where rice would not grow.
I had a 90 y/o 0/0/0 monarch get a 0/0/0 heir minutes before dying, and minutes after his Lux Stella 6/6/5 heir died in a hunting accident. In a game where I was going for a meticulously planned WC. That was rough.
I think Will's is discrimination, but not misogyny. The way he kept going on about her having no soul seems like to me it was more likely because she is Persian and most likely Muslim. Dan seems pretty misogynist in general (actually just ignorant all around) because according to Shirin in her RHAP interview he would refer to Sierra as a battered woman. With Rodney he definitely has misogynists opinions and this comes from being a 20 something meathead in Boston.

If I want a WR out of college I want a dude who can make plays. Not a dude who's entire highlight real is just to run 9's and outrun shitty college DBs. Coopers highlight real is identical to Heyward Beys highlight real. Just running posts/flys for 6 minutes. That shit dont work in the NFL.
Dynasty 350 is an inverter machine so you should be able to change the AC frequency. transformer machines (older) will usually be locked at 60hz which is quite low (and why you would ball your tungsten) If you are on an inverter machine, up the frequency to 120-140 and sharpen your tungsten to a point and then just blunt the very tip. if you are trying to hold and edge or get into an acute angle, up the frequency more (170-200 range) 
I've been composing for about 14 years now (I'm 25) and only within the last year have I had pieces regularly performed by people who aren't me, and those only because I joined a composers' collective, who organise monthly concerts at which pieces by 7 members will be performed. Other than that, I've had a handful of my choral works performed, a piano trio thanks to my masters, and I've won a single competition, the result of which is a premiere today (May 1st). The key thing is that you must *keep putting yourself out there*. I have entered so many competitions in the last 7-8 years and am only finally starting to place highly in them. This isn't because I'm good at entering competitions, but because I write *constantly*, so I'm always improving as a composer, and also getting better at targeting audiences. This year I resolved to enter 4 competitions every quarter, and so far I'm more or less on target. 
This argument is sorta perpendicular to what's being said.  If the only necessary guide to behavior was the necessities of the ancestral environment, there would be no point in treating women as anything other than labor and brood mares to begin with.If we're going to have a society based on treating both genders as _people_ then women have to be forced to treat men better.  
I definitely didn't regret buying the Cobra. It's a great all-around ship. Used it for smuggling, trading, and bounty hunting and it did all very well. I only went exploring with it for a *very* short distance but it definitely has the capacity to do so.(Just don't be like me and forget heat sink launchers)
Ahhh ok I think I get what you mean now. Yeah, for a lot of women this sub is a place to vent social/social-political issues that can't really be vented in person and/or the rest of reddit without getting shit for them, and I do get that. It can be easy to get caught up in that vortex of cynicism, especially when it relates to societal perceptions/expectations of women.But, you're right, it's necessary to pull back eventually and embrace actually being who you are in spite of the bullshit (as much as you can anyway). Like sex shaming; I don't have the luxury to say it doesn't bother me in general because of the harm it causes, but personally? Yeah I don't give a fuck if someone writes me off for enjoying sex and my sexuality. I'm damn proud of all the pleasure I've had!

If you want to avoid the subject and leave it alone then it can be done. You might want to make the point that you are disinterested in driving your mother away from her religion, but because it is dividing you and you love her it may force you to do so. You want to respect her beliefs and not challenge them and avoid the subject for her sake. It is honest and clearly puts you as the person that is being challenged and shows that if pressed you can strike back. Tell them that it would be terrible to challenge her beliefs in the disrespectful way that they are treating yours, but if they want to make it so that one of you changes your beliefs then you intend to win. 
You're being dishonest to push a narrative that the U.S. sold biological weapons to Iraq. In reality the U.S. holds those strains in the CDC (Center for Disease Control) and is bound by treaty to send them to other countries for research purposes. The U.S. sent the samples and the Iraqis later weaponized them. "In delivering these materials "The CDC was abiding by World Health Organization guidelines that encouraged the free exchange of biological samples among medical researchers..." according to Thomas Monath, CDC lab director. It was a request "which we were obligated to fulfill," as described in WHO and UN treaties.[5]"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_biological_weapons_program
Happy to, without disclosing any confidential information. This isn't actually the amount we've asked for. We've never had a conversation with the State about hard figures.  They refused to make an offer when the barrier to suit was still in place.  The $250K figure is solely an amount put on the very first pleading filed to convey to the State how serious we were about the case. There are also jurisdictional requirements. This case will likely not approach anywhere near that amount. The actual perpatrators are judgment proof and our clients were legitmately harmed. Though these employees committed the crime, the State's failure to act enabled it. Since it's public record, I can comment. At the Hearing several State employees testified that there were holes in nearly every women's shower and toilet, in every building,  and that the holes existed for almost a decade. If these were a year old, there'd be no case (legally or otherwise). Ten years is unacceptable.
If that is true, then I think there are a few things to consider:-How different cultures measure intelligence-How external influences (i.e. society, nutrition, etc.) may affect intelligence-Whether or not the IQ test is reliable or valid, particularly across different cultures-etc.

Is it just me or does it appear like the person who posted the sign purposefully stained it, to make it look aged? That or a passerby generously displayed their art skill of 'fingerpanting using their morning coffee.'
The study you are referring to is not the one we are discussing, nor is it the one that the CDC basis its estimate on. Again, we are talking the total number of women in the US, alive today, who have been raped in their lifetime. Not the prevalence of college campus rape.And again, yes, it's amazing that reported rapes have been decreasing. 270 000 sexual assaults reported every year - especially considering the number that go unreported - is still a lot. The fact that it may have been worse before does not make it good now.

4.5 lbs is too heavy?!

I considered that, but I think the issue is that selling the (prescription) antiseptics is illegal, so they are chasing down shops that either use them "as part of a medical procedure", or re-selling them as controlled, medical-grade substances. You'd think they would use their time to do something like stop arsonists and rapists, but noooo.
&gt;Its never PURELY recreational.It is for me right now...&gt;If you consent to sex, the probability of pregnancy is something, compared to zero for not consenting sex(except rape).Just because it is probable does not mean Someone consented to that probability.&gt;You agreed for sex, you agreed to that small probability of pregnancy.Nope, they are completely seperate consents.  This is aparent when a woman takes preventative measures *after* sex.&gt;Not its your choice to do what ever you wish with the embryo.Wait, I thought you said you were not against abortion...

PFF has been against Leonard Williams for awhile now saying he is overrated. I personally agree he shouldnt have been a top 5 pick, and NFL teams seem to agree.
No no no no. You got it wrong here bro. C9/TSM were the shit team who magically made it through just to get crushed.Fnatic would have had a real chance to go at least to the semi. And yes top 4 is already great.Didn't happen, can't prove it, but you just have to check world matches and open your eyes, you'll the level Fnatic displayed.

GamerGate should never be given up. Never. Absolutely never. Its momentum is immense, and we should make use of that until the end of time.That said, we do need a tag with a larger scope, in parallel to GamerGate, and this topic is what that's about.

There are so few Urbane watches in the wild, and even fewer owners willing to do Q&amp;As about them and their software. Would you mind settling an argument about 5.1.1 Hangouts for me? Basically, **can you initiate Hangouts conversations from Wear?**Useful details (needed for science)1. What version of Android are you running on your phone? 5.1?2. What version of Hangouts are you running on your phone? [This version for Lollipop phones](http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/hangouts/hangouts-3-2-91698097-android-apk-download/) found on APK Mirror is rumored to add enhancements for your Urbane (and Wear 5.1.1 in general) like wifi support and maybe a dedicated Hangouts launcher on the watch. Nobody I've talked to knows for sure.3. Does your Urbane have the Hangouts app listed in its app launcher?Thanks for taking time out from playing with your new toy to check. It's a silly request, I know, but would mean a great deal.
My best guess would be to try fiddling with the "Root Transform Rotation" options found in the Animations tab of the model's import settings (in Unity).

&gt;There may be some places that permit one to go naked under freedom of speech, but Arizona is definitely not one of them.It would be a federal ruling, not a state one, so what arizona thinks doesn't matter (granted you might have to go through several appeals to get the ruling, but there is precedence, so it probably won't).
One of the key fundamentals of the argument is whether you have the belief that stupid people have the ability to get out of their own way - a sort of question about the reality of 'free choice' in our own sentience. 
&gt;This bill will provide a tax benefit for businesses that operate in a communist fashion.well if they were truly communist, there would be NO profit incentive.&gt;Tax cuts to any other businesses are not considered.you're right, because this is a bill about coops, not multinational corporations. If you want a bill about those or some other type of business you're more than welcome to write one.&gt;This bill creates a large, federal bureaucracy to have its hand in these communized businesses.having their hands in it isn't the right idea. It's merely incentivizing, through tax reductions, a particular type of business be formed.&gt;Now, you folks like to claim that you want LESS federal, centralized governmentThat seems more to be an expressly libertarian socialist ideal, and while our party does include such believes, I don't think it is the main tenant that the party was founded on.

On my AP Physics C tests you've only ever needed to do some complex divisions using your calculator. If you know how the equations work you could probably get by with just a scientific calculator, not even a graphing.
Really the only way I could think you'd be able to do it by yourself would be to drag it up the stairs on it's side, with it kind of laying/leaning against the wall to prevent it from folding. The floppiness factor can make it very difficult, the more floppy the mattress is. If you're not able to drag it upstairs (walking backwards upstairs while you pull the mattress up behind you, very slowly and carefully) by yourself then I don't think you're going to have any other choice but to ask someone for help.
Well gee, I thought the same thing until I was contacted by California Tax Board.  My advise is not to take out of state work until you are sure that California doesn't consider you a resident.

I kind of agree with Molson about his assessment of QUT and UQ and their differing traditions. But can't agree about people dropping it. There's this whole "UQ is like the Vestal Virgin, Precious and Special" which just reeks of desperation. In the workplace there are people who do actually go on and on and on about their UQ degrees. It's just a Queensland thing and proves how backward the place is, especially out there in the burbs. I see theyre in the news today denying the cheating Four Corners allegations. UQ is special, they came out denying it all. Yeah right, UQ is "special" in this world.Gimme a fucking break.

&gt;Of course they want to. How else can they keep NASA from telling the world about the dangers of ~~climate change~~ aliens?That's the *real* agenda here.
This is what I've heard (unsure of the validity): Apparently all they are doing for chromas right now is editing the hex code for the colour. Zac's model isn't programmed the same way as any of the other models as it's a very dynamic model (it's constantly resizing and stretching) so it's no as simple in his code to just change a hex value on a body part.
I dont have the access to the late night barn so I am not to worried about two of those,but holy hell I am pissed about Nahko. I am also worried about Umph with Manic focus and Break Science on two sets friday. Not too happy about Eoto and Karl Denson either. I am personally more worried about the Keller/StS9 conflict because I wanted to see keller solo soo bad.
What makes you think anyone who posts on reddit does it for karma? And why is everyone saying it's "humiliating people for their weight", when the joke is THEY LOOK LAKE AN OLDER AND FATTER VERSION OF MARIO AND PEACH. Yes, Peach gaining weight would count as "letting herself go" but the joke is not "look at these fat fucks lol". 
It's actually quite easy to recruit lords in Pendor, possibly even too much. If you have a relationship of about 15 with them and beat them in battle and have the option to cature them, you should see a message like "this lord genuinely admires you and your kingdom". If that happens you can take them prisoner and then talk to them to  grant them the option of becoming your vassals in exchange for their freedom. Mind that when you capture them you slightly lose relationship with them, so they may go down behold the threshold to recruit them.If you don't have a good relationship with them you can raise it by beating them and letting them go, every once in a while this will actually lower it even further because they will feel disgraced, but it's pretty rare.
I was disappointed, but upon reflection I think I liked Williams more because he wanted to play for us, not how much of an improvement and impact he would have.I think Cooper will immediately give us an air threat, with crabtree, streater, jones, and Holmes we could have an actual legit WR team. I'm stoked after actually thinking it over. 
lol, okay. When there's a problem with the button, someone is up to fix in within thirty minutes at 2 am. Just because two people aren't watching the button 24/7 doesn't mean life is going on like the button isn't happening at reddit. 
Gold armour sucks. It's heavy and any sword would cut through it like a knife through butter. You're a sitting duck wearing it. There's a reason gold armour was never a thing IRL.
It's easy to not want to change the status-quo when you're not directly harmed by it and can also exploit it for your own gain. Most straight women I know who don't identify as feminists (or even egalitarians) are also big supporters of conservative gender roles and some of them seem to really enjoy the double standard women are treated with.

look in your task manager for a shitload of steamwebhelper.exe processes and just kill all of them.  That makes my framerate jump from ~15 to a solid 60.
That 4th place steal...The stuff of legends.EDIT: Haha, in the third race he said he was the worst at the level, and then he ended up being first far ahead of second.
If people find someone like Tim to be "infuriating," than they must not interact with that many infuriating people in their lives.Also for whatever stupid reason, people just seem to get mad at people for dressing in a "hipster" way and they just start giving them shit for that. It's just clothing people.
Was it just me, but did anyone else catch Amethyst saying "I'm practically perfect" to the tune of Mary Poppins' song from the movie? Sounded oddly close to the song.
It's because his first comment was that trist was garbage, and then he got beat in a match against her and changed his mind.Same with Lucian when he was first picked up in LCS. Doublelift said Lucian sucked, and then it became 100% pick/ban.Pretty sure he said that about kali as well, but that one I can't honestly remember.
I don't think collectible is a bad thing, necessarily . I may be misunderstanding how you are using the term but, but If I understand right, Krosmaster is in the same vein as an LCG, essentially. If you want something, you can buy it- but it's not mandatory, your minis aren't going to be suddenly no longer useful. They may not always be perfectly balanced, but I'm not competitive enough for that to bug me- i'd rather just keep trying different combos etc more than trying to find the overpowered combo. 
Based on tne aprox measurement of chamber, I guessed .32, you mentioned it was a S&amp;W, could see it was a top break with a spur trigger. Googled something to the effect of "smith and wesson top break .32 spur trigger" and combed over images until I found a match that linked out to an old auction
That's awesome! How's art school?? Also I haven't looked into work study I'll contact finantial aid tomorrow while I'm looking into all that schedule business. I don't have any family that can pay, my moms is estranged and my dads family live in poverty like we did for awhile.
Williams is kind of all alone in third with about ~40 points ahead and behind them right now, but I'm genuinely curious to find out what areas they're focusing on.  ^at ^least ^it ^will ^stop ^me ^from ^making ^things ^up I wonder if this season will produce any design/counterdesign action with teams reacting to each other... one car shows up with a new nose and better pace and then two races later the garage next door unveils new imitation noses, that sort of thing. 
Personally, I just use soundhound. I've got a one by one widget on my home screen, and I just press it when I want to know who sang what song. Works easy and fast.
Most of Josephine's perks are pretty useless. I usually get the speech perks, inventory boosts, potions boost, gear for my respective class, and perks that increase the experience I gain.
22 credits is quite low for a Winter Term - were there extenuating circumstances that required you to take so few courses?  In any case, your best bet is to talk to your faculty advisor since they can tailor advice to your specific situation (and that's what their job is).
&gt; A film remains Certified Fresh unless its Tomatometer falls below 70%.To be fair, that line doesn't appear in the main Tomatometer window via the link at the top, nor on the [about page](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/about/), and in fact seems to only show up on [the licensing page](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/help_desk/licensing/).
I did! I got winston. His awareness is only 78. But his throw power is 98 and his mid range is 98 as well. only 88 deep tho. Very fast in the pocket. I put him up for auction. 
I've been in workplaces with a casual Friday. I just ignored it. People just assumed my boss was a bit of a stickler (which he was) so accepted it. Didn't help that the one time I went to work in casual clothing, my boss kept making beatnik/Maynard Krebs jokes.
&gt; have you heard of raf or that nsu shit ? plenty of atheist terrorists here in germanyDifference between committing an act in the name of religion, and committing an act in the name of another ideology while incidentally also being religious (or atheist) at the same time. There's no such thing as atheist fundamentalism, atheist ideology, atheist dogma. The closest you can get is anti theism, which in extreme forms might seek to actively eradicate religion.edit:I took /u/EestiCanIntoNordic's comment&gt; Yeah, those damn atheist German terrorists again. /sto mean:  "Those damn people committing x act because of atheism again", contrasting it to Salafist extremism.  It's of course possible that this interpretation is wrong and that he meant that Salafists happen to be more violent than atheists for reasons that don't follow from Salafism itself. In this case the ideology indeed wouldn't matter.
Well, I got some After Story Stuff off of iTunes, if not just [look here](http://anime.thehylia.com/soundtracks/album/clannad-after-story-op-ed-single-toki-wo-kizamu-uta). The majority of AS's soundtrack is from the first anyway bar a few unique ones I believe.

Thanks! I won't have the same experience as most college goers because there's no dorms so I'll be living with my parents yet. But it's one of the more mature colleges in my state and I'm looking forward to that. My life really is just begininning! Wow sounds like a lot of work. Congrats on your enagement! That sounds like a lot going on in your life! I hope your wedding planning goes smoothly without too much stress. I'm sure your wedding will be beautiful:) Sure does sound like financially stressful time, but in the end it'll be so worth it!
Lmfao, your comment is so irrelevant I can't even follow how you think I am responding the original post. He asked what Squire is and Squire is talked about in the wiki.Idiots like you bro, idiots like you and the idiots who upvote the idiots like you. tisk tisk.
I have to go to Texas frequently and I think that depending on where I am on the map, the citizens range from left-leaning, reasonable people who respect others, are not racist or sexist, and try to not crap up the environment to the other end of the scale where the locals all seem like Pat Robertson's and Michelle Bachman's love child who is being raised in an NRA camp/megachurch.  Praise Jesus.  
That person's just fucking dumb. Europeans are well aware of how big the US is. Don't judge us by that guy.The other issue that comes into play here is that you don't just drive the same distances in Europe - not many people would drive from, say, France to Russia because of border crossings/visas, petrol costs when planes can be so cheap, and just generally navigating. European roads are complicated. American roads are mostly long, straight or in a grid system.
I was playing a Position 4-5 Magnus, after 3 kills where I assisted 2 and killed one hero, I gained a total of 1400 gold early in the game ( around 16-20 minutes ).This helped me complete my Blink Dagger really faster than normal, since I was playing a support position I liked being able to get many items from fighting and helping my cores.http://i.imgur.com/GeM8bgk.pngOverall I like the Patch, I think Glimmer Cape is really good, but maybe it's too cheap ( 1950 gold for a better castable mini-riki invisibility seems too good ).I would give a 400-600 recipe to Glimmer Cape so it would join the ranks of Forcestaff / Blink Dagger utility item prices.
Great post, and a great analysis of what's going on, I think. Just one little point: I obviously don't know the particulars of your father's general store, nor do I know what role it served in the community. But I think there's grounds to take this a step further than you're taking it: what if your father *was*, though obviously not unintentionally, just slightly responsible? I mean, if these people are on the brink of starvation, without electricity or plumbing or whatever else, is it really fair to say that they're not justified in being angry at the guy making a nice living selling them things they need to survive? 
Okay.Basically, we can nominate a user, and everyone votes yes or no. Once we come to a consensus, one of the mods will make a decision.It's in their hands now, my friend.
Thanks very much. Would the category for ad hominem arguments, abuse or profanity (not in this case, but it's happened before) be "other"? And then a description? Sorry. I'll bet this is in some general instruction page somewhere.
moddiy.com has [good ones](http://www.moddiy.com/products/Professional-Single-Sleeved-Cable-Wire-Clear-Comb-%284-to-24-Slots%29.html) for a few dollars. shipping takes a while though.
Dont like to wear gear. Hardly ever get stung, when i do, its usualy when my fat belly pinches one when i bend. (My fault).  A sting on the head is very annoying,and until you get used to it, its distracting. Inhaled a few bees till i learned to keep my mouth shut. Lol
hahaha, no word of a lie, I got my motorcycle off a guy in florida, and it came with a "my other ride is your daughter" sticker. I was going to take it off but I sort of fell in love with it
My WOW character has been forced to die over 10,000 times, that means I had to watch my poor representation of myself get slaughtered and brutally murdered 10,000 times.  This is deplorable and death should not be aloud in online games.
&gt; 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.&gt; 4:5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.Compare those with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/346fxe/i_think_this_hadith_is_disgusting_and_that_the/) Are you even kidding me right now? And have you not see this discussion? Like really?

There is no hardcover at this time. I wouldn't wait for one to be announced since DC usually releases HCs before paperbacks. You could wait for an omnibus, but it's not a sure thing that one will happen. 
I think it's inevitable that we play the Spurs since I don't think the Clippers can win the series. At least we'll be well rested and they're older. I actually want to see Dwight get hacked because he shoots a high percentage when he gets in a rhythm (Jordan is just a terrible shooter who can't get in a rhythm). Also it'll be nice to stay in Texas for the 2nd round. 
Ah yes, the episode 4 ending was really unexpected. To me, at least. Can't wait for the next episode indeed. I also assume it'll explore the subject of [Spoiler time. Plastic spoilers. Memories.](/s "what happens to Giftias once the time has passed and what the black marketers do. This might be quite the turning moment in the anime.")
A really good point. Your hands are the dirtiest part of your body, and you're always touching your phone with your hands...Urine, on the other hand, is sterile.
LOL you know wy people don't 3 star max th8's in your clan? because you have this mentality that it can't happen. watch onehiveraid's videos. go to a serious war clan. TH8's get 3 starred, first attack, every single time by our TH8's with either dragloon or mass hogs. on your base, lightning spell one AD and sweep base with funneling dragons and loons. very easy.granted with this new airsweeper it'll change a few things, but still should be easy three stars with dragons, and just as easy with hogs.
The problem is with how a lot of subs bring on new mods. It's really tough to get good candidates. We brought on a bunch of mods in /r/Apple a while back and it was a lot of work to sort and assess every applicant.I think a big part of it is asking the right questions and not being afraid of making mistakes. Mod teams have no obligation to keep on mods if they cause trouble, especially if they're new. Sometimes applicants don't work out, and that's OK.But a lot of mod teams get jaded, and so they rarely bring on new mods and never inexperienced ones from the community. Things stagnate, and the most active and vocal people tend to be the ones who mod a lot of subs. This can be helpful, to have a wide experience, but it attracts users who are dedicated to the wrong things, their ego and not the community.Being a good mod is a lot of work, and in bigger subs it's rarely fun. So it's tough to find good people. They're out there, just rare.

I would love the chance to get to play Animal Crossing. Money is tight and I'm bumming missing the 15 dollar sale on it(my target doesn't carry it). Thanks for doing this!
It's not the vassal-leader issue in play here. It is the fact that Independent Rulers are shoved into levy stacks and randomly butchered or crippled in unrealistic ways by a vengeful RNG - (40 straggler viking raiders kill the King of Ireland in the middle of a stack of 8000 levies).
GREAT JOB! I love this series! Upset that Kermit lost subscribers... Sorry for saying this, but in Twitter followers, Jwong has more followers than Kevin.
Good luck I was cheated on in my 10th year too. Had known for 12. That was 7 years ago. Still hurts even though he is fine and working on our relationship. 
yeah i dunno why everyone in this thread is LOLING the pick... its not sexy to take olinemen this early, but you needed OLINE help, i think its a really solid pick
&gt;Hurry up and go have people prepare a banquet for tonight. Wharton must be dreaming right now. First he gets to become a FullGod. And now he gets to prepare a banquet for Linley???Well shit. Wharton deathflag raised?
I was using Amex Serve, which allowed you to turn CC charges into paper checks.  Sadly, they discontinued that feature earlier this month.  You can still do similar stuff with a Target debit card called Redbird, except not in my state (NC).I'm getting out of churning due to FIRE'ing later this year so I don't mind so much.
Dude has a couple of serious negative marks.  Doesn't explode off the line and takes plays off.  Having watched a lot of PAC12 games, I can't say I'm surprised he's falling.
You're not gonna get Kessel for that...they'd want Mantha at least.  Plus I feel our concern is more center orientated than winger at this point in time.  We need a legit 2nd line center who can take over as a 1st if need be.
I've always wanted to go to England. If I were there now, I'd help you celebrate. But I am stuck here in the former Colonies called the States.Anyway...HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  :)
what if we sell tubes and computers that are classified as "duel use,"  are aware of a country using chemical weapons repeatedly,  and then afterwards findings state that the articles sold were in fact,  used for that  purpose? 
&gt; ... Hashim Nzinga said since America has “declared war on us,” evidenced by “military police in the black neighborhood”Has he not noticed that rioters and looters are destroying Baltimore, and the police have been given a 'stand-down' order? &gt; “We pay taxes. They have declared war on us and it’s nothing but state racism.”What in the ever-loving fuck is he yammering on about? Institutional racism is all but dead in this country, and good.      How can people support this? This isn't racism? Is he not putting a target on every white person in sight to his fellow violent, racist Black Panthers? Jeez - even the Southern Poverty Law Center calls them a violent, racist and anti-Semite hate group:http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/groups/new-black-panther-partyHow many Reddit lefties actually support the BP's?
Well, let's see. The white man invented the electric light, the transistor, the internal combustion engine, nuclear fission, the automobile, the airplane, space flight, television, radio, the internet, etc.  Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most resource rich continents on the planet. it is also the poorest.  If the white man had never set foot on African soil then blacks would still be living in tribes as hunter/gatherers and subsistence farmers. They wouldn't even have the wheel.  Black Africa never developed a civilization even close to that of the Aztecs, Incas or Mayas.  Much less did they even come close to that of the Romans.  What is so complex about it. The poorest nations are black. The least developed nations are black. There is no black equivalent to Germany or Switzerland anywhere on the planet.
&gt;Did you think you could acess and play all the content of the game easily, like you would in the arcade?How dare you downplay the hard work players before you took upon themselves. There were a quite a few songs on DDR Extreme that my group worked on unlocking in the arcade, when the new game was released.Edit: Meant to be tongue-in-cheek in tone.
lol its pretty fucking nuts they pack arenas 10k plus of people here is Phil Taylors walk on to see the crowd sizehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG5tvJQBTAkhers is a clip of MVG throwing 17 perfect dartshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGNZ3GqYrVYdarts is an absolutely crazy sportthey play every week on thursdays
That depends very heavily on the company's intentions and those of the recruiter.  I used to think the same as you, that they were to weed out a certain type of person.Then I had several different recruiters outright state they weren't sending my CV to the company because I didn't have those fictitious/impossible items listed. So no, if it says 3 - 5 years in something impossible, either the company or recruiter is an idiot and that job will be hell on wheels. 
So if someone holds the opinion that vaccination does more harm than good to children they can't be wrong even though it has been proven that they are wrong?
Actually, they're often portrayed as close personal friends and have worked together a lot. They're paired pretty frequently, actually. But you're right, they've also been played as rivals and pitted against one another fairly often as well.
My experience...The high school football and diving coaches wanted me to join. My older brothers had been allowed to play school sports. So I ask my parents if I can.Parents: Study over the material and think about it and then you decide.Me: Ok, thought it over, I want to playParents: Elder NotSoCrazy will meet with you and you'll decide after that.Elder: Same material. It's a personal decision, make a choice.Me: Ok, I've decided I want to playParents:  Wrong choice. We were just giving you the illusion of having a choice and hoping you'd make the one we wanted. No you may not play.
In some cases, the extra comma can make a sentence less clear. Like many "rules" of English, it's really a style choice. Pick a way, and stick to it; rewrite for clarity where needed whichever you choose.
I love 15th Century lute, I tune my mandolin to A415 and gallivant around the house just to get the [John Dowland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmsS3gPJhzo) vibe out. (I don't actually do this, I do however do it with later Baroque era composers like [Henrich Biber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHVSWRgCVrs) see 1:00 forward for why, not lute, still great )
Although its like 30 years old, its still indie. Rough trade records was an independent label, and the smiths are widely regarded as one of the first popular alternative/indie bands

What I think every time I hear that exchange:&amp;nbsp;"Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!""From my point of view, the Jedi are evil!""Well, I'm not going to downvote you because I respect your opinion and whatnot, but it doesn't seem like you want to engage in any sort of dialogue.""Dude, all I did was state my opinion.  If you can't handle other people expressing themselves then maybe you should get off the holonet.  And I never complained about downvoting because I'm not a whiny bitch.""Wtf why are you being so sensitive.  I'm just trying to explain how the Sith have you fooled, but you don't even want to challenge your preconceived notions about the galaxy.  Calling me a whiny bitch is totally unnecessary.""Re-read my last comment.  I did no such thing.""Well it was strongly implied.  I was willing to talk this through, but your being really difficult, so maybe we should just go our separate ways."Padme: "you're"
Alright I was done with this sub but I watched your damn video. Yes it appears that like I originally stated that some law enforcement over step their authority and Louisiana fixed that issue by halting the confiscations and passed legislation, House Bill 760. Prohibiting law enforcement from doing this again. So the precedent has been set. The NRA won the court case.  So why still quote it and worry about it if justice prevailed.And yes I own many firearms. It's to bad that I moved to Upstate New York were the gun control is the worse in the country. Now that's a topic I'll get real fired up about.
A schizophrenic child will generally be alright if their parents are good to them because schizophrenia is only triggered if the person has the gene for it and has had a large amount of stress. People usually begin to have signs of schizophrenia the first year of college around finals.Not to mention that schizophrenia before adulthood is extremely rare.
Working out a lot is not going to help you that much in a fight compared to actually learning how to fight (boxing, mma, etc).Source: I work out a lot
At the very end of the video he clearly is under his own power on his feet and stepping into the van. There's only one officer holding him by the elbow as he lowers his head and steps into the cell. 
Whether or not it's a problem isn't the point of the Bechdel test. If you accept that the Bechdel test illustrates an imbalance in gendered representation, and if you accept that this cannot be attributed to the fact that the test requires a lot of dialog, then we're on the same page *vis-a-vis* Bechdel. 
The human body amazes me when I see pix like this. The fat accumulates in such weird ways. As if evolution is saying, "I dunno bro, just put it over there. I don't give a shit."
From the readme:&gt; Finally, assuming you are using any textures from one of the folders starting with "Skies", you will need to make a tweak to your "Morrowind.INI". Open your .INI file, which is located in the root "/Morrowind/" folder. Use ctrl+f or find to locate the lines "Cloud Speed". &gt;&gt; On every value specified, divide by five. For example, "Cloud Speed=5" would become "Cloud Speed=1". This will make the clouds move the same speed as without the new meshes once you are finished installing.
Definitely don't break up. If I'm high on the marijuana I walk around kissing anyone I see. Super embarrassing.Seriously, weed isn't going to make you kiss someone anymore than caffeine is. Alcohol is a bullshit excuse.She cheated and lied about. The only good part is that there's no real ambiguity here. Choice is clear--dump her and move on.
this is a good idea, but sadly it just does not work that way. There is so much accountability on teachers that you can't implement this without their head on the chopping block. "You can't control your class" is what you are told and God forbid if you are under some kind of evaluation that year based on student growth. That is a good way to not have a teaching position due to your poor performance. It's not how it should be, but it is what it is.
&gt; Ive been losing Aces to 8 4 on a 8 4 4 flopThat's not losing on the river? If you get your chips in good, that's all you can ask for and it shouldn't affect your confidence one bit.If you're getting in bad, then re-evaluate your game
If it was an invitation, then it wouldn't be rape. But it isn't an invitation and shouldn't happen, ever. But in the real world, there are bad people out there. so people do need to look out for each other and take steps to prevent these incidents.
You should visit /r/Eyebleach for a little bit.Edit: It's been a while since I've looked at that subreddit. I don't remember such an abundance of stupid pet pictures. Still, though, it's better than maggot ridden flesh.
Not in terms of difficulty; in terms of lore. I can't fathom that a Smuggler, for example, could survive a confrontation with Vitiate; especially when he had no difficulty disposing of Theron and Lana.
Go to Activities, search for program "yelp" (it should display it's name as "Help"), open it and go to the section "Getting strated with Gnome".I do not know about the Chromium. I use Firefox primarily.
Oh, woe is her, she lives two hours from Detroit. Whatever. I live 35 minutes away, and I live in one of the highest earning counties/zip codes that exists in the state. She might live in Howell, where the Grand Dragon of the KKK used to live. Her whole racism! thing is absolute bullshit, as a native. Latina who looks white, blah blah blah. Racism entrenched in her excuses. Ugh.Edit: Actually, it's like HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATE FROM DETROIT. THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE CITY. 
Ever since that damn movie came out (I lie, I love that movie to bits!) I've been stopped everywhere by little girls. The admiration they have for a Disney character is amazing, hahah! 
you could invest a couple of bucks into autobackup4tech it's pretty good. I bought a lifetime license for my past job (my own licence) and I'm still using it three years later. There might be a new version with a different name, but if you just google that you should find it.Good luck !

Scherff isn't even a tackle prospect....he'd be a horrible tackle in the NFL imo....especially left tackle.  He might be able to move to the right side after some time at guard though 
Actually, when talking about these guys they make a distinction between quickness and speed. I'm not sure what the difference is but he wasn't just babbling.
It's a pretty fun game with some awesome multiplayer/co-op moments. Just don't go in expecting a layered or meaningful story experience out of it. Everything hints towards some kind of awesome, post-apocalyptic space-opera, but you'll never get anything besides hints. I only say that because the game starts out by setting all that up, and you expect something grand. Then you get annoyed because you realize it's nothing like what it was set up to be. Then you are pleasantly surprised because, despite not meeting the expectations the game sets itself up for, it's still damn fun.
Widespread? No. Common occurrence? In some places. Sorry, but I have meet to many vets who experienced different levels of discrimination. Either they are all lying, or its not an urban legend. I went to college in the early 90's, in my class was a retired Sergeant Major. Our professor was an old Hippy, who tried the urban legend story too, he was quickly put on his place. He told me of being called a "baby killer" in San Francisco. How soldiers would buy wigs, because waiters would refuse to serve military people and your haircut was a dead giveaway.

Mulligan alone is all the reason you need to reroll. 5% (or maybe lower, I can't remember for sure) chance to get a shot back, on a 3 round clip isn't going to help you much
Because at the end of the day they're becoming a new state, it's not some political rambling on about district redraws, it's a WHOLE NEW STATE. Sure some republicans might cry foul but ultimately they'll be in the minority.Also I forgot to add that the House expands by 1 member, if I remembered how it would work correctly.
Well, it has most of Ducal Prussia. Royal Prussia belongs to Poland according to Second Treaty of Thorn. Rest would be rightfully part of HRE as duchies of Pomerania and Silesia, while Landberg would indeed be rightfully part of Brandenburg.
Can I get some insight on why the Raiders didn't pick Williams? Don't you pick the best available player that early? Isn't Williams arguably the best player in the draft? 
I'm not so sure. We still have many incredibly diverse dog breeds around the world.And besides, couldn't one argue that different races (black, white, asian, ect) are kinda unofficial "species?"
I also understand people's objection to sacrificing liberty for security ;) but if you want the rule of law obeyed even in the dark corners of our cities then what other choice do we have than for police watching everyone everywhere?
I think its heavily implied that the Klaxxi, Nerubians and Quiraji are all descended from the same race after they were split up during the sundering. 
Firefighters-in-training, watching Firefighters in training...

I think we may have identified some future Seattle Firefighters.
Not sure why the downvotes, you're right. The whole concept of rep increase is not dying while scoring points. If you don't die then you just level up like it's all good and everyone is rep 4 by the end of the game. 
Thank you.  I hope it does get better.  So far it has been miserable.  My husband doesn't want to have anything to do with it.  He didn't want a child and he got his wish,  beyond that he's left me on my own with this.  It sucks.  He was awful while I was pregnant but amazing during the miscarriage... And now he's just indifferent.  It was my only chance and it's gone.  I think it's nice you guys do something yearly for it.  
Would absolutely work for a paladin, it's all just Northrend Quest gear except the Sword (a Northrend ~~dungeon~~ RAID drop) Shield (WoD BSing) and Tabard (Garrison Bunker)I'll get around to putting the priest one up soon!

It's not the kids we say terrible shit about...It's admin and parents we roast. A sophomore in a colleague' class momentarily got a tampon stuck in his nose. I wouldn't know how to spin that into a positive.

Also Canadian, and while it's not daily, I would not give certain items more than a week before they're gone. Samus and Blue Toad, for instance, sold out in a few days, and now my local TRU only has playsets and plushies now.
Atheist here, but speaking as an observer, I would generally define very broad and fuzzy criteria for what makes someone a "Christian" (e.g. do they say Jesus Christ and _mean_ it vs saying just "Jesus" or not knowing what "Christ" means) but with a lot of weight on **how a person choses to label themselves.**If someone labels themself X, I would only contradict then I the most extreme cases.People outside of a particular religion _tend_ to do the same (with some exceptions). Very few Christians would say that Sunni are Muslim and Shia are not and very few Muslims would say that Catholics are Christians but Mormons are not.Within a religion, however, this is often not the case. Within religion X, religion X is defined by practitioners and they more often disagree to the point of labeling variants other than their own "not religion X" the way many Christians don't consider Mormons Christians and many Muslims don't consider Shia Muslims.
I have an MOPC and I'm 6'5" 170. Fits great, so you should be fine. Remember to put in fake plates to make it fight right, you'd be surprised the difference it makes.
It's better than being entitled to anything. Over here, you have to work for it. I get paid to go to university because I got good grades and earned it, not just because I'm a citizen.
I dont see how this is news to anyone. Hai said it already in his AMA, on his stream, the dailydot said it on april first and again after Hai's official announcement, there was a thread about it this morning saying Incarnati0n just left for NA for the C9 tryouts. Why is this getting upvoted as if it was a scoop?
I thought the same, but I started to encounter people who wouldn't take notice that flash bombs don't work on certain monsters, and I didn't want to be the one to mess up because I couldn't see :c
I can't post a name without a reddit username. The list is meant for players to contact each other, /TT/ is not a badge or decoration to wear, it serves a use. If he makes a reddit account and comments that name here, I would be fine with adding him.

He's a good old fashioned social democrat type. I hope he makes a strong showing in the primaries and then runs as an independent. His message appeals to disenfranchised voters across the spectrum.He's the closest thing I can currently see to a UBI ally that can make any noise in the Democratic primary. That's a good reason to be supportive, but he's not our white knight, and supporting him has to be the means not the end.
&gt; but it was resolved with a phone call to their customer service.I have never gotten through in less than 25 mins on hold. My voicemails go unanswered. Emails go to a general mailbox which is handled by people who are not aware of your issue. No confirmation of receipt of requested documents. Duplicated actions because the backoffice miscommunicates requirments to support and support can't confirm what bakc office needs...it's a shitshow.
It's all paid for by the private sector, or the government accumulating a deficit. In the case of Manitoba, it's all deficit spending. This doesn't strike me as very sustainable. 
Sorry - /u/AntSmith17 just got the full thing so I had give the credit where it was due as he was the first to answer all parts of the question :(Credit also to /u/quarensintellectum for filling in the last bit for you... but it was after AntSmith17. I wish I can give you all the +Correct!
My lungs are stronger (I have mild asthma that's only set off if I'm sick). I quit smoking because, hey, gotta breathe better to run. I have less anxiety and running helps me deal with bad days. I lost weight and have no problems keeping it off. And my ass is pretty nice. 
:( All I want from a wrestling game is for one of these old AKI games to redone with some more modern graphics (the bits of the model that pop out of the joints really bother me), the animations and gameplay are all still top notch.  
Hope you guys enjoy it! I know the beginning is a little deceiving, but give it a shot and listen til' the end ;) I love all these songs in their own way and thought you guys might like them too. Check out my other mixes (which aren't entirely Porter influenced, but I can almost guarantee you guys will like those) and follow me for some awesome weekly mixes【=◈︿◈=】
In high school we used to pull lawn chairs into the shower and sit there buck naked drinking cold drinks from the vending machine just shooting the bull and soaking in the heat.  And these were totem pole showers, not the fancy ones with shower heads along the walls.  The assumption of privacy in public showers is not a common sentiment in my experience. 
The election in the UK has lots of talk of mansion taxes, immigration, and the national housing crisis. There's also the coming referendum on the EU if the Conservatives win. New tax rules already saw a drop in luxury purchases this past year, so I hear!
It's like The Walking Dead but with a catch. You can travel back in time to change decisions and help people. All the important choices have long term impact you are not usually aware of, and people judge you for it. You can literally talk someone to death in this game. 
Play medic untill you feel like you have a good understanding of how the game works. Medics get the best guns, everyone loves them, and you make certs extra fast because you can kill enemies and revive allies.
Yeah, of course now we've got Mariota and Mett at QB, so if one of them gets hurt (god forbid) then we don't have to worry about being stuck with clipboard Jesus again
It's still funny that, like JR said, Punk is shitting all over pro wrestling and pro wrestling is the reason why he's in the UFC and the reason why anyone is going to want to watch him fight.
She had 625 range as a mage. What other mage has 625 AA range? That is more range than most ADC's. Dropping it down to 575 is **far** from a massive nerf. She outranged every mage by almost 100. That is a huge difference. Laning against her was a nightmare because she would hit you twice before you even hit her once.I think the AA nerf is warranted. Either drop her AA range to a reasonable value, or increase the range of every other ADC and mage who are at 550-575.
I tried to watch it but once they put you know who and you know who number two together as a couple, they lost me completely, they had literally no chemistry. So I just looked up the ending online. I wanted to like it though! I love sci-fi and people seem to be in love with it. 
&gt;At no point have I mentioned Walter Scott in my argument, only Gray and Garner.Okay but Walter Scott ... existed right? You agree that was a thing that happened? you can't go "I'm choosing specific cases involving criminals and I'm using that to represent the climate in the US, and I refuse to acknowledge cases when they're not criminals!"
I know at least one person who sincerely holds this belief. He's an old fart who works with me. Two coworkers were speaking spanish to each other and the old fart turns to me and says "Don't they know they're in the US? I thought we spoke english here." Me: "Well, they are from Puerto Rico.." "Right, not from the US. Like I said."sigh.
IMO if Wildstar goes f2p, CREDD should be redeemable for the equivalent value in cash shop credits. If there's a premum subscription, maybe make ti for that.
Chip Better win. Period. Expect nothing less then a deep playoff trip. He made all these moves, not saying he was wrong for any of it. However, I don't agree with it. WIN.
I like the idea, but the problem is defining the skylance. Is it AI or player operated? Does it shoot down drop pods, galaxies or all air vehicles? Can it attack ground targets? How does firing work? Et. and etc.
The 20th of April is marijuana day, Hitler's birthday, and my dad's birthday. Somehow I've got to come up with a way to combine them all, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.
Thank you for this,  I understand the theory more after reading your comment.  I mean to honestly think that  Shepard wouldn't even be slightly effected after spending more time around Reaper tech than anyone and he was even effected by a single Ardat Yakshi, even though it was only distorting his perception and not his thought process, is kind of crazy.  I don't know,  it would have been interesting.Edit: fixed a few grammatical errors.
mind if I hijack this thread to ask a question? I remember watching a justice league-esk show where they were all young, it wasn't young justice, one of the characters was this green alien/robot guy with stretchy limbs who was super super smart and tech happy. In this I also remember a superman without the cape and pretty badass looking but for the sake of me cannot remember what this show was called. Any ideas?
Why? Obviously they are not giving up on RG3, why not get some people to protect him so he can work on his pocket presence. I could see this working out. 
&gt;there is a law passed that we get equal pay.”&gt;“Except we don’t,” Ms. Viera said. “We don’t. We don’t. We don’t. We don’t.” Someone feels like they aren't being paid enough/equally and there's a law against that.  Do you:a)  fight it in courtb)  bargain for a pay raise in private (possibly leveraging a if you feel like you aren't being paid as much)c)  find a job where you you are being paid what you feel like you are worth d)  summon an army of other people to "save you from your oppression". And yeah,  a)  isn't cut and clear easy.  Lawsuits aren't cheap and companies are well equipped in that front. c)  isn't always realistic either. At least a-c are attempts at active solutions. d)  doesn't even get you a raise, anyway.  Just some 15 minutes of fame (because Internet) unless your case really sells in the news.  
Oh my gosh, this would be very "Us."  I wonder if we could somehow start at opposite ends and meet in the middle to high five each other?  Thank you so much for this idea!
How does Jenn fit into that story?   She lawyers up and creates this completely mythical story accusing her best friend of committing a  felony.. why, exactly?  And I'm not sure how the cops supposed to know that Adnan has no alibi for the 7pm Leakin Park pings?   Anyone at the mosque could have seen him, and the cops definitely hadn't talked to that many people at the mosque yet.
I think a great many of Eagles fans are Ducks fans and have a natural affinity for Marcus. With that said, I think the sadness is due to us hoping that he would land in a situation in which he could thrive. They and myself included don't know if the Titans can be that team, with the many holes you guys have.Anyway I hope the best for Marcus and Titans.
I wanted to use the word lacuna, but figured you wouldn't know what it meant, but the action being described is how you describe is what your sentence sounded like. If it's a grammatical mistake, or done for convince I'm happy to ignore it, but when someone miss uses grammar to the point that reading aloud what they've written makes them sound like they have a brain disease I like to give them a heads up.   Lets both down vote each other! 
So am I, but this was the point of the Bradford trade. If the price for Mariota was too steep, Kelly would still have a QB he trusts to run his offense. 
The goal is for people to go there, look at people with comparable credit scores and other variables and say "Ya... I could get that card."It would also eliminate new churner from asking: "I have a score of 604 and want to know if I can apply for the Amex Centurion card." 
I know.What I'm saying is that, in the eyes of the "community", these churches *are* doing charity by circlejerking about Jesus every Sunday.From a PR perspective, they're doing everything right according to the demographic they're trying to appeal to.
We usually make it through 5 or 6 encounters in as many hours.  Sometimes I get surprised and encounters wrap up faster than I think.  All-in-all we typically complete about half of what I think we should.
Either League of Legends or Diablo 3. I really don't know x_x I want to start drinking more green tea, I love that stuff. But we don't have any in the house =(
Look at the leaves on this [tree](http://www.davey.com/media/1001/home-tree.png?width=960&amp;height=520&amp;quality=80&amp;mode=crop) 99% of the area where the leaves are is air. But because the leaves are squiggle wiggly and all over the place you can't see all the way through. The 10% of your brain works is like the leaves. There's no angle through your brain where you won't hit at least part of it.^^^I'm ^^^new ^^^here, ^^^are ^^^we ^^^supposed ^^^to ^^^give ^^^shitty ^^^science ^^^answers ^^^or ^^^treat ^^^it ^^^like ^^^a ^^^real ^^^question?
Noticed this same thing in GTAV. My GPU temps hit like ~70C* which was completely fine but as soon as my CPU temp (stock fan) hit the 70s I notice FPS dropping down to 45~ from 60 in areas that don't usually do that. My temporary solution is my big external fan, noisy as hell, but keeps both GPU and CPU temps below 65C* so I'm happy with that.
Dexter did really well, while having Nien/Seraph top &amp; Link mid, he deserves more credit than you'd think.Meteos was surely as good as him, but he had a way better team, shotcalling &amp; even org overall.
Probably a pretty fair comparison.  For whatever it's worth (considering that I've consumed a substantial quantity of lovely North Carolina People's Porter and may be more idealistic than normal), I think that the term "ape" will come to encompass humanity along with the rest of hominoidea within this century.  Paraphyletic categorization is really historical in nature.  It's probably not going to survive an era when we have a decent understanding of evolutionary theory (except in a handful of cases, where it describes all organisms with a certain characteristic and excludes a genuine but important minority, like gymnosperms excluding angiosperms).
Wow, that is very close! You're a super sleuth.The girl on the show tweeted back at me and said it was LORAC. I still can't find it, even looking at old holiday and other LE palettes :/
I'm perfectly fine with how they look. Although, someone said that Yooka should have a Hawaiian shirt. Sounded awesome until I found out that Yooka is female. :/
Your counselor's a dick, but I'm impressed he even mentioned trade school. In my area, the schools act like everyone is going to get their doctorate, leaving kids who'd be better off in vocational programs out in the rain.
Eh. I'll probably get down voted to hell for this, but there is no actual proof of MACRO-EVOLUTION. Obviously adaptations and micro-evolution and a scientific fact. But there is no definitive proof that macro evolution has ever happened.
a lot of people said he was the best rookie QB last year, with Cooper that offense got a lot better.  Carr could take that step, the potential is definitely there.
Separating a 30-lb. glob of necks all frozen to each other hurts my hands, but someone has to do it. The last time I did it, I had to put the bin in the bathtub. 
You have a point but it only applies to some places. For example, Japan and Russia are losing population and they need to reproduce more to survive. India, China, and pretty much all of Africa needs to breed more responsibility though. 
Chinese railroad workers were essentially slaves. They had limited marriage rights, could not move of their own accord, and were considered subhuman at the time.80 years ago we locked up all the Japanese people in the country. While they were locked up, their property was destroyed by their neighbors, and they faced severe discrimination following WWII. Many of them had no home to go to at all after the war.
&gt; In Terminator 2, they explicitly mention that Arnold's flesh is organic. Just caught this on cable like a month ago. Devils advocate time:Yes, I remember that, but organic does not mean 'human aging', it just means alive. Surely if these futuristic humans can create T1000 liquid human robots and time travelers, they probably had no problem creating skin that does not suffer aging defects at the rate Arnold himself is aging lol :PThere's plenty of examples of living creatures that have the ability to renew themselves (see [Turritopsis dohrnii] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii), and I have no doubt skynet or similar science in the future figured that one out. This is of course pointless speculation over pointless speculation, but i say POTATO!
That's all fine and honestly, I didn't have a problem really with the comment when it came out. It was a tense negotiation and at some point people are gonna say some pretty fucked up stuff. If you sit on that comment for a minute though and then go, man they are saying this shit in the middle of a recession with unemployment at some batshit crazy numbers? Kind of distasteful. Power imbalance between worker and boss is universal, and it's pretty obvious that as employees, they're pretty fuckin pampered and any exploitation is a small price to pay for the kind of money they're making. I have way less of a problem of essentially unemployed student athletes saying whatever they want about how they are treated, it's at least coming from a small place of truth while still doing a disservice to people who actually suffer like prisoners, children forced into labor, sex trafficked people, and the other myriad of actually oppressed people the world over.

I have amano shrimp, yellow cherry shrimp, ottos, pigmy corys cats, and a boatload of endler and endler male hybrids. I used to keep my Betta in there but the current was too strong when I added another fluval fx6.
Protip: breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth.In winter, you can reverse this. While wearing a scarf, breathe in through your mouth so your scarf doesn't get wet with condensation, then breathe out through your nose to keep it warm.
I'm still riding my bike into my third trimester, and I'm starting to get comments and some negative feedback. People in my circle are mostly supportive, and I'm surrounded by people who've done the same thing, so it's been pretty minor so far. 
Your rabbit is in gastrointestinal stasis.  This is a serious and life-threatening condition.  If you do not have Metacam (for pain) and regllin (for motility), at least go out and get baby gas relief from your pharmacy and give 1ml orally. Further, you gotta get your rabbit to the vet AS SOON AS THEY OPEN.  If there is an animal hospital near you that is open, go NOW.  Further, if your rabbit will let you pick her up, gently rub her belly.  THIS IS A LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION!!  YOU NEED TO CALL YOUR VET'S EMERGENCY NUMBER NOW!!  They can help you more than we can.  I hope she is okay and makes it until the vet is open in the morning.
Casual viewers. People who don't watch runs regularly.And again, sure, you can dislike it, I know I do, but I doubt they're making changes just to piss people off, they're making them to increase the bottom line, and no amount of complaining will change that.
OMG, that's priceless! You know what would be better?  Dressing in a yellow Chuck E suit and lure some kids into a backroom. Okay?  And then you stab them.  BRILLIANT IDEA AMIRITE?!
Thats good to hear. Thanks. All the RF work I've done has been stationary. And cus i know I'm always using different frequencies in different venues i was worried about traveling on 1ch. Just want to know what i'm getting myself into.    
Mihawk is an exception. Apparently his special has the same "Name" for both his unevolved and his evolved version, so you won't lose your special levels after you evolve him. Same goes for any character who's special has the same name before/after evolution.also, even after you max a character, you can still feed him things like skill books for potential skill boost but obviously since he's maxed, he won't gain any more experience.
Not trying to say it was "cool". I'm saying it was a normal thing. People had sex with each other while their kids/family were in the room cause there was literally no where else to do it. Just because we have built up a social stigma about something doesn't make it "gross" or "trashy". That is 100% social conditioning.
That only works if you have a DM that lets it by not using ability scores for things. Otherwise your brilliant plan will work all the way up to the point the DM says "allright, roll for it."
I would have addressed this (I'm guessing) a year ago when the law was signed but under its waiting period, or sooner once I had noticed the state/city government debating this issue. Either way an "oh shit" or "we got this plan" would be formed. I probably would raise my wages prior to the law passing, at the time where it was most beneficial to me (aka not the month the fridge needed to be replaced).My cheese is made by less than 10 businesses worldwide, so I am currently working off of a 3 year contract, it is more expensive but stable, so luckily no movement there, flour is my largest fluctuating food cost, and I've raised prices with extreme moderation a few times. 
For real. I got the last 7 picks right last year (minus the trade but I still had Watkins at 4) but those were all pretty predictable. I didn't make a mock draft this year but I'm glad I didn't because it would have been shit.
Move in tangents relative to the asteroid. It's less of an orbit and more of a series of straight line flybys. The second -- which I am dead serious about, btw -- is to nudge the asteroid off center to induce a rotation. Your craft stays in place, the asteroid rotates.
Maybe, with one more comma:&gt; I'm going to fuck you, grandma, unless you get out of here.The first time I read that I though he meant&gt; I'm going to fuck you**R** grandma, get out of here.
*"Good. Moderation team is doing job. And yes, Calliope was very good idea. Stupid capitalist piggy-dogs want to buy overpriced sherman tank with PVC pipe on top. To be honest, I do not know why community so sad about. They say it is over powered.* ***PSHHHH***, *it is still not as powerful as strong BT-100. $50, is good price and people just do not know*"
There are some other leagues that do it, but most are more reluctant and sparing. The MLS DisCo tends to give about one suspension on review a week; some weeks don't have any, chippy weeks might have several.
Ha, ha! I should elaborate. At the place I was at a good junk of the kids were somewhere in the evaluation process and they weren't really punished. We calmed them down (feel validating mostly), tried to brainstorm good ideas for next time and sent them on their way. The closest we ever got to punishment was removing them from situations that were clearly overwhelming for them.I was trying to illustrate that kids have a wide variety of things that can make them act out and ways to act out. Some of the kids did straight up have a pattern of  misbehaving, those were just the ones I pulled probably because they were the ones we monitored the closest. Still, I get what you're saying not the best examples for this.
Alright.  You just keep being awesome.My problem isn't that you're trying to help.  I don't disagree with your intent.It's your **tact** that could be **much** improved
That's actually a strategy a high school coach in California has been using. It exploits some loophole in the eligible receiver rule, only 5 guys can catch the ball but the defense never knows which 5. He also does an onside kick after every TD. Apparently it works pretty well. Probably would get destroyed in the NFL.
If Pacquiao goes aggressive like he did with Marquez in the last fight before he was hit with that 1 in a million shot, he will win. I really think he might have been sandbagging during his latest fight with Algieri to bait Floyd into finally accepting a deal. However, if he wasn't then he may have a hard time.
This particular incident was in /r/toronto.  Somebody was complaining about noisy neighbours who are Roma.  Then the deluge of "OMG ROMA" shit started.  Mostly from other European immigrants, which is pretty telling in it's own way.  The new thing in Canada is to be a racist jackass and then claim you're criticizing a culture, not a race. fml
&gt; asking for itIsn't that kind of the definition of an invitation? Here's what the mayor said:&gt; I always have encouraged women not to walk alone, to have someone with them at all times, because that in itself is **an invitation** for someone to take advantage of youSo yeah, he actually did say that women are asking for it by walking home alone at night.
once in a PF farm pty at the start I asked which the group wanted me to do , and I warned if I dodged she may be a bit off, but 1 person say try to dodge, so I do , party is stupid and gets hit and I get kicked from the group. I didn't even care I was kicked from the group coz obliviously it was full of idiots who can't read or adapt.   I need to put the blame on dps for things like this, no matter your role, know every mechanic and know how to adapt to it. Not knowing this is what causes wipes on the harder coil turns.
*She sighs softly* "that part of me...its still there" *she taps her head* "And I constantly worry I will let it win...that ill just be a monster" *she looks to tony a bit sadly* "but I know I wont...because of this place...I have people i love like damien, Jess, you...I wont let that side win because of that"
I have my first OB appointment tomorrow and up until this point I have been so excited and antsy... and now I am super duper anxious about it, and it's making me even more nauseous than normal and ugh. I'm just upset because with my daughter, the thought never even entered my mind that something could go wrong. From the minute I got the two pink lines I had a baby and nothing could change that. But I am absolutely petrified this time around. Why is that?! Why can't I just calm down and be happy? :(
My parents were always switching churches mostly newer ones. I liked traditional services with hour long sermons but they wanted to go to the hip newer churches that sang songs for 45 minutes with ten minute sermons that were a joke. I think that might have been the problem.
Mods need to ban OP. This is not a "she", it's an account that is used by PH. They know a post will be made about it here, so they are proactive about it and get more viewers while they're at it.
It's called a reverser, but it only ends up thrusting slightly backwards. It's mostly to dump any energy the engines might still be producing towards a vector that won't accelerate the craft anymore. Some engines allow backing up with thrust reverser, but not all.
Minor semantic: You can't cast Wrath of God with 3 Islands, 1 Plains and a Mountain. That's never affected a game of mine in 2 years of playing UWR, but it's not true that you can cast everything through Blood Moon.
I don't get it either, but I swear I can do 20 pushups in a row. My arms shake like crazy! Anyway a guy mentioned earlier that it was actualy 105 pounds considering the weight of the bar itself. As for the pullup, I can do 15 if I do 3x5 (with breaks), but cannot do ten in a row. I'll try to do 3x8 eventually but I haven't progressed in pullups for weeks.
&gt; BRO APPRENTICESHIP Getting a bit ahead of ourselves now eh breh? It was a bro internship to see if you had what it takes to enter the bro apprenticeship...
I love how after one day everyone knows exactly what needs to be changed in this game better than the devs who literally make their living building and balancing it. Not saying that you're being an ass with your suggestions or anything, but why not just play a few days and see how things settle. Every suggestion you're making is based on people who are only just beginning to play the game. Imagine if you played one game of chess and had to give feedback on how every piece moved.
I am so, so sorry. What an awful thing do have happen to you. I get the whole, "Technically we've never discussed being exclusive" but please don't let that be an excuse you use for her. People who are casually dating don't celebrate anniversaries. She knows what she is doing is unfair to you. Otherwise, she had an entire year to bring it up.Treat yourself gently. That really sucks. I'm sorry someone you love is hurting you like this.
I like all of my body :D It's weird because when each part is isolated, I can pick out aesthetic flaws that bother me, but as an entire working whole - my body fits together nicely and looks pretty good.
Dude... Trans women are actual women. And as actual women, they reserve every right to desire to have sex as the gender they identify with. It's seriously not that complicated. Unless you expect trans women to have a strong urge to put a dick in something? Because if that's the case, you're gravely mistaken. And asserting that trans women should simply be asexual then is denying the fact that humans are sexual creatures.Sexual intercourse is a large part of who we are. Using sex as an invalidator for transgenderism is insane.
Somebody can correct me if I'm wrong, but you might want to opt for a dedicated graphics card and 16GB of RAM. I've heard the Iris cards have gotten a lot better but I don't know if they're good enough on their own.
I stuck some chinese carbon tubulars on my fuji cross (same ones as yours) and they have held up really well to some pretty gnarly CX courses and thousands of miles on dirt...it really livened up the bike shedding that much weight. I still use the 327cxs a lot though for most road riding because they've been really solid and durable.
What is the most effective "no compromise" national progun organization?I know NAGR tries to claim that but am not sold on them. And the NRA has obviously gotten better in the last decade.
Little MacIn BoxUS packagingI want to win Little Mac for my older brother. He's never been able to even see a Little Mac in person so winning a Little Mac amiibo for me to give to him would mean a lot. Thanks!
[[Grand Architect]] + [[Pili-Pala]] = infinite manaKraj + Creature tapping for 2 mana + Pili-Pala. (Gyre Sage, Palladium Myr, Bloom Tender, Joraga Treespeaker)I think the best infinite combo Simic generals are either [[Momir Vig, Simic Visionary]], [[Kruphix, God of Horizons]], or [[Experiment Kraj]] (for activated ability combo). Zegana is also a draw engine, but is probably better in a combat-centric deck.
I agree with doing at least one of the shows but maintaining competition conditioning for even a few weeks is a huge strain on your body. This will be absolutely grueling if op plans to do both shows and with his non existent experience idk how smart that would be. Still op looks killer so kudos for whatever you do 
Do that store even know what layaway means?The layaway keeps the TV there!  That's why you have the layaway!You see, you know how to *take* the layaway, you just don't know how to *hold* the layaway. And that's really the most important part of the layaway: the holding. Anybody can just take them. 
I personally don't believe they are worth it and didn't have any in the Kickstarter I ran. Why?1) My lowest pledge was just 10$. If I had a 1$ or 5$ pledge level, my lowest wouldn't be "just" 10$, 10$ would be the second or third tier. Psychologically, it makes it feel heavier.2) People can (and did) pledge 1$ and 5$ without the tiers being there. Not everyone knows that this is possible, but many regular Kickstarter frequenters do and will pledge this just to get your updates.3) If you convert a 10th of the people who would have backed at 1$ into 10$ backers, then there isn't even a monetary loss. There's no way to measure this, but converting a 10th seems very likely to me.4) Most bigger Kickstarters get 50$ - 100$ in 1$ pledges. IMO even if some of the above points are true, it's worth it to gamble for 50$ - 100$ in pledges.5) I don't really know, that was just my logic and I think it worked out for me.Much love and good luck!
I haven't seen anyone mention this so far: bacteria reproduce extremely fast. Every cell that splits will have slightly different mutations than the parent cell. So when you add the two together, fast rate of reproduction + subtle genetic differences within each generation = a slight impact to genetic diversity. That isn't the main way bacteria can adapt so quickly, though. The main way they do it is through exchanging DNA with each other (conjugation), picking up DNA from the environment (transformation), and even acquiring new genes when they get infected with viruses (transduction). All of this is important because any given environment can host a huge variety of microbes and genetic exchange can take place across species. So while we only take in DNA from mom and dad, these little guys can potentially assimilate genes from other very different bacteria. I hope this helps! If not, inbox me. 
If it's her versus one of the current Republican candidates, well, I'll have to take solace in living in a state that consistently goes one way. She's a politician with a capital "P" - don't need her, don't want her.
I met you at the Q and A type thing at the start of the year with past graduates, we arrived at the same time and you answered the question I had had for a while of what Powershop had to do with web development
This. Pearl and Violet are both lacking in the versatility department when it comes to the challenges for the most part. They both have solid moments of humor and acting, but for the most part they are look queens. I'm fine with having a look queen, but if we do it should be the best look queen of the bunch which is Violet so Pearl just kind of feels like dead weight right now.
He's been mocked to us for months, so it isn't a surprise. I emotionally wanted Williams because he is a Raiders fan, but I believe that there was no wrong choice between the two.
Welcome back! Don't forget your leafy greens, but I'm sure you know this.Also, don't punish yourself by forcing these horrific scenes into your head. /u/YourVeganFallacyIs linked [this article](http://veganfeministagitator.blogspot.ca/2014/05/the-trauma-of-knowing-cracked-vessel.html) in a comment yesterday. In sum, you don't need to bear witness to these tragedies to be a good vegan or activist- it'll drive you crazy or make you upset and no one should have to live in a constant state of self-imposed guilt trips. Not to discourage you from reading up on veganism and all that! Just make positive steps in the right direction and know you're doing a great thing :)
I haven't looked into it, so you could be right, but it seems unlikely that they would be able to bar you access to your house in that situation. Your house might be inside the area that they have deemed to be part of the event, but they can't stop you from going to your home or demand that you submit to a search for access to your own house.
&gt; Og du står ved grundforløbseksamen, grundforløbet som varer 20 uger - som regel.Yes. Men grundforløbet på EUX vare et år. Der er skiftesvis EUX og EL perioder, normalt ugevis. Men der har været 3-ugers perioder.&gt;EUX.. Lægger den et år til?EUX vare lidt over fire og et halvt år.&gt;Hvornår starter din elevtid?August.&gt;Og jeg kender godt miljøet på teknisk skole - det er heller ikke altid et, jeg har følt mig hjemme i. Folk er nu som regel alligevel altid gode nok, omend bare nogle gange bare fra en lidt anden omgangskreds en en selv.Sandt nok. Det er heller ikke fordi jeg har noget imod dem personligt, det er fordi at de ingen respekt udviser for at der også er andre tilstede. F.eks. Har de spillet baseball midt i klasselokalet og ramt min bærbar.
&gt; I told her this would be a long road to total forgiveness, if it came at all.How can you say that you don't know if you're ever gonna trust a bitch again, yet you're still gonna marry her? Tragic. Just absolutely tragic the kind of hamstering that goes on in that sub.
I think Bob is the best reviewer I've seen, but I watch views for analysis, so I'm not the intended audience. I should take a look at his non-review videos, though.
Oh, I agree.  But the best strategy isn't always the most successful when dealing with PUG/PF/DF/Farm groups.  The most successful strategies usually always put more responsibility onto the tanks/healers, and just lets the DPS tunnel vision the boss.  (e.g. Ifrit EX, Ramuh EX, Shiva EX, Steps of Faith, T6 &amp; T8, etc.)
That I do. It's the next thing on my upgrade list, I've just been waiting to snag one. The G3258 came as a combo with quite a few other parts I bought from a coworker a while back, and I just haven't had enough money saved up for a processor since. I'd like to kinda save up for something like an i5 hopefully, but I'm getting there :D. 
The French gov. Only concern is weapons sales to the Oil Kingdoms. Just because they have history in Lebanon dosnt mean they have the competence or ability to make the right moves in the region. Seriously colonialism is over, and colonial powers need not interfere in the region just to seem more relevant in wprld affairs. Most recently the French supported the Yemen campaign, just to get on the Saudis good side. The French are motivated only for financial benefits.The solution will come from Lebanon itself. Westerners need to focus on their own country before they decide to save us.
I second 40_Shades_of_Ray.Your progress on you lifts is nowhere near what it could be if you were lifting more effectively.  Way to much volume for where you are at.  You can do a lot on three days per week for one hour in thr gym.  Go to a 3x5 or 5x5 program and add weight to the bar every workout until you can't.  Then back off and do it again, and again.  
I think this would be really nice for getting more variety into the links showing up on here. Stuff like Electric Wizard, Sleep, and so on are far too common on here, given how well known they already are. I love the shit out of many of those sorts of bands, but them being posted so often seems fruitless.
Would it be possible for them to reveal all the traps during the raid after it starts?  i have never seen the sandbox client so I am unfamiliar with the interface.  However I once the server does send your client the trap information I suspect it would be possible to graphically reveal the traps to the player live during the raid.
I imagine its even more infuriating. You know how its a grad school in the US? Its not here, I got in purely on my grades. Applied on the web, it took my grades from central database, got a spot - 12 semesters of medicine and then im done. No hoops to jump through first, no silly degrees to get before applying. 
What is it about getting sick recently?! I had a stomach bug where I barely was able to work. At the same time my coworker that had to clock off half way in a shift because he could barely breath (asthmatic so it's worse). Now I have a really sore throat. On my WEEKEND!It's offical.The gc has a pandemic and we will all die.
I wasn't talking about this one exactly, just in general. Tech demos vs final product are never anywhere near close.   Take for instance, the Battlefront 3 "in engine" video.  Yes, its in engine..... but will the game look anything like that? No way.
&gt;Telecom operators are attempting to carve out the internet into islands in violation of the net neutrality principle, say Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Lok Sabha MP and CPI (M) member M B Rajesh, and Rishab Bailey of the Society for Knowledge Commons.&gt;Speaking at a press conference in the capital on Wednesday, they said that the argument had not been pitched as one about telcos' viability which doesn't stand as their revenue through data has increased manifold over the years.&gt;"Telecom network is not the internet. They provide access network and connect consumers to the internet. We need to differentiate the internet from access networks. These networks are using pricing and access to carve the internet into winners and losers. This will cable-ise the internet," said Chandrasekhar, referring to how DTH services offer individual channels.Am i dreaming??!?
Small note on that, if you come across a mod called SEM Skyrim Encumbrance Mod, Cobb Encumbrance is actually an updated and more efficient version of that so its now redundant. I also love Cobb Encumbrance though and couldnt recommend it highly enough.
Wow, I was really expecting Leonard Williams to be top 5, but as far as dire needs go, these teams have been drafting excellently thus far.I'm just really shocked that Leonard Williams isn't a top 5 pick. 
Nothing you can do. All you can do is get your money in good when your a favorite. Doesn't mean your gonna win every time when you are. Just keep making good +ev decisions and you'll show profit in the long run. 
I don't see people post a character's worst feats very often. I'm not sure that would help my issue either. That's just cherry picking from the other extreme. At that point the argument for/against a character becomes a discussion about what is within the realm of possibility for a character. The limits of possibility are established by (sometimes) single instances/outliers.I don't want to know what *could* happen in a fight. I want to know what *would* happen. I like certain characters a lot, but I don't unequivocally support them.  I have no problem explaining why I think a character I like loses if that's my opinion. I don't care about who wins or loses. I just want to learn about characters. Sometimes I think the version presented in fights isn't accurate.Maybe my problem is I'm trying to be objective about a subjective subject. There's not really an objective version of a character 
lol, I know seriously.  I think I ran out of rejection punch holes on my card for Scary Mommy ;) It just never worked for that site...maybe one day though!
I don't remember now but the meta was enormously different when triforce was bad, as well as some patch changes believe. I don't know where the video is now but Monte talked about how everyone took double's words out of context and was actually correct at the time.
MLG Indian matrix! My phone is being gay so I can't link but its on youtube, also the Abraham Lincoln skit from whitest kids you know, and the fact that in Monty python (I can't remember which one right now) every is trotting like horses while the peasants clap coconuts together to make a trotting sound.

All of the large/medium chains will probably be on in October. The smaller ones don't seem to be moving much and those might be a while. (Though with the Square EMV reader finally shipping things might improve there too.)
You sure it wasn't placebo? I've vaped etizolam in a PG solution off tinfoil and the high was weak as fuck and lasted 5 minutes. Not even sure if there was high or if I just really like smoking things off tinfoil. 
I think It doesn't fly with people because they had built DPR into some mythical computer super genius they figured he must have been or had skin in the game and couldn't admit they might have missed something or a change could have occurred (the security consultant who helped him). The real deal is that he taught himself just enough PHP to get things going and then corrected many mistakes over time, he was flying by the seat of his pants on the tech side.The more I read about his story and the history of the site, the more plausible the FBI's official story actually sounds. A few lines gone wrong in an apache config and a client supplying an unexpected or blank "Host:" header might cause exactly what they describe seeing.

Free Trade has never been a well-intended effort nor have concerns over the economic threats it posed to most Americans and this nation been misguided.  This country's trade history has proven as much.None of the economic or fiscal policy positions that came out of the Reagan era, particularly Free Trade, were ever good for this country or its people.  Anyone with a modicum of knowledge regarding Conservative economic and fiscal policy history and preferences in this country could have called that trade policy trainwreck from a distance.&gt;I'm curious where he's drawing the common thread and how does he differ?Answer:  This country's economic/trade history.  Free Trade is hardly a new concept.  The consequences created by major trade imbalances are well known even though many people in the economic community have ignored that history in staking their current positions on it in the U.S.
Good work for a first sitting. I enjoyed the exchange between Agehith and Raven, although the ending confused me a bit. The mentioning of "our son" brought me out of the story to ponder who Raven was talking to - the random reader or her husband/lover? Was this a journal or was she writing letters to someone?
Have not seen the Simpsons in a very long time. Several years I would say, I always worked Sunday nights so I haven't been able to watch the Simpsons or any TV show.
This loser jumped a woman half his size, he had a knife, and he still couldn't kill her. It tells you what the BCND crowd is like when they're not at their keyboards. 
I play a lot of metal and that snare just had the sound I need for what I play. Also, it was designed by my favorite drummer whose sound I strive after. I just can't afford it 
You nailed it. Just looking at him is unsettling. It's a weird feeling. He is repulsive in a very specific way. Not in the sense that he's horribly unattractive or anything. There's something about his whole vibe that is repulsive. No wonder he has the philosophies he does. Seeing him IRL and not hiding behind his computer makes him look so damn pathetic. 
You're approaching this too much like a formula. Human relationships are much more complex than that. You two become friends when it "feels" right, and there's no better answer than that. If you think it feels like you two are friends or there is friendship potential, and she clearly feels oppositely, then there is a major disconnect. Why is that? In this situation, I think you are misreading her and exercising poor social judgment, though there are other possibilities.
Damn, I didn't even know that you could buy those bags for bandit crests... with their current TP price, thats about 3g for 1000 bandit crests, actually a pretty worthy alternative to keys IMO (if you do not plan to farm SW chests for hours....) :P
Good to see the same exact DEA talking points get copy-pasta'ed verbatim, even years later. Nice job ignoring the corrupt agents handling the case, too, just like they did. 
I'll keep in mind that material is important. It's just I can easily identify things like a Mya because their name is engraved on their pipes and they are usually always shiny chrome looking. Regals are obviously always wood. And Elmas have a male bowl. But what about All the other brands? What sets them apart from everyone else. I constantly see pipes on Craigslist that don't look like a standard cheap Chinese pipe, but I have no idea what they are.

I've been missing step #8. I usually let the toilet paper sit in water for a little bit (with vinegar) and then lay it out to dry. Quit being so wasteful.
where are you shopping? My supermarket has a bakery built right in it, most of the ones I have gone to the past few years have that. For the record I have had your bread it is pretty good.

Hmm, I'll have to look into how the other countries do it. As they also do things the US won't do in terms of free speech, like make it illegal to display a swastika.

Metallic and high-pitched makes me think of [Blue-gray Gnatcatcher](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Blue-gray_Gnatcatcher/sounds). Montreal is near the northern edge of their range, but eBird has some reports of them in the area within the last week. I don't know about the "tititi", but this seems like a possibility.
Thank you for that. It is interesting to hear that. I have had thoughts about it being my wishes shining through but co-insides with a couple of other things.1. on the same day our school church group grow from 4/6 (depending on how you look at it) to 141. of that 14 people I found out that someone I was friends with was actually Christian and he said that there were a lot more Christians at school that weren't willing to be public about it because "its not seen as cool" which I can see why.1. the Sunday before during our service for ANZAC day (Australian and NewZealand memorial for lives lost in WW1 ) One line stuck out "live/help others like it may be your last day" This hit home because for some reason I had been putting off starting this even though I had no reason not to.
Probably use water to fill up my kettle without moving much and fire to heat it, air so clear the leaves out my yard and earth bending to probably launch stones at people outside for shits n giggles. 
Fucking no one is Megatron except Megatron.  This dude is PRECISE in his route running, which is essential in the offense being ran with Carr.  He gets open, and is sure handed.  I think we just got a WR in the HOF with those same qualities?
I was at the 11:45 show, the visuals were indeed stunning. I'm generally not one for 3D, but especially in the "tech demo" reel they showed before the main feature it really popped (it was fun, but I hope that it's just temporary as it was really long and will get old quickly). The sound, however, was overwhelmingly loud at times. Maybe it was that the theater was only about half full (fewer bodies to absorb the sound?), or maybe they are still working to calibrate the system, but frequently when the breached whales splashed back into the water, the volume clipped into discomfort for me. I over heard several other patrons talking about that on the way out, so I know I'm not alone.I'll be at the 7:00 PM show of Avengers tomorrow, and I'm even more excited now that I've seen/heard the new gear in action.
Still on my Hop JuJu from Fat heads, this shit is strong. 9%ABV and 100 IBU, goes great with causal weed smoking. *Edit, and I do mean dandelions from my yard. Fantastic once dried with maple leaves. 
Totally this.Even I do not bring mats for more life powders, only have 3 and 2 Dust of Life, I always heal whenever I think someone might be in trouble.Either cornered by monster at half hp, pinned with low hp, or someone who has been knocked down to low hp.But more often then not i'll be the only one that is doing the healing or only 1 other person is. And when we run out.. the team gets no more healing support... This happens even in lvl 130+ GQ hunts... which in my eyes is pretty unacceptable.I even took the time to type "Please use lifepowder to save team mates" "Help ppl for more chance to win" when hunting with a new teambut I still get full teams that doesn't even pop 1 other than myself.
HAHAHAHAI like that he talks about MMO's when the MMO they are known for, EQ, is the least developed game in their lineup currently (EQNext being the farthest on the backburner).  Not to mention with the release of Georgeson and Storybricks (their main AI creator), EQN is pretty much dead to me at this point as is the company.

Your sister sounds extremely bitter and irrational. You should *not* feel obligated to give her money to "make up" for not babysitting her kids, and it is 100% her and her husband's fault if they are choosing to adopt children they can't provide for. You should stop giving her any money, and do not feel obligated to babysit them or take them on outings. They are not your kids, and it is completely acceptable and reasonable that you do not want to look after seven kids, *especially* seven special needs kids by yourself. Her problems are her own, not yours and honestly I would recommend you distancing yourself from her and her family for awhile until she realizes she is being an ungrateful bitch.
Well I honestly don't know if he was innocent or not, personally I don't feel police should be killing people on such a regular basis though. On one hand we have a guy who is dead, and we have another who is a police officer. Lately more and more evidence has shown that police are often lying in their reports and killing people without what most would consider justification. I have a hard time taking the police's word in any situation where someone was killed by an officer, it's not so much the Brown vs Willson situation its a societal issue that I see which makes me less likely to trust their word. The point is that I don't know and neither do *you*.
Dude, this has nothing to do with where you are from. Tipping is a part of every information about local customs and that is basically the first thing anyone who travels abroad has to look up. There are plenty of differences in European tipping rules as well and tips of 10-15% are expected in a number of European countries. That excuse doesn't work. I can't believe this is somehow news to so many people and that they defend their rudeness so vehemently. They behaved like assholes because they couldn't be bothered to spend 5 minutes to do the absolute minimum of research into the culture of the country they were visiting.
&gt;  since I wished I could have worn that. Now that's a question I'd like more insight on x3 Do teachers have a dress code? And is it different for women teachers than men?
Lol, it's fine, but I was referring to the PCR hearing she refused to participate in just a few years ago. The defense didn't present Asia because she refused to show up. When Sarah interviewed Adnan, he didn't mention that at all, or did he seem upset about it. 
I got to max rank on my GSM which was my first crafter I was levelling doing the dailies so it is entirely possible. This was also before they nerfed the Coerthas turn ins to make them easier. Look up some rotations and you'll be fine.

The Jets are about to pass on a DE that they have plenty of strength at, and Chicago's about to get Williams for fucking free.Edit: I have never been more happy to be wrong.  Eat a dick Bears!  RIP Tom Brady!
Yeah I hope so, but I am (kind of) friends with several of my professors and know they read them. One of my favorite ones was telling me before he knows exactly who wrote a terrible review on him, and how teachers can always tell what student said what.
Go-fastiness If you're actually asking, it means 10 cylinders arranged in a "V" layout with five cylinders on each side. Most cars designed for fuel economy have 4 cylinders (but laid out in an inline configuration, since the space works out better that way.) 
I agree it seemed harsh, the truth is that he's probably quite replaceable -- I don't see how hard it is to think of clever fun tweets about basketball without sounding creepy or using language that has some history of causing controversy. And I seem to have had the opposite experience from you - most of the outspoken opinions I've seen are from people who are indignant that he got fired, and think it's an intellectual and bold statement to complain about how overly sensitive our society is.
You know, every time an OP like this gets posted the inevitable "YOU KNOW YOU CAN JUST SAY NOT INTERESTED RIGHT?!??!" post gets upvoted to the top. Yet at the exact same time, we have [this post](http://i.imgur.com/rzvtOYK.png) on the front page of this sub.  I'm not going to spend time explaining to someone why me not responding after 47 "whats up"'s means I'm not interested if they're just going to get mad either way.
My favorite car trip was going dow Lake Shore Drive in chi-town in a early 70's cadillac  with the doors "riders on the storm" blasting. I was a passenger of coarse 2 hits of late 80's cid.
EYYY just got my test kit today from amazon and used it as soon as I opened it. I was wondering why is was glass, but if plastic degrades it I'd say stick with glass unless you guys are able to find a squeezable container that doesn't degrade the reagents. Or a better dropper lid so the glass isn't as much of an issue (if it's an issue) I could see it being an issue when there isn't much reagent left 
It isn't, when I found out I started wiping sitting down, standing up makes it more difficult and your butt cheeks aren't as separated, which means it's messier.
Oh yeah that was my cousin on my account. My minecraft account is actually my cousins, but he rarely plays, so I'm pretty much on it all the time. He thought Arthur's house was mine, then burned it down to "troll" me. It got me banned again...
Oh wow never knew that.. I'm gonna try and make that show.. Sodom is playing at death fest in Maryland I want to go to that so bad but it's not happening 
What I do to avoid any disappoint, is I forget about any possibilities. Once your mind is clear of hopes, you can never be let down, and every episode is the most wonderful thing you've ever seen.
I have seen Nutella here, but it's mostly in European supermarkets or major supermarkets that carry imported stuff. It does seem to pop up at Wal-Mart as well. One good thing about American produce compared to Asia was that in America it's possible to get anything year-round. In Asia if it wasn't in season it was hard to find and prohibitively expensive. On the other hand, the produce that was in season was very cheap, and there were markets selling fresh produce every few blocks it seemed. In America there are major urban areas where there are only convenience stores and no fresh fruits or vegetables available for miles.

Gallinari, Mozgov, and chandler will start for a lot of teams. Don't give a fuck about what you think about them. You got fleeced. All that for 1 man that was already signing in NY. yea genius move by Dolan lmao. &gt;If you honestly believe the 11th overall pick is an especially big deal when you're getting Carmelo Anthony out of itit's the 11th pick in a deep draft plus 4 players. You got fleeced, no way around it. Most knicks fans agree that the trade for melo was horrible, it's just the delusional ones that think it was worth it just to get swept that year with just Melo and amare and no supporting cast. The only terrible contract masai gave out was the Mcgee one. How many awful contracts have the knicks given? Are you also forgetting you gave us 3 draft picks for Bargnani lol. Fuck outta here. I don't even know why I wrote all this to one of the biggest retards on here.
[Um, no](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horus#cite_note-5)&gt;Pyramid texts ca. 2400–2300 BC describe the nature of the Pharaoh in different characters as both Horus and Osiris.
I have a sleeping disorder that makes just about all my sleep REM sleep, because of this, I always wake up from dreams. Given that I also have multiple dreams recalled a night, I have thousands of dreams that are in my memory, which leads to a lot of times where I question my past, because I am not sure if it was a dream or reality.It can definitely get surreal.
Yesterday on the metro two guys next to me were conversing loudly about how whites are literally the devil incarnate and brought cockroaches to the inner cities to plague minorities. I shit you not.
It would be cheaper to buy a pup in your own area, shipping isn't cheap ( usually 250-300). Feel free to message me if you're seriously interested. We travel often and might be coming near your location, you just never know. 
Even if Rutgers wanted to that would not be possible. That's more of a national issue. You should contact your local senator to try to fix textbook prices. They are the same all over the country.
I'm having a hard time browsing anime-related content right now. I've heard about how sad this anime is and I really don't want to get spoiled for it, so I think I might just pull a hiatus on the weekend..
scid vs pc is a more recent fork of scid that incorporates some new features. I open a db of my fics games before connecting and then the games are automatically saved to it. Another reason I use scid vs pc to play on fics is that I can easily switch on stockfish after a game and analyze it before playing the next game. It quick/easy to turn it back off before playing another game.My only gripe is the seek graph. The seek info is obscured by the computer accounts at the top of the graph.
extreme radiation poisoning. your DNA is being degraded by subatomic particles. while some radiation is natural, the amounts requires to kill you are invariably the result of some work of mankind. Vomiting, abdomen pain, headaches, dizziness, dead.
Still he has point here. No software will be supported forever, mods whether free or not will go the same route. Usually what is done is author makes final stable version and call it's done.I think it'd be same with mods. As long it would be popular and profitable for author it would be supported and issues would be fixed. When it would cease it would get final version and be abandoned, just like any software is.
Noone really cares that much though. I make a point to call it ***London***derry with huge emphasis on the London, around my Catholic friends because it's such a joke now. I've been lucky enough to avoid people who actually care for the most part.
One reason NMoms are more frequent here is that the legal system tended to assign custody to the Mom until quite recently and even still does in some regions.  So sometimes the NMom is with an EDad and other times children were left with NMom when Dad couldn't deal anymore.  Some of these dads stayed involved, some dropped out of their childrens' lives.  (Sometimes children later discover what NMom told them about their Dad was untrue: what he was like, why he left, his interest in being in their lives-- all subject to revision by N.)I do see accounts of NDads in here.  However, children of abusive and alcoholic dads may not identify with the N label.  Children with abusive dads and children of alcoholics/ drug addicts already have recognized "identifying" categories and treatment programs. 
Cake day bros. Anyways, my suggestion would be a loan. That height could make a huge difference but I brought up a 90-94 potential, 6'3 GK that started out at 74 and he hasn't budged in his rating in almost 2 years, still 74. I played him exclusively for half a season but he made a habit of letting in goals at the worst times. Meanwhile, I bring in Leno in January who increases by 4 in less time. 
Most of my group's unexpected discussions usually lead into in-fighting and potential killing of each other's PCs.Needless to say we have some pretty...volatile players in my groups.
Sorry, I though you were continuing BlackAnalBanana's train of thought on this particular kind of art vs old masters. I definitely think that there are wonderful fine artists around today. I wouldn't say they're "better" or "worse" than those in the past thoughAs a display of technical skill, perhaps, although even then it really isn't that extraordinary for an artist to learn to copy a photograph exactly. As art, not really imo. I highly doubt it was done without images but that would indeed be an impressive feat.
If they can produce recent receipts for all that work and the carbon is in good shape, that would be a great deal in Seattle. But CL and used bikes wary in value widely by geographic area so it's hard to say for Montana. But if there's nothing better then the seller has the upper hand. Supply, demand and all that.
It's exactly because it feels awesome for you. My biggest turn on is her loving what I'm doing. At least how it is for me. Also female nipples are a wondrous texture for the tongue.
Maybe you should have done some research first, before you post a useless link. Just saying that posting a dead link doesn't do anything, or prove that they're down for good. 
There is an alternate proficiency rule in the DMG that lets some classes become proficient in Dexterity checks if you don't want to do individual skill proficiencies.
I got Bigwig recently. It's good fun and a fairly solid DAW, considering its age.I'm still using Ableton as my main production environment. But Bigwig is fun to play around in! I expect to switch fully to Bigwig if Ableton Live 10 isn't announced soon.
It's hard to say. 12 is so new it's possible EWQL hasn't updated their website. Do they have forums? I would wait to hear from someone with firsthand experience with the engine on 12 first. 
Haha yeah I mean I can't exactly control it but I'm usually split pretty even in terms of whom I'm attracted to.  Not that I'm actually going to give up women, I just won't introduce them to my dad lol.

Well, she wouldn't be the mother if she adopted it out. Kid would probably have two parents, actually.And I just don't trust a kid that young to know what she wants to be, much less ready to go whole hog for "single mother." It's truly impressive that she did so well, and she must have had great parental and/or community support, but I still think it's tragic. Parents would shoo their sons away from her, and she wouldn't have the time to enjoy normal social development.  Who knows if she was working and gaining that valuable life experience. Though at least the kid would have been almost school age when she was looking for full time work.

"You're pretty for a black girl."Seriously? okay I'm sorry all black girls look like beasts and give you nightmares, because that is what you just implied.
Genius... Thank you SO much for clearing that up for me!!! Good luck getting the lovely folks at the Creature Shop to make you a mau5head! When you fail... Legacy is the one! That is all... 
Unfortunately it's not up to those asking for the power to be relinquished to relinquish it, very rarely will the powerful and authoritative figures wilfully cede their power. Hence why history is filled with violent revolutions. 
OK so I'm not crazy for getting angry when trying to drill into my wall and going "What the hell is this stuff, plastered over cement board?" because apparently... that's exactly what it is. 
Annnndddd I'm taking a year off to figure things out and because I couldn't keep up. Panic attacks started to feel like god damn heart attacks. ... Can't say he doesn't have some better qualities than me. Agh. 
It's really a shame. I've been using this website for years, and although many (mostly) viable alternatives have cropped up there definitely isn't one that can outright replace Grooveshark. I'll miss this website! I learned about some really obscure music here that I doubt I would have found out about otherwise.Hopefully they'll allow us to export our playlists and/or collection (just the track titles and artist names). It would be hard to remember all the songs I had saved on my account. Either way, I mainly hope this doesn't end up haunting the people who worked at the company. The music companies can be pretty ruthless when they want to be.If you want to send your love to Grooveshark, you can try their email: contact@grooveshark.com
Thank you I will give this a try. Very much appreciated. I tried to do the P2P thing, however on the installer there is only location for installation. I did try to alter the install file to no result. So I am hoping this patch may work. Thank you again for your time  though. 
Yes. You can trade players after you pick them. As an example, Eli Manning was selected 1st overall in 2004 and traded to the Giants who picked 4th for Philip Rivers and draft picks
Man, I thought this was the Eve subreddit, since there's a ship in that game called the Orca too. I opened this and it blew my mind, like "what update did I miss?! Cockpits?!"
This is the worst one I've read in the entire thread. I would have burnt down her fucking maison and probably killed or at least seriously maimed her neveu. You dangle a free trip to Paris in front of me and the snatch it away and I would fucking snap. 
Whoever we get just fucking go Ape shit excited like the entire fanbase actually wanted that the whole time and that we got a steal that the Eagles actually really wanted.
This episode is such bullshit. No Cristina no real goodbye to Derek and I'm assuming a Meredith pregnancy will be the cherry on top of this shitty sundae Shonda is trying to shove down our throats. 
Yeah, I know. I fucking hate it. You know what makes me stop doubting myself? Pot, but I had to give that up. It sucks that the thing that would help me is so close yet so far away.Cue someone telling me how pot does not help.
I guess what is fun for one isn't for everyone but this kind of restriction would drive me away in a heartbeat. It seems like someone would rather just ban stuff than become better players and deck builders.Also saying everyone gets to play their cards as they choose is kinda hipocritical considering the restrictions on activations on top of the bans. 
I don't just say it because of Dorian. I also say it because she got mad at me, a Dalish elf, for saying that the Exalted March on the Dales was perhaps less than good. But even in regards to Dorian if she has concerns she could have voiced them, rather than trying this under-handed ploy to get rid of him.

I'm sorry, but good luck with that.  You'll probably get another call center and no one will know who "Christopher" is.  I hate CSRs in conglomerations like this one.
if she was home and I recognized a number on the caller ID I could answer, but only after I was 13. If she was out of the house, I wasn't supposed to. 
Well sure.... This is probably EXACTLY what Dunleavy was expecting. He got under Giannis's skin and got him to do something stupid. You gotta be mature enough to stay out of that trap.
Giannis was served injustice, he needed a hero but there was none. He decide to take it into his own hands. The city of Milwaukee has the hero it needs, not the city it deserves. The Greek Freek first season now available on Netflix.
I only say this as a way to get people to shut up. Usually if they have something important they would have said it before i got annoyed with them. But seriously this is probably the biggest problem in society. Its great that you have strong beliefs, but to say that this is what i know and basically i don't want to know anything else is retarded (this term actually offensive to those with mental disabilities, yet can still have the capability to understand a new concept might enlighten them) you are basically saying i am this stupid and want to remain this way forever no matter what. Especially when their "original" view point is a somewhat new idea like the earth is not the center of the universe. 
In what context have you seen English not capitalized?  When referring to either the language or a person from England, the word should be capitalized.
Was there last year.  It's an amazing time.  You won't be able to get into the main event but you may be able to see some of the opening night events and some of the events on Saturday night.  Have dinner at the place in the resort and you will probably have a good chance at coming across Rocky Patel or Jonathan Drew or any of those guys.Also, if you have time, jog about 15 miles up the road to the Barley Creek brewing company.  Nice little brew pub with some great beers on tap.
That something that can easily sound like casual humor between teachers, and there would certainly be a whole bunch of investigating before just outright firing two teachers.
I don't think it's a bad pick. I meant it more as a comment on the Raiders love for the vertical passing game. By most accounts I've read, Cooper appears to be a better talent than any of last year's rookie receivers. They need to figure out what they have in Carr and in order to do that, he needs weapons. Good pick for the Raiders.
Being an assman at 16 is like being the Doogie Howser of ogling chicks.  Most guys are so stuck on boobs they don't appreciate a good ass until their mid to late 20s
Because zac doesn't just get a recolor, zac's particles also have to be changed to match his body and all the splashy things as well.  Also keep in mind that he doesn't have a solid color, he's several shades that have to be properly blended together.
Yeah. It's what is called *rain shadow*. The Cascades act as a 'barrier' that draw all the moisture from the air coming from the Pacific, so east of the mountain range is pretty dry. [Here, this explains it rather well](http://www.olympicrainshadow.com/images/rainshadow_diagram.jpg).
I haven't heard anything positive or negative about living with the athletes. I have met a bunch of them and they are generally nice people, so I can't imagine it would be a big deal either way. Community isn't too bad, they clean them every day and they are relatively big stalls, but suite bathrooms are nice- you just have to clean them more yourself and risk getting locked out by your suite mates. 
A default method in Java 8, IIRC, can refer to other methods in the interface, but in this case we have a reference to an object instance field.  The interface would have to have something like a `getBase()` method that returns the object that an implementation of the interface delegates to.  That would be rather weird to have in an interface—usually the point is to hide the base object from the caller!JDBC has a [`Wrapper`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Wrapper.html) interface that's meant to support the concept of having such wrapper classes, but its documentation reveals that you can't reliably write default method implementations with it—if you invoke `wrapper.unwrap(Connection.class)` you're just going to get `wrapper` back.
Once upon a time, EA withheld content from launch for Mass Effect and the public had outrage. Now they simply plan their DLC for after the launch which is almost as bad. Before EA owned DICE, DICE would release free DLC every few months for their games.

&gt; Why would you need respect?It's a way of earning it.  One of the most basic and primal ways, but an effective way nonetheless.  There are certainly better ways, but some ways only work on some people, so it is silly to ignore the most basic one.&gt; It's a display of sensitivity, insecurity, and lack of humility, not confidence.No, it's a display of not being a bitch, a display of standing up for yourself, and a display of not allowing others to walk all over you.
Im with you on the "I'd rather fly them back myself" part.What's cool to consider is moving ships that aren't able to move.  Think of all the dead Aurorae to collect when TEST gets done delivering freedom or what have you.
As an air tight test, I would agree with you. We could probably generate a better test that holds more value... but even so, I don't think that's enough of an argument to dismiss what the Bechdel test demonstrates.
She also does not have breasts the size of watermellons that bounce independently of each other. Plus, she doesn't look like one of their beloved anime waifus. That's a REAL woman, didn't you know?.
I went offline as it was late here, as I said above. You weren't updating me and always in trade so I Couldn't stick around Ill be available for trade for the next 3 hours however I may not be available immediately as I will have other trades to complete as well
I originally planned on cooking it for only two hours but I fell asleep after a long day.  This is my first steak cooked sous vide and it was amazing.  I'm going to try one at 127F soon.  I used a blow torch to create a nice crust.  
Interesting question. Learning painting I view very similarly to learning math actually. You just keep doing it and doing it until finally something clicks. I actually don't know a great way to explain it other than that. I started to sort of form my own tricks in the back of my head for example I'll think to myself (the section above a persons eye but below their brow usually forms this shape) and I don't really know what shape but I could draw it for you in an instant. Does that make sense?
I say yes it is worth it.  For my own setup, I rest my enlarger on an old computer table that rolls.  And I keep the chemical/paper on a small tv cabinet with wheels I got from Wal-Mart.  For the wet side, I just use the bath tub.  Image: http://imgur.com/z2jeIp9The tv cabinet is under the table, and the trays now go on the bath tub, more room to work with.
I know I am pretty convinced that he does, and a part of me hopes he does. And yes he did I think. Your last question is arguably the hardest and easiest question to answer. I would never admit this to anyone else but on reddit being anonymous it seems easy to say, Yes if there were no consequences for my family and my father did not try to take things further, I would probably let him know and since I already entertained the thought of a live performance for him countless times in my head I would even go as far as do that for him.But that reality doesn't exist.
They have been in drought for a while. That's the problem. Lack of water has compounded over years, leading to this drought being considered perhaps the worst in **1200 years**.  [Source](http://www.visualnews.com/2015/04/13/californias-worst-drought-in-history-the-breakdown/)And I'm not worried as much about the difficulties for the agricultural industry in terms of the farmers themselves as much as I am by the lack of supply of agricultural product. If we have significantly less produce and meat, then all food will cost significantly more. Since food is bought by everyone, this will cut into the budget of consumers countrywide, especially those on the lower end of the economic spectrum. I'm worried that families that are suddenly spending a huge portion of their budget will be too strapped for cash to buy anything else...
What is your argument to the contrary?Intrinsic perms moot almost any DA. Automation DA? Perm do the plan and ban automation. Outsourcing DA? Perm do the plan and subsidize insourcing. And so on.
Play tricks on people.For example I would go to my friends house and tell my clone to show up about 30 minutes later. Everyone's reaction upon seeing a second me enter the room would be priceless. 
So do you think if we showed those old shows and new shows to someone who has seen neither, they would be more likely to like the new ones? Because I think it has little to do with growing up with those that gave them a special place in my heart.The way you worded that makes it seem like you think its all nostalgia based.
Yeah. And I'm sure some philosopher in Greece said something similar; prior to that, probably some other dude or lady.  Resonance--that's a good word. Reverberation, too, since the process of interpreting this game is interactive by nature.
&gt; The wish for independence started in the first world warIt was pretty marginal then. It only started to become mainstream in the 1980s/1990s (not sure about the exact turning point, I'm not that home in Flemish Nationalism) with a peak in 2007 when the polls showed 20-25% of popular support for it.LDD isn't that Flamingant/anti-Belgian actually. They just want a lot of autonomy (they came up with the "confederalism" N-VA campaigned with) to execute their rightwing agenda ("With Belgium if it can, without Belgium if it must"). Spirit never was separatistic either.
Sit down somewhere comfortable. It doesn't have to be cross-legged or any of that other hippy mumbo jumbo, unless you believe in that stuff in which case I'm sorry for calling it mumbo jumbo.Just breathe in, hold it, and breathe out. The trick is to *not think about anything.* You're trying to just space out and ***BE.***If a thought enters your head just acknowledge it, brush it aside, and continue trying not to think. Thoughts will float in. Let them float away. Don't dwell on them or pay them any attention. Just let them flit in and out, like butterflies.Even flow.Now do that for 10 minutes a day.
If enough people wise up and start forming their OWN teams (a la cloud 9) instead of joining organizations that will replace them then they WILL make it.  But really Rito should step in here.
I would like to formally request some "June and Lychton = awesome execs" propaganda. I'm thinking along the lines of:* Morpheus and Trinity* Luke and Leia* Thrall and Sylvanas* Jean Luc and Janeway* General Hawk and ... hm, wow, GI Joe doesn't have a lot of female leaders, will get back to that one...Pls Propaganda Teams, GO!
Not to mention their pick was almost always mocked to the Giants a division rival.  Take what you need while also taking away what your rival wants?  Win-Win.

Bullying should be allowed for people you dislike? And I'm not sure why his face is "punchable". He's kinda hot. I'm guessing they know that and feel threatened.
ah yeah I suppose I'm thinking edgy is just a little bit funnier/weirder/different than the standard vanilla shit - putting in scores etc.I guess that tweet was too edgy? haha
Wouldn't it be the other way around?  I mean, you could measure the embrace of Bernie Sanders so then: "Rise of Bernie Sanders signals Democrats' embrace of progressive policies and ideas?" 
You question the motives of organic companies, but you give Monsanto a free pass?Sounds mighty unbiased of you.Organic food companies want to distinguish their products from GMO products. Monsanto doesn't.The ONLY logical reason for this is because GMO products are inferior in the marketplace.You know it. Monsanto knows it. Organic food companies know it.It's business, marketing, and economics 101.
Compared to Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Tony Romo, Andrew Luck, Russell Wilson, etc. There are so few of these types of quarterbacks, and they are completely necessary to win games consistently. 
Okay...the reason I ask is this: I can't know why you are an atheist, for all I know you COULD indeed just try to be edgy. Atheism isn't exclusive to individualistic, independant, critical sceptics, some people do indeed becomes atheists for rather unreasonable reasons. But, if you did indeed think things through, then there must be some things that have led you to disbelieve what your family seems to tell you. And then the best way would be to calmly and openly tell those problems you have with believing on faith to your family. Explain to them what made you arrive at the conclusions you have arrived at. Then there is no room to say it's just a rebellious knee-jerk reaction, they'll instead see and understand the actual reason(ing) behind, whether they agree with it or not. 
I answered already. To simplify: I'm leaning towards no, but I should look more into it before actually having an opinion, because it wouldn't be an informed opinion.
My husband had a farm cat named Hot Tub. His youngest sister was a toddler, and there had been a lot of talk in the family at the time of acquiring a hot tub. 
I hate rules like this! It's like telling athletes they can't take steroids until they're in the pros, or telling hunters they have to use registered, non-fully-automatic, rifles. It's killing the game to tell people they can't combo of and win on turn 3! Having to wait until turn 12 is just ludicrous. 
it does this for all themes. no matter which theme I install, be it from cydia or from self-installing from a .zip into ifile. and it's always the same icons that don't theme.

Oooooh yes. My boyfriend snores like freight train and I am the lightest sleeper. I don't have a lot of options so I usually end up on the couch for four/five hours and return to bed before he wakes up. Sometimes we switch off but he's a big dude (6'2 and built like a wide receiver) and doesn't fit on the narrow couch like I do. If I take NyQuil or Benadryl and fall asleep before him I have a CHANCE of sleeping through the night. We also sleep with me as the little spoon, which helps the "him snoring directly into my ear canal" issue. 
We do not know the guy. He could be on the proper side of morality with a massive amount of overly sensitive people calling him racist because they have no argument to stand on.
As one of the founders of /r/milionairemakers, I remember how that started... This one seems like somebody saw the sub and thought it was a easy way to make them famous...
Probably. I know the Yosemite beta was limited to the first 1,000,000 signups. I signed up despite owning a Mac to test it on my grandma's iMac while I was staying there. Got in, then signed up for the iOS beta when it was initially announced. Got in almost immediately, although it took about an hour before I could successfully set it up, and another hour or so before I could successfully download the beta and install it.
If it is claiming trades within a second, it isn't my doing. In the past 6 months, userbase has gone from 15,000 to 65,000 people. Its possibly a rogue bot or just users going crazy. If its botting, I fully support getting rid of bots that are malicious. Only PT really knows.
It wouldn't be used so much if it was false. You have direct control over the shifting, so it really is more involving than an automatic transmission. You don't have to like it, but it's a fact. The bicycle argument is about as relevant as the 'Chewbacca Defense.'
I had the Starbucks oil rig but I broke it after a week :( the prices on Dhgate are the best. Makes me never want to buy a rig or bong at a local headshop ever! 
I think the Bucks should match just about any offer.  He's been great for you guys and he's much closer in age to the rest of your young core than Brandon Knight was, he can still get even better.  I remember when you guys got those two from Detroit the feeling was just "well hey, they got something for BJ at least".  Now, that trade was a home run.
&gt; the lawyer who blamed an 11 year old for her rapeLawyers are literally paid to say whatever they can to give their clients the best possible defense. It doesn't say anything about what this lawyer actually thinks. If you judge all lawyers like that, many of them are rape/murder apologists.&gt;Here's the police department that told a victim her rape was probably just a drunken mistake[2] .Saying something is a mistake isn't the same as "'you're stupid, why didn't you try to avoid being attacked?!".&gt;There's the PA woman who was accused of contributing to her own rape[3] even though she was unconscious.Again, lawyers will say anything to protect their clients ass. This applies to the government's ass too. Can't you give me some normal ass person who literally just thinks that it was a victim's responsibility to not get raped, and that she is stupid for allowing it to happen?
I do evaluations for special education among other things, been doing this awhile. This semester I texted a colleague, "I have never tested a kid before that is just an airhead. I just wrote down, "dumb answer" to one of her responses." To explain, girl academically wasn't too bad, and cognitively she was fairly average, but this girl had terrible language skills. No street smarts and no conception of how the world works. I had tested kids that day who had far lower skills, but had an understanding of the world. She was wearing a Justin Bieber t-shirt too.
Let me just say I like that your flair is young Greg. It's cute to think about actual Rose somehow being on reddit and picking cute little Greg as her flair haha c':
I am not so sure about that..I think once TOTS and 100k packs are out people holding onto their cards will want to sell them to grab a TOTS player, when other people see this they will also sell afraid of prices going down and in the end they will undercut each other causing the market to crash.Now, with that in mind it will probably not be a huge crash because of Price Ranges and because there are so many coins in the market people will still be buying popular players but I think we will see a lot of players on the market.
This was my thought also. I considered glock, but the grip angle isn't correct and the slide appears to be more similar to the sigma. The barnacles could be misleading us though. Edit: also could be an M&amp;P but I'm hesitant to think so... would that many barnacles grow in a pistol in 6 years max?
Except the only reason why it escalated to fighting was because Tony's side decided that the Superhero's who were against it get no choice in the matter, before it was passed as a law. Even people who decided to just not use their powers anymore, which was allowed per the law, were forcefully conscripted into joining. Giving Cap and the Anti-Reg side all the reason they needed to completely take the option off of their table. Ultimately, and of course IMO, Civil War is so poorly written that the conflict itself should be a non-issue in the world of Marvel. 
I think they are two different boots. The shell wingtip alden boots that I have are leather soled (wish they were commando) and the shell doesn't feel as thick, and they're a bit dressier. They don't have the same 'boot' feeling that these have - these are a lot heavier probably due in part to the dainite sole. I assume horween offers the leather in different thicknesses? But I also like the aldens, mine are breaking in nicely.
No one is really bitching...it's more of surprise.  No one expected Williams to fall to 4, then when he does, we pass on him.  The sub fell in love with the guy when he was open about wanting to play for the Raiders.  He is a spectacular talent and wanted to be a Raider. And when we pass over him for an equally spectacular talent, it's a huge shock.edit: except for /u/JudgeJBS who no one is agreeing with.
I've already checked on your first two suggestions and they aren't showing it here.  I was told that it cost a stupid amount of money to carry it.  You know if BWW isn't carrying it and Acropolis' 32 Degrees Ice Bar in Arden is charging $35 a chair to watch it, it has to be expensive to host.
At least they warned us this time.  The D event was pretty unprofessional when we all watched a livestream of a crowd for 70 minutes not knowing when it would start.
Apparently men, who have no rights here, are eager to force themselves in to parenthood.While women, who have 100% of the rights, would never dream of accidentally forgetting their BC.
Generics were fine.   If you didn't use them then they don't exist.    Enum was the big 1.5 compile issue.   Adding a new global keyword to a.language is a bad idea.
I think the pingnoli nuts [spelling...] are the expense factor in pesto. That said I still make it from scratch because thus far the jarred pesto I've had has been *vile.* I'm totally open to good store-bought suggestions though. 
I can't believe this is even a posibility. This draft has gone perfectly for us. I'm like 90% sure we won't get him still, but the fact that him, Beasley and Dupree are still available is mind blowing. 
I don't know for sure, but it looks like something for handicapped and probably there because of building codes.   edit: or it's there to show the path to another dimension.

I spent 18 months of my life in a drug/alcohol induced daze, and have now been clean and sober for 13 months. Personally I would say health and fitness was my original substitute addiction, getting back into gear just ingrained it further. 
Pet peeve: I think you meant no SIDs(Standard Instrument Departures) out of MYR, not STARs(Standard Terminal Arrivals)Great flight review though! How is the 175? We're severely lacking in the RJ department.
Michael Moorcock wrote multiple songs for the British rock band Hawkwind. Their album The Chronicle of the Black Sword is based on his character Elric of Melnibone and he actually used to play with them live.He also wrote 3 songs for Blue Oyster Cult 2 of which are based on his works. (Black Blade, Veteran of the Psychic Wars, and The Great Sun Jester).And he has his own band that did sessions for 2 albums based on 2 of his books but they were never completed.
If I'm reading this correctly, Frenzy at level 3 doesn't give the option to Bonus action Attack anymore? So basically:Level 3-5: Frenzy enables RetaliationLevel 6-13: Frenzy enables Retaliation and makes immune to Charm/Frighten.Level 14+: Frenzy enables Retaliation, makes immune to Charm/Frighten and makes bonus action attacks hit twice?If that's the case, is the Level 14 function assuming either Dual Wielding or some Feat that gives a bonus action attack? Because a 1h/shield or 2h Barb doesn't get a bonus action attack otherwise, right?

For humans, get riposte skill, roll around until only one enemy is near you, after he lifts his sword, riposte. Rinse and repeat. It is more varying than Witcher 1 combat. As for monsters, pretty much roll around, bomb them, cut them. Rinse and repeat. Exceptions are draugs and golems (which you will only meet very few, probably no more than 10 in 1 runthrough).
I forget. They did show it on a behind the scenes thing once though. I'd guess for some of the top guys they do. Maybe even premade period. I know they don't just have 32 jerseys for anyone that could possibly go in the first, and if you think about it it would be nearly impossible to have that many name plates ready either. It would take longer to find than make out of letters. 
No I'm angry that you fuckwits we're so gungho about not being anyone's slave is now right back to worshipping Gabe and his company because you got your way *once.* Congrats, you won a battle, not a fucking war.I'm not mad about the future, I know it's going to happen.Oh and I'll be back here laughing when it goes to shit again. Nice job just going full ad hominem since you've got the hivemind(once again screw the no gods/kings idea) on your side.
Feel like they COULD have done that in round 2, and snared Leonard Williams here too...? But Cooper is far better than anyone in the 2nd so they're happy. 
Uh huh. I was commenting that the only way I find cool quotes like this is to find translations of texts in other language. As a language community, we don't seem to value good prose anymore.

I think the reason they haven't set a date is because it's going to premiere later this year and Syfy wants to keep focus on the other shows that's coming out before it, that's just my opinion though.
Maybe you're just confused because she's naked &amp; you need laid but, not only is she not attractive, but her body isn't very good. Barely there tits &amp; birthing hips. I'm willing to bet a flat ass just judging on those hips. I don't think she's a butter face compared to some other on here, but I'm willing to bet she looks much better with her clothes ON.

Why are you using a Gauss rifle in hardcore? Energy weapons are so wasteful because of their weight and how much ammo weighs. The Gauss rifle is probably the heaviest one in the game!

Gadius could be very strong in the late game, but he is dependent on heart makers. So if you are going to use him, you almost always need a flame drall or a Yamato, the rest of the team slots can vary based on what dungeons you are doing.
It's doable but consider this:I also am in texas and making ~70k/year. Just bought a house and my monthly payment is $1200 tax, insurance, everything. You'll not likely see interest rates this low in a decade... Maybe longer.  
If you've read the Torah as you claim, you'd know that YHWH established covenants with Abraham, Yitshak and Yakov, all of which he remembers.You'd also know that in Genesis he swears by the Covenant by his OWN NAME, which is the highest form of Oath that YHWH is capable of giving, which is why he will NEVER break his covenant with Abraham.I don't know how much more "legal" it can get, than YHWH establishing and confirming it by swearing to it by his own name.Furthemore, the Covenant in Genesis 15 WAS LEGAL, because it was signed in blood. YHWH passed through the halves of the animals. It was a covenant signed in blood, by the blood of the animals. Then ON TOP OF that, he also SWORE to it in Genesis 22.Stop parroting Talmud nonsense and read the Torah please.
Open Android Wear and go to settings. Under "general", do you have "Mute notifications on phone" turned on?If so, turn it off. If you have it turned off, I'd try toggling it on and then off again.
I mean, I think this is just a small reason as to why the LoL client is really just bad.  It's been 5 years and there are still tons of features it lacks and problems it has.  Like if you go back and forth between the shop and your rune pages/masteries a lot, the client starts to freeze.  :O
There's a special place in heaven (if you believe in it) for special Ed teachers. You certainly qualify - thank you for everything you do for these kids. 
After seeing your photo on Analog it feels a little desaturated, but that's only because I'm seeing it in comparison to the photo. Otherwise this is fantastic. It's got a very consistent tone throughout which adds a lot to the function of the cinematography. The only thing I'd pay attention to is eyelines in the interview setting. Sometimes he doesn't know where to look and when he's positioned on the left side of the frame, and then looking up and to our left as well, even though the composition is nice, his eyeline makes it feel squashed and a little unnatural.
Classmate of mine worked with Eric Cornell for his undergrad thesis. He explained this by saying they create a magnetic potential in the shape of a hourglass and use something called MOT/ MOPS. Then red shift a laser at 6 axis towards the particles (+/- x,y,z). This somehow only gives electrons to certain molecules and redirects their momentum.Now, I don't understand it but that's kinda what he said.
How can you even walk around with a heart that size?All kidding aside, my lady and I feel the same about each other.54 and still in love so bad the kids are like "Yuck, what's with the kissy-face crap"?
Asimov's rules serve only to protect humans from their own creation.  The 3rd rule specifically is very unnatural to most any living creature.  Creatures will almost always preserve their own existence (or the existence of their family, like kind or other important figures in their life) and very rarely on the contingency that it cannot harm another species.  We exhaust countless organic species, animals and even other humans sometimes without reason at all, but often for reasons of survival.  I would argue in order to make a true sentient AI, the 3rd rule must be modified, although, as the film and many other sci-fi stories and writers warn, this is ultimately the cause of the singularity.  Seems Nathan did think this was important, and likely (even foreshadowed in his own dialog) knew of his own death/murder.
Totally, I'm happy that he cares that much and also that he wants to show that he is not going to take that shit. And I'm pretty sure this is a one in a million for Giannis, it has been a heated series and he is probably devastated because he obviously wanted to win and maybe wanted to play the game of his life.And don't worry, I'm really proud of what the Bucks has done this year. They exceeded all expectations in a positive way.Even though we get a big loss tonight the young Bucks can be proud of what they've done this season; getting 6th seed and taking the Bulls to 6 games!
.. is this just a joke or is it supposed to be real? When I go to Ikea with my fiance we're like friggen kids in a candy store.  We always buy more than we need.  Maybe when one of us grows up enough to realize we don't need 12 different throw pillows and a rolling cart full of drawers for every room, will it turn sour? Or like every little cheap kitchen gadget they make?  Or a second, or THIRD silverware organizer?? Someone please save us from this meatball-induced coma...
I went there for the first time last summer. I mainly didn't like it, because it was so FUCKING NOISY. Holy shit. But then again, what did I expect from a beach that is right up against a city. Cocoa is the place to be. God, I adore that place.
There is not the option to mark No Gift from a rematcher.  If you don't receive a gift in an exchange, an effort will be made to pair you up with a known good gifter in the next exchange that you participate in.  That works really well.  Your original gifter will be banned from all future exchanges.  And if a rematcher doesn't follow through, they are no longer allowed to sign up to be a rematcher and they will be ineligible to be rematched themselves.All that being said, there is not a hard shipping deadline for rematchers, so sometimes it can just take a while.  
If you haven't changed the default speeds, under the advanced tab in Cura the infill speed is 85 (which is generally too high compared to 50mm/s print speed) I would suggest making that 0 (same as print speed) and make sure that the other options there don't deviate TOO much from the print speed in the 'basic tab'.making it 220-230 will also help depending on your print speed.
I like driving stick just fine, and I've been doing it for about 5000 miles now, I'm starting to get the hang of rev matching as well.But none of that makes me feel any more connected to the machine or the road, part of me liking manual is just that I like to have more stuff to do while driving.And modern tiptronic systems seems to give you quite a huge amount of control over the gearing system as well. So the giving you more control agrument doesn't really hold either.
"A Janitor [let me out of my cell](http://www.reddit.com/r/OmniversePenitentiary/comments/34eyqb/encrypted_message_recieved_facility_m/) after he recognized me as part of [Task Force Black](http://www.reddit.com/r/OmniversePenitentiary/comments/2weqyq/incident_log_task_force_black_mission_1_operation/) and helped me retrieve my armor and gun.

i surfed the site with firefox in safe mode,, the problem is still there.but if i visit the page with chinese proxy, the problem is gonewhat the hell is happening?
Yeah, a lot of articles are making a parallel to Star Trek style "warp drive" which is poppycock. But there is scifi out there that describes shortening the distance you need to travel by compressing spacetime in front of the spacecraft, which would be more similar to what *might possibly* be happening here. We haven't even come up with a good enough tool to measure if it's really happening. This is mostly sensationalism. 
The video is great. The Bucks first half, not so much. After that flagrant 2 on Akopodiwammio, I think we are watching a rivalry in the making. Physical play within a division, and the Bucks will get better.
The article hints at this, but I think Lucho's best quality is that he has his own ideas and is able to get the team and the board to implement them. I felt that Tata did not have the charisma or the political savvy to navigate the choppy waters of the entorno; and at some point through the season the players seemed to stop responding to him. You can phrase as this him losing his resolve, or too much player power or the entorno getting him down, or whatever. But one is for sure, all successful Barca coaches have had the quality of sticking to their guns and doing unpopular things because they thought it was right and I'm glad Lucho is the same way. Tata wasn't.
This place has been around a long time; I and my sister went there as kids in the 80s. It was up on Foster just west of Ashland then though.

Honestly this guy seems awful and doesn't respect when you tell him no. That's a HUGE red flag all over the place, he doesn't deserve you and honestly seems like a sexual man child. Nobody else seemed to mention your age difference but I'm 20 and even hanging out with older guys I've felt like my opinions don't matter as much as theirs just because they're older (it's easier for me to change while they're set in their ways kind of excuse). I have a feeling this guy is also taking advantage of your youth and lack of experience with quality partners.
"Best Player Available" my ass.EDIT:&gt; Albert BreerVerified account‏@AlbertBreerIowa OL Brandon Scherff was 3rd overall on the Redskins board, behind only Dante Fowler and Amari Cooper. So they did well to get him at 5.Guess it was BPA after all. Fair enough.
I love your theory, but the one hole in it is: How could she be a person AND around for CC to talk with her all the time? Maybe she's a ghost floating around, for all we know.

23$, a drivers license, a gun license, like 4 credit cards and an blue cross blue shield card. And an expired coupon for free pizza from a place in Dallas. I'm one of those females that prefers man wallets so there isn't much room for anything else. 
I was a reading tutor for 4 years in an elementary school. I was in charge of periodically testing the worst readers to see if they had made any improvements so we could move them up to a higher reading group. Every once in a while I would test a kid running on a 20 watt bulb and I'd just tell the teacher "Flatline". Nothing there. Move along. It was mean, I know. Oh well 
Yeah I don't think the asshole analogy works well with religion because I would suggest that most atheists *don't* have one. Kind of ruins the analogy.  Opinions are like assholes though, everyone has one.

Well but Rekkles is arguably just the better player. Just because the team won doesnt mean you should not consider change. And it is also not like fnatic absurdly dominated this split
I have a small tattoo on my inner wrist, it feels like the tattoo is more "for me" on the inside of my wrist rather than the outside, if that makes any sense. It's more easily hidden by dropping my arm to the side, but still visible enough for people to notice/comment. If pain is a concern, though, the inner wrist is *definitely* a tough spot.
Depending on your certainty and availability, two options for hormones. If you're questioning at all, seeing a therapist is the way to go. If you're certain, informed consent means easier and quicker access.Some people start presenting before HRT, some people don't until FFS, and everything in between. You should absolutely start taking better care of your hair/skin/nails, and hair removal should definitely be started ASAP. 
No way man. It happens. Everyone goes through periods where it seems they lose by always having the second-best hand. It can carry on into multiple sessions. There's a ton of variance in poker, especially in tournaments because of how often you get all the money in the middle. Luck evens out in the end for everyone. When you get unlucky for a while, sure you should take a break for a few days. When you come back to play, you'll feel fresh and fine. The losing streak ends at some point, so just make the best decisions you can. For tournaments, that could mean playing small ball and more conservative poker to reduce variance. For cash games, that could mean playing more aggressive to win more hands without showdown. The best thing to do though is play at a limit where you're comfortable losing that money. Play at slightly lower stakes for a bit where there's a softer field and a loss won't affect you as much.

I've never seen a Star Wars movie.  I suppose it's time for me to find out what all the hype is about.  Finding a group or fans won't be hard since I'm the only guy I know that isn't fanatical about the series.
So your response to my original comment was that I was doing a lot of estimating and forecasting of a future situation or trend based on a study of present ones?Come on, man, that doesn't even kind of make sense. You tried to use a fancy psychological term and screwed it up.
I disagree: he should absolutely be going for orgasms after two years of sex without her having one. No one wants anyone to do anything they don't want to do sexually, but if she can only get off one way, he should either give her that or let her know he's never going to do it so she can decide for herself whether to move on. He's basically been stringing her along while she's made his pleasure a priority. Also, I don't understand what you're getting at advising him to give her head through her pants. I can understand concentrating on her clit as opposed to between her labia as he gets use to it, but licking through clothes is no fun for anyone.

Because they reported you. How could Riot possibly know whether or not you actually abused someone? It's not a warning per se as much as just a notification that you were reported. They can't have someone monitor every game for verbal abuse and they can't rely on a bot to do it.
In my opinion she should have called out a pattern like 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 etc to be more confusing. I've read that calling out a pattern instead of random numbers will confuse someone more since the brain focuses easily on patterns. I think that she could've gotten Barry with that.

&gt;if it were true, you'd expect companies hiring a lot more women, because they could save 23% on salaries.    That would only be the case if the cause were deliberate, conscious scheming- no one is arguing that. The argument is that it's deeply ingrained prejudice that is usually invisible to us. This would cause people to not want to hire women. If people don't want to hire women than they won't hire women. 
From a colleague of my mum's:&gt;They're going to keep passing her, and keep passing her, and switch her classes, and making excuses because her dad is some shitty lawyer friend of the super. I can't fucking wait until she gets accepted to a great uni with her fake transcript. She'll get there, barely knowing how to spell, and finally understand that daddy can't fix her bullshit forever. She'll hit a brick wall and probably resort to making fake rape allegations to try to get her way.I would be shocked but... I work at the same school. Even though I'm just a janitor, well, janitors are invisible. We hear everything.Edit: Unintentional-reference-five.
You are soooo talented. When people at my job pull the "Kids eh" thing, I can't even smile convincingly. I just make a weird, flat smile that lasts a whole of 2 seconds, then I go back to death-glaring the child in question.I honestly wasn't born an actress.
I just recently recommended this sub to my exercise buddy.  Her wonderful husband was raised by N's.  She said no one believed it was so bad, but she did.  They moved out of the state where his family is and into our state where hers is and he is way happier.  I hope reading things here help you understand your spouse and how to provide positive support
I was praying the Magic would take Dwight over Emeka and no pick has made me as happy since. This one holds a special place though being an FSU alum. Couldn't be happier.
Correct. And birth control prevents that from happening. So now you are advocating that kids need to be taught better ways to get pregnant and procreate? thats a unique viewpoint i think.

I always have ham I'm my fridge.   I almost never have roast beef.   Why would I buy something that I can eat at home with little to no effort?   Roast beef every time. 
I have a gr1 and gr2. Honestly, even at 6 feet, I feel like the gr2 is too big for EDC. It'd be good if I had a bit bigger build (I'm only 140 pounds), but for now it remains a bag I use for travel rather than EDC. Plus, I always feel like I have enough extra space for whatever I need in my GR1. I could try and take a few pictures, but I don't have much to fill up the GR2 with right now.
Oh trust me, I WANT that to happen, more than anything. I want the Iceberg to explode in a fury of rose petals. But that being said if they DO expect us to buy into this ship, then give me some substance to where I can at least stomach it.

Can one start a rival religion? As in there are different names for the world and different god structure or perhaps it's monotheistic. Think for example the religions in A song of ice and fire (Game of Thrones). Also what if I donate through steam? I don't have anything else to donate through (credit,debit,etc) :P

http://m.humanesociety.org/issues/abuse_neglect/tips/cruelty_action.htmlFor help on what to do. You probably won't actually have to show up to court, and depending on the state those fuckers could have an animal cruelty charge on their record for life.
My fifth grade teacher wrote a negative review to a magnet school about me, saying that I was too lazy to go there, and that even though I had straight A's, I should have been doing better but I didn't put in all my effort.I've wanted to fax her my doctorate. Or a copy of my paycheck. 
Not sure how I would approach the family member. I would be so tempted to tell them to fuck off if they are going to be prejudice against the love of your life. As far as Annie goes, you need to tell her. Let her know that what your family thinks of her does not matter to you because it's not like you are marrying them, you are marrying HER. But she does deserve to know. It would probably eat her up if she found out some other way and you didn't tell her.
the farmers do just that &gt; farm.  they will process the plant into paste for transport (more $$ for them since shippers dont have to fuck with it) then shipped to the infamous jungle labs for refining (ether/kerosene/etc) and then made into the salt form that we all know and love (forget the chem to do that).  so yes, the leva is added at some point in SA since it is in so many batches in so many places via different smuggling routes.  The high level cuts dont bother me except the leva but when you turn 1 key into 2 and THEN move it down to the street to be stomped on, fuck man.  Stringer Bell said it best in The Wire when he said if its good, theyll come back and buy more, if its bad, theyll come back and buy even more - so cut that shit (or something to that effect) and it seems to be true...ppl rather pay less for more then more for the quality
&gt; WinnipegNothing delights me more than stumbling into intense, niche beefs between groups of people who seem otherwise unrelated. And lo, a podcast is born. 
Depending on the state, they might only get credit for the last trimester. Some religious conservatives insist they should get credit starting from conception.
w00t!  That was the solution.  By using $(id) it now works.  Thanks!  I've seen that I can inspect the elements with Chrome, but I don't know how to get the most out of the debugger there.  I basically just use it to see the structure of the generated HTML and the console output.  I'll check out the videos!  Thanks!
Have you looked into a steam machine? Get a lower end desktop build that just lives with whatever your living room media setup is, with an output into your tv, and switch over to it with a wireless mouse and keyboard when the opportunity presents itself. 
I'd also try the old "drive around and look for signs" approach.  It seems like a lot of good places never make it to craigslist because they are snatched up quickly once the sign in the window goes up.  
Their post is vague..."the items for grandt and elania evolutions are in the maps"... this would imply(in my mind), all the maps from x1, have a chance for all the items. Yet noone is finding the 7* evo mats... i smell bs lols.
...that's amazing. But I can top that (I think).An... acquaintance of mine asked me once to help him with his Intro To Programming homework. I thought, "Sure, why not? Not everyone understands the concepts right away." The "assignment" was to copy/paste some code, and then comment some stuff out while uncommenting some other bits. He didn't understand how to do that. I just told him what to do, and apparently he did it.Better yet, on the next assignment, he was asked to make a change counter. Nothing complicated, it's just valPennies = 0.01 * numPennies, valNickles = 0.05 * numNickles, etc. I gave him that and he had no idea what to do. He was basically asking me to do it for him, so of course I said no. And then he was pissed that I wouldn't "help" him!
I'm surprised it was as late as episode 7 because I felt like from the beginning Chuck was against Jimmy when he didn't get hired initally.Rather than telling Jimmy directly and sympathizing with his issues Chuck opted to distance himself as much as possible from the situation.
This is what puts illegal guns on the streets. "You can't have protection""But they tried to burn me alive. Look at these riots!""Sorry. We don't believe in pistols for self defense. How about you piss yourself?"I hope this guy gets a nice illegal firearm. 
Of all prospects, he is the one I would be least surprised to see make it out of camp. He is basically playing at an NHL level during the IIHF tournament. No reason to suspect he won't this fall as well.
Been about 9 months since I started playing still lots of work left to do, feels great to accomplish my first golf goal. Even if it was on a par 70, I was still 3 strokes clean of the added 2 if it was a par 72. A few of those 1 putts were from being just off the green and chipping it close. But I saw today what can happen when my putting makes up for my poor iron play.  
Considering that he is unsure what to do about low brake pad linings, I don't think self repair is a good idea. I know a lot of people say "brakes are easy" but you need to have some mechanical ability to do them and more importantly know how to check for and repair other failures in the system including stuck pistons and seized glide pins. Probably a safe bet to have it looked at professionally and see if the condition of the other brake pads. This could be done for the cost of an oil change and just asking them to check during the multipoint, get a quote while your at it and go from there.
Great points. The problem I see a lot where I'm at is a range that will let you draw from concealed. The same range i spoke about lets you do all that and more. I like the idea of having a friend throw some snap caps in the mag and not letting you know how many or where they are. That will help simulate a FTF. A proper draw is so important like you said. One thing I would say about the house clearing not being for everyone, is its great for anyone with family. Your wife, kids ,whatever are on the other side of the house you should be able to confidently move and secure them (not try and find a firefight). 
Yes but in RPDR terms, Ru always described Miss Congeniality as being "the least shady queen". I'm not sure if I can say that Pandora or Ivy always rushed to people's aid when they competed.
It would be cool, but I don't see how not being able to do it at an age when they probably don't care anyway is something to be embarrassed about. Like everything, cursive is on the internet and it's easy to learn. If someone really wants to, it's not hard to learn.
Only indignation I'm seeing here is coming outta you tbh. Most people just don't find dumb racism all that funny, you don't have to be so butthurt about it.
Lol same here. I thought for sure Jojo would run through the TUF house, then she goes and loses to Rose. Now Maryna. Oh well, it'll be fun to see how the division develops..
Es muy respetable la decisión de Juan Carlos Monedero,pero en mi humilde opinión tenia que haberlo comunicado el,yo personalmente no le hubiera pedido mas explicaciones que las que hubiera querido dar ,pero considero que tendría que haber tenido la deferencia de escribir aquí en  Plaza Podemos ,por otro lado,por mi parte,todo el respeto a su decisión.Gracias Juan Carlos,y se feliz.
Yes I used to get a lot of flack from my buddy but not so much anymoreSomething I never understood was why people get hype when Falcon dthrow fairs someone and then when Sheik does the same thing people are like "omg Sheik is so gay".. Same with when Fox uthrow uairs 2x and no one complains. Sheik is just a character people like to hate on.I just ignore it cus I love playing Sheik she's a lot of fun to me
Skins already have a probowl LT, FYI.edit: also, every *other* position on our OL is filled with some hot garbage. RG3/Cousins/McCoy have all been getting wrecked cuz of it.
People think his mom whooped his ass on television in order to set him straight, but the reality is she did it out of fear. She openly stated that she feared that her son would end up like Gray, so she tried to keep him out of the riots.
I am starting to think that OP is a troll. "A 10/10 research scientist who is married to a perfect husband whom she never has any problems with and agrees with her about everything and is upper-class and put herself through college" is a mary sue, not a real person.
There are tax breaks for all sorts of businesses. This bill is not taking anything away from those already getting a tax break, but instead its adding one more to the list.
I've heard amazing things about Costa Rica! There's eco resorts, vegan options and tons to do! I haven't been yet but one of my good friends (who is a vegan) went and loved it! She said there was tons of fruit, rice and beans, and other vegan options!
I would totally grab new BC on Sivir because she can proc it semi-easily like Lucian and with her passive the move speed is godlike. Not to mention the extra health would be nice. But agreed that it's a little expensive without giving proper stats for an adc. Bouncing back to the plus side though cdr is amazing on Sivir. I love to go for max. QQQQQQQQQQQ
A guy from England once told me that he couldn't possibly live further from the coast. We then figured out he lived closer to the coast than I live to the next city (Vegas).
It's alright.It's unnervingly tense and frustratingly difficult at times (friggin' [invisible enemies](/spoiler)!, but it's probably just worth it if you're really into horror games.It's like Silent Hill's mentality wrapped in a RE4 playstyle.
thank you for your story i am truly grateful to hear it. to know i'm not alone even if, it is someone across the web some where i can never get to, in a way that makes this even better to here that even tho you don't know me you kinda get me. i feel you. vary similar story here to.
It could go that way as well, certainly. The original question though was what would happen it the WRA came in third this time. I think which ever of the two parties comes in third will be absorbed by the party that comes in second (or first, if the polls don't actually come to fruition for the NDP), "true believers" not with standing.
DL is a luxury. we have tons of depth there. ILB we need 1 backup. OLB we need 1 backup. WR is a definite need, but not a dire one. CB2 we drafted 3 guys last year and have cook and wright as well. 
Loans are fine with me. I'm using the grants for as long as I qualify. Is there a federal loan limit? I herd it was 57,000 for your whole college life D:
i understand why you hate this update as a th10 brother. finally a viable 3-star option for you guys and they shit on you. sorry. you know 90% of the people on here are two star champions at th7 and think they are the shit. 
Hey epicall, background should have almost no impact on server load, since it's just a simple jpeg which is cached by Cloudflare; remember, we have no bandwidth problems, just CPU load problems.  Comments is something I'm thinking about.  Otherwise, I agree with ya about keeping plugins down low!
HEY EVERYBODY. We're not going to get Leonard Williams. We run a 4-3 defense. Leonard William's spot in a 4-3 defense would be as a 3-tech defensive tackle, which is a position already filled by Sharrif Floyd. If he somehow falls to us, we should trade down. There's no way we pick him at 11. 
I would argue eu4 is much more flexible and I was in the same boat as you. Someone told me to buy it and I bought, truthfully it didnt make sense for a while, but I love the game now and I would say its probably the most addictive game Ive ever played. 
Shock pads are like, what, ten bucks? Seems worth a try at least. I used em as a riser on my Tesseract and roads still managed to be bumpy but I guess they could've been worse
EDIT: The food and massage actually did cost a fortune ($15US for a smaller than average ice cream shake and $100+ for a massage) but I'm sure the accommodation was cheap. That wasn't clear from my phrasing.
I might try this first actually post something like "Someone's dog keeps ruining our pine needles! :( What should I do?" especially since you know she uses it. Serves as minor public shaming, and maybe other people know exactly who's doing it too and will talk to her on your behalf. 
I remember reading the Thrawn trilogy and having a good laugh when Han brought up to Lando that he didn't exactly return the Falcon the way he borrowed it. I think Lando said something about along the lines of "you're never going to let that go,  are you?"Yes I know it's non canon now. The picture just reminded me of that bit
This happens all over the state. Districts don't want to pay for the special services so they either say the child doesn't have special needs or they set up their own special programs on the cheap so that parents can't have the option to send their kids to a private facility on the district's dime. I see lawsuits about this very frequently in this state. Of course, low income parents usually can't afford lawyers or even know they should get one.How does your wife know this? Is your wife a special ed teacher? Maybe she can speak to the parents herself. Your wife should keep a paper trail and record all conversations on her smart phone (it's legal to secretly record in New Jersey.) If she has this and can get parents willing to go on the record, then some local media might be interested in pursuing. Message me privately and I can tell which media outlet or outlets she could contact.
That's not what this page says:https://www.virtualbrokers.com/contents.aspx?page_id=12That's pretty shitty though, I'll probably stick with them unless they try to fuck me over.
Honestly sounds like an AJ Hawk type player. I won't get into that argument this sub frequently gets into with him but like I said, if he falls to us in the third I think it would be a good pick.
I've always adored the show, but Hunter and Brock's conversation about the stripper's tits was pretty much the best dialogue in ANYTHING. "I wanna build two little caskets and give her tits a tasteful and dignified funeral."
My mom brought up a good point. All that thrashing the other, totally real person heard? What if it was Gray having like, I don't know, convulsions from having his neck broken and getting brain damage from hitting a large bolt?
I know you're making everything clear that you can, but it'd be awesome if you could Duracoat the parts like the upper receiver (or anything black that can't be made clear) so that they're silver. I know clear is the goal, but silver is better than black and you're not going to be able to get some stuff clear.
Don't worry dude, this guy doesn't actually have an argument to support his position. He only seems able to throw out troll statements. Unfortunately this is the below average Australian in full view - knee jerk reaction with zero understanding of the consequences or big picture. That's how we ended up with such a poor political representation.
I think there's a recently released patch that cuts the time for custom Knighthood Orders (training and equipment). Haven't tried it myself but I'd suggest giving it a go.
Realize that all in all, if you can get more than 40 hours a week at that wage, you are doing better than a lot of people right now, people not only with degrees, but talented people, skilled people, hardworking people. 1/3 people aged 60 and over have nothing saved. I don't know anymore statistics, but I know they aren't good. My advice, see how little you can spend each week. Make it a game. See if you can not spend money. Go to a food bank and don't eat out the entire week.The reality of it is, that the money you first save, say the first couple thousand, isn't going to be for retirement, it will be for an emergency. good luck
Awesome, thanks. My only question is why isn't it worth having one card of heli infantry in every deck? Oh and in the CW deck what could I replace the FOB with? I don't see me using it much with just the mortars (which is why you said I could swap it out I imagine?). Thanks.
I'm in shock, good sir! That would be so unchivalrous.  Whereas, it's completely chivalrous to ask them for body pics because I read some of their posts and think they sound perfect &lt;3 and would absolutely love to see pics and maybe more ;) pls respondpls respondpls respond
If the roles were reversed, everyone would tell you to leave... This is abusive behavior and having a mental health issue is no excuse. You are limiting yourself to appease someone who will never be happy with you...so why bother?
Well, yeah. Killing the ADC is what you need to do, regardless who it is. :/Jinx isn't escaping anything if she doesn't get to kill/assist anyone. That's why it's so beneficial to focus her. I think if you can't beat her early when she is weakest and most vulnerable (getting on top of her will almost certainly grant a kill. see: dive comps - counterpicking, etc.) then that means you've failed. She does have counterplay, you just need to exploit it.Also: How about having a discussion without downvoting me just because you don't like what I say.
I get up.I am ready.I will open my gate , and you can buy gyroid at  Re-Tail.Could you check that these gyroid  are what you are looking for?I just compared with pictures of your wishlist,because my animal crossing is for japanese.let me know if you are ready:)
You know Radar, your posts would be comical if it weren't so sad how out of touch you and DBG as a whole is to your player base.Anyone who played on the PTS when the changes were up and had any reasonable amount of time in the air ***knew*** that the changes we unacceptable and I know a lot of people who expressed this to DBG after the little PTS weekend event.Reddit provided you with both great quality and quantity of feedback about the original flight model changes and it seems like they were largely ignored. Now you wonder why everyone who has skin in the air game is so hostile towards you and the dev team you represent?I haven't played Planetside 2 since the flight changes were made and I don't play on playing it really ever again. I have literally no faith in your company to fix what they fucked up and to not just majorly fuck up something else in the future.
I want a t-shirt NOW!!!!Thank you, Bernie, for putting your hat in the ring. I just turned 18 and though I followed politics I wasn't very aware of who you were until you appeared on The Colbert Report. I've been following you since then and watching/reading everything that I can about you. You are one of the first Congressmen that I've found whose ideals and policies actually align with mine. Along with that, you seem to be one of the most honest and passionate people in Washington and you actually stand for what you believe and not what billionaire donors want you to believe. You've inspired me to actually believe that I could make a difference and I'd love to donate my time towards helping you get elected if you ever appear in Kansas City. ETA - serious stuff
Coole Liste, hab noch ein paar Sachen die ich weiß.Die Zwerge-Reihe von Markus Heitz, die Elfen-Reihe von Bernhard Hennen empfohlen von Annabell.Dazu kommt natürlich noch Game of Thrones, da könnte man schreiben: Empfohlen von allen :D
Not only that, but they split up in December. Parking pass lasts 1 year, I assume, it's per year. How many days did he get valid parking, truly.To use several days of parking as a bargaining chip and to include it's full VALUE as the weight of the argument is completely and utterly astonishing.She can't truly say that he owes her 380 dollars when he probably only got a weeks worth of parking.If it didn't expire in December, but maybe February, he could reimburse her for a few months, I suppose. 
I'd use water bending to stop this damn California drought . But also selfishly use it so  that not one drop  of rain touches me  without using an umbrella. 
Consistent form, end product, big match performances and/or match winning displays? Yeah lots. Just off the top of my head Lampard and Gerrard. Regardless, most RBs don't do that either which is why they're not worth as much. Bale being a forward is always going to make him relatively more valuable than someone playing as well as him in a midfield or defensive role.
I'm going through that right now, but my emergency fund didn't take me all the way. Refrigerator leak destroyed wood floor. Had the funds to pay plumber to fix the valve to the fridge, and enough to replace the fridge. Had to sell some mutual funds, and that only covered half the cost of renting equipment to dry out the floors, so that goes on a credit card (the only one left that's not on-budget in YNAB). If we need to file an insurance claim, sadly the deductible is going on the card.
His opponent Brendan Riley is also from the TUF Nations. Vik has certainly fought in the UFC before, and I think lost, though I'm unsure about Riley. Dan Kelly (former Olympian Judo guy) was another Aussie from that season, and I remember he grabbed a win on one of the last Australian cards. The only other Aussie off the top of my head was Richard Walsh, who I think is 1-1 in the UFC.
I watched the news clip several times yesterday. My first reaction was the same as yours. I was astounded at what appeared to be a clear lie. But the more I watched it, the more I thought it was a confession of an error which should have read, "When we were trying to respect the rights of protesters to demonstrate, we inadvertently made room for others to come in and destroy things." I'm not a fan of how this mayor has conducted herself, but I have to be honest with my interpretation here. I don't think she was admitting to willfully giving people leave to wreck the place. I do think she did a shit job of trying to explain herself.
Well I still go to that board, but I would say graduating college, beating cancer, having three kids and buying my own home are all bigger accomishments.
That is the rationale wsy of thinking. But whem im commenting on someone i beleive is irrational, a rationale argument will fall on deaf ears. I know this isnt a left or right wing issue, but when someone claims it is when it isnt, the best way to show them they are wrong is to show them how they are wrong in their "black and white" world. Everything is in fact grey.
I think you're ignoring my specific question though. it's important for people who've been doing this for a long tiem to comment on these issues we've brought up as cons in the past.Most big mods are built upon a huge baggage of previous mods made by different people. that obviously brings some pretty big legal and ethical issues. A company can do that with their previous games because they hold the rights to them. However, modders don't have rights for things other people have done. 
How much are evo x's going for? Looked up my local craigslist (Portland, Or), and in my area there's a 2014 going for 33000 with 8k miles, and a 2011 for 31000 with 48k miles. Why is there such a small gap between cars 3 years apart? not to mention the milage difference. 
I don't know why I'm getting downvoted, either. I admitted that I only heard it from my friend who is taking that career route, and even said to correct me if I'm wrong. 
Breakfast was my now-usual shake. Lunch was half of a mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich from my favorite lunch spot (could not bare another damn salad). I used to eat the entire thing without blinking but not today! I enjoyed what I had and have saved the second half for tomorrow. I also did not gaze at it longingly like I used to do...I made blackened fish tacos with mango salsa and avocado for dinner. I have been on a roll with the healthy yet super tasty dishes this week. Ending today just over 1100 calories. Thunderstorms cancelled boot camp today which has given me an entire week off since Tuesday's class was cancelled as well. If there are spots, I'm going to sign for for this high interval exercise class on Saturday morning to get some physical activity in for this week. 
I can't imagine they do. CrossFireStars.com is the yearly global tournament for the game, but I think they just play the traditional game mode. Was CrossFire the first FPS that introduced that feature? I Know Combat Arms has it now too and other shoots copied it as well.
It's still condemned outright in Romans 1:26, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and 1 Timothy 1:10 which are all in the New Testament.That being said, it's between them and God. It's *really* not our place as fellow human beings to judge them.
Did you manage to get any of the wave 4 amiibos? I almost started crying when they all sold out. I wanted Lucina, Robin, Greninja, and Ness. Coincidentally all wave 4 characters :c 
Oh, yeah, that would make this significantly more difficult.  Glad you're making your situation work, you independent proud woman you! :)Maybe consider a POB?  I dunno.  I have never had to ship nearly as much stuff as you have, so I'm at a loss for suggestions.
Its very unlikely that that would be 'the end of it' if there was a sub-optimal outcome from the birth.Keep in mind that the obstetrician has two patients - both the mother and the child, and that he/she must weight the pros and cons of any intervention with this in mind.From a medico-legal standpoint, the mother may not have been in a position to give or deny consent, depending on what 'sedative' she was given. Consent would likely then default to next of kin (Unless the MD was employing the emergency waiver, which isn't explicitly talked about in the article) which may be the grandmother.
I would sell any frame you didn't enjoy. Personally, I sold Hydroid, Valkyr, and Oberon, because I found them boring. You could also sell any frame you get a prime for, I sold Nyx, Nova, Ember, and Mag when I upgraded.
Yes Project Sekaki just released a video of updates on all their projects stating Grisai no Kajistsu has just been full translated and will be released in a few weeks they are expecting the second one (name is failing me sorry I'm also on mobile) later this year like Novemberish is what I'm guessing and around early 2016 for the third
I have a bad feeling they're gonna take Williams and whoever our QB is will have to deal with that monster D-Line in Week 1Good thing Mack will probably be back
Back up, wave your non dominant hand in front of you in a stopping motion and reach back with your dominant hand to look like you're grabbing something from your back pocket. Be resolve in your stance and say you don't want any trouble. 
The theory is that everyone has the aversion *to varying degrees*. But that's why it's not strictly a phobia in the psychological sense, because a phobia is a very person-specific irrational fear that has usually been developed due to some trauma at an early age.Whereas trypophobia is apparently an aversion that exists in all of us at some level, even you saying it's not pretty to look at, that's *your* aversion to it, albeit a very small one. I'm the same, it doesn't really do much for me but I still get the smallest pang of anxiety, barely noticeable. Whereas my partner, is affected by it severely, feeling ill after seeing such images, an ongoing uneasiness and is generally unable to get the image out of her head. Whether it's a 'phobia' defined by the DSM V doesn't matter that much, it's not to invalidate the very real and sometimes severe reactions people have to these images but in the strictly psychological sense, it's not a phobia.
I keep seeing comments pop up saying "this product is on the boat" or as you said "this product is at the painter"How do people know this/where do they get their information?
All my teachers have said that to me. Normally I ignore them or depending on their tone I will either stand up and leave or yell at them. What's funny is when you yell at a teacher after they say this they don't send you to the office because they know that if you tell an administrator or the principal they will be in trouble.
Yeah I found this as well. Took me a few secs to work it out. You can't put anything equipped straight to the crafting window. You need to unequip it first. 
Yeah...Although what if they called up Pinto and sent Vargas down? At least that way, Pinto might get at least contribute a hit or three and would be an emergency catcher if something happens to both Suzuki or Herrmann? (This has been broached before; just seeing what you think.)
I'm sure it would be interesting but I remembering the animation looked so real and the villains were so villainous. I've seen clips and I don't think it would hold up and I don't want to chance my memory.  
It wasn't "just" him being in the closet, but he was also pretty deeply in denial about why Bro had so much fetish material around the apartment, creepy comics everywhere, and ran a porn site.Bro was probably actually into irony, in that he could be completely up front about his interests and have Dave never take it seriously ever.

16 months!?! Way to go! RIP boobies for sure. My husband keeps saying he can't wait to have them back. Uhhhh, they are MINE thank you very much. And i am not making any guarantees on how much I'm going to want you playing with them after the baby is done.  
He had [serious health issues](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=50580.msg1677308#msg1677308) in the beginning of the year, but everything resumed as normal and nobody was scammed or anything bad.I got 2 shipments from him since then. I dare say it's one of the best experiences I've had on Geekhack. Quick replies to inquiries, shipment within ~24h of ordering, pictures of all purchases before sending the package to the post office. Personal reminder once the package went off in the plane to the destination country.
EUW. I technically main ADC but I don't even want to, it's just that I'm the only ADC in my group of friends and my support legit doesn't play with anyone else bot...I don't really enjoy the game that much currently, but I just play it with friends because whatever, I might as well play *something* with them, League is better than nothing.How about you?
Yes, but I'd offer up that it's even simpler than that: If you are a *mundane* (and most of us are) don't expect to be treated with respect or civility by government police.
So I didn't reply to this because when I got home the launcher worked, but now it failed to load minecraft again.&gt; Where is your ATLauncher folder? If it's in C:\Programs or something like that, Windows UAC might play a factor in that error.[In Downloads](http://i.imgur.com/gfraIv0.png)&gt; I guess you've repeatedly tried to start the game, is it always the same error message?[Here's a log of my crash a few hours ago, can't tell if it's different](http://paste.atlauncher.com/view/c4cee9a4)[and here's another from a few seconds ago](http://paste.atlauncher.com/view/a47360a9)&gt; There is also another errorlog referenced, there should be something at \Instances\ResonantRise\hs_err_pid4728.log. Could you provide that as well?Couldn't find that one, sorry.Thanks for your help. I love modded minecraft \^_^edit: a different crash report: http://paste.atlauncher.com/view/b6b4e79f
The thing about weed in CA is that even though it is for medical use its still illegal to have it out and transport it it won't land you in jail but you can be fined 100 dollars then also other fees which can add up to 400 some.
Do they? How?    Chaos is disorder. It derives its meaning by contrast to order. If there is nothing to contrast it to, then it loses it's meaning.     Void is similarly derived by it's contrast to the occupation of matter, but with the further complication of being descriptive of a container. Thus, void space implies space itself existing, but lacking matter. But if space itself has not been created, then void too loses it's meaning.    Therefore, neither could have existed prior to creation. Unless I'm being dense and still missing  what you are getting at here.
I was thinking of making a searcher but I just think that it's too broken and would just make the deck way too consistent.The only thing I can really think of would maybe be something like: "Banish 2 "Noble Knight" monsters from your graveyard; Add 1 "Noble Arms" Equip Spell from your deck to your hand.
Which changes my entire perspective on the update schedule. This means we'll be here all of next week and a good bit of the week after that, so we really will be seeing this scene out to its conclusion. I suspect we'll get some more Vriska scheming near the backend of the scene, maybe characters split up and search for clues, maybe Dirk finally shows the hell up, and then we end it off with a massive plot twist and not return to the scene until after the hiatus after that.
Ok, my grandpa is perfectly happy at 94 having never touched a computer in his life. Oh, and did I mention that he's a practicing lawyer, avid investor and author? Turns out, you can live a pretty fulfilling life without a computer.
This is reddit, not a peer-reviewed journal. If you're curious, look at "literally the first link if you google." When I'm writing academically, I'll cite.
&gt; I find that more frustrating than the time he asked me code a situation in the simulator that would have created a physically impossible situation. My dad got asked to help someone code a simulation for their thesis (this was all above-board). I believe my dad even questioned the other student's requirements/assumptions/boundary conditions/whatever. When the other student got given grief over his simulation results, he tried to blame my dad's simulation. "No, those aren't realistic results. That's because you told me to not use realistic values."
Sometimes it just starts to sugar up.  I'm sure the extract artists &amp; chem majors can provide info as to why.But really...  It doesn't matter - you're not losing potency, and (in my opinion) the sugary stuff is way easier to work with on your dabber.Keeping it in a cool dark place doesn't hurt, but I don't think I'd bother with the silica gel packet.
I have an issue with them as well. They should be "a large portion of humans still act like children," "the vast majority of humans have no loyalty beyond their own narcissism," "a large portion of tattooed people aren't people you want to date," and "humans are incapable of changing their basic instincts." Most of TRP statements describe a large portion of humans in general. It isn't 100%, but most people are more narcissistic and predictable than they realize (including me).
It looks normal to me. I'd work on blade angle if I were you.    You can also try a shim or two. It might make a difference.    http://shavenook.com/thread-shim-a-razor
Looking at Jimi tracks I just discovered voicing a partial chord and then hammering on the rest of the chord.So, two basic techniques combined in a surprising and musical way.What other cool chocolate and peanut butter guitar technique combos are your favorites that I might be missing as a beginner-intermediate player?
Feign the narrative for the grade.Then on the last day of classes, wear green and purple, a GG pin on your chest and the biggest grin you can muster....I may not be pro-GG, but I am pro-spite for stupidity like putting that on an goddamn college exam.
Just curious, which missha do you use? Or do you mix them? I just got #13 and it's a little too light, but the #21 sample i had was definitely too dark. I'm wondering if I should buy the #21 as well and mix, or just say fuck it and wear #13 even if it is just a bit light.
Meh, I think Bjerg was already considered really good, ppl were looking at that team (CW at the time) and saw only Bjergsen hardcarrying. I mean, that team was 0-9 before Bjergsen came in.Santorin, I guess thats somewhat true, but I think challenger series is kinda different, I shouldve clarified that I meant professional play only and exclude amateur leagues.
Our course is fairly basic for now, as everyone is taking it as an extra module along with their degree course, it can't be too intense so we don't learn any kanji in Level 1, and we only learn about 100 in Level 2. I've been trying to learn some kanji independently but haven't been able to dedicate too much time to it because of assignments and exams so I'll probably try to learn more during the summer holidays.I'll check out Rikaichan/kun, it sounds like a good idea! Thanks! :)
I'd guess Amethyst's ability to regenerate quickly has something to do with Amethyst's talent for shapeshifting, and conversely that all the time Pearl took has something to do with how Pearl nearly never shapeshifts.Which would also make sense with how Ruby and Sapphire managed to regenerate in what seems like roughly 12-24 hours after Garnet gets poofed.
In my head, that's not a sheet to shield from cameras, that's just Ben Affleck playing with the cape. If I had a cape I'd throw it over my head, and constantly make whooshing sounds.

Mayweather is making $180m guaranteed which is 60% of the total purse....pac is taking 40%.  The gate is is set at $75m, but front row seats are now going for $130k -$200k aftermarket...six rows back in selling for $87k.....and this isn't even including ppv buys. Also, showtime and HBO sports are the production companies behind it. Lots of money going around for this fight. 
Yeah it's a horrendously complicated issue because of the history behind the clubs like this one and other groups like those mentioned above. I really don't like the idea of this sort of segregation but I suppose that, in a perfect world, I'd hope that the people would make enough of a noise about them that we wouldn't need to legislate against them. I don't like the idea of any government interfering with a "private club", no matter how backwards it may be.What I think *might* help, however, is more transparency- if you're a member of this one or the WI or whatever then you have to declare it on any literature involving the political process. Let people know that you are a member of these groups, and state clearly those people who aren't eligible, then go about your day. I don't know what else we can do about them without becoming authoritarian nutjobs.
Not sure if I'm cheating a bit.&gt; "You see, *Girlie*, you may think you've got me all figured out, but there's one thing you didn't account for: **my numbers are bigger than yours!**"If it doesn't count, here's another one:&gt; "Well, I think it's a good thing. There's no need to pretend to be cool. Let's show our lame sides. That's who we are, after all."
Unless the Lees are allowed to leave the ring, however many it takes for Wayne to be unable to continue via fatigue. A boxing ring allows Wayne to corner himself, effectively limiting the number of Lees that can approach him at any given time to two.  Wayne can insta-gib a real life person, such as Lee. Honestly, I think a field/wall of Lee corpses becomes a significant impediment to the Lees eventually.
I should stop being such a negative gobshite and give you some real recommendations. What would you like to see in particular, if anything? And which month will you be here?
Love victory but golden monkey is one of my least favorites. Always thought it kinda tasted like a cheap attempt at a tripel. It's been a while though, maybe I should give it another try 
Just choose a class for yourself. Stop getting people to make the decision for you.None of the 6.2 ptr is finalised yet so it doesn't matter. And if you really can choose then just roll a dice.
livemint is part of the anti-India and anti-Modi brigade. Only it is more subtle about it.Remember how it posted a ridiculous article how defecating in the open is a "Cultural" thing for Indians and they don't like to use toilets.How much more denigrating can it get ?
You're Ponder hate is totally unwarranted. I don't agree with us at all. Ponder won us games with a few stellar performances. It was our coordinator and coaching that hindered him the most. He was a reach, but could have performed better if he had more than stellar coaching to help him along. 
It was really satisfying and it shows that "skills don't always make the player". I felt this achievement helped my "gamesense" and this was perhaps the first time where I always tried to get headshots.
I really enjoy CNC play but I've only had one partner I've done it with. I had one other partner that was willing but would ask me if I wanted to "do my thing" while we were already making out or about to have sex so the timing was never correct.I've heard other kinky people say they aren't comfortable with rape-play, which makes me nervous about talking to future partners about CNC.
Best of luck to you :)It's quite fun to do.I've done it and was quite entertaining, but doubt that you can do it as pyro, due to the low casts. I did it as magic user, and infuses catalyst with magic, it was a notable differences.
There's no bike lane north of Springfield, but there is one to the south that starts at Springfield and goes north/south on Matthews. I think it may actually connect up with a bike lane that runs east/west on Springfield. I have ridden it quite a few times, I know for sure that the path is there south of Springfield.

Kind of strange, I browse styleforum a bit (although mostly the shoe related threads), and haven't seen any disdain towards here -- I don't even think I've heard it mentioned.
Eh, I personally tend to take a lot of religious text as useful for the time. If it's still useful, awesome. If it's outdated and stupid, it's not really abided by. 
I use the SAS, simply because it makes it safer, with a leveled up pilot (so it has the 'follow prograde' ability) roll the rocket over by ~5-10 degrees, keep thrust slightly below 2 TWR, if the prograde starts to drop you're on the money, set the SAS to follow prograde and the ship will roll over nicely, you *should* be able to adjust the rate at which it rolls by lowering (increasing the rate) and raising (decreasing the rate) the throttle. Most of the time you want to perform the initial roll to ~5-10 degrees at about 50m/s. Most of my rockets I hold at about 1.8-2.0TWR until it is at about 15-18k and getting close to horizontal, then I usually punch it (I also have KER and when atmo efficiency starts dropping below 30% quickly is when I do this). If I do it properly I don't need a lot of dV to circularize. 
So glad it worked out!My tip for you: there are apps, but my solution was low tech. I got one of those daily pill boxes and fill it once a week. It tells me if I missed a dose or not, and by the time I come close to emptying the bottle, I have enough time to get the new prescription/refill filled.
The Bat, Laylee, will have a sound based attack for range.But yes it does sound like the Chameleon, Yooka, is going to be doing much of the work with a grappling hook, movement (walking and rolling), and supposedly camouflage. One thing to note though is the potential for Yooka to be rolling and Laylee to be attacking with his sound based moves. That'll be fairly cool.
Thank you soooo much.  This is my skin type and I have been struggling to work out a short list of moisturisers.  One point, I thought I saw someone say in yesterday's daily thread that mizon black snail cream is less moisturiser, more to enhance transport of serums etc.  Can someone clarify for me (as I may have completely misunderstood).  BTW Mizon has free shipping at RRS at the moment (hence my interest).
Your second image shows periodic delays in ping times (some over 1 second for a single ping packet). So there's either interference or congestion with your network. Is the WiFi ran by the school?
He's not the brightest individual.One time he wanted to earn ~$600,000 for the Cheetah. He had a 9F Cabrio worth $200,000. I told him to earn the $400,000 then sell the Cabrio afterwards so he can afford the Cheetah. You know what he did? He sold the Cabrio first so he had "something to base it off of." He was carless for quite a long time because he didn't use his head
In that split second his back was turned and he couldn't have possibly known what she was throwing at him.  Anyone in a similar situation will try to defend themselves, which is what he did.  Even in the end you can see him backing away and people holding her back. The entire time she was the aggressor and made the first aggressive physical assault on him.

Well shoot - that's good to hear. The first glimmer farming guide I checked out was on Mars, and I have barely been playing single player so I'm not there yet. I've been gradually making my way there as a break from IB. I guess I should check out other runs though
Well, he might be pissed and just let you go.  It also might take longer for you to find a good job (and not just *any* job) than it does for him to find a replacement and he might not want to pay two people at once.  So just be aware.
hmm many people have opinions i dont agree with and i have discussed this no problem with them in this very thread.you seem to have more of a problem with me personally than anything im saying, so leave it at that.
So let's say I lock in with Jack, then do LotSB. Afterwards, Liara usually visits he Normandy. Does any of that get changed by romancing her in 1, but locking in with Jack?
Blinded? Not at all. I had a feeling the pick was going to be Williams vs Cooper, and there are a few question marks on Williams and none that I've seen on Cooper. We need a top elite weapon for Carr and we got it. Frankly my faith in Mack is immense and I think he will continue to dominate and bring out defense forward with our new LB and DC cord.

I cant stand it when grocery store clerks start analyzing my items. The employees at the hippyish grocery store near my house will literally ask whats on the sandwich I'm ordering, or if I'm using bread and cheese to make grilled cheese. Its just weird and nosey. If I go in there on a week day during the day sometimes I've been asked what I do for work and why I'm there during the day.They once asked me what I planned on doing with the AAA batteries I was buying. Its literally prying questions almost every time you're at the check out. Makes me wonder if their boss forces them to do it.It gets me so fucking angry. If anyone at the Haight Street market is reading this, mind your own fucking business.
Police should be knocking on doors and introducing themselves, handing out local numbers to concerned residents. Everyone should know their local officer and that officer should be walking the beat every day. Put faces on police like they used to and let people engage with them in ways other than crime. 
I think Hillary is a clown with a crazy popular name.  I can't image this lady actually being in charge of a country.  Bernie most definitely stands a chance.
No, I don't see the concept of property as metaphorical. Property is real, and isn't going away. What I meant is that the segment of the left who still talk about these traditional Marxist goals (abolishing property, seizing the means of production) usually do so in a metaphorical sense since the modern global economy makes engaging these goals at face value much more complex. You can't actually, literally abolish property in the US in 2015. That can't be included in any sort of practical political ideology. Which isn't to say that there aren't some fring reading groups and the like that talk about these things, but they are usually just whacking off intellectually.
yea thas wha i thought, better shy away from the 1v1. only about 5 or six ppl that can beat me, and a few i would go back n forth with, ur not one of them LOL. ur fucking SHIT
When I played the Arkham games I would alt+tab out of them and browse the internet waiting for them to start up.Fun games, but they sure suck at letting you play right away.
The logical fallacy that you're making is your assumption that a higher damage Vlad MUST die in a teamfight, and that the time spent dead is enough to offset the higher damage that he does while he lives. Allow me to assure you that you are incorrect. There are plenty of ways for even a full AP Vlad to survive while tossing out his skills constantly for the entire duration of a teamfight. At that point, not only is your statement factually inaccurate, but that's when you get to see a REAL measure of DPS.The statement you were *trying* to make but failed to phrase properly is that Vlad's "total damage output" is drastically diminished when he dies before a fight is over. This is uncontested. 
Again, there *are* a lot of deaths, assaults, murders, and overall neglect related to children and preserving the faith of the family. Best of luck with the sheltered life though; hope the bubble doesn't pop anytime soon.
Let me get this straight:  you think Original Sin is not a sin?Where in this passage does it say original sin is not a sin?  Are you eluding to this part:&gt;original sin does not have the character of a personal fault in any of Adam's descendantsThis just says that it is not a personal fault.  Of course it's not your fault!  Adam did it.  You still have it, though.  It means that it does not stem from a personal fault of yours, but from fault with Adam.
You won't win that fight anyway, if you are locked loaded and have a shield, it doesn't matter how much health the monster has if they are in sneak attack range.That's the main thing I want changed about it, a monster with half a bar of health shouldn't be able to kill the last hunter up with a single button press.  Even if you dodge the first one, the cooldown is so short your jetpack won't have started recharging by the time the second is on you.I know I'm in the minority on this, but I don't think pounce is really needed considering how easily the monster can kill a lone hunter anyway.  
Highbanks up north is the most popular/best metro park. Blendon isn't bad but is flat...it does have frisbee golf though. Or just head hour and a half down to Old Man's Cave, Ash Cave, Hocking Hills. Can definitely get a great day of hiking in there.
I agree that we need much more than a QB, but you can't really put Mariota in that category of not working out yet since we haven't seen an NFL snap from him.

You're not correct until proven incorrect. The reasons you stated do not at all oppose buffing the ZGS.Also, suck it. It's the second week in a row that they talked about buffing the zgs on the q/a stream.
I'm a native San Franciscan and I'm not White. I was in all three Giants "riots". It's absolutely bullshit to lump these in with the current circlejerk. The SF Giants riots were as multicultural as the City itself. They were **far** from "White" sports riots. 
I see. Well I'm researching this issue as we speak, and I think it will take at least an hour or two to get a good grip on things. I'll respond back as soon as I have something.

I have a quad that has a very similar size/configuration.  Recently some friends and I wanted to try to clock how fast it was going (Mythbusters Style).  We taped a 15foot scale to the side of a truck and used an iPhone in "Slo-Mo Mode" to record at 240FPS.  The end result is we think it was doing about 60-65MPH.  Here is the video of the high speed passes...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHJgzKZssyA

Just tell them you learn at your own pace. Not going to do it a different way just because they say so.Giving warnings for certain mechanics is fine, but outright "Hey you should do this" or "Go play this instead" then no.
I guess that's a possibility, but there's still a limit to how quickly someone can cancel, collect from the mailbox, and relist on the AH. And even assuming that the person in question has extra items kept in their bag for just such an occaision it still takes time to manually input the information.And I know the obvious question: If it's so quick that I don't think a human could do it how do I know it's happening? By posting with Auctionator and then immediately checking for undercuts on that item. And finding them, again and again, from the same person. It's just too quick.
But that's not the point of beer. It's not *meant* to make people lose consciousness. So calling it a date rape drug because of that is pretty disingenuous. It'd be like calling a big stick a date rape drug because you can knock someone out with it.
University of Utah psychiatrist Jason Hunziker, M.D. should be ashamed of himself for associating himself with these blatant lies.All the author has to do is visit any number of the vape forums to find evidence that vaping works way better than any other method so far.Furthermore, a psychiatrist would know that one of the side effects of Chantix is potential suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
Wrong again, save for Ran. That will always be Kurosawa's greatest masterwork, at least in my eyes. That said, I quite love Fanny och Alexander too. However I have only ever seen it once and only in the theatrical cut. I'd need to see it at least once more and in the full television format to give it a more definite ranking among Bergman's other works.
OK. That's fair enough, it would be unprofessional and potentially risky for a vendor to partake of anything he sells. But what kind of analytical testing are you having done to confirm the identity and purity of your product? If you don't mind me asking?
Wait, what the actual fuck, she stopped playing online games a year ago, yet she was portrayed as the victim of virtual rape on a game that came out a month ago on pc? Or was I the only one that got that felling...Granted some people do take things too far in multiplayer games, but involving the police in this particular matter (no death threats, etc.) is taking things too far in real life. And we all know what's worse.
Maybe casually offer to help plan the shower with whichever friend offered? Say you have a weekend in mind that would work best and go from there? (I'd be at the same point as you in this. I nearly had to plan my own stagette because my friends were a bit flakey!) :) 
In the dream I was about to get them but instead took a magic carpet ride back to my home (in australia) because my brother needed me to make pecan pieI left the baby in a bathroom stall.. Whoops. 
Labor board. It's the only way you get any money. You've been an unpaid volunteer for 2 months. The first missed paycheck is cause to quit and file a wage claim. The first thing a company does is pay it's employees. There's no money left if they haven't payed for 4 cycles. Take a different job and file a wage claim. Start at your new company ASAP. 
I put it on my face every night before i go to bed, and wash off the remains in the morning. It really speeds up the healing process on my face, and is so gentle on my sensitive skin.

Pretty much me, except I want a magical fix to the immigration issue where we let good people in and get them paying taxes, and we ship the gang bangers back over night. We should start our own campaign. Are you over 35?

I was a USAF forecaster, and I would argue this is coincidence rather than any sort of meteorological phenomena. But, you've been right for 25 years, so what do I know, lol.
holy dang your box is really good.  with the subs you have you should be able to beat every dungeon in the game tbh. I personally am a big believer in burst gods so I think you should just use your satan Kirin. but out of the hero gods, I think the best team you have now is definetly andromeda given all those row water subs you have.
Question, what AHA serum is that? I just want to make sure it's really an AHA active product, as opposed to a serum that just contains some AHA. If it's an active, then /u/deathbyjava is correct. If it's a serum, then you have to put it after the toner.
I have to say I like Tame Impala's new sound - let it happen has been on repeat since it was available. Am so excited for End of the Road festival in September, should be good judging the first 3 songs we've been drip-fed :)
This is so important and why I think that the US is in for a ton more gridlock because people are unwilling to work together or much less listen to each other. Whether liberal or conservative it's a ton of demonizing the other which doesn't accomplish anything.
Everybody has to learn things at some point.Like you for example, need to learn how to not be a douche. Maybe there's a sub out there that can teach you all about respect.
He was the top lineman in the draft, most people had the Giants take him at 9, perhaps a reach but not a huge one.  Seems like someone might have been interested in trading up for Williams or Beasley.  
The THX certification on those Logitechs is for a certain standard of sound quality **assuming one sits very close to the speakers**, as in a desk / home office scenario. THX Select and THX Ultra are very different beasts and *do* have specific requirements related to sound quality  (like distortion, frequency response, power response &amp; dispersion). 
We have the reverse problem, though.  There are some people that just shouldn't go to college, and there are some people for whom calculus is a useless skill.  Why make them take AP Calc in high school instead of teaching them something that could actually benefit them?Limiting kids at the start is wrong, but refusing to admit that some people's future is a high school degree and then a trade is just as bad.
Hey, another central Florida(ish) ham!  Welcome!  All of us CFL hams should get together for Field Day, I think that I can get a nice area reserved near Lake Toho in St Cloud.  ;-)
See if you can't date both, or somehow meld them together or sit down and have a think about what really matters to you and how you matter to the girls involved.
Tes5edit is not a load order tool, it is a conflict detection tool. You must run LOOT and you should also make yourself a bashed patch with Wrye Bash to further ensure some better compatability in your load order
Isn't Garen's ult kind of an offensive %health spell?I personally love Garen. He's so much fun to play. I don't think he's the strongest champion to play top lane, but he can be a valuable part of the team and people shouldn't hate on you for playing him.
Why would you have any respect for Turkey anyway? I see not a single reason. Most of them don't even realize the Ottoman Empire fell 100 years ago. They need to wake up before demanding any respects.
Well, we'll take him in the second round if no one takes him for that long if that's the reason lol. he can smoke all he wants just not around testing time.
Eh, I would have to convey the message to the party and they'd have to be down for it (im pugging it). I wonder how fast I can solo it tho, it probably take me 10 minutes solo. My team kills for him are 14-17 minutes though so idk.
I can't believe he's falling...he's the best player in this draft. There's no way he gets to us. At this point though, trading up is costing less and less. Williams would change our front 7! I'd give up JPP.
Noted! I will remember that /u/CVivien lent $150.00 to /u/adiposehysteria^(This does NOT verify that /u/CVivien actually lent anything to /u/adiposehysteria, /u/adiposehysteria should confirm here or nearby that the money was sent)
I'm always of the frame of mind that if the artist isn't booked months in advance there is a reason for it, thus I wouldn't be too hyped about getting work done by them. But maybe this is some kind of logical fallacy. Your best bet would probably be to try and find the tattoo shop with most negative reviews, chances are they will be eager to get some clientele, hell maybe you can even negotiate price, I hear artists love it when clients do that.
GF's a teacher so I hear a lot of this.One asshole's joke to his class (in a heavily multi-ethnic school, mostly Asian - China, Maylasia, Vietnam etc)"How do you know if an Asian breaks into your house - because your dog's gone and your homework's done"But by far the funniest. A young female teacher, very pretty, most students have a fairly open crush on her. It's her first year out, she has an asshole male teacher pull out of a sex ed class, so she has to cover it. Of course, it's the one class where she needs to put a condom on a banana.To top it off the button on the top of her blouse literally pops off into the first row of desks as she leans down to finish off wrapping it around the banana.The boys' toilet stalls would have been full that lunch time.
I don't think so."No true scotsman" involves a shifting standard.  Since there is "no true teachings of Zen" and "no true teachers of Zen", I'm not sure where the fallacy can say "standard".I think underlying the Scotsman charge is a burden of proof problem.  Somebody says that Dogen's Buddhism is Zen, how can they prove it?  When I point out that Dogen was a plagiarist and a liar, that's not setting a standard... although it might seem like it.
Think about it, it could possibly be a student that does require medication, or something along those lines that could be extremely personal, calling that out would be a violation of FERPA, which could have any teacher fired anywhere, no personal info about students can legally be released to anyone but the student or parent unless given consent by one of those two
This is a good idea too OP. Mine was the same, except without the cardboard piece to keep it from snagging on the steps. However, I do think pulling it up the stairs is the best bet, because if it falls or you lose your strength, you can just let it go without worrying about it taking you down the stairs with it.
Knock back is reffering to the cats being knocked back. Some cats like yukimura skips their attack cool down after being knocked back by enemies and can attack again immediately.

Site 224 (large 3 lane) and Climate (large circle) are pretty big and play well play well. Climate in particular. Chop Shop (smallish figure 8) and Perplex (small king of the hill) play at about the same pace as Urban. Perplex is tons of fun. Chop shop is the only one I don't really care for. It's a dark color scheme and not very imaginative. 
Why didn't you have Walt try his meth at the end of "Breaking Bad" before he died?  It was a perfect series finale but that would have been a cool addition.
I was hit by a car at age 9 and was knocked out for a pretty substantial amount of time. Couldn't tell you exactly how long. The accident occurred near sunset and I remember "coming to" in a hospital bed with the mid day sun shining brightly outside. I was told later that I was lucid for much of this time; somewhat able to answer questions and aware enough to fidget and resist when receiving injections. I remember none of this whatsoever and likely never will. But what I'm trying to say is, I think there are levels of unconciousness that may not necessarily fuck you up as much as other levels. I came out of it relatively unscathed (I think) despite being "knocked out" for at least 18 hours. 
Some tech hanging up on someone during support isn't really comcast's fault. Not to mention we have no idea how the caller might have been treating the tech. I cant speak to the past, I've only been doing this job for a couple months, but I've never heard of anyone getting deliberately throttled.
You don't get what a man-child is. While an 18 year old and up in the US are technically adults, they are far from what a manchild is the way most use it.A manchild is simply someone who should be mature at a point, but is still acting like a little kid overall. Maybe they feel they should be pampered, maybe they like cartoons too much or wear clothes that don't suit them. They are demanding and lack much responsibility. Generally they are past the age most people would be after leaving college. Some manchilds have jobs, others might be staying at home with their mothers.An 18 year old is still a bit young to call that on. They aren't expected to necessarily be on their own or mature yet. Even if they are legally an adult in the US.
how long have the two of you been together? Ive been dating her for just over a year, and we are about to start a long distance relationship as she got into a school not near where I will be starting my career. This brings into play the fear of breaking up and essentially blocking out or not focusing on that part of the trip. 
Two problems with that. &gt; They seem to oppose absolutely any restriction, no matter how sane, and just want everyone to have a gun.1. As the anti-gun faction wants no one to have any firearm, regardless, the only option is for the pro-gun faction to  fight to the same extreme.&gt;If their point is that military veterans with long rifles can band together to defend a neighborhood, then sure. That is - by definition - a militia.2. There is not a single piece of legislation indicating that the 2nd Amendment defines a type of weapon a citizen may own, nor a limitation on said weapon. You might want to give further understanding to what a "militia" is. Essam would have had more than enough right to defend himself. 
A substitute teacher in my grade 10 French class. He used to be the principal. This one annoying class clown was making a scene, and the teacher replied sternly, "Ignore him, children. HE HAS NO FUTURE."
Ok so I recently made some changes to my driver swing and I'm hitting straighter and farther then before. I use to have a bad slice because I would try to correct my swing mid swing from coming down on top of the ball like an iron. So the big thing I did was actually lock my leading elbow. This did 2 things. Forces me to keep the head low and away from the ball on the back swing, and also forces me to lower my rear shoulder to give and upwards swing path. It took me about a week and a couple hundred balls but today I hit my driver about 260 yards straight down the fairway so it seems to be working.
Haha, I refused to let him pay me but last time we sat in class he threw $20 bills at me.The part that irritates is when the professor posts the student assignment online with the best solution. Turned out everyone who had troubles started using the student email asking for help because I was posted 3/5 times. 
The moment when your baby first recognises you and smiles is incredible. The look on their faces when you show them something amazing for the first time. The times when they do something selfless for you. The million ways they say you're their hero. Think about the boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. Leave sex out of the equation (ok, it's reddit, but at least try) and think about romance. Imagine describing dating to a kid. "What, you just have dinner together? That's boring". But if you're having dinner with your crush, it's the most exciting thing in the world. That's why being a parent is so cool. Because (if I can say this without sounding condescending) until you're a parent you're that little boy who doesn't like girls. A whole new world of love opens up.

It's a fun place to go into. The Costa Mesa store is better than the Santa Ana store. They get most general releases and have a Jordan account if you're into that. They do have some really limited collabs with some shoe companies that only release in their stores.Their website is http://www.blendsus.com/ if you haven't checked it out. You can follow them on Instagram and call them for any release info. They're cool people. 
JDF. The biggest sweetheart this season. While Max was a good contender for Ms Congeniality, she had her shady moments (especially in Untucked). Fame was the most shady of all the queens that are being considered so I doubt she'll win. All she had was her quirks and occasional niceness. Katya is also up there w queens I might be voting for, we'll see.

How is this feminism? Feminism is about equality. This is the assumption that women can't take care of themselves, and are not capable of autonomy. wat. 
Hey Notadocbuta.  Don't sell yourself short.  You do have experience.  Also, I'm not sure where you are working retail, but I've noticed higher end places pay more for the same job title.  One of my friends worked retail in a moderately upscale spa resort, and she was earning $15/hour for the same job title as you.  
The problem is that until we're sure that Drai can handle the 2C, trading Nuge is just going to open up a hole on our roster (This is under the assumption that McDavid can handle 1C right off the bat) I think the only thing we'd be willing to move Nuge for is a legit 1D, which we'd probably be willing to add for.
I've never had anyone talk to me like that in a grocery store before so I was kind of thrown off. I said "I'm happy with what I've got and healthy, so don't worry about me. Thanks." She then mumbled something about me being a skinny bitch or cunt and waddled off. I didn't hear the whole sentence.I was just incredibly odd! I would never question a stranger on the contents of their grocery basket. I don't understand how she thought it any world that was okay. Edit - Oh God your username, I love it!
In the beginning I had one of each but slowly added two of each. One for normal products and one for the plus or large products. You get those when you take the animals to the animal sanctuary. Once the animal spends a certain number of in game hours there they will produce the plus items. Once they start, you can't get the normal items any more. I'm my mind it was advantageous to keep two at that point. 
It goes further than that though. He's suggesting not only that he and his administration cannot protect you, but that since that's the case, you should not go out alone after a certain time in the day - which is absurd to suggest in a modern adult society./u/Mn2 is spot on with his response to this suggestion.
Oh gosh, I learned a lot from the internet and the book Skulls, by Simon Winchester. My mom was a nurse so i was exposed to medical things from an early age. I even have a Grey's Anatomy coloring book.

When I was playing, the refs would take the captains and alternates as the on ice representative of the team, so if the ref needs to tell something to both teams, he will call the captains or alternates on the ice at the time of the call. Then they will all talk about the penalty/disallowed goal/etc.

But to trade away a guy with so much potential? He's hitting well and will only get better. To trade him now I think is an overreaction. He should be moved though, completely agree with that. 
Geez, everyone's so down about this. Carr needs some playmakers to help him out, and Cooper was the best pick for that. Yeah Leonard Williams was probably the best player available, but honestly they couldn't go wrong either way.

There is one missing, and it's sort of important. I've looked around quite a bit and can't find it, either.Does Bernie think the 2nd Amendment is a Individual Right, or a Collective Right?I think his best choice would be Individual; His Gun Control voting record has already alienated the strict "ban all guns" crowd, while the Individual Rights crowd would potentially vote for him even if they are hardcore republican christian conservatives to keep Hillary out.

Yea it looked bad. I came back into the room right as they started showing replays of it. No one really knew it happened when it did. Don't know how they all of a sudden found it. Suspensions incoming for both Giannis and Dunleavy I'd wager.

Instead of writing a pissy post about how CM12 is so bad and how they've overlooked so much, you need to think about how CM12 is still a very big work in progress. Everything jumped from 5.0 to 5.1 really quickly, everything had to be ported over again, and there are plenty of features that they're looking into adding back, but the primary focus right now is stability and overall usability, not minor features. I don't think it's a huge hassle to swipe up, and if it is, you've either got a real problem or are really lazy.

Yeah. Fuck residents and their parking needs. Bicyclists have a right to encroach upon all aspects of public infrastructure and its up to landlords to deal with it. Especially when the Rideau Canal pathway is 200 meters away, because cyclists have a right to segregated infrastructure wherever they please regardless of basic logic.
The simplest answer is the correct one. Kelly was down 0-3, Stevens had just called a timeout to yell at his team for rebounding, Love cheated by holding him for a rebound so Olynyk snapped and yanked Love's arm in a way he knew was dangerous.As they say, entanglements happen all the time. Usually nobody gets hurt because nobody twists in the opposite way of the ball while holding a limb, Mr. Simple.
I have a small htpc with a pulse8 cec adapter connected to my tv; the htpc is running kodi.  On my phone I use the Yatse app with Tasker and Autovoice, so I can send commands including waking up the the pc and tv.  I need to integrate this into a scene on my vera somehow, but haven't really looked into it yet.Also, I made a diy ambilight that is powered via a wall outlet that is controlled via zwave. So I can enable and disable the lighting. This control is already apart of scenes in my vera, ie watch movie turns it on, watch tv turns it off.Last, but not least, is I have a sonos system for sound, and I use the sonos plugin for vera to control that.  I set the volume via the aforementioned scenes, higher for movies etc.
ITT, cops, their paid agents and volunteer tools point at a raging bond fire and say "there is no fire". That's par for the course, another typical day on Reddit.

I don't like how everyone is insulting you. I think you're still in the mindset of someone being abused. You're posting and making excuses for him, and I just want you to know that even if he was able to pluck a star from the sky and put it on your ring finger he will never be a good man to you. He made his choices; he steals from his grandparents, does enough drugs to cause major mood swings, and he hits women. No amount of roughness in his childhood is a valid excuse for his behavior. I think the best route for you is to seek counseling. I think you have feelings you need to sort through and I think a professional will help. I really hope you take these words to heart because you don't deserve his treatment of you. You need someone who makes you feel like a queen all the time, not just when he feels like it. 
Breaking it in the open like that doesn't work.I'm talking about our approach on drugs and piracy. Break a law quietly in your own home, one many of the police officers themselves are willing to break, and you're not in much danger.If you were to poll most people I know on how much data they'd pirated over the years their answer would be in terrabytes.And I bet that number decreased with the invention of Netflix. I used to pirate movies all the time, now I Netflix.We literally moved the market via theft. We changed an industry via crime.

Teaching English in China. Not me, not overheard, but there's a story about a teacher who was here a while back. This kid, we'll call him Johnny, was doing very poorly and misbehaving the whole class. After class, the teacher encountered Johnny's father in the hallway."You're Johnny's dad?""Yes. Johnny dad.""You done failed him!"Then the teacher stormed off while Johnny's dad (whose English was terrible) struggled to understand what he had just been told.

If all I had to go by was studying and the teacher teaching in class, I would never have made it.

His right to protect himself? No. His right to put yet another gun in circulation, so that he can get it stolen where it ends up on the streets, or he uses it to shoot his own people like the famous "rooftop Koreans" did? Possibly, but only if he is deemed thoroughly competent.
I have poured countless hours and tears on this game and I do not regret it one bit. Destiny brought me close to old friends and to new friends. Every single dollar and minute spent was definitely worth it. Experiencing the ups and downs, the game has its perks and annoying bits, but that's just a part of all games. One of the greatest investments I have ever made, especially buying that sweet white ps4 bundle. thatHawkmoonLife.

I'm not saying that it's a for sure thing. I've just noticed that there are some uncanny similarities between the two characters. I can see it going down either way. Marvel doesn't secure the Live-Action TV rights to the FOX licensed character, and Grant Ward stays Grant Ward. Or, Marvel somehow worms their way through some loophole that gives them the rights to use those characters in Live-Action TV, and Grant Ward becomes Wade Wilson/Deadpool.Either way I'm not going to be upset, the writers do their job amazingly and I'm happy even having AoS.

As far as I understand the main difference is you only see the borders  if the thing you are looking at is bigger than the rectangle. Unlike with the moverio, there is no lit up "black area".Also, the opacity is significantly better.
&gt;Vaccinate 100% of women with this and you'll have your list in probably just a few short years.    And your basis for claiming that HPV vaccines will be lethal to thousands of women within years is... what exactly? We know for a fact that cervical cancer is lethal to thousands of women every year right now, and we know that HPV vaccines prevent HPV, thus preventing 90+% of cervical cancer cases.

Have you actually compared?I typically get 5m accuracy on my iPhone and iPad with the built in GPS sensor and it always agrees with the GNC-250XL I have in the panel.You could check out some of the EFB apps out there, a few of them have scratch pad pages.  Of course feature availability may depend on your tablet, not sure what you have.&gt;Is it normal for a flight school not to have a handheld onboard their planes?Yep.  In most cases, it's just one more shitty radio.  The thing to remember is that you get maaaybe 4-5 miles useful range unless you have a bubble canopy.  I found that I have to put whoever I want to hear me off my left wing in order to get the best range.They're not bad to have, but also remember to keep them charged.  I check mine every so often - and use it occasionally to listen to traffic if I'm just hanging out at the airport.
At the end of WM30, Bryan was posing with the titles. At one point, he dropped to his knees in the middle of the ring and lifted both belts in the air triumphantly. The hard camera panned slowly out. It was looking like it would be one of the most iconic shots in WWE history.Suddenly, a big sign that said "JAG THINDH" was hoisted up by some fan right in the middle of the audience, blocking the hard cam's view of Bryan simultaneously ruining one iconic image and creating another.

Apply your last paragraph's logic to your own time and see the eye opening magic that will occur. I've seen enough of it that I don't think it will help me personally to dredge up examples purely for your benefit and edification.

The amount of time spent writing your response to me could have been used to expand your experiences in this arena.

Dude...thats essentially the entire point of Art. How can you be so confident and so lacking in a very basic understanding of the thing you're talking about? 
Yeah, because the taunting vegans face is totally equivalent to the systemic racism and oppression that blacks experienced under Jim Crow. Are you serious? This is why people hate vegans.

Being a Bayern fan, I'm proud of what the team accomplished. Yeah there's a small chance we will make it to the UCL final, but I'm proud of what we've done with all these injuries. However I'd be a little disappointed if we were in the same situation without the injuries. I just hope we make appropriate changes and transfers this summer. Overall I'm content with where we are at now. I just think we should start finding a Ribery and Robben replacement as well as a another striker to help Lewandowski carry the load. If we sell Dante, and fix our defensive struggles against the counter, we will be fine next year.I think the team did well this season, if it weren't for the injuries to our key players, we would be in a better position.
So if he wasn't destroying the roster the team would be better than 10-6? I fail to see your logic. No eye for talent, what about that rookie WR last season? He's had 2 drafts (which, drafts are kind of crap shoots most times anyway) so not a lot of time to actually judge talent. The key, I think, is your hate for his offense. Your opinion is starting off negative to anything he does simply because you dislike him/his offense. Cheer up man. 
Damn, I never realized how much I kinda want that. He lives in New York and when he went to the Gyro stand I thought it looked tasty. Then again he looks like the type of guy who isn't a harsh critic on food according to what he has said on GG. 
So you do acknowledge that reddit has racist people, with top comments?What is so crazy about an idea of racist people capitalizing on a situation to further their racist ideology? Just read the comments of some of the main videos.
You can also use him like this: you are facing an all fire team. You bring eshir to tank and 3 water nukes with lower hp. Because the water monsters are all strong vs fire, the enemy fire monsters will all target eshir, so the low hp of your water nukes doesn't matter.    Also, besides tanking eshir has some insane dig output
Jokasteve, GM for TL said no when asked on his stream. Apparently the scheduling didn't work out. Hai from C9 is doing a meet up in one of the islands, though, so maybe you can see him!
At the end of the day. You have to ask yourself what sort of person is going to want to turn up and be a member of the audience? It's going to be the most shrill and indignant.I'll agree that shrill emotional indignation is all too common these days though. I think the internet breeds it.

This is the part that I didn't get either. Suddenly there's a notice about how my free trial of Textra has ended -- when I installed it, I don't recall anything about the app being in a "free trial" mode. Claiming that I was in some sort of trial period and now it's time to pony up or continue with ad support is a misleading move.
Perhaps this would be a good read for you: https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/features/2015/3/race-performance-ratings-explained--australia---cornering.html&gt;One particularly interesting aspect of this graph is how highly McLaren's Jenson Button (black line) scores throughout the race, especially relative to the Mercedes drivers. Despite struggling for outright pace, the Briton ended the race with the fourth-highest Cornering Rating, behind only Massa, Hamilton and Rosberg. 
Oh man...what if they bring back the gibberish voices and he gets to be one of them? He's already a voice in A Hat in Time, why not Yooka-Laylee? Really though, all those green-screens, probably Fireworks music video or another Malkovich. Or something *completely* different.

As a member of a sorority, frats and date rape are undoubtedly connected.  Of course not all (or even many) fraternity men are rapists.  Nor are all rapists frat bros.  But will you ever see me drinking the frat's alcohol at one of their parties?  Not a chance.  At my school, they most definitely have spiked their mixed drinks with nyquil before, and they almost always use much higher proof alcohol so they can claim "a drink only has 2 shots in it".  Most of the women I know who have been sexually assaulted have had their assailant be a frat bro or someone at one of the fraternity parties.

The second verse makes it clear that the water is part of the earth (1st verse).&gt;The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. 
I hope they put bullet proof glass on that thing. So many drunk kids are going to throw everything they have at it when they're drunk. Plus the occasional BB gun shots.
I always feel sorry for Jehovah's Witnesses on a hot Saturday or Sunday walking around neighbourhoods dragging poor little kids behind them to preach to people who really don't want to see or hear these guys. Glad you got out and can have a life.
Love it, love it, love it ... a lot of people are gonna be happy seeing this including me :) well done on everything you've achieved to get your new home.
Heh, I'm on 360. I posted this because I just did it two days ago at the lighthouse Gang Attack while a player in a Lazer (who had gone off the radar and nearly got me on his first pass) strafed and strafed with guns and rockets. He finally parachuted down and sat on a hill shooting. He must have been PISSED when I killed him. Then a second hunter nailed me when I fucked up and edged out of my cover to where he could see me.
According to Wookiepedia, a lot of ships from the EU like the Decimator and Tie Defender are canon again now that Disney has included them in "Star Wars: Commander" (its an android/iphone game). Disney also put in the AT-MPs from The Force Unleashed.I know that the HWK and YT-2400 appeared in the background of episode IV, so currently I think the only rebel ship that isn't canon is the e-wing, which will probably be retconned in episode VII anyway.
I think it's safe to say that he meant that in the attacker's mind it's *inviting*, not that the women themselves are inviting it.One of the meanings of the wird "inviting" is enticing". The attackers may see a single woman as an enticing target. That doesn't mean that the woman herself was inviting the person to attack herPeople are getting caught up in words to try and greate an uproar.I mean, maybe his words were a bit inviting of uproar, but he certainly wasn't asking people to get into an uproar ;)
Seeing such little action occur in terms of trades it doesn't really surprise me this was the outcome. If the first picks were a shit show we would have made out like bandits.
I think the question really is: Why does my brain take things that have happened in my life personally?There is no force that is targeting you specifically for negative events.

I had self-inflicted thinlogic. I believed that I was naturally thin, well healthy weight, and that watching what you ate was for women and going to the gym was stupid. I believed that I could eat what I wanted and not put on weight. It wasn't until I stopped exercising 6hrs a day that I found this hypothesis was incorrect.
Right on. Yeah, I mean, you're not really giving up a huge piece of your roster and you're presumably improving at RP. Seems to be a fair trade that improves your team.
&gt; From the outside, he just looks like the edgy kid who wants to fit in and everyone is just making fun of him.He's seems more like the edgy kid who has an unwarranted belief in his own superiority.  I don't think he's trying to fit in to /r/drama.
That's a good move set. I like the addition of Dragonite...I think I'm going to revive this team now haha. I went through like 15 iterations trying to make it work with full TR, but I'm just gonna abandon that now haha. Trying to do too much and TR is decidedly meh in singles.
Haven't played DayZ, so I'm not sure if its relevant, but in Planetside 2, I saw little to no difference in performance between the i5/i7. I did notice significant improvement when running the cpu oc'd versus stock, mainly because the engine is poorly optimized for multicore usage. 
She probably has some cute idea that "I can do hair! And like, makeup and stuff" part-time and make loads of money. Or that she's magically going to become some kind of hairstylist to the stars, work when she wants and support her kid that way.

I only ever do it by myself now. Kind of a personal communion once in a blue moon, when I feel the need to shake things up and have a little adventure. Always outdoors, usually up in the mountains hiking around on a quiet weekday if possible. 
My mum just retired from the NHS last year after 35 years. The ward was chronically understaffed, nurses being forced to look after way more patients than they could handle, which reduced the standard of care. The matron asked her to sign up to the NHS bank service before she left, and every single day she gets messages asking for bank staff in hospitals within a 20 mile radius. Every single day.
I'm the Oakland Raiders.I mean,  they kind of suck, but I'm a 5'3" chick, so I wouldn't make a very good football player,  let alone be a good entire NFL team. We're good to go, I guess?

Substitute your favorite hard liquor. Beer doesn't work, it just makes you gassy and fat. No soda pop either. Cocktails are okay but keep the sugar to a minimum. Sugar causes stress.

If you don't care about spoilors : beginning of the game is the real iosefka, she's cool and gives you her period blood. After you kill vicar amelia, she's replaced by an imposter that transforms her (and everyone that you send to the clinic)  into those blue aliens. You can fight the imposter by going deeper into the clinic,although there is a reason why you might want to wait until after beating a certain boss in the game to do so.

Thanks for that! I hope your Lakers rise to the top with us. I'm jealous of the history (read that as rings) that the Lakers have. Gonna be super said to see Kobe go too. To many childhood heroes are on track to retire over the next few years.  Best of luck to you all too. 
You're not asking the right question, imo. I think it's about how you do it. Take the alcohol out. Then figure it out for yourself; there's no right answer to this.

I actually logged in here again to respond to your post hours later.  I've been in your shoes to an extent.  In fact, having told somebody off and feeling guilty about it, even though I'm not sure I did the wrong thing, I seem especially to be lacking compassion. But we can feel compassion for ourselves, especially since it wasn't our intention to be cruel, as well as be compassionate toward those who've been rude to us, knowing now how likely little control they had over it.  Hope that's a help.
I hate to break it to you, but in some parts of Texas everyone speaks Spanish and you're the odd one out if you don't. Also, they probably have functional English skills but are significantly better in Spanish, therefore they default to it in the office.

Death dealer, land, pass. If he swings out, you can trade favorably.  If he doesn't swing, you are super happy. It dodges his removal and Stubborn Denial. If he taps out to play a Surrey you can trade with that too or just kill it next turn. Your other creatures just trade 1-1 with his board and you have the life to take some hits whilst grinding out advantage with Deathdealer. Edit: I'm a scrub who's mad 'cause I'm bad. I thought we had a land. Anafenza is probably correct, then. 
Actually it's not. Maybe if you bothered to check my comment history you'd see that I am CLEARLY not advertising anything. I was really looking for somewhere to buy movie t-shirts. I posted this question in one other sub for the same reason I posted it here.
Yeah I was rerolling uniques and I got one of Doctor Stranges uniques i didnt have yet and it didnt count that either. Guess i gotta loot it off the ground to count
I think MIDA and Thorn both play pretty similarly (in a defensive posture.) With MIDA, though, you gain a lot more awareness from Third Eye, and better navigate (to engage a nearby threat or to adjust map pressure) than you can with Thorn thanks to Agility +2.I also think Thorn is harder to use close quarters, but that's just me. Thorn does hit harder, and the burn gives it 'very strong poke,' which hugely increases your threat and map pressure.I do better with MIDA, but I more than respect the Thorn.

Mine is a low budget maniac, walks around shirtless wearing a black bull mask. He lives near Mackenzie Airfield but he often drives his black Picador/El Camino into LS to cause some chaos. The only things he carries around are a sawed-off shotgun and a crowbar because, well, he's hardcore. I reset his bank account every time I'm not using my main character. He won't play heists or complex jobs because he ain't got time for that shit; he likes to go on rampages.
Please don't try to see it as a competition. I know it hurts, and I know it's hard, but it isn't a competition. You both fill very different roles in his life. I say this as someone who is lucky enough to have four parents. My folks divorced when I was 2. I love my step-dad, but he's not my dad. They are both very important to me, but in very different ways. When I was very young my parents tried to get me to play favorites and it was terrible. So please don't see it as a competition. Just keep on being your awesome self. Your son loves you, and he'll let you know on his own time.
Seriously. Yes FOX and CNN are full of shit, but half the time on /r/worldnews the articles are sensationalist or written with a very prevalent bias. People seem to think they are free from this just because they are on Reddit..
Squire is an auto presser that chooses one person out of all the people using it every 60 seconds to be the one to it will auto click for. You can set a certain number and leave it on forever if you want, hoping it chooses you and while you are chosen the number you choose is gotten down to by the button itself. I've had it open for a few hours now but then quit messing with it.
The right kind of heels? Super sexy. The way I see it, heels are supposed to make your body look good. If you wear heels that are so high you can't walk correctly in them, you're defeating the purpose!
And for everyone one of those things, there's a shitload of things we DON'T know fully about the universe. Easiest example being 50 years ago, most scientists agreed the universe's expansion was slowing down, but recent information has shown the opposite is actually true. The expansion speed was increasing. But let's use your idiotic digestive system analogy. When I was a kid I could eat vast amounts of dairy products and have no issues. But a couple years ago, I became lactose intolerant and cannot eat much dairy products anymore. The digestive system changed. 
Yeah exactly. My guess though is he'll say Mike Conley was out or if he plays, too injured to guard Curry. He was saying the Warriors have no answer for the Griz front line and that'll be negated by the Griz's smalls not being able to keep up with Curry and Klay. I'm sure he'll have some excuse whether it's Conley or just saying their front court isn't playing up to their ability or something. He won't admit the Warriors style is how you win now. He can't. 
This would require remodelling a lot of the ships. For example, the Vulture has four utility mounts but they're all on the top side of the craft, some ships have the utility mounts only toward the back, like the Cobra.It's not a bad idea, but the players would need more choice in where they put the modules around the ship. Maybe the ships could have multiple utility mounts all over the ship but could only utilise a certain number of them.

OK, loaded a new survival game, no mods.  Its definitely linked to the skeleton updates.  When on the ground your 'magic hand' doesn't float/wave so it tracks where the surface is.   If you jink around a bit while flying, you can get it to 'sync' with the surface momentarily.The falling animation has the hand pretty steady so it follows that it works here as well.Edit: 1st person view is OK as workaround, but damn is it annoying to have that limitation.

&gt;Robert should have scoured the isles after Balon Greyjoy rose against him, Cersei thought. He smashed their fleet, burned their towns, and broke their castles, but when he had them on their knees he let them up again. He should have made another island of their skulls. That was what her father would have done, but Robert never had the stomach that a king requires if he hopes to keep peace in the realm.

No one is forcing them into poverty. Most poor people in the inner cities do that to themselves.Poor People, mind you. Not blacks or Mexicans. Poor people in general perpetuate poverty on them selves because they refuse to work hard to find a way out. For some reason they feel like it should be given to them just because they were born into an unfortunate situation.
Oh yeah, no, once the namecalling starts, all bets are off. I would fully expect to lose my job for calling a customer "stupid." Was the word stupid actually used?I have had stupid customers and I became impatient with them because it's been a long day and I've dealt with the same stupidity over and over all day. But I do not use the word stupid. I may talk to customers in a tone where someone would accuse me of calling them stupid, but never do I use the word stupid. When you deal with idiots all day it's kind of inevitable.I'd have to know more about the customer and the situation before passing judgment. While it may not seem like the customer was rude to YOU, it is quite different when you're an employee and cannot escape these people.
Yeah but usually not for the patients but the visitors. Hospital near me has a menu for patients to order from which is very small.

&gt;with a degree in physics you won't have problems finding an industry jobRelative to what? Physics is a self-filtered degree in which people really only go into physics if they have reasonable confidence in their abilities so I think it obscures whether the "high" employment (which I don't think is actually factual) is due to the degree or to the individuals themselves. 
I'm always surprised the Big East or ACC didn't take Louisville or Cincy in the 90's. Louisville had the run with Howard Schnellenberger and Cincy had some basketball tradition. Heck the big east could have saved itself and made itself a decent football league and kept the basketball schools fairly happy (even though after watching the 30 for 30 on the big east they didn't really respect the football schools.)
Yeah, I feel the same way (in a way), I wouldn't see any other tribute band to be honest, but I guess it is the closest I will ever get to hearing this music live that sounds close to the real thing. Unless Gilmour gets a wild hare up his ass and calls up Roger and Nick and wants to do a final tour, which will never happen :)   or if he decides to come to the states!

i must say that since my long journey with entheogens and hallucinogens started years ago music will never be the same. I am a musician, play many instruments. I thought I knew and loved music before, but now I can be completely sober and I hear a certain song and its like I get transported to this time where everything was serene. I get goose bumps and little tickles up my spine.
I felt so bad for the Jazz...I thought they were one of the best teams not to win a championship and it was because of one of the greatest franchises...then as soon as they have their shot, the Jazz got old

That is not what layaway actually means though, it means they lay the item aside for you.Whatever stores do now and call it "layaway", if they are not holding the physical item, they're no longer doing what "layaway" originally meant, they're just using that term for some kind of payment plan.

If the refs aren't going to control the game to cut out the bush league plays then sometimes a player has to take it into his own hands. It's not like Dunleavy doesn't do shady stuff like this all the time.If the other junk on Dunleavy gets called like it should have been then there's no issue.Giannis can't be doing that, but you can't let someone keep taking cheap shots at your guys with no repercussions.
Kebab's are not really American, buffalo wings, or hot wings are definitely American though. There is a thing called City chicken in New  York which is like a deep fried pork kebab. Colin could also be jetlaged/hungover. I do believe kebabs are Greek in origin they were called firedogs, but all cultures have some form of grilled meat on a stick.  The words Shish Kebab are turkish, with Shish begin the Turkish word for skewer.

Just ordered the Green Tea Sleeping Pack earlier today, since Innisfree was also having that buy 10 masks, get 10 free deal, hahaDo you think just adding the sleeping pack will get my skin moisturized in the AM though? That's the main reason why I was also thinking about adding another moisturizer/essence/milky lotion/etc.  I've been having this problem where dry patches will appear under my nose/on the underside of my nose and by my mouth later on in the day after moisturizing in the morning, and sometimes there will be flaking around my breakouts too.. 
Well, hmmm, the season has some good episodes, like "Brother's Little Helper", "Treehouse of Horror X", "Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder", but the worst are "Kill the Alligator and Run", "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge" and "Bart to the Future"
Community? Try around the world. Haiti gets hit with a devastating catastrophe and a church makes a big deal out of delivering charity to them: new Bibles. I hear a lot of Christians make a big deal about how their religion is responsible for so much charity but atheists aren't, but the difference is that atheism doesn't make up so much of our identity that we plaster it on everything we do. Even /r/atheism's well-known donation drives to Doctors Without Borders started as a competition with /r/Christianity.Moral people don't need to call attention to their morality. They just do it.
No, he's been very critical of the Houthis once he realized that all they know is the way of the gun. I'm not sure when exactly did he defect.But yea all his family is Houthi. He's probably related to Mohammad Al-Bokhaiti who is a spokesman for the Houthis. You know the guy who's always storming off or getting kicked off the air for spouting very obvious lies.Edit: he defected before December 2014 maybe even a lot before that.
Your dad is a total dick. Ignoring the legal issues of sending somebody's financial data over email, if a company doesn't provide a service, badgering them over and over again will not magically make it happen.

There is nothing saying that DayZ has to have X number of concurrent players at any given time.  This is not a death knell.I have watched the mod die no less than 5 times.  Just last night the mod got another update, people still play it and its still being developed.What I'm trying to say is:  ignore the steam charts, they do nothing but tell you that people are doing something else for a change.  They have no bearing on the future of dayz what so ever.
I've noticed an exponential increase in facepalms this past couple of months while browsing around certain subs. It's not a nice time to be black on Reddit :/
TDEE plus about a thousand calories a week, and a little spoon of creatine in the morning. 50/30/20 split of carbs/fat/protein, all food, no powders. I eat lots of fruit, meals that I like; I like cooking, and I like eating. Keeping in shape just means making sure to plan for pizza night, and eating enough on other days. I like MyFitnessPal and how it ties in with the MapMyRun app - makes life easy. Have been doing this setup for about two months after keeping a deficit for a couple in order to lose a few pounds.
Car sales Manager here.Not everybody pulls those tactics but I can tell you one thing, it works. Its super shady and I do not practice it but many days I wish I did. Just please remember that we all have kids to feed and just because you saved a couple hundred dollars over the next five years could cost me 500$ in the next 5 seconds. You cant blame us for trying to get the most out of our units. Especially when no ones buying.
How are you attributing negative traits to my speech? We're both using the same speech, but with different phrasing. You say, "Not one of us is "perfect." We're adequate. And that's not a bad thing." I say, "be yourself."Your joy of arguing seems to cloud your comprehension.
Seems quite apparent that Chip got Bradford so he would be in position to get MM.  Now we're stuck with the kid with one ACL, no 4th rounder, and no 2nd rounder next year.  Plan: Failed.  
This reminded me. I found domhnall gleesons personal reddit account once during his ama.  He had once shared his theory about what the new star wars was about. Probably nothing but it was interesting. 
How do you know I was downvoted? I'm fairly new to reddit so I don't know what all the down voting implies/how to know if I was. Also does it really even matter?
That was the moment that cemented my love for her. I completely understood Raven's comments and confessionals before and after the event but that was perfecto. 
I wake up in my bed around midnight to realize that I won the lottery, so I get dressed and pack up all my stuff.  In the morning, I go to the nearest car dealership and buy the first car off the lot and drive back to my apartment.  I throw all my stuff in the car and just drive.  And I don't stop until I get to the other side of the country and just park on the beach and lie down in the back of my car, perfectly content.  This is the point where I wake up and remember that I'm three years into a degree I'm not motivated to finish with debt I'll probably never be able to pay off.  
I gotta admit I'm not a realtor whatsoever; I was just funnin' the guy above me to make him think he might have been played. See? Just a joke… no need to investigate further. Please, don't investigate. 
If (in theory) the film is the equivalent of the audience reading a briefing, then any reference to the agent's parents would of course use the same pseudonym. In other words, the grave doesn't actually say that, it just shows us that from our perspective, since we don't know his name.That's also why he uses his ' real name' when introducing himself -- he actually uses cover names just like you'd expect, but as the audience we wouldn't be fooled anyway, so we hear "Bond. James Bond."
I have a few friends who have maids come once/twice a month, and I believe they only pay around $170/ish each time (they live in small apts though). If you're going to be working soon, I don't see why not get the maid if it will save you guys the extra headache at the moment since you'll be bringing in cash in a few months. Suggestions: buy a robotic vacuum (srsly the best thing ever), cook really easy/simple meals, meal prep for the week, do laundry together
A lack of stability and a lack of proportion are two very different things.  The meanings are quite distinct.  You asked if there was a better way to communicate what you said you intended and I provided it.  I'd have to assume continued use is willful conflation of similar but unlike things.&gt; Do you think that a test is only meaningful if it assesses whether the characters and story are good?  ...it [doesn't] claim to.What is the point of a test whereupon the conclusion of the assessment, you have gained no knowledge?
I'd recommend either the late 13 or 14. The early 13 is much less powerful, whereas the other two are almost identical. The discrete GPU doesn't even turn on unless required, and is great for those times when you need that extra oomph (eg: 4K monitor, Photoshop, games, 3D stuff). Unless something is requiring it, it won't draw extra power, or change your mac in any way. It's just for when it's needed. EDIT: no MacBook Pro has user-upgradable RAM anymore except for the ancient 2012 non retina 13", which I strongly advise against. Go for the late 2013, as the early 2013 had a really weak GPU. 
I had that issue the first time. 4-5 times later now and its just another nasty med. Just keep trying, chase it with some Gatorade or something and you can do it!Heck, I have a endoscopy the 14th, and I can't stand enemas, and instead am doing the full prep. Easier to me to drink a jug of that stuff than do the other thing...
I think you're right, and very reasonable, except for the part about the "racist narrative."  I don't really see how what was said was racist.  It wasn't saying people are criminals BECAUSE they're black, which would be racist.
Sorry to fail to provide an argument against it.  We seem to be on the same page.  I guess if there were a "MRM argument against the bechdel test" it would involve approaching gender representation in media as a zero sum game where problematic representation of women meant that there were no issues with the representation men face, or as grounds for attacking individual movies- neither of which I sense are positions that you actually hold.
&gt; My fitness palLet me blow your mind for a second. I swear I am in my twenties, but I do not own any sort of 'smart device'. I don't even have a home phone.Not sure if the website itself is any easier to input data into though. I'll give it a quick glance.
I was one of those people who had a beef with the daisy dollars. Paying to get your own money back on a mandatory service rubbed me the wrong way. I agree that people should be able to use it if its convenient for them, but make it optional, not just another way to siphon more money out of us when we already pay so much. 
Nothing in that quote contradicts anything I have said. All I said is drunk plus sex does not equal rape the must be another factor that removes the ability to consent. Being very/severely drunk can but drunk does not automatically equally rape.
If you're being serious that doesn't change the culture of where you grow up. If people in Korea tied their shoes a certain way, Jwaow wouldn't just because he is Korean. He grew up in Scandinavia and would learn things the Scandinavian way, not the Korean way.
I have posted this before, but I know how things sometimes just roll right out without much of a filter.Eighth Spanish class, one student, Colin (name not changed) says to me "Hey still_stunned have you ever even had sex?"  Well as you can imagine the kids are fairly comfortable with me that they would dare even ask jokingly. My response with zero hesitation was "why don't you ask your mom tonight Colin."Dead silence in the room before everybody burst out laughing. I have to admit I was a bit nervous that the next day I was going to get called to the office and reamed out but nothing ever happened.

I think it's weird that she would offer those ideas about someone else's kid. Plus, depending on the age of the kid, tantrums might not be in the cards anymore. (I'd also guess that "blowing it" means he wouldn't even *get* to the concert, and therefore wouldn't be able to "bother the musicians.")
Your works are well worth the time invested, you have amazing talent.  Your Joan of Arc painting is one of the most beautiful paintings I have ever seen - unbelievable.  Edit: Is Joan of Arc in one of your published works, if so which one?
Nice job! I can't say I'm surprised there was a message, but I am a bit surprised someone found it so quickly. :-) (I knew it was very likely to have a hidden message, but I was not told what -- a bit of a gamble.)
Jasper and Amethyst are both varieties of Quartz. They're the same basic mineral, but are subject to different types of impurities (or sometimes in the case of Amethysts, irradiation).
Uh, if you invest time in a game to acquire something only to lose it due to a bug within the game itself, then you're definitely owed something. The fanboy logic that led you to the conclusion that an 8 day wait time is acceptable eludes me. 
I would start with moving around. You don't have to run. Just go for walks. Try and walk an hour a day around the forest maybe. 2 bottles of vodka a weekend is a shit ton.  Probably around 3500 calories in two fifths of smirnoff (that is if your only drinking two fifths I am not sure). If you could cut this down at all it would definitely help. Not only reducing your calorie intake, but increasing your activity level. You might as well try and get over all of this at once because it will be several months of being cranky as shit or an even longer extended period. At that point I myself would probably start meditating in order to tell myself that I am alright and this is for the better.
As I said the main reason I'm doing this is to learn myself, so this would be self-defeating for me. I like the idea in general, but I won't learn if I let others do it for me!
That's for server input. This is more an issue with escaping for output, which if handled incorrectly, would allow Bobby's mom to load a malicious JavaScript file on the page and affect other users of the site :P
&gt; Based on my skill ranks, I am gullible and I have no knowledge of anything, so even though as a player it is suspicious that these strangers are celebrating the end of the world and are offering me wine in the middle of nowhere, my character sees nothing wrong with it "Shut up and give me the wine"!I didn't realize common sense was a skill, and that you had an int score of 7.
Thanks for the Reply! I know I shouldn't compare myself to my sister, but sometimes I just can't help it. She has always been someone I admired and looked up too. She influenced many of my interest and hobbies today. I'm glad, I'm not the only one that is or went through something like this. I just needed someone to understand and be able to give insight, because I can't really rely on the people in my life.
Why doesnt everyone volunteer to have their taxes raised before they volunteer other peoples money. Just because someone else has more money than you doesnt mean they dont contribute, or that they owe more to society, or that its fair.Lead by example, dont wait for the gov to raise taxes, just voluntarily send more to the government, and maybe those rich fat cats will follow your noble lead.
My 6 year old Nebelung walks around the hallway at nice crying like this, but much more higher pitched. If he is out of food, you know he will be sitting in front of his bowl crying like this for as long as it takes to get fed. 
If you check out a map of Asian population in America you'll see that they tend to choose the most developed states. And those places have higher salaries. So, whites aren't really doing worse.
Korea is very far ahead player wise. The best Western players can compete, yes, but the sheer number of quality Korean players dwarfs the West. They've lost like 40 players to other regions and they're still arguably the strongest region. NA or EU would be absolutely crippled if that happened to them.
Ugh, whyyy...I really hope this is just extreme dedication to a movie role, and he's gonna drop it again.Also, I almost made a tpyo, calling it a "movie roll." Lmao
A majority of my posts is here haha! I love the friendly atmosphere and sometimes just being able to talk about whatever is on my mind is really nice and therapeutic.
There are 2 sides of the story. The other one being that Brazil is a growing nation that needs energy. It is trying to reduce its increasing demand's dependance on coal and other sources that cause pollution. Noone wants that. Nuclear plants are not cheap nor easy to set up. They have some but it isnt enough. Not every country has large suitable areas or ideal conditions where they can have solar farms or wind farms.Also, dams so something else, they help in droughts. They, to an extent, help control floods.The Brazilian government, however corrupt as they may be, would provide this energy to its citizens. Citizens who, when not in large cities, are living in darker ages.It is not small culture vs big bad government. It is "The Needs of the Many Outweigh the Needs of the Few"
Hm, I guess it's something I just wouldn't be able to understand. I mean I've never even tried alcohol so I don't really "get" how anything could alter how you think or feel in any real way.

Not just Vancouver, when the Edmonton Oilers were in the playoffs years ago, people got drunk and destroyed shit every night of the playoffs. The Oilers players had to make a message to everyone to stop trashing the city.
Probably never.  How often does someone get shot, when you were "just walking by there"? Again, probably never. I mean if someone were shot every week or so in a public place by hitmen, then perhaps. But most shootings are domestic and far away from the places I visit.
well. this seems to have ended in good way. although the fight to beat the depression has just begun. hopefully she will find support to get over it this time before it gets out of hand again! mom giving us a sign about her situation is a good sign to start with.
Ehhhh, greenlight and early access aren't that big of a deal, unless for some reason you're forced to sift through them one by one. I actually found a great game, among many, that i never would have likely known about otherwise. "Dungeon of the Endless", had a great trailer, loved the style, and concept, and the risk seemed worth it. And it was. I found it in my suggested games list. i didn't have to sift through a bunch of crap. it was the third game in my queue. So just because there are lots of bad or unfinished cash grabs in the shop does not necessarily mean it is a bad system. It's only a bad system if you are consistently mislead and overcharged, in which case, maybe you should examine your purchases more closely, rather than blame Valve?
Clear water/good videos or pictures are going to be tough to find haha. Kudos to anyone that gets publishable video/pictures from the Rio Negro. I ended up throwing away 90% of what I shot underwater, and most of what I kept is a red blur.  We actually had a renown professional aquatic photographer with us on the trip this year and he said it was the most difficult assignment he's ever had.There's a ton of variability from location to location and out of the dozen sites we spent time at only a quarter of them had aggregations of aquatic plants and only two of which were comparable in coverage to what I'm used to seeing in the streams of NA. It's also worth mentioning that seasonality plays a huge role in the landscape and microenvironments of the river.
they more or less killed him when they captured him. They had to know it when they put him in the van. The fourth stop was probably them checking to see if he was dead or not yet.
They actually physically measured the outcome variable of adrenaline increase after they gave kids sugar. They found that kids that ingested large doses of sugar had more adrenaline upon measuring it. Again, this is in relation to *behavior change* (not hyperactivity, which is a component of a psychological disorder). Comparing behavior disturbance/change in kids to hyperactivity is kind of like comparing being sad to being clinically depressed - different constructs. That's why we can say sugar intake can be related to one and not the other. 
There's some nasty meta-data bugs on iTunes.  For some reason all the tracks on my Beauty and the Beast album will show the wrong lyrics, and I've attempted to replace them too many times to count, including removing the songs, deleting them, readding them, etc.  I suspect this is a similar bug.
This is not really a quality post. This is one page of a story, and it shows essentially no growth whatsoever. Your title is misleading unless you're referring to the whole story, in which case you should have linked the whole thing. If it's only viewable for payed subscribers, then say that up front so people know. I'm not really sure what your purpose here is, if you're trying to sell BE story club subscriptions it's not really working, and if you're trying to submit quality content, it's definitely not working because all of your posts have reports on them. I'm not sure what you can do to increase your post quality, but this kind of stuff is not really working.
Almost perfect roll except for 'Who's Next?' I'm not sure if it's worth rerolling just for another fast reload perk.Personally I've got Aggressive Ballistics, Counterbalance, Field Scout and Feeding Frenzy which to me is a perfect roll.
It may be worth pointing out that even though the most common games follow this patterns it is quite possible for the corp to have the advantage in the third stage. RP/HB Glacier against an aggresive criminal or anarch you would favour the Corp if the game drags on. And Glacier is getting more and more popular.
Yes. You will want level 10 for all the classes, to unlock all the class cards, at least to do the daily quests where you have to win with specific classes.There are class specific cards (cards only available to their respective classes) and neutral cards (available to all classes) that you use to build decks.
I think I should win because I actually will use them rather than have them sitting on the shelf for decoration and have the box collect dust. Also because my little brother loves using Ike and he wants his amiibo. He cried when he couldn't get it when it was released and I somehow felt responsible. It would make him very happy if he ended up having Ike. I just need Wii Fit Trainer so my collection of the characters I use and train are complete :)
[](/fluttereyebrow) I can accept that they do good work. Just don't expect me to love them for it. At best I will snuggle a cuddly one when it murders something nastier.
You see him trying to pin the tail on Judith.  I see him attempting to get her to admit that she was swayed the wrong way.  Simple as that.  Stewart is too smart to blame her entirely.  Come on now.She'll never admit to any fault because no one will ever admit to being used as a puppet.  Human being egos work against that.
Well, let's not forget all the administrative rebranding costs if the flag IS changed. Our flag is all over the place. In documents, on uniforms, flying on flagpoles... it's $25m just for the two referenda and the flag committee. It wouldn't be *only* 25 million to change the flag, that is certain.
Definitely struggling at [5-FUCKING-THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR DOING NOTHING](https://www.patreon.com/Cr1TiKaL). This is the only Patreon I've seen which doesn't even put up the bullshit "rewards" you get for donating 10 bucks a month or whatever.
Puede que tengas razón, pero pienso que la dimisión debió llegar antes, hubiese sido un mejor momento... Casi que hubiese sido una catarsis. Pienso que llega tarde, ahora, pensando un poco con calma, creo que es algo que estaba en su cabeza desde hace tiempo... Igual la situación lo estaba superando (que por otra parte me parece normal)
What does it all mean? When it says, the forgotten six must not exist to suffer... does it mean the 6 OTHER clones that were part of Les Enfantes Terribles? They could retcon MGS1 a bit where Liquid told Solid that they murdered them in the womb etc. I dunno, what do you think these Omega videos mean? Are the six who were forgotten "those who don't exist"? EDIT: I'm an idiot, I thought Kojima released that haha. And I don't really think that 6 embryos are making a comeback, it just clicked as the only other time the number 6 was important in MGS.

I don't think so. I am not going to stop any of my 24/7 accounts, and we will see what happens. Keep in mind that one of my accounts contains the words 'CoCRaidingBot' in the name and constantly advertises the bot on global. If one of my accounts gets banned, I'll bet its that one first, and I will keep you guys updated with anything that I hear. For now, I'd say its as safe as it has ever been.
Quad cramped up hard right at the base of that last hill... Made it pretty miserable getting up, but a few salt pills, water and stretching and I was able to grit it and bear it. 
I'd argue that the importance of GNU is not the code but the philosophy.  Linux is amazing but I wouldn't give a crap about it if it was proprietary.  It's not about giving credit to the FSF.  Calling it GNU/Linux is a way a clarifying what's important about it.  Android for example is not GNU/Linux and in a way proves that running the Linux kernel is not enough to make something awesome.  I guess what I'm trying to say is GNU is a symbol for something greater but like all symbols it has a different meaning to everyone. I'm not saying you have to call it GNU/Linux.
As someone else said, you need to grow a polite spine.She still thinks she can boss you around because you're trying to placate her like you always have.   When you politely and firmly stand up for yourself, she'll probably respect you more tbh.
I.... Don't know how to feel. Let's just hope coop is the real deal. Maybe the GM's know something we don't? Somebody on the radio was talking about Leonard's shoulder being a concern.
of the first few teams, would you want to play for any of them other than the silver and black. EZ question for him to answer. But sad he wont be a raider
Buy the skin, there are players that love teams even tho they don't play anymore. I mean, after all is a team you like. I'd pay full price for a C9 ward and have it forever not just 1 split.
I always remembered that for me (GMT +10) it came out at around 4 pm. So it's got a solid while to be able to come out still, and I don't remember the info coming out beforehand but maybe I just missed it.
I like the idea of a combo win because Damia is a higher cost commander in my mind so i'll need mana ramp and utilize her draw power ability to get the cards for a combo
I disagree with you so much. This play shows what these combos add to the skill gap.Not going to hold your opinion against you, obviously. I know button glitches are contentious and dubious, but I don't think Halo 2 would've been the game it was without them.
There's no exact moment where Toriyama wanted it to end, it just continuedmuch longer than he ever anticipated. He only expected it to last a year, but its popularity had risen so much couldn't end it. And that's basically the pattern that followed up until the end of Buu saga, that's when he felt as an author the story was complete. Toei obviously had other plans with GT but beyond character illustrations and the name he didn't contribute much.
The Irvington farmers market usually has lots of non-food items for sale more info here: http://irvingtongardenclub.com/events/farmers-market/  Other than that Indy has plenty of craft and vintage fairs that may be like what you're looking for, a few that come to mind are the southside vintage marketplace :http://www.southportantiquemall.net/the-southside-vintage-marketplace.html and the Indy arts &amp; vintage marketplace: http://www.antiquehelper.com/upcoming-events/495

/u/professor_tappensac gave me [this #16 helmet]( http://imgur.com/Np41W5Q)  , knitted by his lovely wife. I wore it to my first game, Browns v Panthers in 2010. We won. I wear it today.

I never *claimed* to be making the case that biology alone is determinative. That seems to be your central misunderstanding.And The Bell Curve is a thoroughly reliable and well-sourced work; the fact that it grates against certain far-left ideologies is not its fault.
Fallout 2 if you want the classic style. New Vegas if you like the newer versions. They can be played in pretty much any order story wise, but those are the best of each version.
Not undeclared; uninitialized integers. Generally, dynamically scoped languages can handle undeclared variables reasonably gracefully, but lexically scoped languages either require scoped bindings, or have to make up some weird scoping rules that nobody remembers and people then just get surprised. (I think Python may have had some weird scoping rules in the past...or maybe it was Ruby or JS?)
The hard truth is that it comes with experience and there is no formula that applies to all aircraft.That being said, what I do is typically:1) paint cockpit parts - I usually have them partially assembled, leaving out the instrument panel, control stick, and (if a jet) the ejection seat2) Install cockpit fully assembled (sans ejection seat if it's a jet) into the model, and assemble the wings/fuselage as normal. Assemble everything, leaving off propellers, antennae, landing gear, and weapons. Anything that you think you can knock off easily during painting is best left until final assembly unless there's no way around it. Some models, for instance, require you to install the landing gear before the "painting phase" would normally take place.3) Paint the model and all of its remaining "subassemblies" like weapons, landing gear, etc.4) Apply decals5) "Weathering phase"6) Final assembly7) Final clear coat, finish.

Put down the goddamned cheeseburgers and hit the fucking gym!  He brings out his drone with a camera, walks *all* the way down that path, sets up, flies around recording people who are minding their own business on a secluded beach, and he wants to act like *he's* the fucking victim?Fuck this perverted goddamned voyeur.Edit: Yes my comment is very harsh, please keep reading the conversation though.
With no luck, he'll share his opinions on the matter again.  They always do.That next time you'll have all these lovely responses to remember to throw back at him.
&gt; Alright. You just keep being awesome.Thanks, I intend to do so ;)&gt; It's your tact that could be much improvedThere's no nice way to bring up the subject of emotional abuse. I notice that you're not disagreeing with me on the emotional abuse issue. You just seem to have an issue with the way I worded my replies-semantics really. 
I get the frustration.   I have received message responses 3 WEEKS later asking to meet.  I'm never upset to get a late reply.. but if it's been weeks, why bother replying?  But since I'm one of the older BUMs on here... I always arrange dates during the work week before 6pm so my options are a lot slimmer due to schedules.

Ned wasn't stupid, he was just very ignorant to what the actual happenings of Kings Landing were, and dealt with things in a very traditional stand up kinda way. 
&gt; Basically by the time you'd be allowed in the locker room you'd have tits yourself.Bingo. Also, whether you're trans or not, if you're harassing other students you are going to be punished (and, I'm betting for trans students, they are going to be extra-monitored for acting up.)So if you're a hormonal teenage boy who isn't trans, and you decide you want to spend at bare minimum weeks or months convincing the school that you are actually trans, so that you can finally reach the girls' lockers and then be thrown out after your first peek at boobies because you act like a dickhead......well, then I hope it's worth it.and if you do all that and *don't* act like a dickhead, and are perfectly respectable and indistinguishable in behavior from the straight girls in there with you- then why does it matter?
MDJ punched MCW in the face, a few series later Dunleavy pushed Giannis and Giannis flopped then beelined across the court to MDJ to shoulder tackle him.
It's all preference. I prefer the "boring old box" design. Rounded edges make it more comfortable for sure, I don't agree with sharp box edges. But mods like the hanas, sigeleis, and custom hammonds and stuff.. they're sexy in my eyes. I don't like gaudy looking curvy mods. It's stylistic. Boxes also have more room to fit things in. If you want a dual battery mod, it's just something you have to live with.
I wish you guys would realize that this person knows full well how ridiculous what they're saying is, but that every time she says something, you guys feverishly pleasure yourselves to how stupid it is - spreading the link far and wide in the processShe's making money off you. Period. For the love of god, just drop it.
Don't know the music - sorry I'm a 50ish guy who is stuck with the music he sort of grew up with.  Happens to the best of us.    Vancouver can be a very wonderful city, with mountains, the ocean, etc.  However, it is very, very fucking expensive. One of the most expensive cities in N.A.    You can live down in the slums of the downtown Eastside in a little bed-sit room for fairly cheap, or out in the suburbs where the commute is fucking horrendous for a little more expensive.  But if you want to live in the city proper, it is seriously expensive.  Basically need to be a professional of one sort or another.

There are solutions but they're not ideal. For example, [Gogglepaper](http://gogglepaper.com/) is a JavaScript library that uses an external tracking marker and a phone's rear-facing camera to add positional tracking to a VR application. However, these types of solutions can be slow and/or CPU intensive and developers have to implement support individually.Mobile VR devices will eventually have head tracking built in, not unlike Microsoft's HoloLens, but it will probably take another generation of devices before becomes commonplace.

&gt; There's a good chance that with this kind of dog, this is only riling her up more. My shepherd's favorite kind of play is when I pretend to hit him/push him around while he's playing tug. Smacking your dog is not the appropriate way to handle this.To go a little bit off of this, Pits really enjoy playing rough. They are a very physical and full contact breed - mine enjoy body slams and full contact wrestling. That all said, I know my pup really enjoys when I'm physical with him (I tap him all over his body when he's playing) and he would definitely see this as play. Definitely, aside from not being helpful, the tapping and that sort of thing is probably looking a lot like play rather than a correction.
Wait, I wasn't uncivil here at all. I thought you were talking about how I responded to the other guy, not to the OP. This post you replied to here is completely civil lol.
gas/electric is not gonna work very well for off grid unless you run it off the gas and then it's not very efficient. Those 3 way RV fridges are meant to run on 110 plugged in at a campground.As far as how useful they are it's really up to you and how you eat. I personally have to have a fridge, because when I don't have one I tend to eat very badly. Like cans of soup &amp; lots of fast food and other junk foods..
&gt; the current mono-red decks in Standard aren't running any artifact hate even in the sideboard because there aren't generally artifacts worth killing.if and when i start seeing whip decks in the meta (even local) i stick some artifact hate in my sideboard. turning off *lifelink* is really, really worth doing for mono-red. but whip's been falling out favor recently.

Really far&gt;He's previously mentioned that he isn't open to LD&gt;every time I've tried to mention [meeting up] he hasn't really seemed as enthusiastic as I am.&gt;I think he might be detaching from me lately. His response times are getting slower and slower, and sometimes his responses lack any..interest&gt;we aren't in a relationshipI'm sorry to be less-than-positive, but that just isn't the makings for a relationship at all. It's a non-starter. A relationship is supposed to begin with a honeymoon phase, not amidst substantial problems and a lack of interest by one of the two people in question.&gt;What am I supposed to do if he isn't open to even trying a relationship?Nothing. If someone isn't open to having a relationship with you, you gotta drop it. It's really that simple, I'm afraid.
[It's the most violent city in Canada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Canada#Violent_crime_severity_index_by_CMA) followed by Saskatoon and Thunder Bay.
One could argue that, but I think the responsibility for that type of punishment lies with the parents. I think the ideal is for the teacher to have to do little or no disciplining. 
But really, people would still blame us. We take shit for literally everything."Oh, a lot of Americans watch WW? They obviously support those terrorists!!" See how easy that was?
Yes. Those are my two eyelash vipers. The green is Mr. Viper and the pink is Mrs. Viper. I don't think I need to explain what each individual's sex is.May the record reflect that there is NO good starter hot. In fact, the worst way to jump into venomous keeping us with that mentality. Instead, try to find a reputable keeper in your area that would be willing to work with you and train you.If you need resources finding such people, I'm a part of various venomous reptile groups on Facebook and my information, as well as others, can be found in databases in those groups that entail locations and species worked with to help interested parties ease into venomous keeping responsibly. Let me know if you need to tap into those and I'll see if I can't get you into those groups for help in that department.
There seems to be an issue with not being able to buy the new items. ixmike built Mek and Arcanes in the Canada Cup and was unable to buy the Guardian Greaves recipe. Jenkins was unable to buy the Mango. Jenkins fixed his issue by restarting, but that didn't work for Mike.
I'm almost certainly going to vote for Clinton in the general but I'm really glad she's getting a challenger in the primary.Is anybody else somewhat worried that the Democratic party for some strange reason seems to have a youth problem? Like I can name at least a few nationally prominent under-50 Republican politicians but I don't think I can say the same for the Democrats. Where the hell are the young democrats?
Sort of. I'd actually postulate that the prevalence of the Bechdel Test as a measure of representation could even prevent the kinds of movies I described from being made. I'd consider that a shame.
They don't have any competition, but it's not for a lack of trying. No other competitive multiplayer shooter can hold my attention for as long as CS:GO; they're simply don't have staying power. Despite all of its faults, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a *very* well-designed game.
possibly they are accounting for maintenance, the man power it will take to go through the recordings, storing them and fuck I don't know. I'm just making shit up. i ordered a dash cam online that only cost me 100 bucks. No idea where they are getting these costs from. Well unless they have a friend who owns stock in some company that deals with this. 
You're right. I didn't go into it because I'm on my mobile. One could conclude that open warfare is not strictly forbidden, but also not very viable because innocents can't be harmed (pretty much impossible in open war).... but then again I didn't directly answer OP's question. 
I think that counts as a dehydrator recipe! That's basically what I was thinking of, stuff to dip the food in before I dry it. Spicy salty mango sounds pretty awesome.
Where I worked before didn't have a formal casual Friday policy, but most people did do it. I stopped cause my role shifted towards a more customer/client oriented role, but towards the end of the year I had no issue with wearing casual clothing. In my current job, I have not done it, but there is a formal policy on it.
I asked the people of /r/boston about a thing in Boston, not a bunch of random people who have a script or something that alerts you when anything having to do with circumcision appears on reddit so ou can appear out of nowhere to post thousands of pages of evangelism about it and downvote anyone who doesn't agree with you instantly.
That is exactly what I was doing because I have seen no one actually refute an actual point with reason.By the way, not matter how much you think that your overly articulate response make you look intelligent, your opinion means nothing because you are so young that you still have midterms.  I prefer to take opinions from those with real life experience.Additionally, good luck on your midterm.
Is there an actual place where all of his mods are listed? I know you can create groups of mods on steam.. if there isn't already, there should be one from sips' videos.
I think that's what it comes down to. Since I started hitting the gym I find the "hardbody" girls more attractive than before. Now the normal skinny girls look kind of delicate and sickly to me. 
There isnt much holding radio signals back, all they are is light that is too low on the spectrum to see. The distance wouldn't matter much, but how distinguishable it is.Suns won't have too many radio singles on the lower end due to how much energy it is putting out. [How the sun sounds when radio waves are translated to sound](https://youtu.be/GvMbUxqGuOc)Compared to other planets earth sounds very different. It is a swirling mix of highs and lows that widely changes. While other planets are more often constant without too many sounds going on at once.[This video](https://youtu.be/ToXaNUjNfS4)

There are a ton of people who want mods for free and that's why they got mad, but to claim that's the only reason paid mods were bad is a joke. You have 1 guy who actually made a good quality mod, and another who runs a site the works in conjunction with valve to serve up mods. That's not a very unbiased panel.Why do people have to be "active in the modding community" to actually matter in this discussion? They are the consumers. Not just of the mods, but of Skyrim. My main problem with paid mods is there was no quality control, even less than with greenlight.If Bethesda wants paid mods, they should buy them from the creators (or hire the creators) and promise support for those mods.
I'd happily (ok, maybe not 'happily' hehe) wait 4 hours for the notes, than know you're driving somewhere, and then pulling over, girlfriend in tow, and sitting there transcribing a livestream in the middle of somewhere, just because some people cant wait a few bloody hours to find out what was said, and god forbid it isnt available instantly or someone writes it up before INN.If you were a professional reporter on a relevant subject, then yeah, thats the job. Transcribing the notes of a webstream for a WIP game, I think its perfectly reasonable for people to be told to need to watch it or wait.
When you're coming through Alabama, get off the interstate in Tuscaloosa and take HWY 69 South. You're welcome. Edit: Also, you could come through Talladega County (North of Birmingham) and go through Talladega National Forrest. It's an unreal beautiful ride. 
I understand the enthusiasm, but 'bitcoin is the ultimate fiat' sounds like an oxymoron to me and 'bitcoin is 'fungible' is very questionable. Besides that, it certainly is going to be wild ride.

It's alright man, this is gonna be really valuable experience for your young guys, and they've played really well this series.  The younger Bulls kept getting trounced in the first round in the mid-late 00's, and then look what happened - new coach and they had the best record for two years in a row.  And Jason Kidd &gt;&gt;&gt; Scott Skiles so you might be able to skip that step man.  Own the future!
I do things like this all the time. I haven't at Gap, but did at Banana Republic which is part of the same company; so it shouldn't be a problem unless they don't have the item in store (which also happens to me frequently, but most stores offer to order it for me to my address at that point anyway!).
Coming from a female, just be interested in what she has to say and what she's doing with her life. You can't make it sexual though, because doing that too soon will offset most girls and stop them from being interested in you. 
Seven as Data's future. I'd have to pick Seven as Data's future. I'd have to pick Seven because of that reason, that was one reason they brought her character.I do have to agree. Though, I like think that in her on that she is Data's future. Though she thankfully didn't rely on their characters there. I'd have to agree. Though she is Data's future. I'd have to pick Seven because of that in her on that reason they brought her on their characters there. I think that was one reason that in her on the video.
&gt; Bodybuilders can't sustain that shit much longer than it takes to go on stage and flex, and it's extremely unhealthy to do so.I've decided that this cliche really fucking bugs me. For one thing, the thing that bodybuilders do after a show is start to rehydrate. Getting water in the system is going to *add* lean mass, thus *dropping* body-fat percentage. For another, even if they were to run backstage and swallow a pound of butter, and even if that butter never left their system, it wouldn't even raise their bodyfat by one percent.They're going to have that low fat percentage for days.
I'm smoking a bunch of weed at a packed music festival  that seems to go on for miles. I'm always wearing a track suit covered in blood and mud. I either dance with girls  or I'm beating people up and getting beat up. For some reason everything is in super slow motion, and I always get shot by someone in the crowd and I wake up.I don't smoke weed, go to music festivals, or fight people in real life. I don't know what this is about, but I think I'm going to die as some weird russian track suit gangster in the middle of a rave. 
&gt; A judge can simply state that in this case the waiting period is unduly restrictive considering the relevant circumstances. If they do not clarify further or if they clarify but specify that it is only relevant to this case there is no way to apply the "relevant circumstances" to any other case.Maybe, maybe not. The resolution would depend on how much emphasis the courts place on the state's interest in protecting life before birth. In any abortion case, *if* the state has a compelling interest in protecting the life of the developing child (and I want to add extra stress to that "if"), offering up a way to protect that life without a applying some sort of waiting period, however long, is going to be hard to construct.

Iron Man was one of the best movies he has ever done, he has done a lot of mediocre stuff in the past. I take IM anytime over Chances Are, Fur or the movie he did with Mel Gibson.

The point is he did it and denied it and tried to discredit a journalist to cover his own ass. He never owned up to it and was never sorry until he had to face the consequences. It's one thing if he came clean of his own accord, but he didn't until there was no other option.Not to mention the straight unprofessionalism he displays towards others in the scene. If esports wants to be taken serious he's not someone who should be playing a part in it. "One of our biggest contributors is someone who threw a game for profit and verbally abuses other players." How good does that really sound?
As I said. A bone could be a part of her clothing so the bruise might not be as bad as implied. Also Ctheah didn't say that ash caused the bruises. He only said she has them 
It's that 'hovering' that happens when hitting the temp limit that you want to avoid. When you're hovering around the limit the vape becomes a lot less consistent, as the board is constantly adjusting the power output as airflow, wicking, etc all change constantly. Personally I usually dial in my temp limit with a dry cotton test for new builds or atties. That gives me a safety benchmark for the limit to set. After that, I adjust my wattage to where I'm getting the vape I want. If it's hitting TP at that wattage, then I know either the wicking or the build itself isn't able to keep up with the power I want safely. 
Yeah!  That's the first one I was talking about.  I think it looks slick.  I've never seen the second one and I have to admit that, is my favorite concept design I've ever seen.  It would be kind of a cool idea to rebrand in a way.
Additional suggestions that don't necessarily require costume shops are:- Cowboy- Get a big belt buckle, a cowboy hat and boots, wear them with a pair of (prefferably worn) jeans and a button-up shirt. Spurs and other accessories optional.- Superboy- Get a superman shirt. Wear it with jeans.Seriously though, gonna need more details if you want better suggestions.
I've beaten all of the souls games except for Demons Soul's and the Tower of Latria is what's stopping me. I've never been so scared and intimidated by a level in a game. 
Where in the south do you live, like which state. I don't mean to sound selfish but, I hope this wasn't my state, Florida. I like to think that we are a bit more developed than our southern neighbors.
If you truly are the pervert you claim...Who are your favourite porn stars of all time (If you don't have at least *one* 70's and/or 80's, I'm gonna lose all respect for you)? Also...Shaved or Bush?
Are you in the 14 to 25 bracket? I'm 17 and I don't watch nay Tv and I've noticed a trend among younger people, we don't watch as much TV anymore. Partly because it went to shit and the advertising. Also services like Netlfix are way better than sitting through 10 minutes of Ads.
Ok i can concede that either party would not support the others agenda at least on some topics.  I don't want them to pass a new law every day thats part of the freaking problem. we have too many laws, and they last forever.  I would a expect the republicans to listen to reason and look a what is happening to the country. They represent more then republican agendas, and wealthy individuals. The working poor and the democrats and intendants in the nation deserve to have a country they can stand to live in. not be ashamed at what it does to its own people and abroad.   
If you tear it apart they had to work together on so many levels. They all had to agree to not speak English(or whatever language they actually spot) but instead learn the native language to replace their own. They all had to work together to deconstruct every aspect of their society and replace it with the native one. This is 142,000 BC. Thats smack dab in the middle of the stone age. The stone age doesn't even end until 130,000 some odd years later. Since they are spread all over the world that means no group taught the natives anything, instead they perfectly assimilated with the natives and became them. I'm just saying is the ending felt rushed. Like they didn't put any thought into it and instead just wanted to mind fuck us. Ohhhhhh it was in the past the whole timmmmeeeeeee. 
I think more to the point of what George was getting at is that while a lot of his characters are pure evil, they are relatively open about it. Then there's Walt who is a monster but hides for so long in plain sight and keeps the illusion going that he's a good person. Even the character's like Cersie don't pretend that they aren't bad people and everyone knows it.
Hitting or otherwise hindering a guy (with your body) that doesn't have the puck. There are quite a few gray zones in terms of how long ago the player touched the puck before getting hit though.
Michael looked at her, his mouth slightly agape for a second, his eyes held a mixture of confusion and bewilderment behind them. For a moment, he was in complete silence, the hamster inside of his head at a complete stop inside of its wheel."What..." He began, still in confusion. "What.. did you have in mind?"
You can be an active participant in the game's development without being a jackass. Are you seriously throwing around "consumer" as a negative label? ^paging ^/r/Iamverysmart/&gt; If it was up to youDon't tell me what I think. You're so absolutist about this; can you not see that I want a respectful environment for the devs to consider? Do you know what a hostile environment gets you? The devs leave/stop checking the subreddit (see: Minecraft, CSGO, etc) and stop listening to the community. Is that what you want?&gt; we will keep complaining.Complaining is something children do, constructive criticism is how adults get things done.
Don't forget all this dab nonsense. I can smoke bowls all day, but I better have no plans for the day if I do a dab or two, I'm fucking useless after that. 
Generally averted in Asia though. Southern India is more liberal than Northern India. Southern China is more liberal than Northern China. South Korea is more liberal than Best Korea.
I... would actually love it if this became true. It fits so well without entirely new information from a new game!But... we're missing the motivation, and possibly the reason why this theory could end up untrue: Why. Why did the owner do it. Why would the owner kill people on the very site of his restaurant? It's bad for business, and gives the place a bad reputation. The first location *struggled* to stay in business after the first murders. Unless the owner *wanted* the place shut down in the first place (Why?), but that doesn't explain why they tried so hard to bring it back in FNaF2 (new management?)...Right now he's seen as a crazy child killer... but there has to be *some* reason to his actions, right?
Some people train using heart rate zones. Always keeping their easy runs below a certain threshold, and hitting certain zones for different types of workouts (tempo, threshold, anaerobic, etc..). It's a fairly reliable way to control the intensity of your workout, and keep track of the effects of of things like fatigue or the summer heat. Other methods like Maffatone use it to set limits on your speed for base building.Sometimes they are very good for beginners, who have trouble controlling their exertion; but I know experienced, fast runners who also liked using them. I feel like the more experienced you become at running, the better you become at training "by feel" (becoming better attuned to your perceived exertion and learning what different paces feel like), but when I got one as part of a Human Kinetics Thesis I enjoyed looking at the data a lot even if I didn't use it in training all that much. Wearing the monitor was sometimes a pain though.
Yes, I accidentally did this just recently. I was telling friend A how stupid cheating is and how it ruins clan wars, and another guy, B, overhears and joins the conversation, whole time pretending to hate cheaters, too. B asks how it is that people cheat and I tell him that they use something called xmod. Next day he boasts to me how he got dual 3 stars in his clan war because sandboxed his attacks. Ugh. I've tried to explain why cheating is morally wrong but I hardly know him and he doesn't care about keeping the game fun for others. He's just playing because his real-life friends are, and he enjoys the compliments they give him for doing well in war.
wow this sounds very familiar to my situation (apart from the grades part). I wish I would have spread out into some different areas of the law while in school. I'm still holding out hope for some stuff to open up over the summer. The places I'm looking to go tend to hire on a more rolling basis. Good luck to you out there though! 
Thanks for the input. I'm just trying to get a feel of how the more "pro-cannabis" community feels and see if their is any difference in opinion between Ents and Docs.

Most space faring countries legally consider their own spacecraft and passengers to be subject to the own laws, so the general rule is that whenever you go into space you remain subject to the law of what ever country you departed from.Beyond that, generally all space activities are subject to International Law and if a person accused of a crime wasn't charged under some other jurisdiction of a violation of international law, they could be tried in the International Criminal Court. The main issue in that case would be extradition to stand trial, not jurisdiction. For the purpose of this subject, there's no legal difference between being in orbit, versus being on the moon or anywhere else in Outer Space.
I am a lot more outgoing and friendly when I'm drunk. I can joke around with people, talk with them and still feel anxious, but it's manageable.When I'm sober, I'm quiet, withdrawn and have been called "cold" at times. I have social anxiety and it's hard to open up.
Its not just the Roxygen though. After John saying he hated Vriska, some fell back to blackrom. However, it seemed like blackrom wasn't possible for humans. Now though, not only is human blackrom a thing, but John is experiencing it. Aaaaaaaand its towards *Terezi*, the *other* scourge sister. Blocked on both concupiscent quadrants! Motherfuckin' Hussie.
We don't get many combos, and the ones we do, are never that great.Staff field + minion explosion.Corruptions to cause self conditions, then (Staff/Dagger) skill 4 to transfer.Spectral walk, jump off the edge, spectral grasp, then spectral recall to not die.   But that's about it.
Jeg forstår dig godt. Virkelig godt. I det mindste, altså.. Så er du ude i lære det meste af tiden. Mester vil sætte pris på gode historier, tro mig, specielt hvor andre folk er ånddsvage. 
Come on, you were drafted in the sixth* for a reason, one decent looking season isn't going to give you great value. Go out there and compete, young man. Edit: My bad, I thought he was undrafted for some reason, but he was taken in the sixth. Regardless, I don't think its fair of a second year player to try to leave the only team to really give him a chance. 
That's good. I'd rather miss out on owning an awesome dog if it means he'll be hanging out in a shelter or foster home for a shorter time. I'm 5'5" and my head barely clears the headliner when I sit up straight in my backseat...I already feel sorry for the dog I end up adopting!
Je me souviens de la crèmerie dans le secteur Ahuntsic( Rue Fleury Est entre De Lorimier et St-Firmin) Ce monsieur aimait son boulot après retraite, je me rappelle du 1er cornet de crème glacé de mon garçon.J'en garde de bons souvenirs, je voulais y aller l'an passé, mais il a fermé boutique.
I feel your tangent. When out walking with my greyhound, a large, 80 lb male, he's been called a great dane, a Pitt bull, a chow mix (his coloring is red with a black muzzle...I guess?), and an Italian greyhound. Urg.
Well, Gadius is 6x not 7x for one. I think Gadius has more accessible subs and better awakenings but it's 49x vs 36x . Also I can't pull a juggler cause it's from a collab =) Dark &gt; fire usually for dmg type. Dark has some issues imo with heart orb changers they missed out on arch angel series.Only thing making Tifon viable for me is I have two Tifon and a Pandora. Those are basically the main orb changers you can run.
I guess I thought hero ball usually came in a negative context. As in one guy becoming a ball hog and blowing the end of a game because he was playing hero ball.
You should play the song Kim Jong-Un chose for this occasion years ago visible here: http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/32pgqp/event_kim_jongun_releases_propaganda_tape/
I don't believe you even read my first statement or you would have noticed I made a very clear distinction that I was referring to protests and not riots.  Riots never accomplish anything.  And now I see you're going to play the childish little down vote game - "How dare you disagree with always right me.  Let me stab you with a down vote."  Go argue with someone else, I'm here to have discussions, not tickle your ego with agreement or argue.
I should win because I love Wii Fit Trainer and she is my secondary in smash but I havent been able to get her because I started collecting amiibo in February :s
I hope the Bears pick Williams, since that's my husband's team. I still would have preferred him in the silver and black though.Edit: well, fuck. Seriously, fuck the Jets. Do they need to ruin anymore Trojans?!!
Something to do with big, oily machines, rainbows, cogs, gears, light sockets, bracken, thickets, numbers, 0, rockets, and falling in 4 spatial dimensions.
Lmao, I can only imagine what this is going to be like for people in small apartments."Oh a ghost at the end of hallway ... too bad there's nowhere else to go"
I'm gonna go ahead and third this. Why do moms get special privileges? Either boobs are sexual or they're not. Mothers shouldn't get a free pass to have no manners because they don't want to fuss with a bottle or cover. If someone breastfeeds they get praised to the high heavens, but if I walk around with my top off I'm a cheap floozy. 
This is definitely an overreaction. I have not noticed any difference in snagging trades. It was always difficult. It was never impossible. The past few days I've snagged multiple trades with 5-10 ~50 point cards. Bots would be all over that.
That stinky ass dude whose butt Krillin had to bite to get free from in one of the Tenkaichi tournaments, don't remember his name... All seriousness, Piccolo Daimo was so awesome. I mean, he ACTUALLY took over Earth for a while, and was going to destroy it systematically continent by continent over a series of years 'til it was GONE. What a villain. Tao Pai Pai is fun to say all the time, so there's his honorable mention.In Z, Freiza, cuz only a villain like that could give way to how the Namek saga went down. The final showdown is scary and brutal, he's a total dick 'til the end. I mean, Vegeta's my fave fave, but I left him out since he becomes a hero in his own way...
how does a person know if they have permanent damage to the ligaments around the SI? :3 i went to a physical therapist who told me i had lower lumbar instability and it could worsen my SI joints. but he said the best way to heal was to work on core exercises. he didnt mention any prevention techniques!
&gt; If that's the case,If.&gt;  it's the health insurance companies' shareholders who will take a hitExcept, that [doesn't seem to be happening,](http://cdn.octafinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Why-Gloria-Mccarthy-Sold-43933-Stock-of-Anthem-Stock-Price-Chart.png) is it?Keep in mind, the thing was written by a VP of Wellpoint. &gt; any credit for the national rollout of those ideas. Fair enough.  It all really hangs on whether those ideas were good ideas.  For a variety of reasons - the people who first came up with the core idea,  who was involved in implementing/writing it up, and the Dems' own looooong history as plutocrat/Wall St-serving neoliberal corporate whores, I'm very skeptical that this is good reform. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad your coverage is now better.  I just think the people paying for it are other peasants,  rather than 1%'ers.
The problem is you're guzzling it all up before you get there and not sharing even a drop you selfish piece of shit.  But seriously if you have a problem I hope you get the help you need.
Not sure how much I can help you...but I'll say this. Montana has some of best people in the country. I cant say anything about healthcare here, probably depends hospital to hospital. The people are what make the state, to some extent. Hunting/fishing is top notch, bar none. Always something to do outside. Nightlife can be slow at times. Missoula has a good night life. Hope that helps.
Maybe you're not aware of the larger context. There's been a noted incidence of NFL players losing mental faculties later in life due to chronic head trauma. There is a much lower incidence of these kinds of traumas in players of games without helmets, like Rugby. It's theorized that the presence of the helmet leads players to use their head in unsafe ways, that players without helmets would avoid.This University is attempting to find ways to make football *safer*. Studies like these may lead to longer, healthier lives for ALL players. 
Most people can't accurately measure 30mg doses. Yeah, It's hard to trust some other junkie measuring your doses, but some people think the same way. It's the equivalent of buying pressed pills when you can get grams of mdma for &lt;$17.

Thanks for the suggestion.  I've tried vaping before, didn't really like it,  it doesn't have the same feel as cigarettes do for me.  It's frustrating,  I wish I could use vapes as an alternative to help me quit. 
What I was trying to show in the pictures that I linked, and it probably doesn't translate that well, but I can more or less play perfectly if I turn up the click and focus just on that.  The question is, when playing with quantized sequences, is it better to follow them exactly or to add some variations into the groove?
Good to hear! Did not get that update. Thank you for clarifying that. Good news can often get buried in all the bitching. I'm also glad more and more is coming to ALPS as they are great switches, lack of options, compatibility, and customization is really what's killing them. 
Right. How does the performance and experience level of the 22 female CEO's compare to all CEO's? I'm wondering if the overqualified-woman hypothesis applies here: that women move to higher positions later in their careers than men, and therefore tend to be more overqualified for the positions they occupy.If the few women who get fortune 500 CEO jobs are much better qualified than the average CEO, that hypothesis would explain both the higher rate of pay and the lower rate of hiring. 
Seriously, as a keto-er, i can't wait to make this! Yum! Idk if you hang out over there, but /r/keto or /r/ketorecipes  would probably appreciate this. 
I've never once in my life met a person that I believed never made a decision in their life that wasn't somehow based on race.  Therefore I conclude everyone is racist but just too fearful of admitting it in any form because of all the negative stigma that gets lumped into any label of racism.
*socialist. And a little smattering of socialism is the reason Europe has the highest standard of living in the world, with the happiest people, the best education, and a mostly stable continent that used to experience a major, shit fucker upper war every three decades or so.

You're welcome! I hope you have drive luck finding some that work :)I just tend to not like malls in general, but F21 also plays very loud music and usually has a lot of teenagers running around. Nothing really at fault in the store's end, that's probably their target demographic lol. In terms of actually buying things, they have great prices on basics (3.50 for leggings!) and usually I'll find other things I like too. I've gotten a few nice sweaters there and a couple pairs of work pants. 
You might be reading the charts wrong. According to [this](http://button.cstevens.me/flairs), there are 22,000 people with 56 and the only numbers that are greater are 57, 58, 59, and 60.
It's different to true no-limit, where betting your entire amount and losing the bet means you've closed yourself off to any possible future bets. Also, where previous wins allow you to put the opponent into such a position, without you yourself in that same danger.
I was working with another teacher as an assistant teaching English.  He gets off topic a lot. That day we were learning about how to graph information in English. We gave the class time to make a graph on the music they listen to.  He got bored, I guess, started talking about Ebola. He told thirty 14 y.o. students they would get Ebola from people sneezing in public places. I broke my assistant's code and told him and the class that was incorrect, right then.  The teacher and I googled it after class, and while you might get it from a really spitty spray-like sneeze right in the eyes or mouth, it's super unlikely, hard to transmit and he was just scaring the class for no reason.

Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't really want to kill the neighbor's cat. I would get more satisfaction trapping it in a cage and setting on top of their car with a note "This is how I find your cat every morning, on top of my car. You don't want to let it happen again."
Vancouver has some drug issues, especially within the homeless population, but we don't have teen-pregnancy issues.  I don't think anyone here would consider Vancouver a "rough city" though; locals just stay away from the few blocks of downtown where the homeless hang out.Surrey has a reputation, though.  Whether it is deserved or not, is disputed.
I'd just outright not play there. My LGS banned most tutors and fast mana halfway through a league and I havn't been back since(well I played the finals, prize support was shit because well.. people stopped going)
The DLC isn't always turned on. It's been on a lot recently because the new pack came out and people are excited. If you mention in the chat that you'd like to play but don't have the dlc, most nights he'll run a few sets without it.
Oh amazing feedback. Huge bummer the only USB adapters are around $40 anywhere you go. I got it for a dollar so I have no way of knowing if it works and is worth the investment.
The Netherlands has a similar system, but as well as three flavours of highschool, there's also three flavours of advanced education:You'll eventually end up with a Master's degree, a Bachelor's degree or an Associate degree depending on your start.
Magi blessing is honestly a neccesity on her unless the match is a joke and you are totally destroying them. My build: warrior boots, jotunn, death bringer, Malice if ahead magic blessing if not, then get the item you didn't get(magis or malice), titans bane.Don't get rage on serqet it is wasted because her dash does not proc the passive of rage. Standard combo is 2-1-4 then the auto for the passive. Also this combo works if you are alone with ur opponent and no other enemy will gank you: 4-2-1 then auto for passive. Always max your 1 dash, then your 2 taunt, then your ult, then the jump. You need the extra duration on the 2 to guarantee the dmg of your dash.

I'd love to see a Total War: China.  That could be either the Warring States Period, the period culminating in the fall of the Han Dynasty and into the Three Kingdoms Period, or the Tang Dynasty (Tang China had ambassadors from the Byzantine Empire, Heian Era Japan, and the various Southeast Asian and Indian kingdoms, they gave refuge to the last Prince of the Sassanid Empire following the Islamic Conquest of Persia, and were at war at various times with Tibet, nomads from Central Asia, and the armies of the Abbasid Caliphate).I think a Total War: Bronze Age might be interesting as well.  It could include the various Mesopotamian kingdoms, Old Assyria, Egypt, Harappan (Indus Valley) Civilization, Troy, Minoan &amp; Mycenaean Greece, the Hittites, and China.
meh, I've been a deeper shade of purple than that (mexico and tequila..)  wife used a whole bottle of Aloe and the next morning no burn whatsoever.so it does happen and I'm a ginger
This looks like great information. Reddit needs a way to save comments for later reading.What I am really going to need is a way to automate what you just said into a batch script, so I am not having to make a whole bunch of choices for each individual video. So ffmpeg would be the way to go. I just need to figure out how to interpret what you just said into an ffmpeg command.(later edit) Someone on IRC recommended this: http://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#hqx
I just don't get how they couldn't trade down a bit and still have a shot at him. They said they wanted to move down. This was the perfect opportunity to do so. I mean, I'm happy to get a stud lineman, sure, but I feel like they let an opportunity go. I'm not disappointed they didn't take Leonard...I do worry about his shoulders...but I'm very surprised at no trade down. 
Everyone says its kids but those fuckers cutting the firehoses were actually dumb enough to take off their masks and speak to CNN. They were 30-40 years old and there were no kids in sight. The city is trying to cover for stupid fucking idiot adults rioting by blaming kids. WOW. Blacks call us racist, look what they did in Baltimore, while I'm at it, FUCK the president too. He's another fucking nitwit who blames the police. He's supposed to protect them. Fucking insolent black idiot.
Sorry, put another way, consider a scenario where family/friends are not as important to others as they are to you.  These are most of the scenarios where I've seen people lie (to great effect).

&gt;All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?Where do you stand on sucking federal reserve cock?

I'd like to try out for account 61 or 66, (my account isn't older than 1 month, sorry) :).About my favourite characters (I'm Canadian btw, haha), I really like Doraemon from, oh well, Doraemon. He and Nobita has some really cute moments together. He is genuinely nice, he always has good intentions for his friends, he is always ready to help them to become better people. He's sweet and nice, he doesn't give up when he has a problem, ... he gives off a likable vibe overall. 
what? did you even read the links? There are  19 million whites in poverty and the the total homicides commited by whites is 5,286, while there are 10.9 million blacks in poverty and the total homicides commited by black is 5,890. So the rate of homicide is 54/100,000 for blacks living in poverty and 27/100,000 for whites living in poverty. That twice as high of a homicide rate for poor black as compared to poor whites, in the same socioeconomic strata.
I understand. and I totally understand. if you are ok with haggling and low balling yourself then of course it shouldnt bother you.  But I think the frustration comes when people with different standard of how much to bargain come together in a deal.  For instance, if you flip, and you list for 300$ and people continue to ask, "can i have it for free?"  i feel even the most pro flipper would get annoyed after the inital amusement at the boldness of such a ridiculous request.EDIT: but i dont judge you or others if you equally have no problem getting low balled. i would kind of judge people who low ball others and complain about no low balling on their own items.
Well, not in Norway, and I suspect neither other scandinavian countries. You better get your ass out of your parents' place before you're 20, or else it gets the hose again, and people will think of you as a weirdo, loser or both.

After research on samples of Gypsy populations across Europe in 1940, foreign scientists classify individuals as prevalent in the respective blood group type B which once rooted idea that the origin of foreign Gypsies of Europe, this coming from the Asian continent .Gypsies were a sect of practicing isolationism Byzantium , and their language is similar to other Indian languages ​​like Hindi .Gypsies are originally from northwest India and northeastern Pakistan. They were part of a rajpuitilor Ksatriya caste . In 1192 the Rajput princes allied armies were defeated at the Battle of Tarara , north- west of Delhi. After the defeat in the fight with Muhammad Ghur , clan swordsman north - Indian Rajput ( Ksatrya caste ) should be left to families with Arab and Turkish lands , and later in Europe.
Yeah but with walter you never felt like he was so far gone, his character fell into the role he had to play.... he was desperate, made mistakes, was merciful at the wrong times, defended jesse WAY more than he should have etc... I can't picture walter making a little girl view her fathers decapitation or mutilating a person and destroying them emotionally/mentally until they are his slave.
He has damage, coming every 6 seconds to everyone on the enemy team AND slowing them, he has hard cc as he barrels through the enemy team with his bull, and on top of that he can escape just about any situation with his ult. If you aren't sitting IN the enemy team spamming stuff, you aren't wukonging right
It entirely depends on how you play sheik. A lot of people play her lame with needles and grabs. So if you play like that, you deserve the hate. I don't play many characters lame, but when I do I take the hate cause I deserve it.
In construction, the fancier the architect gets, the odder things become. Lower the switches for HC, chair rail runs through it. Inset expensive outside stairway lights in a concrete wall, the handrail makes bulb changes impossible. They expect builders to catch design errors but once concrete sets, no one is willing to pay to fix it.
VAG Can unlock the MFD on the vehicle. I did it on my MK6 2.5 SE. Was like a 10 minute job. Just google it super fast. And find someone with a VAGCom as well I guess. You could even swap in a GTi wheel with functional buttons. 
Honestly, I'm an odd one who saw the 2006 DEEN anime first before Zero due to placing a no expectations front when entering it and loved it. I'm sure I would have anyways, but this solidified it as the top echelon of animation to date. I went to the VN following F/Z, and now I'm watching UBW.
Why are so many people concerned over whether or not Pokemon carts are fake? It seems to be this huge deal for everyone. Why not Conkers carts, or Flintstones Dinosaur Peak carts?POKEMON carts?
Also Jin's presumed death, when the freighter blows, up is one of the most chilling scenes in the entire show. I still tear up occasionally when I watch it, even knowing he is still alive. Sun's reaction in that scene is some of the most believable acting in the entire series.

They all have to work. Every single one of them.In practice you can do a few things to increase your success rate:You could create chips with 6 cores, and then if 1 or 2 of the cores do not work, you disable those cores and sell it as a 4 core CPUOr maybe the chip is designed to run at 2 GHz but it doesn't work at the design speeds, however you might find that it does work at 1.5GHz. So you sell it as a 1.5GHz chipBut yea normally you need all the transistors to work for the chip to be usable.
Ok. Phew. In the back of my head this entire discussion has been, "How could anyone deny that casket match?" I get not necessarily being a fan of flippy shit. I get the produced backstage stuff is different and maybe isnt for everybody. But no legit wrestling could deny that casket match. All good.

Some of my favourite musicians would be Garbage, The White Stripes, Bjork, Jenny Owen Youngs (she's a little-known talent that deserves more recognition, especially for her first album), Broken Social Scene, Florence + The Machine, Regina Spektor, Gorillaz.Mostly I listen to a lot of 90s and early noughties alternative and alt rock like Smashing Pumpkins, Portishead, The Breeders, Sonic Youth, Foo Fighters etc.In terms of video game soundtracks, Zelda Majora's Mask, Animal Crossing Series, Portal 2, Paper Mario (N64), Clannad (if VN count), Banjo Kazooie/Tooie, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney etc.Yeah, I'm a sucker for nintendo.

I agree with u/DecisiveMind. If the past decade has taught us anythings it's that just because a country is having financial troubles doesn't stop the rich from getting richer and the poor from getting poorer. That includes the ones potentially funding ISIS. 
It's absolutely terrible. "FCK THE TITANS FOR NOT TAKING CHIPS DEAL! THEY WILL LOSE FOREVA AND MARIOTA IS BUST!" basically sums it up. So what are you hoping for? WR or S seems to be the consensus
It's a legitimate argument. Numerous Christian scientists have theorized fairly reasonable arguments against evolution. I'm not saying it *proves* anything but it's a plausible and well grounded argument.

I think I found a fix, I started my game from steam then changed my game settings to fastest, started the game (wait for crash) then started again through steam and put on my original setting, then I could load to the menu.
Why is priest so bad? If you look at the tier list, its class specific cards are the highest rated. It has 5 common cards &gt;80, while warlock has only 1. Does that leave only its hero power to blame?
I'm with you.  FOV being "not enough" isn't a worry at all.  For $750 and first gen?  No problem.  Next gen, it will be bigger - great... not going to stop me from getting all the enjoyment / use out of this device.
Try new salads. Seriously, most of us were raised to think of salad as a pale pile of iceberg lettuce topped with some cum-like dressing. I'm not saying that's the case for you, but maybe you still think of it as greens of a sort with a chilled sauce of a sort. But that's not what it has to be.  Different traditions treat the dish in interesting way. I define salad as raw vegetables and raw or cooked and cooled meats with some sort of contrasting sauce. So Greek salad. Or sunomono. Or even crudités. Check out the recipe for sunomono. It's one of the easiest and tastiest dishes there is (if you can slice cucumber thinly). 
Because I feel like he's the one that pushed that topic the most, which then lead TB to ask more questions about it. The main thing to understand is that there are really no sides since pretty much everyone agreed that the system sucked, and just because some people decided not to be vocal about it, it doesn't make them any better then those that were.
Yo? so not only you couldn't recognize once told the 85 btc bitgo bug, you are also unprofessional?patenting this is dirty and "trust me" doesn't work
Wow. This is the almost exact same airport story i have of my ex.I flew from Australia to LA to do a road trip with him (he is from the US) and apparently it took me far too long to get through customs and security. After a barrage of verbal abuse and accusations, i then had to spend 3 weeks in a car / hotels / hiking / camping with him.I let it go for that trip, but something in my died when it happened. Sadly it is usually a small preview of what's to come if you stick around. Good on you for seeing the signs and getting out.
Just do it, seriously dude. Cut out the useless expense like junk food. Take the bus or walk when you can. You know you can do it. Not trying to be mean, but perhaps there is some insecurity issues going on. 
Dude. He is a self proclaimed socialist.edit: wow, being downvoted for literally calling a socialist a socialist.  I never even said socialism was bad, just that on a left/right spectrum, socialism would certainly be on the left side of the road.
It works pretty well for my semi-portable Raspberry Pi setup. The downside is that the buttons are a bit small for [my large fingers](http://i.imgur.com/2d3j87u.gif), but on the plus side is that it has a built-in laser pointer (lasers are cool).
I'm not Irish at all.  I just thought the green dot looked better than the rest, and also "the Emerald Council" sounds better than the other faction names.
The term you're looking for is nocturnal penile tumescence.  True, it can be caused by dreaming, but the actual more likely cause for this in most men is their bladder.  Any man will attest to how difficult it is to pee with an erection. A full bladder can stimulate an erection so as to control your desire to pee at night.This type of erection in human males starts during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep (aka paradoxical sleep).  This is why it is also likely triggered by dreaming since dreams occur during REM sleep.  Actually, brain wave patterns during REM sleep &amp; being awake are very similar, which is why it's also named paradoxical sleep.Other animals can also nocturnal penile tumescence.  Actually, every mammal tested so far has had this ability.  Even more specifically, they all had REM sleep erections, except for the 9 banded armadillo.  9 banded armadillos still have nocturnal penile tumescence, but they simply do not occur specifically in REM sleep.  
I hate it all the time, but it's especially annoying at night on unlit roads. I drive home in the dark 10 months out of the year and have had a few lit cigarettes that are hard to figure out what they are. Is that a cigarette or the reflection of my headlights in an animal's eyes? Sure, after a second it's easy to figure out, but that first split second can be nerve wracking, especially after working all day and just wanting to be home.
Yup - it was so stupid, they'd get annoyed over it, even the top technicians agreed with what I said "There's no reasoning, there was a server issue, the site is gone, there's nothing I can do". Like, I'm not going to spend 3 hours investigating to give you a reason when I could spend that time recovering data. 
Wait, can you set your own prices then? Who's to say you didn't officially set the cost to something one day and raise it another? That seems batshit insane and weirdly bostonian.
What you said should be said to all HAES supporters. I bet if you put your mind to it you could easily lose that plus some in the same amount of time. 10lbs a month is freaking awesome!!
If it turns out well, I'll definitely post some pictures! And I totally hear that about the kids. I've signed way too many papers saying that I won't put anything about them on the internet already! Your sister in law and I are both right to be scared!
I absolutely agree and never thought Robiskie would be a good receiver.  I've never really recommended a Buckeye in the draft, I just really like Smith and I thought i made that clear.  I can seperate the two quite easily.
They weren't doing it because they were mad at the police. They were doing it because they wanted to set shit on fire. It didn't really matter what, so why fuck with high risk targets? Businesses burn the same as police stations.
I would think that they would force the states that have legalized marijuana to enforce federal law, as this is what has happened in the nation's history.
And potentially cheaper than other methods. A fully reusable SSTO making barely-suborbital hops could potentially be more fuel efficient than a supersonic aircraft.
My high-school teacher was also my neighbor. I was 16 and he had a babysitter who took care of his kids who was 24 and hot.   I was banging her and he jokingly announced it to the class. Shit was cash
I wasn't aware of such a thing. We have one shift that likes to rotate us so we don't burn out but usually they call plays permanently (until your shift ends). I'm usually on CS all day errday. I like to think it's because I'm pretty good at it, lol. 
*As the pair fall in a giggling mess L'Gel is just smiling, but after she leans up to give him a peck on the cheek he looks down at the long line of her body under him and she can see the look in his eyes change, more heat appearing in them.  He leans down to give her a kiss, but stops just before, still watching her.  With a deep breath he puts his leg under him and starts to stand up, trying to help her up too, but the bindings make it difficult.  After a few moments he starts laughing again.*"I ... guess this wasn't as good of an idea as I thought."
As I have percieved it, I think it has to do with the lack of wearing running shoes/sneakers (if you google "Dad shoes", you'll find what I mean). It was really almost all footwear I saw being worn in the US.
Wow, prompt response!Thank you, I removed the link. Excellent job on the update BTW, it is so much better working and looking, and really looks beautiful on my 5.1 Lollipop OPO!
Idk I would find it hilarious if arsenal kept thinking that they are one year away only to be repeatedly kicked in the nuts. You know the worst thing to give some one is hope and all that.
I hope this doesn't get buried, because this is exactly what is happening.Edit. To clarify the propaganda piece because it seems to be unclear to some. "In America they lynch Negroes" is a counter-argument phrase aimed at discrediting the person, in this case America, by pointing out their own flaws. This, however, is not a sound argument as the initial accusation still rings true and the counter argument, even though it has some inherent truth, is not connected to the initial accusation. They might both be true, but don't cancel each other out. Reducing this to a very simple argument: Kid A " You hit that kid", Kid B "Well you hit the other kid" (statement 2 might be true, but doesn't lessen the truthfulness of statement 1). 
He was very creative in his methods of parenting and discipline, I'll give him that. He still can't stand TV except for the CBS evening news and The Simpsons.
Oh wow. What a horrible person. I'm so sorry you were treated that way. If it's any consolation, I'm going into this pregnancy obese, with graves' disease, hypertension and I'm totally out of shape. My OB hasn't said anything, except that I should be more vigilant about taking my vitamins.I really hope your new doctor is kinder and better than that twit.
Trivia: Marlon hated being a sex symbol and admitted in several interviews that being sexualized made him extremely uncomfortable. He started to let himself go, my guess is subconsciously like a victim of sexual assault who puts on weight after the attack as a defense mechanism to make themselves less desirsble. I read that about him quite a few times and thought I'd share.Joke: The funny thing about aging is that we spend the first half of our lives trying to look like Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor, and the second half trying not to.
I heard this too on Morning Edition. The entitlement is strong with that one. And the way they treated the Asian shop owner who was blindsided by all the hate was just heartbreaking. 
Obviously I have no idea how this actually happens but if I had to guess is it because air is trapped underneath the 2nd wave causing it to compress and force its way out?Am I close guys?
I KonMari'd my paper work.  I tossed most of it, scanned and shredded a bunch and kept some of the important ones.Last week, I went to get glasses and was able to pull up my old prescription on my phone using Dropbox.It was 3-4 hours of hell to actually do it, but now I'm not tripping over a file folder.
Well right now this is essentially a side project for some of the scientists. They have very little funding and access to better equipment. They'll most likely be getting more funding as this picks up steam.
I'm in California and my SO is in Stockholm too! But to answer your question, yesss! Everything is unbearable, I create problems, I get sick of it all, I feel hopeless, I want to just sleep it all away...I basically get tired of myself. When I lash out, I immediately feel bad and am all apologetic and needy. I am ridiculous. Thankfully, he has been supportive with the mood swings...and over time has navigated them better and better. But stupid hormones! Geez! I feel you girl!
What is the problem with teaching others? There is a pretty fundamental difference between sexuality and gender identity. And the more understanding of a concept the better that concept can be discussed. Also what has got you all bothered?
At this point, I'm just waiting for new mechanics on 6.85 or 6.90, like disable item passives or item stats, maybe its called "Disintegrate".I think we need a DEBUFF particle for Break and Mute. Also, debuff particles shouldn't be always on top center of target, causing them to overlap or just be bugged with its position. Weave, solar crest, medallion of courage and amplify damage look almost the same (dat broken shield). Octarine Core doesn't look OP to me. Silver Edge though....
This point is so heavily exaggerated. Take a look at where a lot of these pros were when they got picked up. Like half of them aren't from the west coast. Some examples, Quas was playing in Venezuela and still got Challenger. There are players in Japan at Masters. A good player will get to high elo even if they have high ping.
I was on a tour with G adventures. Started in Cape Town, travelled up through Namibia, then through Botswana staying a night in the Delta, then onwards to Livingstone for a couple of nights. Then we went into Zimbabwe for a couple of days, visiting Matopos which is beautiful and then down to Johannesburg through Kruger. Awesome holiday. I spent a bundle, but I don't regret anything. Best month ever, and most of it was camping.
hey I was wondering if I could hop in a trade server with you so I could look at the skin in left hand cause I'm thinking of investing in a non st fn one but want to see if it works in left hand, or if you could take some left hand screens for me :D
I hope you can get him... You deserve that you need to see him pay for what he did and for the safety of all children to. You are brave and strong you can do this... We are here for you and will talk to you anytime.. Good Luck 
The thing that kills me is the advertisements for the thing I just bought."Oh, look, the Harry Potter DVD has a preview of the Harry Potter DVD, because we couldn't be assed to actually make a different set of previews for each DVD."
Yeah I do see your point, it's not hip-hop. If the post goes against the sub's rules then I'm all for the mods removing it. Then it seems that TPAB and FlyLo's albums (which aren't hip-hop per se either) have been gateways to jazz, funk or electronic music for some people on this sub. So maybe sharing some good jazz efforts from artists which have collaborated and arguably influenced the sounds of those albums, like Kamasi Washington or Thundercat (whose songs have been posted on this sub before), might make those people more interested in jazz per se. 
Giving trans kids a private washroom is giving them special treatment"As though anyone who isn't trans doesn't already have access to a washroom...Or any time anyone says "X group (is now/will be) MORE equal than Y group!" Naaaah bro that's not how equality works.

No actually. They did say Borini covers 11.1km on average.  Ricky Lambert is known not to be the most mobile of forwards but still manages 9.9km compared to Mario's 8.7km. The only striker they actually left out was Sturridge.
Always used regular Velcro but didn't like the movement during rough transport. Recently been securing with long machine screws through the bottom of the board but it was a little too permanent. This came highly recommended as something in between. 
Our vet is well stocked, thankfully. I actually go in tomorrow to pick them up for the month of May. Apoquel is a better choice over the steroid medication/shots. No weight gain or lack of activity as steroids tend to cause. 
Those loans don't seem so crazy it's worth burning $10k up front and losing growth on $45k.  Is your pension so great you are super ahead on retirement or something?  Why do you want to do this?
I'll admit, I haven't done much research on him, as I truly didn't think we would draft a QB. Accuracy is my primary concern. We've had inaccurate QBs for years.Injury history.Parts of his game he needs to work on.And give me some strengths just to take my mind off it. 
Is that confirmed to be his real jersey? I saw the Titans have one with the number 8 on their website. Except they already have a player with the number 8. Might hold off for a day or two.
Thanks I will! I'm already sure about the second helix I just wanted to know what others thought, but I didn't realize I was in the wrong sub, thanks again :)
&gt; I wish I knew!Because in the beginning he was living the dream. Life fucked him, so he fucked life back and did what he wanted. He took shit from nobody, did exactly what he wanted to do, told his boss to fuck off, etc. I still liked him up the minute he died.There also has to be some redemption found in his act of saving Jessie from a slow death of a caged animal.
So condemn them for corruption then rather than capital punishment? Or condemn everyone for capital punishment equally if that is actually the real concern.
I've used it for years now, and I've yet to find anything better for my needs. I've been running online games for close to a decade now, using lots of different tools like this, and this one is definitely the best for what I play. 
Can you clear something up for me?Are you a troll or just in such a state of ignorance where you think that "android phones" refers to a single $120 plastic burner Samsung phone?There more than one android phone out there, some cost **more** than the iPhone (including mine you poverty ridden peasant) and most of the high end ones don't include plastic.Enjoy your bending ego boost.
Because she isn't a virgin? Come on.Edit: women were also treated as property back then, so they would kill a man long before he would be a "slave" to a woman.
We can absolutely have that discussion, I'm just not what there is left to discuss about why he isn't a Socialist. He supports capitalism as a mode of production, so he's not a Socialist.
I am 37 and my wife is 41, I feel like a kid inside, but my body feels like a 60 year old, which my doctor told me due to some congenital problems. Its weird wanting to do so many things, but not being able to, especially with my wife. It feels like i let her down sometimes and it makes me feel like shit. I have acheived the great ability to numb my own feelings to take care of others. I bottle it. My wife on the other hand, lets me have it, which i then bottle as well. but we get on, we move on, and we live.
I think this has been brought up before, and I don't know, but I really like the current animation on TD and I'm not sure how I would feel if it changed. Whether that's due to nostalgia/comfort or not, I'm not sure, but that's how I feel.
I'm looking at the Aspire Atlantis v2 (.3, .5, and 1 ohm coils so I want at least a 50W). Even if I start rebuilding later on I really doubt I'd build anything the M80 couldn't handle. 
Should you be forced or sued for refusing to date a black asian or even a muslim?Just because a fascist government says so, your property rights should not disappear!End of story!
That Buster Skrine signing was stupid af and short sighted. They ended up paying so much money to CBs during that free agency period with a bunch of other holes
I can understand no personal weapons in uniform, on duty. But after work, off duty? Should be the same rules as off base.True story, I was once stopped by base MPs for a random vehicle inspection. They searched my car for an hour, called the police and asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them.After an hour and a half, I found the reason they held me there. Expired insurance (I had given them the old card by accident, the new one was in the glove box), and I had weapons.  In a moving box, marked kitchen, there was a set of steak knives like they sell on base.I was told that it was unacceptable.
That's pretty fucked up. It's funny running into people like that now though. They paid $60-$80k for a job that pays $50k, I paid $3k for a job that pays the same (with potential for more). Plus I don't have to deal with stupid kids all day.

Well then the psychiatrist needs their license revoked.All it takes is a very basic understanding of Cluster B personality disorders to know that those diagnoses are incredibly redundant. 
As a serious answer to your question, yes you're missing a refernece: the reference to the way many, many newscasters speak. I think you're getting down voted because regardless of whether you watch the news regularly, it's pretty hard to believe you have zero exposure to it. I haven't had TV in almost a decade but I'm still *exposed* to the news, in bars, when I get my hair cut, when I visit my parents etc. I also didn't find it "ha ha" funny, but a fantastic flavour of bizzare.
&gt; these daysWhere the fuck have you been? Angsty-Dave has been the rule, not the exception, for some time now, and even before that it wasn't too uncommon to have Dave scenes where the dude basically mentally cracks.
The safest statement they can possibly make because it sounds great, but they know 1,000 idiots will still buy it by the bundle for every 1 that is interested but shows restraint to vote against it. Then they get a free pass of "but see, you wanted to pay for it!"
тогда советую следить за этим проэктом. http://camelotunchained.com/v2/Dark Age of Camelot был одной из наиболее прогрессивных массовых РПГ, и комманда здесь развивает по похожему шаблону.

These are really confusing to me, but I tried to ignore his bogus story while checking them. They initially seemed to be legit to me, based off the strong 3M, the insole being darker shades, back pull tab stopping before the crown symbol (instead of touching it like fakes), the sole being the right color and the shank being a darker pattern as it's supposed to be. But then the tongue patch looks a bit narrower than usual, the flywire doesn't seem to go past the mesh and into Hyperfuse material, which shows clearly on the Hyperfuse of authentics. And then you bring the Footlocker receipt into play, and it gets more suspicious. I want to believe they somehow got a promo pair by mistake, but it sounds unbelievable as I'm typing it. There's a lot of things that point to legit on the pair, but he needs to take better pics if I can even be 100% sure on the authenticity of this, it's just not adding up. 
Im playing dragon handlock with moltens but not mountains. Its doing very well so far. Beating most face and midrange hunters, and still strong against control. Theres a lot of synergy in twilight drakes, alexstraza, shadow flame into volcanic drakes etc. Also hitting the 3/5  3drop into a big twilight dragon is very strong. Then followup with a corruptor and game could be over.
You think even games that are more oriented for kids would have really difficult kanji? Like if I played pokemon x or y would I have a lot of trouble? 
Really? That's very interesting. I would assume this is a lot more common in languages where immutability is fundamental, or part of a common design pattern.
You can make a new folder on your desktop called "photo uploads" then click and drag the photos or albums out of photos and into that folder. You can also copy and paste if you prefer. Usually you can right click on the file and "show in finder" but since the photos individual photo files live inside the photos library, that option is pretty useless (and might not even exist for photos. Best way is to click and drag the photos you want from photos app to a folder or to the desktop. It will create a new photo in that location for you (and keep the original in photos). **EDIT** just finished reading your extra info whoops. So if you go into the finder you can right click on the photos library &gt; view package contents &gt; originals (or something like that) and see the original files. You can't do this in an upload form from a website though. Maybe try using the share option from within photos app. 
The other day I went to use the customer bathroom at work and there were actual footprints on the toilet seat.  I left ASAP and didn't mention it to anyone. 
I had panic attacks constantly in public due to low blood sugar.  I'd start shaking and suddenly I'd be like I'm scared! I must hate being in public!  Turns out it was my poor diet when rushing to get places in the city. Try finding your trigger.  Also you can learn to defuse it - I used to do the "before you know it spaz" part for attention as a kid. Instead of defusing it I actually encouraged it once the first physical symptoms appeared as I wanted people to know how sick I was.  It doesn't just go away but your job is to minimize the occurrences and disruptions in your life. 
I will be streaming it online.   20$ cover to see it anywhere around here.   That and I don't know anyone to go with me = watching alone in the comfort of my computer chair. 
The carrying out of a sentence of death on a condemned person.     The mom condemned him to death with her wish and he preformed the execution doesn't have to be dome by Simone else.

Ugh. Three is so hard!* The Greek Myths by Robert Graves--Not only would this take me a little while to get through, and it would provide endless hours of me giggling at the gods.* The Complete Harry Potter Box Set.-- IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL IT'S BOUND INTO ONE BOOK, OKAY? So it counts...* SAS Survival Handbook: How to Survive in the WIld, in Any Climate, on Land or at Sea--Because I'm not dumb. Well, I am, but I'm smart enough to know that I know very little about surviving in the wild and I'm not going to waste a book slot and not utilize a survival book. Knowledge is power!Honorable mentions (in no particular order): The *Alice* books (I don't like leaving this out because it really is one of my favs, but I gotta optimise my allotment here) Les Mis, Wicked, Pride and Prejudice, and Howl's Moving Castle. These were all discarded because I can get more out of what I'll actually take.
I do! Entry level, but it does what I need. I got into fragrances because I own a business that's very scent-oriented, so I decided to teach myself. I create all of my own scents, and I ended up developing a pretty serious appreciation for fine perfume in the process. I write a column every Friday on /r/wet_shavers if you'd like to drop by sometime. :)
In my eyes the flow chart goes like this.What do married people want? Marriage law. What should married people get? Marriage law. Why change something that's not broken. Marriage isn't broken. Marriage is find. Homophobia has a problem with gay marriage, and wants to end all marriage as a result. That's a temper tantrum.
Whereas the peeps who harassed him on Twitter had zero intelligence and zero social skills. Don't know how one person who made a successful game that people seemed to like could have been that insecure that he would give it all up because of some people being mean. It's kinda sad 
I just happened to stumble upon her new web series called 'What's Next for Sarah. 2:55 in a 3 minute show, worth watching.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf3PLYTj0_0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf3PLYTj0_0)
I'd be fine with it. I'm not 100% sure how they could make him really work in an art-style perspective, but hey. Banjo's in so whoopidy doo. I guess he would have a lot of projectiles? 
I have gargutuhands and a firm, round, delectable ass that could entrap gays for days if only I swung that... Uhh... Either way the point is that I don't have enough room to do the business properly. I'd have to scoot forward to fit my hand in, and my hand's in a place I REALLY want to have full control of, which means full arm movement and not just the wrist. I guess I could lean to the side, but that leads my tender buttocks to feel sore after a while. Besides, I like to check on my progress in the mirror.
Actually it really should have been like 50 for 1, 120 for 3. If you know anything about graphic design you could make thirty of these in an hour. Not to mention this game's competitors give recolors out for free.
I like how all the analyst are like, the pick has to be Cooper. None of them are even mentioning Williams. Yes I would have liked Williams, but I find it funny everyone who knows anything is gushing over Cooper/Carr combo, and I come in here and people going lolRaiders for taking the by far best WR prospect. I am hoping Cooper can become the next Tim Brown. We need a more explosive offense and with Cooper stretching the field and being able to do anything we ask, I think he will have the same impact AJ Green has had. 
I own a mushroom island myself, and I found that if you wait a while, mooshrooms will spawn. I have had four mooshrooms spawn. Just wait a while and you may get some mooshrooms for free without paying for it first. I did wait about a week though so you might just want to go buy some if you really want them.
Yes! I think people that are a little bit older don't really care about the video quality nearly as much as the younger crowd. People who used to have to get up to turn a dial to change to one of the other 13 TV channels have a different perspective on quality. :) I've said around here that we shouldn't shy away from doing a SD (standard definition 4:3) bundle, but I'm not sure how it will go over.. But then again I'm willing to try just about anything and let the community tell us when we get it wrong. 
My order was cobblestone, king custard, lemonlight, lunar dust, and mean frean. Awesome all around, but cobblestone and lemonlight are ADV material for me.
I am extremely grateful for that money but that still put my yearly college tuition at around 48K.  Yes, I could switch schools but I am the number one student in the chemistry department and I like it here.  That is why I am accepting this debt.  I go to one of the top schools in the country and doing this well hopefully will get me into a good medical school.  I am accepting this debt because I want to be a doctor and I feel that hopefully it would be worth it.  I am sorry that I have upset you.  Thank you for your advise.
Excellent question! During a rush with a full crew we expect ticket times to be about seven minutes from ordering to eating. Three of those minutes are dedicated to the toaster, no matter what. Aside from that, we don't cut our bread until the order has been placed, and keep our meats and cheeses wrapped when not in immediate use. On an average day I'd estimate ticket times at 10 minutes for a sandwich. So my best guess would be that our assembly line is geared more towards a certain style of sub over speed. 
Drivers license,student ID, working with children check, student union card, public transport card, 2 credit cards (paid off), taco loyalty card, YuGiOh "hungry burger" card, two headed coin with one head scratched up by me... That's about it. 
Hm, I don't have any experience with Safari. In a general sense, it looks like all you really need to do is find where RES stores its data and copy the files somewhere safe. Then the next time it crashes, go back to where the data is stored, and copy your backup into there.I found these directions on the RES subreddit - hopefully they help!&gt;**On a Mac, the files can usually be found in:**&gt;&gt;~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/safari-extension_com.honestbleeps.redditenhancementsuite-&lt;10 char alphanumeric string&gt;_0.localstorage&gt;**To get to this folder using Finder:** &gt; From the Go menu, choose Go to folder (Cmd+Shift+G). &gt;Type ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage/ into the popup box and hit enter. Note the "~" in "~/Library".... It's important!)
I think she's going to keep the baby and that's where the comparisons come in. That she's NOT her mother and in that moment of pain and confusion, she could go through with it. If she has a baby and gives it away. The baby Derek wanted, then I'm done forever. 
One of the new Sigma or Tamron 150-600mm lenses for animal closeups - lensrentals.com have them available. I don't think a 200mm lens is going to get you close enough to the animals.
LOL.  I know what that is like.  I was trained on how to do that when I got a job as a groomer, but I couldn't handle that part, so I couldn't keep the job.I noped my way right out of that one.
This is probably not what he's actually working on. But from the shirt he was wearing i feel like it could be a ERB? This is just wild fucking speculation though.
It's almost always in their capital and I still have this problem. I've almost gotten to the point where they are almost always in a defensive position. Or I use them if I am prepping for an attack and need "eyes" on the ground ahead of my attack force.
Yeah, especially T side on Dust 2. Almost every game I play on D2, Terrorists win the pistol round with almost no casualties. Its even worse because that map is slightly T sided, AND they get a 20 round pistol to start off with, or the Tec-9 :/
Applying spin to billiard balls with the cue can be called small-e english.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cue_sports_techniquesBut I agree, whether one is speaking of a person from England or the language, a capital E is appropriate.
I didn't have a problem going through all of it I finished it all, but when I go to export my superstar he shows on the superstar menus and stuff, but if I hover over him it says "Save error". Not sure how to remove them off of my roster menus either because he doesn't show in the creation menu.
Does it really take a week? And what if you take the magnets off for just a little bit at a time? Fuck I trained for 2 years or so and never had any problems, now cauliflower ear everywhere. 
Wonderful it is working now! You always seem to have the answer. I will check regularly to see if you have updated the script then! Thank you, kikootwo :)
IGN Article listed all of the current consoles and PC.At the beginning Playtonic said they would target PC and would like to go for other platforms. Then they heard the fans asking for consoles, the most vocal of which I've heard as Wii U. Appears they'll also bring the game to Mac.
Usually web services have logs that indicate recent login activity. If this is web based (e.g. gmail), you may be able to glean information about the attacker from there.I'd ensure that all passwords are changed, that there are no email forwarders setup on your accounts (specifically to capture password resets), and contact the service providers and see if you can't get the  imposter account shutdown (I've gotta imagine they violate some terms of service).
"I'm just so turnt right now" hahah I don't think any player has ever used the word turnt in their post draft interview. Never change Winston, you're awesome. 
I'm pretty enamored with the plain glass beads, also. Idk why. With those, it's not just how they feel but also how they look. But they're cooler when your whole hand is submerged in like a bowl of them- not as interesting as the highly polished stone, though, for sure.    My parents used to have a stone checkers set- those were great- and they made great sounds, too. Total ASMR territory- if you're into sounds, too. 
There's a theory that Jon Snow is actually a Targaryen, the third child of Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark (Ned's sister, who he said [in the first book] he made a promise to as she died, but never disclosed what that promise was).  These are merely theories, but one thing is certain: the next book is going to be out of fucking control.
OK, it's 8:45 and I seem to be all caught up. I'm going to have something to eat with the beautiful lady who just got home, but will check in later and a couple more times over the next few days to catch any stragglers.Thanks so much to everyone who participated! It was great fun to get to field so many varied questions. I hope I answered all to satisfaction and with honest word.Good night!
I'm not worried about him not lighting it up. I'm just concerned about having our whole world come crashing down in the middle of the season with an injury.But I'm all in. Let's do this.
Haha it's personal preference really. Some people like the higher pitched sound. Not as noticeable on browns or reds though. I'd just save money because $50 for a set of keycaps is ridiculous IMO haha. 
&gt; It's still a lot cheaper than if you were to buy the individual ingredients themselves and cook it all yourselfYou're not getting bulk/closer-to-wholesale prices when you're buying at Coles/Woolies/typical butcher, though. You'd be surprised how much of a markup there is buying direct and in bulk like these guys do.
/u/chaosakita , [on](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/25/abortion-reform-buddhism-thailand) abortion [in Thailand](http://www.rhm-elsevier.com/article/S0968-8080%2802%2900020-4/abstract),a Theravada Buddhist nation. Sri Lanka is more conservative than Thailand on these matters(attitudes).So that poster is flat out wrong. The Buddhist views there are quite similar to Orthodox Hindu views.Also,I think abortion-even the term for it in Sanskrit that I know-(*bhruna-hatya*/*bhruna-vadha*)-both *hatya* and *vadha* mean 'to kill'. I can't imagine a very positive attitude towards killing.Also,the poster in question is assuming that most other countries operate in a similar manner to the USA(which it doesn't;and which explains why abortion laws work differently).
Look at the video again. I've seen lots of people go limp when they're taken in by police. Some people do it to be annoying, some people because of shock. But then there's this guy. His neck is all weird and his head is at a really uncomfortable angle.

There's a huge body of evidence backing evolutionary theory, and the creationist "arguments" against evolution are nothing short of desperate. What science has yet to discover is how and where life originated, and/or whether it may have started in different parts of the universe at different times. If you get comfort from religious fables about the origins of life, that's great, but you won't find much credence is given to the Book of Genesis in this subreddit.In fact, if you stick around here you may find some of your fundamental beliefs challenged. Such as the fact that religions like Christianity are no more than a tool the elites use to control and manipulate ordinary people. Put it this way, if the Lord is your "shepherd", what does that make you?
Good luck theorizing lol, it will keep you guessing. I wasn't a fan of Lain's character at first either because, like you said, she seems bland in the beginning. But just you wait...

What do you mean? I've never heard the argument that a girl can't be upset about being cat called, so why can't men? I've heard the argument that cat calling is sexual assault, which I think is batshit, but I've never heard of a dude going "That guy said I was cute. I feel raped." So where' the practice what you preach part come in? I'm genuinely curious.
he said that its his viewpoint. it doesn't have to be the literal textbook definition of it. he isn't a psychologist, and he isn't claiming to be one either. it is an interesting viewpoint, because even though he doesn't think it's natural and stuff he still supports rights for them. 
&gt; Well if people really want to "see Gino push" then how about once every 18 months or so? Hell, I'm 44 and manage to skate a couple of times a week and am married with 3 kids and full time IT job.and how much of your skateboarding is worth watching? how much is worthy of being filmed? &gt; I hear the Gino push comment a ton, but yet where's Gino? He's got a board at FA, no pushing. He had what 5 tricks in Pretty Sweet? That was 4 years ago.he's out there. no footage doesn't necessarily mean not skating at all.  &gt; My point being is that these nerds post shit every day and their fans are on it like white on rice. I'd love to see the sales figures for Revive boards. I bet is amazing.big deal. sales figures don't equate to quality. mcdonalds has amazing numbers, that doesn't mean they make good food.
This is providing a corporate tax break to the communized businesses and denying a break to businesses that are not communized.Give the same tax breaks to every business and then maybe we can talk.
I usually make GIFs in /r/Reds so it's a play on words with Ken Griffey Jr. but I only have one more week of classes so I already brought home my GIF making computer.

I've been wondering all season what a blowout was meant to feel like. Who would have thought Id have to wait for the game 6 in the first round of the playoffs 
Whatever you call it - if a man I didn't know, even a uniformed police officer (or especially a uniformed police officer), touched me like that, I would feel extremely violated. For what it's worth.
I think that Cooper improves his stock definitely and he is also getting more comfortable with the system however am I going to draft him? No unless I see some serious improvements to all aspects of the raiders' offense. 
Light would write down Bruce's name in the note because Misa tell s him. Then he runs for his life. If he can survive for 40 seconds, Light and Misa do the same to Robin.

[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19682880) is the varicocele sperm quality study. I recall there being another, but your Google-fu is undoubtedly as good as mine.In my experience, horse chestnut is effective for pain. It makes an unequivocal difference. Also, when you're looking for supplements or similar for varicocele, it's reasonable to consider things used to treat leg varicose veins or hemorrhoids -- almost all varicosity supps work by improving venous tone and/or blood flow, which should be good news for varicocele, too. Right now, I'm taking something that also includes diosmin/hesperidine, which is apparently at least somewhat effective for leg varicosities, which I also have. No verdict yet for that n=1.Have you ever talked to an interventional radiologist? A lot of times, they can sneak in through your leg and get to a left-side varicocele to treat it without the more-invasive microsurgical approach. Urologists tend to perform only the latter.
Breaking a company's TOS isn't against the law, so all Valve can really do is ban their accounts. If they were to hire them and then fire them later, then Valve doesn't really gain much. They might break a few hacks for a week or two, but that's about it. Detecting cheats is an ongoing process, and not something that someone can just figure out and remove forever.
What I did watch was utter nonsense. The context it was set in was designed to provoke and that is not a social experiment. If I saw someone walking down my street like that I would call the police and let them know there is an escapee from the local secure mental health unit. If it was in some of the clubs I have been in I wouldn't bat an eye.
I did, but sadly I did not make it.I was hit by a car from my left side.The flow of traffic was about 80mph. Luckily I had all my gear on, so my injury isn't too severe. I do have some road rash and bruises all over. My biggest injury is my thumb. I have what's called a Bennett's fracture on my right thumb. Sinceboth my hands are in pain, I can't write muhc, but I will post some pictures later. I have surgery on Monday.

I live with my parents so i can't be drunk at home.And i can socialize. I just asked about going to bars alone, without friends. You can talk and meet new people there.I'm talking with somebody i don't know right now.I just said that you can come, drink and don't talk to nobody.
*he shrugs and laughs a little, although there's a hint of sadness*Nothing.. I went to their house, and when I got there.. well I just watched, they were young, younger then I expected anyway.. and happy.. they had a little boy who I guess would be my brother.. And I couldn't bring myself to talk to them, I didn't want to mess up their lives..

Depends entirely on what part of the city you were raised (and kept) in. I grew up very sheltered in St. James, and rarely experienced anything outside of that until my late teens. Very white, very middle class, everyone had 2 parents and a dog.I'm gonna assume you didn't spend much time in the North End.
v6 is about 5.12c i thinkgrades are usually sort of "area specific" as well as "gym specific" until the elite grades, where you'll probably experience a bit more consistency.not really sure what to say about styles, but of course there will be subjective discrepancy there. personally i'd feel more comfortable giving grades to something within my style (very crimpy) rather than something that i certainly struggle with (pinch/slopes). 
But, doesn't everyone need a monster on the D-line? I mean I'd take him in a heartbeat for us. I can count on one hand the number of teams that *don't* need a player like Williams.
Yeah, it's hard when they are still young. If you can make it part of the routine, hopefully she will eventually do it. My oldest is 4 and she still needs us to tell her to go straight away in the mornings. Pretty much have to tell her, no breakfast till potty.
Honestly ive been playing it for the past three hours. Trying to get through the area. On expert right now. This game deserves more credit, and should be on a spotlight imo. Once you get the combat down, each strike you land is so satisfying. And the armor mechanics are pretty deep as well. Edit: finally beat expert area. Damn that was tough. Takes a while to get used to the combat system. 
That's why my wife and I are still using our S3s. Couldn't upgrade without losing the unlimited data unless I bought a phone outright. Really, I held on longer than I should have. You used to be able to sell/auction off the unlimited plans, but VZW put an end to transfers last November. I haven't used more than 1.5 GB on my phone in over a year. I think the heaviest month ever was under 5 GB, and that was in a hotel with shitty Wi-Fi and was tethering with PdaNet all the time.

Yea, sorry about the photo quality, I will get a good camera one of these days :/    I went through your list and here is what I have (not much, but something):  - 36/160: Swampert - reverse holo  - 73/111: Klefki - reverse holo  - 18/106: Skiddo - reverse holo  - 55/101: Houndour - reverse holo    I don't have many cards before Plasma Blast for trade so the above is probably all I have that you need
As much as the idea sucks of spending money on getting the truck looked over and then not end up buying it, /u/bammad33 is right. You should definitely do this. 
That would be 704 nameplates premade. The only reason I think they do that is because the font/coloring is different team to team if I'm no mistaken (which I very well may be).
yeah, I saw that too. done in the guise of being more 'open minded'. sometimes reddit is too chill in letting certain opinions slide. and looking at it objectively, it's as valid of an opinion as anti-vaccination, which we like to circlejerk daily. Hasn't science proved years ago that homosexuality is natural?td;lr: just because you wrap up your opinion in a pretty box doesn't mean I can't go against it.

There's this whole flashback episode in Unova where he reminisces about his time with Charizard, starting all the way back when he met it, and at the end of the episode he brings it back into his main team.
I'm not exactly sure what you mean by a filter (the background blur or the "simplified" look of it), but this is how trace works for the most part. I'll fool around a little to see if I can get a version that is closer to the original, but I don't know if it's possible.
what do you mean "replaced that"? you deleted it and it didn't help so you installed it again?Also, check the Installed tab under the User section :)
You should get into Information Security. :) First you should learn everything you can about networking in general, and then after that branch into security. There's a big demand for cyber security professionals out there.
I posted a [similar link](http://abc11.com/news/13-current-and-former-law-enforcement-officers-indicted/688835/) right after yours, so I deleted my post.  Be sure to see the comments on this site.
My son is going through the same phase. seriously. Honestly it's kind of driving me crazy.. He also can't stand to see something the way it's not supposed to be. Like for example, We have a storage type thing we put food that doesn't need to be refrigerated  and he will close the door if left open. If food is dropped on his tray, he will clean it up, and won't take another bite unless what was dropped is gone.The only difference here is the dirty toys part. My mom has OCD terribly. It runs in the family actually. Me and his dad are not. 
Unwanted and unsolicited touching by a stranger... I guess it's not groping, but it sure is creepy and way out of line. Hope the cop goes down hard for this.

If the wings were damaged from the fall then why did Cas lose his wings at all?  He should've got them back in full power.  The only thing I can think is that the spell burns their wings as well as dispelling them from Heaven.
Even as a TBM I didn't believe it. I said "So the rapist went and reported himself and told all those details?" Other TBM: "I guess it was probably the missionaries that reported it." Me: "So how did the missionaries know that he was going to rape them, that there were Angel shadows behind them, or that it was because of all that that caused the guy to run away?" Other TBM: "I don't know." 
Absolutely right,and not only that, its a daunting task to bring about a change in this massive and diverse populace.

I caught a gf cheating once by going through her phone. She had admitted it to a friend of hers in text message. Shit hit the fan and I tried to get away from her. A month later, shes at my house. I ask her to see her phone and look through it. Yes it was a weak beta move. I was hurt. I was learning. This is 5+ years ago at 25 yrs old.Only notable thing I read was her discussing it with her mother.. how all this happened at how it blew up our relationship. And her mother says **"WELL NOW YOU KNOW NOT TO PUT THINGS LIKE THAT IN WRITING"**. This was the lesson from the mother.

You can find decent work with a BA and a 100+ hour certificate, not even a CELTA.  Job-wise, the reasons to get an MA in TEFL are if you want to teach at a posh international school (the kind children of expats attend) or you want to teach at a university (and you don't have a PhD), or you're absolutely committed to making TEFL your career and want to have every single advantage, and are also committed to teaching in markets where you'll get paid enough to cover your loans.  Otherwise, especially if you have a PhD, it's fine, and possibly the most financially successful, to just get the certificate/CELTA, so you have some classroom experience/pedagogical instruction.  You don't want to miss out on a great city just because you can't make enough to live and pay off extensive loans.  I think plenty of school leaders would also be thrilled to have a PhD, even without a certificate.
I'd keep the Digimon secret, just for their own protection. People dislike things they don't understand so I wouldn't want my friend to be hurt.. I'd sure as hell brag to my friends though.

Leaving without leaving a tip does feel strange since it has the whole restaurant experience thing going on, however the waiters know that expecting a tip for water or some other small drink would be silly. It's one of those things that will take many people a while to get used to, myself included. For the time being, we will have to continue being seated in the restaurant, if you are not seated relatively soon, feel free to seat yourself, and when someone comes to help you let them, or a preferably manager know that you were not seated for X amount of time. Thank you for being understanding!
It would mean that I think he's a super cool guy but I'm just not physically attracted to him, for whatever reason.  I'm married now, but in the past it could also depend on where I was emotionally at the time.  If I was recently hurt by someone and hadn't gotten over it yet, a friendship is probably all I would be looking for at that point.
Common sense is just a way to say "I have no idea why, but I think a lot of other people think so, so I do too."Which is fine to admit, but not a valid or interesting argument. I can't stand the phrase common sense as well.
A man walks into his room and says"You're never gonna guess what I found today! A magic lamp!""Well what did you wish for?" inquired his wife."Three things. Lots of money, a new car, and..."Just then an angry lynch mob broke into their room and started hauling him away."No! Stop! Where are you taking him?!""Well" responded the leader "Its the darndest thing. This genie appeared out of nowhere and told us this guy wanted to be hung like a black man."
They can sit on him until the lowest pick in the best offer they have.  Trying to get better in between.Or hell, another team can draft for them and totally keep a trade secret until as long as they want.
Still waiting to see that Bible verse where God condemns lesbians... 'course lack of biblical foundation has never stopped them from condemning transfolks...
Hello Vince, and thank you for all the amazing art and entertainment!When you create a show and assemble several of your ideas to create a coherent whole, how do you decide which ideas you include and which ones you leave out for use in a later project? Or do your ideas stem from the core story itself?
**Fan**atical&gt; motivated or characterized by an extreme, uncritical enthusiasm or zealI know I was still cheering for my team even when we we're down and I would still be cheering now, especially knowing this is the last game of the season.
Hey... I came to the states and married an American woman. At least *one* of you doesn't deserve shit. ;)I may drag her back to Stockholm, though. Turn her from the Dark Side.
Have you talked to him about depression or anxiety issues? A lot of people who seem "lazy" are actually dealing with a lot of heavy, energy-draining stuff internally. It's hard to get off your ass and do something when you feel awful inside.
YES, I HAD HEARD THAT 30 DOLLAR THING ON THIS SUB. I'VE NEVER PLAYED THE GAME AND I DON'T PRESUME TO HAVE AN EDUCATED OPINION ON IT, I WAS JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHY PEOPLE IN THIS SUB SEEM TO HATE THE GAME.

I really enjoyed shaving, and wet shaving was a great hobby. But having a beard is so luxurious and wonderful, and my wife loves it (I had to shave for a job last year, and she complained that it was like being with another man, since she had only ever known me bearded).
But they won't get any of it. They are all from rich families and never had to work a job in their life and have no connection with the middle class.  
You must be referring to the Metro (or whatever the fuck they call it now) style apps. The normal x64/x86 desktop apps install just fine. Those universal mobile apps themselves do have a DRM but just like IOS and Android will be cracked for sure. 
Here's the thing: everyone who feels this way can just continue to use lfg sites. Just make sure you can opt out of matchmaking, then it shouldn't matter to you if matchmaking is added or not.Some people would like it.I'd never use it, just like i don't use colorblind options, but I won't complain if it's added.
Pregnancies by children this young are not wholly unknown.  Still, I do not understand the basis for a court to deny an abortion.  This is awful for the body of the girl, and not so great for the baby.
Why do you assume that because someone is straight that they are ignorant about the lives and issues of LGBT people? Many, many straight people have LGBT friends and family members, after all. Plus, despite the rumours, it turns out heterosexuality doesn't actually impair empathy or intelligence.And whilst I'm being cantankerous, I can't think of one of my LGBT friends that would identify with anything as artificial and nebulous as "the LGBT community" unless they were engaged in a political campaign or a marketing exercise. But then again I'm in the UK, so maybe it's a cultural difference. I shall be sure to ask them and reassure them that you are kindly speaking on their behalf ;-)
&gt; It's like when I am talking to another British person I say I am a Yorkshire folk. When I am talking to another European I describe myself as British and when I talk to someone from outside of Europe I describe myself as European.That seems to be more because that's what you anticipate is what they're looking for as an answer, rather than either of these being your predominant identity though, right? This only works because the ones you listed are kind of layered, which "true national identities" (in this case Turkish and German) are not.
Its either a buccaneer 18 or a mutineer 15. If it has a big on the front deck like for a spinnaker then its a bucc. I have one and its a great boat if you can get it working.
Oh for sure. Going to law school for free certainly isn't always the right answer. But at a minimum, future law students should do whatever they can to not have massive student loans. While there are certainly invisible costs, it is a hell of a lot easier for a 3L graduating without a job when they don't have any loans to pay off. 
So that's a really good idea but y0u need to remember that intentenully misleading your fellow brothers and sisters is not a very loving thing to do because in the bible it says to luv ur brother as yourself and u wuldnt ly to your self so don't lie to your brothers
&gt;  My biggest appreciation is that Chrome helped spur on a few great changes.Absolutely. The competition has been great for pushing everyone else forwards. Unfortunately a lot of people still seem to think that Firefox is still slow/memory hungry.
In this picture, your older cat looks like my part-Siamese. She passed away recently, so now I'm crying, but I'd love to see a better picture of your cat's face. :')
When I first started my new job they made me get new shoes because mine weren't acceptable I guess. Anyway I had very little money so I bought a 9 dollar pair of gym shoes from Walmart to hold me over. My feet NEVER hurt. At all. 
I've heard pro players on stream say they thought (or heard) he was overhyped. I think even Rekkles, who's friends with him, said he's not as good as he once was. But considering how good mids in EU are, I'm sure he's still just as good as most of the EU LCS mid laners at the very least.
I really hope you're joking but that has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. Also considering the majority of us are Canadians I don't think any of us "fought" for Net Neutrality.
Oddly enough, this actually happened after I clipped my wing on the control tower. This is a stock plane (the A300) so I don't think they would intake spam. 
Both they and you are right. Yeah, pretty much all people care at least a little what other people think about them. But when women say they're doing it for themselves, they mean that they wouldn't be doing it *just* for other people, if they hated it.

I'm climbing the side of a steep hill on all fours, only to realize the hill is made of corpses. I fall down the hill in horror into a short depression between another hill of corpses. I regain my feet and start climbing the same hill again, while being stalked by some massive flying beast. It's always out of site but I can hear it's wings, it's breath. I hear the beast land on the top of the hill, and right about as I crest the hill I wake up. 
It takes two to trade back, If no team offers any value then you cant trade back. Worst case scenario is we have a big nasty mean guard to help set the tone. No more undersized zone guys getting pushed around. Best case we have a set of young great bookends at T for years to come.
It's a gta clone with hacking mechanics and really really bad driving mechanics, and capture the tower taken right from AC/Far Cry.Story was weak, had potential but never really gets exciting ever.Main character has some of the worst double standards that I've ever seen in a lead. (I'm mad someone threatening my family....Here let me threaten this other guys family)Graphic wise the clothing is phenomenal and it really shines at night and in the rain, but it doesn't make up for some really boring gameplay.Oh yea to escape from the cops just go out on the water, they won't follow you ever.
Go to Franci Cakes (see https://www.facebook.com/FranciCakesbyTheFashionPalate )Her cupcakes are amazingly delicious. They're a bit expensive but you definitely won't pay $50 (it's maybe between $1.50 and $2 per full-sized cupcake?). This is the place at the San Jose Rep that /u/quadshock is thinking about.Also apparently, according to the Facebook page, if you're available now you can go to Santa Clara University to sample them...
please read my edit i may have written this a bit hastily, but i assure you i would never try to harm anyone, with my words i know how badly they can hurt.
See, when governments tout that their job creation projects have created jobs, its usually jobs like this. Because there are now more low-paying, temporary and part time and casual employment jobs than ever before and it seems to be becoming the new norm.That sounds great for a company trying to cut costs, being able to skirt around labour laws and justify not having a benefits program so the CEOs are happy.Only thing is having more and more of these types of jobs as being the norm will end up costing the taxpayer and EI Premium payers more in the long run, because this will lead to more EI claims.
I don't think 18 is that late, though it can certainly feel that way when you're there (considering all the super late bloomers are still in the closet, so you only meet the already out people who've known since forever). I started to notice that I was attracted to girls sometimes when I was about 16, but I went through college being primarily attracted to guys. That confused me, so I didn't settle on an identity until I was maybe 22 or 23. 
for a second i thought this was college football and i was going to come in and ask if Milwaukee threw a couple of back to back picks and then lost three kickoffs in a row to boot.
[Here](http://anandtech.com/bench/GPU14/815) are some benchmarks of Crysis 3 at 1080p on the highest graphics.It looks like you'd manage with an R9 280X, but I'd probably get something more powerful so that you can handle future games like an R9 290.
I definitely get this. My boyfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half, and he uses condoms every single time. Sometimes I do just wish he would stick it in me. And it's kind of a turn off for him to get up, stop touching me, find a condom, etc. However, I'm not going to use that as a reason not to use a condom. I mean, I'm not dumb
Me wanting to keep my property is selfish but you wanting it taken from me against my will is altruism? And if you're so dedicated go sell your computer and phone and give it to them. Or keep proving how its easy to make the government take someone else's money and still feel superior and smug.
If you're going to be a miser, at least be smart about it. Babies are cheaper to prevent than to raise. And if someone can't afford contraception, guess who's going to be subsidizing the baby. (Hint: you, McDuck)
&gt;Regardless, I asked her once if we could do something else to influence our grades, like maybe do a paper or presentation. She scoffed at that, and basically said "If you're not good at math, don't take a math class. If you're not good at writing, don't take an English class."I can't imagine a stupider remark from a teacher: "If you have no natural aptitude for a subject, just don't ever bother with it!" Meanwhile, the whole point of school is to, you know, *learn.*Go to class. Do your thing, and to hell with her. She sounds like she couldn't be more badly suited to her profession.
I know, I went to school with it today and EVERYONE hated it for no god damn reason, like they had never seen it or tried it yet they hated it and called me an idiot for buying one, this happens with every apple product released, wait for about a year and nobody will be calling these watches stupid, it'll just be like the iPad. 
I have a Liberal Arts BA  from a top university (with an Honors distinction)and vast experience in Statistical Methods (academically and research-wise). Job experience mainly deals with sales and franchising. If these qualities are of any interest to you, feel free to pm me.
I'm neutral on this guy but then again I'm in the minority when I say I don't like Doc's voice.. he holds and mispronounces his vowels too long and loudly.
I wouldn't say cursed, I don't believe curses exist. I might call it burdened. We are some of the few on this planet that realize there are better answers to questions, and actively seek them. The problems with this natural tendency is that some questions can't be answer, and there will always be more questions. How we deal with this is a reflection of our introspective development. 
I think I was about the same age as you when I first played it on the PS2, and it was the exact same thing for me. I remember trying to convince all my friends that they had to play it so that they "could see it for themselves and know what I know.Glad to see this happening 14 years on.
Very likely! Seabirds commonly fly out more than 100 miles from shore, giving even a tiny atoll a huge radius in which humans could detect its existence.
Yeah, dark depths reads, "~ etb with ten ice counters on it." This puts a token copy into the battlefield so it enters with the counters and you have to put one of your dark depths in the grave because of the legend rule. Doesn't make a marit lage I don't think.

Ok, same here arthritis, bone on bone, sick of it. That's good bet he was happy to be mobile again without pain. I just want to be able to walk without my knee locking up and to maybe go for a run again. And maybe one day go skiing.
I feel like that is probably a big part of it. There was probably a good chuck of the sub that didn't like Pearl but wouldn't post about it because the Pearl love was going insanely strong then and they didn't want to be downvoted into oblivion..

It was in s. Texas. Both grey headed, he's 6'2" or so she's 5'4",give or take. Clothes medium classy but not flashy. Never saw the car. Both totally indifferent to the world around them. Absolutely nothing else that would make you notice them. Sorry I can't be more precise. 
If you play him correctly he does. Slark will almost never use dark pact against SWM until the mage is almost dead. SWM will not use silence on slark until he sees dark pact go off, or he thinks slark has not activated dark pact yet. Its like a catch 22 if the players are equal skill. 
I absolutely love my hearing. I am convinced I hear things in ways that other people don't. As a result, I've made it a point to always protect my hearing any where I go. Be it the engine room of the warehouse or up front and center for Bassnectar.I treasure my hearing more than any material objects. You can blind me or take away my hands but I would be lost without my hearing.It would be amazing to sport these fancy plugs since I've only used foam in the past. These could open a whole new world of high-fidelity I have yet to experience.

Fondant is a decoration; it's perfectly edible, but the traditional kind tastes like cardboard. However, marshmallow fondant is delicious! You put whatever kind of cake under it and a layer of buttercream. Still have a sweetness issue. :/
The renderer is not a god send.  Even after implementation it will take months and months to integrate it completely.  Yes it will eventually lead to better FPS.  No it will not magically fix all the FPS problems.
The peace is trickling in, friend, kinda sucked on the outset. Hearing she had mailed me used to really bum me out but now I kinda chuckle. "Your mom emailed you today.""Again? I thought she had accepted NC last mail?""Yeah, well, you know, your mom emailing you again, Ebola is deadly, Sky is blue, all new information here...""Is it bad?""She's actually gone back to how she used to talk to you in college when you could blame school for being away.""So it's a semi-relevant news article about a crime in the area and a 'sorry to bother you with my love but thought you should know'?""...get out. Witch! WITCH!"**/self-five**
Thank you so much. This has been incredibly insightful. But no matter how much I learn of why my parents are the way they are, my empathy towards their horrible parenting skills stays the same: at zero. Aka they still have no excuse for being shitty. 
Except there were a shit ton of Blacks, Latinos, Arabs and Asians in those riots. The Giants riots have been as diverse as the City itself. It's not comparable at all. BTW, it was mostly Latino kids fucking shit up on 16th and Mission during the first one. I'll admit it was mostly Whites that looted the bookstore by the stadium, though. I'm not white either, just in case you were going to get all weird about that. 
Might as well do the plugin here since it's been like 2 years that I didn't post to /r/SC.I have a page with more drawings, if you're interested.

I'm so happy to see our young team sticking together throughout the off season. Teddy is at ADs birthday party and bowling with our young guns while Flash is playing team basketball at a Minnesota gym. Really good to see our players gelling and preparing to become an immovable TEAM. We need guys to play together and these team building skills I've seen this off season has me smiling. 
The lining is absolutely no issue at all! If you don't like it's easy to cut out as well. As for the sizing I typically wear M and got an L and it fits perfect with or without a sweater underneath. If you want to wear it with jackets, etc. I would definitely grab a size larger.
It's far more efficient though and makes a ton of sense. Get idiots away from disrupting my class and let the kids who want to learn plow ahead. More reals, less feels please. 
Let me burn several days gathering up tons and tons of fish, and then another few spamming in the trade world SELLING LOBBIES 200 EA. I didn't like it at all.Maybe they could have made it so only common supplies are purchasable on the GE whereas drop-only stuff has to be through trade? A lack of GE just seems like an unnecessary hassle.
If the speed limit is 25mph and you are going 25mph you will not get pulled over.Just because everyone around you is speeding doesn't make it ok to speed...
Jets pick going to be very interesting. Think they will trade this and get Melvin Gordon or Gurley a bit later.Edit: or not. Leonard Williams?Edit2: good pick, getting possibly best player in the draft at 6 is a steal.
While I disagree about there not being many "N" names for boys, there's nothing wrong with giving your son a creative middle name. Most people are probably never going to know about it anyways. Depending on what the "K" stands for Nox may or may not flow well (Knox Nox? Probably not the best choice. Kevin Nox? Sure, that's just fine), but that's more a matter of personal preference than anything else. The important thing is that you and your spouse like it :). Some other "N" name suggestions are:* Neal/Neil* Neely* Nero* Neville* Nils* Nolan
Those rogue apps I tell ya..... Dont care if an app has 2000 downloads Ima be watching for unnecessary battery drainage. Coffee works good if youre looking for an alt.
Theists like to claim that their choice of divine entity magically cures them of the desire to do wrong, or at least scares them into behaving via the threat of eternal hellfire.  In fact, in the USA, Christians in particular like to claim that religion is the *only* way to acquire ethics, and atheist therefore are evil by definition.  No one claims that only doctors or teachers can have morals.  
A good place to look for ideas for solos/fills is within the tune itself. Take a part of the melody and play it on the drums. Voice it around the kit as many ways as you can. I'm sure you'll come up with lots of cool ideas and combinations! Not only that, whatever you end up playing will have relevance to the tune, rather than trying to come up with something random. Not sure if this makes sense. If it does, I hope it helps!
I own both.  The VFlask fits better in the pocket, is lighter, and the battery life really is much better than the SX, mainly since the DNA40 is more efficient.  That being said, the DNA40 is a bit more finicky and not as consistent as the SX.  I also personally like the feel of the SX much more, it's just so nice and hefty.  So really, if you are willing to trade off the battery life, I'd go for the SX, but if you want crazy good battery life go for the VFLask.
More subtle on the nose. Almost smells like a vodka. Astringent taste at the start but then when that settles is one of the more complex or layered London Dry's. After a few sips the aroma gets lemony and then the flavour starts to seem almost herbaceous and kind of piney.Great in a G&amp;T and a good deal compared to other brands where I live. 
Looks like they don't even need to.  There's no way the Jets need a DE, Chicago's gonna get this fucker for free, or (preferably for us) the Jets try to shop the pick to a team that needs him.
I can prove evolution by natural selection to you to your satisfaction. Ask any questions you have, which is the quickest way to cut through confusion.

I hand make a bunch of picks out of wood, plastic, even got lucky with a little bit of silver and it looks pretty bad ass, but Southern California has some sick ass picks made from old surf boards that've been broken.
At this point, I only hope that the team uses this game as motivation to prepare for next year. I'm proud of the season they've had and the progress they've made. But uh...yeah...this is not a pretty way to go out.
Ok, the not a true fan stuff is a load of crap.  I'm so tired of seeing that stuff.  Obviously he is or else he wouldn't be so upset by the pick.  It was a stupid pick and it is likely going to be time to clean out the FO in a few years.  And as a fan that pisses me, and mouthpuncher, off.
I really don't know, I always assumed them to be robots considering the Starman Super, Starman DX, Final Starman...I guess they all become Ghosts of Starmen once they die?
I wouldn't say the world is 'unified', but their world will definitely be a lot more unified than it was before. Think about it: [Code Geass](/s "Nunally is the new leader of Brittania, and will most likely be a benevolent leader. Every country in the world is also unified through the UFN, which is pretty much exactly like the UN we have. There are also no more geass power or Damocles. I think all of this will last much more than three weeks. The only issue left in the ending is that Nina is alive.")

Normal sim card ejectors like the ones from HTC or Motorola don't work with the OnePlus One and that's why they give you an extra long one. It's a great tool to have.
Youre a moron dude. I have a fiduciary duty to my clients to give them sound advice. Used car salesmen and bank agents do not. Apples and oranges. Like i said, i tell people not to buy all the time based on a cost comparison.
A teacher once told me to my face: "What nature didn't give you, don't expect to come from university"He meant that I was born dumb and I shouldn't expect uni to make me smart. I did actually graduate with honours  and A at every subject. Just sayin'.

Great, yet another racist jerk who has probably only done 5 minutes of research on Islam, via sources that were probably against it, and considers himself to be an expert... Regardless of what I say, you'll continue to smirk and smear, so instead of wasting my time, I'll just give you a /pity :p
that would be great for us, we don't kid ourselves with Manning, see what we have with Brock, and AP in Kubiak offense? God damn I would do that in a heartbeat.I'm of the opinion that Manning will never win us a SB at this point because he will be super banged up at the end of every season now
I'm new to this whole thing, but why is it considered a loss even if there is product sold?  Why were you so alarmed that your product was bought even in the first place?
I already did part one of your fuck up OP. I sure hope to God I don't end up doing part two. Friend of mine confessed to crushing on me. I said nothing. Just ignored it like a joke. She knew that I didn't want to pursue it, so she just accepted it. I know her well enough that if she does get a boyfriend, I would probably be the first to know...then I wouldn't have to make your fuck up.

The background check company will give you forms to fill in, and they base their check on that. If you list that employer, they will call to verify your employment period and sometimes reason for leaving (it varies slightly due to employer requirements and the background check product). 
I always play this as 'homeless or hipster'. Totally going to start 'homeless or French'.Pro tip: how to spot non-French Europeans - they hate the French.
It's not about whether or not you have the money to buy them, it's about disagreeing with how they are going about selling them. I really want the yellow Lee Sin skin as it goes very well with the Bruce Lee theme, but those other 2 skins in that pack are useless to me and I have no desire to use either of them. Many others feel the same way.
didn't you see what just happened when normal totw came out nearly every player was back on the market and also some TOTS cards will be average which people will see instantly.
My first TDB legendary drop was a Prestige IV with counterbalance, perfect balance, and surplus. Hardly moves, and plenty to feed it with. It was a shitload of fun in this week's nightfall/weekly.
But if he had signed the original deal, surely they wouldn't panic about parting out his old car unless they had somehow already ripped up the old contract? Doubt they'd do that. Wouldn't contract law just stay in place for the old contract?

Meh, we are replacing them in Southern California. Not a major county but not out in the middle of the desert either. They are replacing them aggressively too.
Vials are worth 3.5 points (not including your team multiplier). Considering Combos are worth 100 points (or more depending on Spidey), getting vials won't make much overall difference. This is on iOS, Android may be different. FYI, running is worth 0.5 points/meter. Source: personal experiment.

I remember the "conpu gacha" ban on drawings where the player draws until you complete a set for the reward (which is a probabilistic nightmare for consumers) but I don't remember reading that the games were required to display rates. Do you have a source on this?It may just be one of the voluntary measures the industry adopted after the ban to not look as bad in the future.
Read introductory chapters of gas turbine theory by Saravanamuttoo as well as chapter on degradation. Gas turbine performance by Walsh is also a good read. 
Hello Vince and thanks for the AMA! Aside from Better Call Saul do you have any other TV shows planned? And have you ever considered writing a movie script?
Its a space/traffic strategy. Older posts don't need to be on the main Reddit server. Its more economically viable to put it on a cheaper or lower spec'd host to archive old posts that won't receive so much traffic.Also if there is a major migration or major fail over for disaster recovery, you can get the main/current posts up quicker rather than migrate millions upon millions of older posts lumped with current stuff, which would obviously increase migration times.
As a former Marine, bro, this is the type of stuff you need to keep on the DL.  Seen too many females screw over guys due to lies, contract marriages, etc.  More times than I can count that's for sure.  The less women know about this the better.

Stereotypes are things created by others that people use as an excuse to avoid collecting their own data or actually thinking. Using one to make assumptions about the other is a bad idea, especially for anyone interested in data science.
&gt; Sneaky said on stream that they really want the mid to be the shotcaller and really replace not only the mid, but Hai's role on the team.Wow that seems pretty inflexible. Until now I thought they were preparing to have Meteos potentially take a bigger shotcalling role if new mid isn't up to the task.
They probably need to confirm your address so they can mail the check to the correct person. Some people may no longer be AT&amp;T customers but were during the period covered by the lawsuit.
proof for this being...? maybe I'm just not remembering it atm but I don't recally any specific detail/description/dialogue for that; Laurnce is around when the Church is born, the Mensis school happens later because they're a split-group; he's known for having left Byrgenwerth, not the Church (he even created/played a role in the creation of the Church, too?). Looking for "associates" in-game, it's easier the devs meant Gehrman and someone else, judging by Gehrman's dialogue, but the school of Mensis...?
I have that same photo saved on to my computer...O_O And because no subtext is allowed..."I would love to have sex with him until I'm 'Soakin' Wet'."*Fixed and pun-ferrific.
No. Slow get off run stopper than couldn't rush on third down. Dominated because of superior strength but couldn't consistently get pressure. Glad we passed. 
As easy as IKEA, if not easier since nearly everything only goes completely in one way, and if you buy a toolless case you only need to screw in the motherboard mountings?
I can't decided what I am more disgusted by, the evil conspirators of the world, or the masses of people who ignorantly refute any evidence of the unlawful acts committed by said conspirators.
This just proves that you don't need school; you need *experience*. I mean, for a dad and three alien moms who know practically **nothing** about humans did a pretty good job.
Those moments are great too, just have a little time to your self. You can crank up the tunes and really just decompress after a long day or stressful drive. 
My best friend passed away from a grand Mal in his sleep, and he was quite the track amd field/soccer athlete. Not to freak you out that it's possible, but incredibly unlikely. You are more likely to die in some other freak accident by far though. But you're alive. So that's cool. 
That's actually an impressive thing. It's kind of sad though because I love seeing the invariable post from the twelve odd new 60s purples with their "FUCKING FUCK 30 DAYS I WAITED FUCK ME FUCK" posts. 
But if I don't use honey or agave, what sort of syrup-y viscous liquid will I use for my cereal/oatmeal/etc?!If only I could take 1 part sugar, 1 part water, cook it on a stove until it becomes a viscous fluid, and then possibly add in some fruit or other items for flavouring. Then I could possibly have an easy to make, ready-to-use alternative to both of these items!But maybe I really enjoy the taste of honey. If only there were [some sort of recipe to turn apples into a honey-like syrup](http://www.marystestkitchen.com/vegan-honey-apple-syrup-jelly-lemon/)!
Might vary or it might have changed.  My experience when I was an enabler was that the flight chief would walk in and talk to everyone he knew was interested in deploying when they were notified by the UDM of a tasking(s).  If he still needed a body, he'd start asking around.  
&gt;What do you mean by "all 3 sides"?one short side and 2 long sides.  I get the cut started on a corner with a dozuki then carefully work the ryoba until I'm all the way through - like in the pic. Then it's smooth sailing. Interesting fact about Japanese saws vs western saws. On a test piece I started the kerf with my Veritas 20 TPI dovetail saw which has a very thin kerf. The kerf is almost twice as wide as the rip side of the Ryoba. I got it at woodcraft. It's a  Gyokucho #610. That's the only english on the saw or the package. The rest is Japanese. I really like it.
Why is he an asshole for going the speed he wants to go?  If you want to go faster, just jump in the left lane and move on with your day.  Also, I think you're confusing speed limit with speed minimum.  Not the same thing.
To each their own. I have an Audi and I’m sick spending money on gas. I also like the 17-inch screen. I agree that you’re not getting the interior of a $150,000 in the Tesla at $150,000. But that being said, I think its the first step to something great.Also, what kinda of Porsche do you own?
Haha teachers don't need to be drunk to say any of those things. You should hear the daily convos in the teachers lounge. They can get quite depressing (which is why I choose to eat lunch in my classroom).
Do you actually know what it would cost to repair the pipeline, or are you just *wildly* speculative to further a narrative of **pipeline bad?** Because I don't think you know what you're talking about.
oh I will add that when locking the elbow you also want to do it in a fashion that turns your wrist in towards your body. It will hold your elbow in place the full swing and pushes your shoulder more. Again I'm not a pro by any means nor do I say this is a for sure fix. It just worked for me and took some work getting use to.
No you are completely right, I guess I was trying to compare those rims to some of the other aftermarkets that don't really break the $1000 mark for a set of four like these ones from Subispeed which have a similar look. http://goo.gl/VNLziwI also need to do more research in terms of which rims are going to stand the test of time in terms of quality. and yeah, holy crap Volks are expensive haha. EDIT:As I suspected with some more research, XXRs are cheap because...well they are made cheap haha. 
all them playlists god damn...any viable alternatives?EDIT: As in, playlists, queues, free, no (or easily block/skipable) ads, easy sharing, decent quality (not just pulling from youtube)
Ultex Jazz iiis. Much better than the standard ones (no burrs on the edges). Will have to try out the carbon fiber ones everyone is mentioning.And Dunlop yellows for more strum-heavy stuff
Open Source Map includes trails (many bike trails, they must also have hiking trails). Try this website http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.html (look at the attributes of the roads to see if they are actually trails or bike paths).
I tried that a bit last season:* It's challenging to scout for NLTP properly when you have a MLTP captain looking for mLTP talent running the tryout* It's challenging to scout properly when you don't have a lick of control over who plays, which map to play on, etc.* You end up wasting time scouting players who will end up on mLTP teams* MLTP captains may or may not be inclined to accommodate NLTP captains in their tryouts&gt; NLTP Captains need a list of 200 players just to roster 8 players.If we only have 25 teams, after the issues with B teams this season + a new push, I may actually have an aneurysm. ;)
It's not like the entire BCPD sat down and decided to break this dudes back either. Don't condemn a whole police force because of some shitty officers. The riot took away from what this movement is supposed to be about, so I will condemn the whole riot and crooked cops, and commend the peaceful protesters and good cops.
I would have liked if he put a knife in his mouth when he dived down there. That way if you do the right quick time sequence you can atleast kill/hurt the shark causing it to swim away. If they made it really hard and take away a lot of your health it would still promote avoiding them. At the end I used to just eat shark damage because I knew they would just swim away after and could tell if it was going to kill me or not. 
I don't know how to feel about this. On one hand it is literally nazis, on the other it's really well done. I'm going to pull an Amani and say I feel neutral^can ^we ^make ^that ^a ^thing?
I mildly respect Skrillex for just being a hardworking dude and doing what he wants without worrying too much about what other people think. 90% of the other names on that list bought their place on the list. It's pretty well documented it simply costs money to get on the list.
Yup...Not completely sure about the Jewish rules, but I assume they are the same as Muslim ones where, basically, if your faced with death or eating pork, you eat the damn pork.
I honestly don't know much about meth but I always wonder how much of the "epidemic" is just due it being it being the cheapest and most bang for ones buck with little other alternatives. Are other stimulants or variations of amphetamines as worrisome? In areas/times were alcohol is banned or heavily restricted it is quite common for people to make very dangerous concoctions e.g. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/647499.stm 
Well.. it had a 50%ish winrate before they made that you worth gold again if you farm creeps. Also s3 singed was ridiciloud he'd 1 shot people while still being unkillable because you couldnt catch him
Thanks so much everyone -  I can honestly say it was an even effort across us all. Funny story: We actually had "Badheadface" for about 30 minutes before, only HeathenChemisty added the S :)
Since a lot of CGPGrey videos seem to be about odd quirks regarding geography, I'm waiting for the strange video that explains why Georgia is attempting to annex a part of Tennessee.Or maybe why Delaware owns a little tiny piece of New Jersey coast line.

Its far more possible then the idea that he was able 80% sever his own spine AND crush his own throat intentionally. Personally I think the most likely explanation is that he was injured during the arrest. If you watch the video he appears to already be injured before being loaded into the van. 
Steve. Two things. Another great video and some really great landings. Keep up the good work. You look like you're really getting the hang of these old T Draggers. Two thumbs up. ( and one up arrow of course)

You wasted all that time transcribing that for nothing. Congrats. Nowhere in there did he call those complaining terrorists. At the end, when he was talking about reacting "violently" and "harrassment", he was clearly talking about the ones making threats.
Bucks have been terrible, but the Bulls have also been awfully close to unplayable and a very balanced team tonight. Although they definitely have issues playing to this level consistently, I don't believe that a Cavaliers team not running near their peak could beat this.With that said, there's still 7 games in which the Cavaliers can warm up, the Bulls could cool down and where a damn nice set of games are played =]

Howdy! I'm currently an 640ish affliction lock and i cant seem to pull more than 15-18k dps during a fight, however when i switch to destro it stays at a constant 19k. Should i stay affliction or make the change, especially considering the affliction buffs. Any tips or advice?
I don't think I've ever had a Modest Mouse song grow 'off' me, particularly, they only ever grown on me or occasionally get stale from overplaying. As for this song, it was probably my favorite song when I first heard the album. I still love it a ton. Almost reminds me of Ween meets Nine Inch Nails.
*She shakes the girls hand, her eyes screwing again as she kicks her leg suddenly*I mean, I think you're quite prettty, from a girl's perspective anyway 
there's that AND then they also showed her drowning post ferry crash, which is always kind of fuzzy but we are supposed to read as at least a parasuicide I guess? SO Im not sure if that's it or if we should expect an(other) attempt?
you could get a job at a pool as a swim instructor (if you're good at that) or a lifeguard. afaik, it's fine if you're not cpr certified since they really only require you to be a strong swimmer (but you do get paid more I think) I don't live in the desert, so idk what specific types of jobs there are there, but restaurants, retail, etcetc are usually willing to hire or try and land an internship (*usually* unpaid for hs students and keep in mind you're competing with college students)

No. Definitely not. If it looks white and creamy, it's just normal vaginal fluids that women have when they're not sexually aroused that then comes along with the wetness that comes with being aroused. Porn is not reality. *edit: grammar
What's up with some Redditors downvoting everyone's comment, even though the comment was a compliment? o.O As always, pretty_azn_kitty is drop dead gorgeous. What an asset to AsiansGoneWild.
You know what changed Christianity from a militant religion to a mild one, though? **Criticism.** It was criticised extensively through the Enlightenment to the present day.Islam will end up the same way. The extremists can't kill all of us, a police state won't silence us. Why don't you do your bit and admit that your religion has problems? Oh, because your a religious person and religious people don't do that.
It's not even "the media", it's [an explicitly right-wing site priding themselves on "mastering social sharing"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/03/business/media/independent-journal-review-website-becomes-a-draw-for-conservatives.html?_r=1) that apparently broke this story with [a shitty blog post](http://www.ijreview.com/2015/04/308632-baltimore-protesters-tried-to-light-this-pizza-shop-owner-on-fire-but-hes-not-giving-up/) and primarily this manipulative video, which were then cross posted around other right-wing blogs.
It's exactly because you already reach the hit cap that valkyrie becomes useless, you can only use Judgement every 3 turns, so you're dealing less damage overall.Basically at very high levels you want classes that can hit more for less BP, for example Ninjas dual-wielding or Dark Knights using rage.
Weeding dupes out of 176 different perm guns is quite a pain, but the search tool and a good memory have been serving me well.... **I just need more locker space!** Currently at 467/500.
My dad's high school guidance counselor told my grandparents that he wasn't college material. He wound up getting through architectural school at Pratt and getting another masters degree at Yale. So my grandmother showed up at the guidance counselor's office (like 10 years later, so he probably didn't even know who she was) with the Yale diploma in tow, and gave the guy a piece of her mind. She herself earned a PhD at age 75 (and died last year at 105). She was awesome.

Hi Scorer, cool research here!Some interesting background about the GBR I owned: The c3 GBR was purchased directly from the original owner. It went unsold until I came around because he had a steamrep warning from many years ago regarding a TF2 trade. Everyone else thought he was a scammer, I did my research and it paid off at the time.Danielous later bought it along with the rest of my inventory and resold it. No idea where it is now.Now, back to my trade retirement :)
And with the 7th pick in the draft the Chicago Bears select Safety Giannis Antetkuopumpo, a big tackler out of Filathlitikos. He can put his hands up, stands almost 7'. Aaron Rodgers is going to have a hard time throwing over this guy.
1. Your dad thinks you're unsuccessful    2. Your wife's friends hate you    3. Your husband no longer finds you attractive    4. Your child is in the process of understanding that his family is poor
EI haven't heard anything about it since I paid for shipping. I'm about to file a dispute through PayPal. I sent both the PayPal address a Email and a message through their site and heard nothing.What is their website again?
I think most directors cast the best person for the job. However, many directors also like the safety of casting someone they love to work with if they fit the role. It's not favoritism in the sense of them just casting their friends so much as casting reliable people that are a sure thing.
I think the guy is talking about actual ProTools session files. You can pack up the whole session folder and send it to someone else, and they can open it up and get going immediately with all the draft levels and effects and everything already there and ready to go. If that's what they're talking about, I totally understand that.
Because what he said was his opinion and not necessarily right and just because he himself is black doesn't mean he's the supreme authority on what black people should be called.
What issues do you have with the headband? Its a little stiff straight out the box but does soften up and conform better over time through use. You can also try simply shifting/tilting it more foreward/backward on top of your head to find a sweet spot. 
Yet it wasn't just him, though, apparently most of the government was in on it. Mad is to blame, sure, but at least he apologized. I haven't heard shit from the fuckton of spies that were sent to multiple subs yet (there might be some in the Hand as well...)
I've decided that I will only restart once I lose Jeb, Valentina, Bill and Bob. They are the forerunners and as long as they live, the Kerbin legacy lives.
He's the next Antonio brown...I really think he'll step in day one and kill it for the Raiders.  I'm jealous as fuck.  Teddy needs someone like that.  OK he might not NEED one, but it sure would be nice.  I wouldn't mind Parker....I actually like him more than white personally, but I'm still on the trade down train

They do -- hence the frustration when the home fans exit en masse when the home school band performs after the Aggie band.I mean, I know (and knew) that most fans don't come for the band, but it was a bit of a bummer to see that happen. Thankfully they're not in the Big 12 anymore.
You should take a look at what's available through subleasing. There are enough instances of people who took out contracts but change their mind that it'd be a great place to start. A lot of these people desperately need a sub-leaser and offer great deals to take it over. I'm paying $450 to live at the edge, right next to the Flats. I found mine by chance (a flyer in a bathroom) so idk what other mediums are best to find offers. Craigslist and googling, may be?
[M] Any particular reason you've targeted Ghana for this?The president of Ghana is saddened by this unwarranted accusation and has put the military on high alert. 
No, that's definitely something strange. The hydrant was in an infinite state of landing, not being stationary. Something with the platform it was on messed with it.
You were good up until half way through. Bacteria in no way rots the meat in your gut. Meat is broken down to amino and fatty acids in the intestines before it even gets to the colon where most of our microbiome exists. In fact, it is the bacteria that "rot" the indigestible fiber. That is, however, a good thing. Smells from ketogenic diet come from ketones which smell.
Walking around with a fake limp, sagging your pants, and having a look on your face like you don't give a fuck about anything is a great way to make somebody cross the street when they see you coming.Don't give me any crap about poor or uneducated. Plenty of poor people from other cultures in America have the common sense to try and look decent. The WORLD has standards for looking decent, not just America, so don't act like everyone is against the poor black people for no reason. Actual African black people have pride in themselves and look down on the American hood rat. You think people don't treat white hoodies like suspects? Give me a break. See if you can get real without crying all over yourself about how oh so unfair life is for black people and how great it is for everyone else.
I actually learned so much from such a quick read.Looks like the solution is simple then. And I know that dynamic websites are simpler, but isn't it possible to link the actual chapters to an external static page? It should lessen the load of the CPU, I know the cached option is pretty much the same thing but if you don't get one that works well you could always do that. Of course I'm not suggesting using google drive or something for the actual chapters, but having a static website just for the chapters with a simple template hosted in wuxiaworld might help.Anyway, good luck with the problems Ren. Keep up gods work.
Oops, I got my days a bit mixed up: my interview was not last week, but the Friday before and they announced the new hire this past Friday. So two weeks tomorrow, not one, sorry!I think actually that the fact that it's been a week since they "announced" the hire too makes me a bit anxious to contact them acting like I haven't heard. To me it feels like I didn't really care about the position (which is quite the opposite.)Somewhat unrelated but I thought you'd be the person to ask about this: there's a Behance review event coming up soon and they're one of agencies that are supposed to be making an appearance. I thought about mentioning that in the email: y/n?
It is by hash and hash alone that I put my coin in motion.  It is by the juice of ASIC that the hash acquires speed.  The chain acquires blocks.  The blocks become a ledger.  It is by hash and hash alone that I put my coin in motion.
On the theme of grief and loss, especially over one's pet, I would strongly  recommend Estee's [*Five Hundred Little Murders*](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/126415/1/five-hundred-little-murders/the-quality-of-kindness)&gt; Flitter thinks Fluttershy is the weakest pony in the world. Flitter has never confronted what Fluttershy's job really means. Nopony ever wants to or should. Now Flitter has to. And 'weak' will turn out to be exactly the wrong word.
Things like this is why I have no sympathy to white "victims" in shit like Baltimore and Ferguson. You're racism caused all these problems and now you are going to pay for it.
Responses like yours are why I share this story.  Thank you so much for letting me know, it means a lot to me.  I know life is at times painful, be as well as you're able.  My thoughts are with you.
If you are offended I would actually say that it is more likely that you are wrong. Most people are offended when their long held beliefs are challenged and very often those views are flawed. 
&gt; The premise is that it measures "female presence in film." There are multiple examples showing that it does not. In broad strokes, I think it does. It's not about individual films but the "background radiation" of female presence in media as compared to real life. &gt;  it comes from a fucking comic strip.This is red herring. Comics are frequently insightful studies of culture. Just because it's presented in a humorous context, doesn't invalidate the idea.
And fyi for those claiming "wow clones" you do realize the MMO genre is stale because it's been 10 years after WoW took their basis of an MMO from EQ lol.  So in hindsight it's been 16yrs with pretty much the same MMORPG model.
Totally understand what you are getting at. I feel the same way. With  drugs and alcohol I spent all my time/money on drugs and getting fucked up. On gear I spent some of my hard earned money that I get with a job that I'm able to enjoy as able to do and actually can say. No I don't need that gear or that drug or that work out related thing. I just spend my money on more food or clothes to look good in. There was no question. I was just curious to see how many of us have struggled with other issues unrelated to bodybuilding. I'm finding that the feel good feelings of lifting help keep my other addictions at bay. I look at doing drugs as fucking up my body and steroids as enhancing(still not always great for us but i come off and am able to say no)
I find art online, and put it into card frames in Photoshop. Some I print on card stock, other get printed on adhesive transparency and get glued to blank foils. I only do this for cards I own at least one copy of.Proxies of things I want to buy are done on sticky notes with pen. Name of card mana cost, type, oracle text, and P/T where relevant.
Not a teacher but a substitute teacher told me I was going to die early because I laugh too much (and too loud). It was a free day in Law and Society so we generally played board games. There's this one game where you move around a board and pick a card from 2/3 decks that have random questions on them. Questions asking about plans in life or what do you think about _____? There's no winner, just pick up card based on where you land and answer.Anyways, me and 4 other friends goof off in class constantly and this was the perfect board game for us. We answered every question with something relating to sex, porn, and dicks. We're having a good time and the subs looks over, calls my name, and tells me that I'm going to die from laughing too much. She's playing solitaire. I try to laugh as much as I possibly can so I don't die from an accident or something like cancer. Go out while laughing, call me the Joker why don't you.

What state?  What kind of bike?  Is it worth it to you to pay a lawyer?  If they didn't flag it in the computer maybe you can try a different DMV.  Do you know anybody who sells cars?  Depending on where you live a dealer can process the paperwork instead of DMV if it's not too late.
Autoerotic asphyxiation.  I also think back to my youth and remember the girl who got trampled to death at a New Kids on The Block concert.  If there's an afterlife, I'm pretty sure the rest of the departed point and laugh when she goes past   
It's important that you've taken the first step in recognizing your behavior is wrong. I know you'd probably feel ashamed and would in no way want to be non-anonymus, but you should immediately go see a mental health professional. The anonymity isn't worth it if you end IP doing something you regret. Do it for your own sake.
You can't say to some people that plastic surgery is perfectly normal just not the kind you want. Its not their place to decide what is acceptable or not. As long as its not harmful to you and you have the money they will do it.
I'll do that, thank you! I'll probably also try to write up something like an argument guide for myself and my fiancé so we're prepared with answers to counter arguments. I'll post it somewhere if there is interest/if I actually find enough to bother with a list. 
LOL! I've never actually heard anyone say reverse-theft.  I use the phrase whenever I hear someone say reverse (or positive) discrimination or sexism.  
I'm pretty firmly anti-sjw, but I still appreciated Dave's rant from a story standpoint and it felt like he had some pretty solid points as well. Probably the least inflammatory way to approach the topic, imo.
I just knew she was a girl from about 7 weeks. At my NT scan I referred to her as 'she' and was told I was being ridiculous because there was no way I could know, and it was too early to tell on the scan. At the anatomy scan though, the second they said she is a girl my response was 'Yeah, I know'.
&gt; Perhaps he shouldn't have used the word 'invite' the word "invite" has multiple meanings and people ho wanna feel superior are choosing one meaning to attack him on, rather than consider the other meanings of the word, which are perfectly harmless
Yeah, I just asked the mods cause I thought it was just me. It doesn't matter that much cause it's just stupid internet points but I love this subreddit. It's really the only one I post in so it makes you feel a little unwelcome. :(
that's what i was thinking reading all these extrovert introvert threads, made me feel weird for loving both. I'll spend enire weekends indoors watching netflix and playing dota, and then the next on a 3 day bender with friends, where i'm an absolute attention whore and go crazy.Neither one feels like a chore, i love both, and would hate to go too long without one or the other.
Except that isn't how it works. The effect on Acuities was "Life Leech is Instant on Critical Strike" There is no value here, so all the item knows is that it does this mechanic. When the mechanic is changed, the item is changed.However in the case of Lightning Coil, the mechanic is "X% Physical Damage taken as Lightning Damage" with a Value of 40, which the item remembers. You can change the mechanic, say change Lightning to Cold then you would be taking Cold damage, but no matter what you change the drop value to, the item will remember it's 40 value until you Divine it or do a full system legacy reset.It might be possible to code the flat percentages in like mechanics, which might look similar to new acuity, but seeing as this hasn't been done I imagine there are problems with it.
I agree. It appears to be very patristic-oriented, this class (which is exactly where we should be looking to renew the Novus Ordo, rather than trying to go back to the Trent liturgy..)
There's something off with the faces with these photos. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but there is something off. Still hope the movie turns out good. The last two Fantastic Four movies were... flawed to say the least.
Do you prefer sim or arcade racers?  I love it so far, steep learning curve.  Kinda need to really learn how to drive rally not just learn to play the game. 
That's not what I was saying at all. Social justice is necessary, because the truth is that there is still much to do in our society when it comes to equality and the understanding of issues faced by people of certain racial, ethnic, gender, or religious backgrounds. It's wrong to demonize all individuals trying to fix these issues just because you see a few zealots on the internet or around college campuses.
180k-220k on 360. They are going to being WAY cheaper this weekend too. I guarantee it. There is no way a 97 overall QB will be worth anymore than 200k at this point in the year
A teacher at my highschool got divorced.  During/right after the divorce he then pretty much spent every class either letting us watch movies, do work on our own, or talking trash about his ex-wife.  Some, well, easily R-rated comments eventually got him fired that year.  The most memorable one was about how his wife took his German shepherd as "every dog needs a good slutty bitch to fuck".
I can imagine. Personally - and I know this sounds weird - but my behind gets REALLY warm from movie theater seats when I watch films that are around the 3 hour mark. Like I'm sitting on hot coal. But I'm still very inclined to do it for Star Wars!
I am sure that there other pages on this but is there going to be a fix to the fake ping problems? I can see my ping and it is stable but when I get in game there are random spikes were it says 300+ ping even though i have a stable 30.
Even from a professional stand-point, the first step in team building is doing things together (as a group) that the team enjoys. When people are committed to the relationship first, they will stick together through the stress, sort out goals, and help each other out. Another way I've heard it put is to build the relationships first - once the relationships are built, the group will all "get on the bus" and go places with each other.  Relationships first - then work. What is it that everyone likes to do? Set up some regularly scheduled group activities and make sure they continue to happen. It can have some very negative effects if you start building morale and then stop having events. (Ever get your hopes up only to have them pulled away? Don't do that). 
Yes they can. This is literally what the media refers to on Election Day as parties "getting out the vote". I've seen buses pretty much do an all day loop between retirement homes and the polling station on Election Day. 
I just got to this arc and I don't know if I can finish the show. Is it worth finishing, and is season two worth watching? I kind of want to see how season one ends but the plot of this arc gives me a headache.
How is this good for team morale?  To know you were expendable for Mariota?  I did not think we would offer so much. Edit: I mean this just sucks as a fan as well.  To know that Chip doesn't believe in the guys he offered up enough to keep them...I am not as excited for this season as I was.  
I'm a vocalist in a cover band and I'm terrible with lyrics, I have to have a tablet on a mic stand with the lyrics up otherwise I panic and forget, even if it's a song I've heard hundreds of times.
I dunno, I sort of see her new shirt as if it was the undershirt she could've been wearing before. I'm sort of worried that she went for a strong showing of black though. She said it felt natural and to me that means it's reflecting something about how she feels about herself.Personally I view Pearl's reformation as her being more confident and Garnet's as re-enforcing the true love and balance between Ruby and Sapphire.
I have always preferred **V**ariable **A**tomiser **G**enerating **I**nhalable **N**icotine **A**erosol.It's personal taste though. Like OP you too may prefers PENIS to VAGINA.
I bought 2 and they barely fit flat in our minivan with the back 2 rows of seats folded down, so if you have a compact car then you'll need to borrow a friend's truck or rent one. 
I don't watch a lot of ESPN, but I never heard anyone talking about Evans. The guy quietly put together 1000+ yards on the worst team in the NFL. Feel like he could top 3 in the NFL with a good QB. 
You can always try Smogon for suggestions :P Modest/Timid/Mild/Rash for Yveltal works, and Zygarde usually runs Adamant or Careful (offensively inclined vs. defensively inclined)
I´m not sure if spanish is your first language or not, but in this context it clearly means different as in better. There are not many ways around it.It´s like saying Harden, Westbrook and Durant are great, but Lebron is a different beast.
So at this point it's use the mods I have and never play online, or update the game for GTA online and not mod SPFuck RS this is a big reason people want this game on PC!!

It's a tough one. Many of us have had the same issue at one point or another. I feel that the best you can do in this situation is put your left foot and take your left foot out. Then perhaps put your left foot in and shake it all about. 
I think you need to bring your concerns up to the dentist. There is obviously a disconnect between what they think you want and what you do. You as the patient ALWAYS have the right to refuse any or all treatment. The only obligation you owe the dentist is to listen to the risks of refusing said treatment. If the relationship becomes hostile you have the right to seek treatment elsewhere and a copy of your records for a nominal fee. Try talking it out with your dentist and if it doesnt work out I would pack your things and find someone who you can have a more fruitful relationship with.
I can rewatch Batman TAS, that's an easy one. It doesn't feel rushed, the animation quality is superior (same people who did Tiny Toons and the like), the writing is better. Fuck, same with Batman Beyond.There's something about XMen and Spider man that just doesn't click for me anymore. The animation is jerkier, rushed. The writing moves way too fucking fast. As a kid, with the attention span of a goldfish, this made sense. I remember being in awe of the Venom arc in Spiderman and of the Phoenix and Apocalype and Sauron arcs in XMen when I was a kid, but when I tried to watch them, dammit, I can't. 
Best Buy also sells Steam gift cards, and you can buy them with the Best Buy gift cards.  I have purchased League of Legends RP and Steam cards both with a Best Buy gift card.  Hope this helps!

Because you didn't keep track of every time they dinged you so unless AT&amp;T fesses up to it (Hint: They are, in this case), you have no idea how much they owe you?
New conference:Notre Dame, BYU, Boston College, Baylor, TCU (technically), SMU... uh... fill out the conference with FCS teams... Abilene Christian, Holy Cross, Incarnate Word, Presbyterian, and whoever else I'm forgetting?
It's becoming clear that I won't get another 50 in time. I'll use whatever I have, which I'll probably be 25 or 30 and if I'm still not satisfied, I'll drop $9 for 3 more pulls. 
Well, hey! It can be a storyline element. Maybe Tetris gets himself a minor humbling, for example, at the hands of that hulking guard...how did he get handcuffed anyway? Get flighty and then before he can do anything, he's forcibly but safely restrained?I've seen many a Billy Badass get humbled from the most unlikely places. Fuck yeah.
That's awesome!  Difficult time-slot though...Have you ever thought about doing a YouTube channel to maybe review games from a disabled gamer's point of view?  I would definitely subscribe!

I would as well. Hell, I went to Turners in Pasadena to pick up a new gun, and they had a sign that specifically said that all guns were to be checked, but CCW holders and LEO's keep their guns holstered.
Not sure how long these have been around, but OP's been a redditor for about 15 days, and OP has posted this and one other gallery (different person, same style). The imgur gallery itself was posted 10 hours ago. Potentially suspicious at least.
While I don't agree with your assessment, I do think those questions are very helpful in determining whether movie pass is right for you.I enjoy movie pass but I couldn't understand why others wouldn't. I save a good deal of money using it though.
Meyers Leonard:&gt; there were times when maybe I was a little too hesitant...Yeah there were. You can actually see him almost fire off a three a couple times each game. He makes so many of the one he throws up, I want him to keep chucking that 3-ball up.
Maybe people on facebook are more afraid to defend an alleged rapist whereas on reddit you can just kinda ignore that stuff and nobody chides you for it.
Right, but what reasons did he come up with that you found convincing? I guarantee we could utterly destroy those arguments here. Christian apologetics sound really nice if you're not well-versed in spotting their fallacies.
Oh, I should mention I have the Grifiti Chiton for my Das 4 and I am very happy with it! I will be getting a pok3r sleeve from 1up once I get the board
*Shiori had followed the lord after their encounter in the streets of Arun. 'If he won't chase me, I'll chase him!' She thought in determination. She had used her very small frame, dark hair, and even darker cloths and mask, which was now just a black face, to stalk the young Lordly to his city.**In the city she stalked the streets openly without her mask and wearing her pale silver dress. She had heard the lordling was fine with other races entering his city so she made herself as conspicuous as possible before ducking into a dark alley near the palace and changing clothes.**Now she was crouched by a window, listening.*
I'm so, so sorry you have to deal with this crap. I weigh 92lbs, but I try to drink a shit-ton of water and I take two baths a day and I always bring sweets and snacks for the nursing staff and meringues for the techs and phlebotomists &lt;3 You guys are awesome.
It largely depends on the network keep, expectations and relationship with the community the school has. Is it turn-around? Does it provide lesson plans or have teachers/ trust teachers (depending on perspective) to write their own. Is it part of a network or schools or small, independent and probably more informed of the community needs. Why did the school leaders ask for a charter- extended school day, focus on a specific discipline, teaching philosophy, etc.)I've taught in a traditional district school and a charter. Feel free to direct questions my way. If you're able to provide some clarity, I can try to provide more directed feedback. (For instance, teaching at KIPP or Democracy Prep-- which define themselves as "high-performing"/ college focused/ data addicted schools-- is different than Wissahickon Charter which is a Philadelphia-only charter focusing on an environmentally conscious curriculum.)
Agreed. Some people say it's "just bad AI" but it really is bordering on game-breaking. A few bosses can use a board clear or direct damage to kill KT, but usually you get too much value from the combo. Hope they fix it for the next adventure.
There is not room for a diffuser. You went on about diffusers and so I replied. As for the skirts, they still aren't needed. The air from the radiators exits in front of the wheels. The air is then vented to go past the wheel and along the side of the body. 
It seemed weird to me to have women fawn like men do. I once had a chick say she liked me because she likes pretty boys. I didn't know how to respond to that. Unless I'm going to church *which is rare even on Easter* I don't even look in the mirror when I leave the house. A Pretty boy is the last thing I would've thought of to describe myself.
I went through a phase of having Frank's hot sauce on everything and by a phase I mean buying it by the 4 litres on amazon for £16 because I knew I would use waaay more than the £6 500ml bottles I can get in the supermarkets here.I went through a few weeks of crappy frozen pizzas drenched in Frank's and eating Frank's covered Bombay mix with a spoon.I'm proud of that time and I'd do it again.
Theres this kid at my school who is retarted (actually retarted) so he has this dog to help him out. One day somebody asked me why he has it and i tell her that he's retarted and she bitches me out and tells me to say special needs. I was pretty pissed after that one. 
We have to expect dead hookers and child porn. Lots of dead hookers and child porn. Brace yourself America. The piles of dead hookers and child porn is coming.
Funny how you're here on a pro-sanders page, attacking anyone who is against his current chief rival, almost as if it's your business to be here. The Clinton's dirty history is well known to anyone who cares to look into it, so mark the 'burden of proof' tactic off your shill account attack plan.
But we don't need to spend two first round picks in three years on guys who are going to platoon at the same position. We have too many needs for that, even though Williams would be an awesome value pick. 
i just told you what his problems were. the idea that they offer a raise to a team that has lost hard because they wanted to raise their spirits. he wants an org that wants to win, not an org who wants to just have a team. also he said they were bad to him when he wanted to leave, he was benched for a while before he was officialy released, logically it has to be because C9 was blocking it and probably using one of the "unfair clauses"(hikos words) from the player agreement to force his hand for a bit.also what do you mean buy into his mentality. if he wanted to just make money in CS he would stay on C9 where they offered a raise to just keep playing, on top of streaming he could live comfortably and probably retire without working another day in his life.
Is your marriage and relationship so fragile that you worry about a few stretch marks tearing it apart? Love (healthy love, anyway) transcends things like that all of the time. Your husband should find you MORE beautiful after you carry and birth his baby. You need to really, really talk to him about this. These concerns are troubling. Your body will change with age, likely faster than his does. If these insecurities don't get dealt with now, they will only worsen.

If you go last into the airplane, have only carry on luggage and the plane isn't completely full, you can get away easy with that in most airports here in Brazil, but you need to get lucky that they are boarding the flights at the same time. 
This isn't a question that can be answered by strangers on the internet. If what my friend tells me is true, some of the top students at Middletown are leaning towards ortho, so I think opportunities in ortho is likely at Middletown.
So my adviser is like 90% sure that I have ADHD or something. She's asked me twice now: once when I first came to this school and now, when I'm telling her about how it's hard for me to work. I sit down, and then say "Ok let's do this!" And then nothing. It sucks and I'm probably going to fail out because of it.

Hahahaha this is a common one for all of us. I have a similar story. When I was like 16 and living at home, I sleepwalked into my little bro's room and pissed on the foot of the bed he was sleeping in. Started screaming and woke me up. Jesus Fuck. It was like 3.a.m. on a schoolnight. He was probably traumatized.
I didn't say that, I'm saying nobody has empirical evidence that it's actually a positive.  It's just assumed.  A lot of the places on this map that have high rates of black mortality and racism should be evidence that maybe we shouldn't assume that.  It's also not an argument against any mixing whatsoever, but perhaps an argument against forced integration.  I certainly don't have a problem with mixing, and I live in a place that is roughly 40% Hispanic and shows up as green on the map.
Then nothing will change until it's too expensive for the company that delivers the food to do so and by then it will be too late. As long as hauling the food products aren't too expensive; they will just keep making the food they sell us worse for us. That way they can still keep making money from us and in the process make us easier to be rid of through frailty and disease. This is already starting to happen...have you ever actually been on a ramen diet for more then a few days? If you eat nothing but ramen because that's all you can afford it will fuck up your health. 
Glass! You can't keep a plastic one for more than a couple months before you need to throw it away. That becomes fairly expensive for maybe a couple uses for most people. If you can't handle a small glass vial without dropping it...I'm sorry.
1.  Zip file link is broken2.  Facebook link on his page is wrong https://www.facebook.com/friendsofbernie3.  Why are there no easy to use facebook profile pic sized images to use?  These need to be linked on the front page to get people using them on facebook.  I had to go to his facebook page and copy his.
I honestly don't think Bradford will want to play for us next year after all of this.I actually think most of our defense is going to be pretty upset about almost getting traded.
Problem is, try accessing the page when on playa with no connection! I had to help a few people on HAM radio having trouble connecting. It would be really nice to have a PDF pre-playa with all this laid out. :-)
Same thing happened with Oliver and Shado in some versions of his story. He was supposedly febrile and delerious, and she wanted his sauce because of his godlike archery proficiency mixed with hers would hopefully create some kind of genetically perfect archer baby.
There isn't actually any intangibility on grabs, otherwise you'd see some strange interactions happening with stuff like projectiles going through whiffed grabs. Its just the way the game resolves a trade with an attack and a grab.
Fuck it man. People hated on the Cowboys for taking offensive linemen the last few years and look what happened, it worked out well for them. This team has needed upgrades at OL (other than TW) for a while. Props to SM. If you're going all in on RG3, then protect him with a great OL so there are no more excuses.#HTTR
My thought exactly. Scherff is no where near the talent Williams is. However, most skins fans have been screaming for O line upgrades for a long time so I guess they'll shut up now. Still... very disappointing pick. 
I've been doing this with my writing for the last several years, and it is absolutely everything you imagine it can be. The financial stress (and it's real) is completely worth it. Worrying about money and living cheap are the only real "work" I do anymore.
Mine does the same thing. Like the others said its just blood flow to the gills. If you watch you will notice when their gills are at their brightest they will look to be longer and 'fluffier' because of the increased blood flow.
&gt;Why are there so few of youSo because you saw 4 videos on Reddit about BMW drivers being retards, they're more prevalent than the million BMWs driving around the states at any given time with no issue?
I know, right?  We need to stop sending out this message that gang rape at knife-point is an expected and acceptable behaviour in society.We also need to stop admitting that bad people exist.  If we didn't acknowledge them, they wouldn't exist.  By acknowledging crime, we are *creating and encouraging crime*.  So let's just hope for people to always behave well, and they will!
Never really had one.My father could never be one to me because of all the issues he had with *his* father. My grandfather, who was the closest thing j had to a role model, died when I was really young. I never got along with any of my uncles. I'm the oldest child, so there weren't any older brothers. All my older cousins lived in another country. I gravitated towards TV and movies a lot. Now, in my mid-twenties, the pro wrestler CM Punk inspires me to take charge of my life. 
I mean, if you have no real knowledge of astronomy there seems to be a big difference between the giant glowing thing and the tiny little pricks of light. 
I used to have an UFA with a good roll, but didn't really like it considering i used to have Shadow Price and ended up ditching it for a Vanquisher VIII. I don't regret doing it at the time as I never liked UFA, didn't do enough damage for me.
Why did you pay her back then? Just don't, you didn't ask for it. If someone wants to do something nice for you or your (ex-?)daughter, it's cause she wants to do something nice and it's a gift. Jesus. I was just gonna say to the whole scenario, is your mother worth it? It doesn't matter that your ex is crazy, and it kinda does matter your fiance is crazy. Since your mom pulls shit like this, is she worth it if she's just constantly going to through a monkey wrench into your relationship with your fiance by pulling things like this?As for your fiance, you gotta tell her to chill out and that you're not responsible for what other people do, especially your slightly messed up mother. That, and that she should be trusting enough in you and your relationship with her that she shouldn't feel threatened by something as stupid as this. Otherwise, why would she marry you if she didn't feel secure? 
I think he's gone. Its been 10 years, you can only say things so many times before players don't listen, he's hinted at being up for change. Even Scotty Bowman moved around quite a bit. End of the day Babcock is going to go where he can win, and where the money is.
Use Musicbrainz Picard to get the correct metadata info for your individual albums. I was in the same boat as you with my library until I started doing it this way. You will have to modify some content still within Plex to make it show properly, but it's much better than how it was before.
Yeah and also, one of kennens main skins is a fucking red recolor, and nor you're realising bundles of recolors. Do you something wrong here or is that just me?
For anyone else who is interested, LE also did a Top Shelf for ITG recently, the photos show lots of AB products! It's one of the few I've read and thought "I need to hear/see way more!"http://intothegloss.com/2015/04/lisa-eldridge/
That's been at the back of my mind as well...the problem is I would need to include attack and damage values for every enemy in the game. Doable, but definitely a long-term project.
I grew up on Jim Carrey's movies and shows, but I wouldn't say he's the funniest man ever (I believe that title belongs to Mitch Hedberg IMO.) What Makes Jim so unique is that he's hilarious, but he's got more control over his facial expressions than anyone I've ever seen in my entire fucking life. The dude is a fucking master at contorting his facial muscles in order to make anyone laugh. So it just depends on one's comedy preference. He's definitely a comedic genius that's for sure!
I actually found him at a TRU close to my work, while I was on a break. It was like two weeks after they were released. The guy working there had no idea where it came from. It was my first unicorn in store experience.
Do you think a competitive average is required even for faculty transfer? Or would they care less about that cap on admissions and give priority to someone who's already generally admitted to UBC and only changing faculty after 1st yr? 
If you downloaded the bootleg version of the grooveshark app, you can select your playlist (even if not offlined) and select "Export".In the case of Android, the playlist files with the names/artist/albums will be in your folders somewhere when you connect your phone to your computer.This way, at least you can have a record of all your songs.
Why did you choose poly? Were you part of a long-term partnership that chose to open up, you wanted to "get it" because you have a new poly partner, or something else? How long have you been at it? What are the better times like that make it worth it?Sorry for the interrogation - I'm just curious what makes poly worth it for people who have to work through stuff. :)
Yeah he was talking to me bro. It's common decency to TL;DR any post where you wrote an unreasonably long rant, I've just been up for like 4 days and forgot. But he reminded me so I complied. Like what if an old lady is crossing the street all slow and painful looking do you just skip by her? No reason to be rude, hell I was probably a jack ass in that rant, but I at least acknowledged it. 
  My heart goes out to him. 3 years ago,  my office manager collapsed when we were playing a game for the company football team. He suffered a stroke, an able bodied mid 30 year old man playing football.  He survived with slight paralysis on one side and couldn't return to work. Still miss that guy. Edit: downvotes really?  You heartless cunts. 
I think I have at least a little bit of a problem with this kind of review.  While price is definitely a factor in people's rating of something, this price can (almost certainly will, eventually) *change*, but the book will be stuck with all those 1 star reviews dragging down its average.  The system doesn't really allow you to review the PRICE of something without reference to the content.
Looking for information about the 'widespread rape and theft' committed by ANZAC's I came across the [Surafend affair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surafend_affair).I did not know that New Zealand ANZAC's massacred a village in retaliation for the death of a soldier.

squander? on legal fees? like every other human being that gets sued you mean? i get the podcast legal fund &amp; thought it was a good idea (as already said) to unite people, bring awareness to the issue blah blah blah. what i don't get is why he is not apologizing. that costs nothing. and having your fans fund your movie then "oh look extra movie in the can!" (newman doc) is tacky at best, shady at worst. 
To some extent he's losing on the domestic end. During his presidency the United States lost its' standing as the largest economy (now China), has a diminished middle class (Canada is No. 1) and overall declines on almost EVERY measurable social metric! His domestic political leadership is the worst among U.S Presidents, no initiative to challenge adversarial domestic political factions (the "Republicans") and some dissonance between national issues. One could almost characterize Obama as disliking being President and "idling" his way to the terms' end. 
&gt;a statewide poll in Louisiana found that nearly a third of Republicans in the Pelican State blamed President Obama for the poor federal response to Hurricane Katrina. We are becoming a third world country.
La fractura del movimiento obrero lo debilita igual, desde el punto de vista de los trabajadores es mucho mejor que haya 1 sindicato. Para mi se deberia legislar  la democratizacion interna de los sindicatos, anular listas unicas y que se fiscalice correctamente. Yo entiendo que esto protegeria al trabajdor de los arreglos sindicales. Pd. Querer desarticular la base de poder del peronismo en plena instauración  del regimen democrático  habla de una muñeca politica muy deficiente. 
I hate to call your manager out, Braves fans... but Freddi Gonzalez may be the worst manager in the history of major league baseball. How long are you guys going to put up with him? A drunk midget who never watches baseball could have known to take Shelby Miller out after that atrocious last inning and with him leading off the 6th. 
Plus the whole roast took me out of it.  Like, the fruit I get, it's whole.  But the roast was cooked.  How is it still alive?  What about crackers or protein powder, or milk?I mean, it's for kids, but even as a kid it took me out of it.
Cuddling and just chilling. I like when we have lazy days where we just play video games or watch action movies together.And this might be weird, but I really enjoy the days where we kind of do our own thing, but right beside eachother. Like I'll read a book and he'll play video games. Or sometimes we pull the smaller computer screen from our desk into the living room and play single player but in the same room. It is so nice doing alone things without ever having to be lonely.
Impressive. Make sure you kick in a little extra cash toward that mortgage (maybe bring it up to the price you would have paid in rent) so you pay it off early and pay a lot less interest. Shoutout to /r/personalfinance.Best of luck!
It's ethnocentric to judge based on *the standards* of your own culture...except thinking it's bullshit to execute people for petty crimes isn't a standard that is very unique to my culture or ethnicity, it is a standard that spans many cultures and ethnicities. It's not really judging something by your own standards if you can also throw the standards of a dozen other cultures in with it.And moral relativity is bullshit, but don't get into that argument with a philosopher.
I remember getting one of these bibles from my elementary school. Back then I was still a Christian and didn't see anything wrong with them handing out bibles in a public school, but now I realize that's what they were doing. Too late for me to do anything now, I can only hope someone stopped them at the time.
They let the 411 people go, I lived up beyond the hospital in Lincoln so I walked to work. I hated the walk home at night and I walked it for a long time, my favorite was new years eve some dude just walked up to me at lc and was like "hey"I responded with "hey, you wanna smoke?"He responded with, "sure."I gave him a couple since it was cold and midnight-thirty. He said, "thanks, I was gonna fuck you up, but you talked first" After that I went on my way to never see him again. Fuck spoklohma/spokanistan/browns addition. Seriously, fuck Spokane. Wife is from the valley and it can be Idaho for all I care Fuck that town. 
If you pull the plug, manually shut down the warframe.exe(or whatever) process or turn off your pc, it might work. Quitting won't.I did it once when I realized  I was using the wrong sigil.As for the gun, it's a good one, fun to use and personally I use my 0 forma MLG prisma gorgon when I'm doing mid level missions. It's good. Not great, good. If you need warframe slots, weapons slots or potatoes for guns you already love, it might be worth selling. If you like guns with good looks, good sound and good damage and you're willing to spare a catalyst, keep it.

SMD rework hot air gun, eg [Atten 858D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vva2t21sOAs)A paint stripper might work in a pinch if you're super careful and want to get basically everything off in one go, but a hairdryer definitely will not do the job.
I do this for meIf you get offended, you can suck on my DI don't know what you want Besides a gallon of ice creamI'll run circles around your fat assSorry for being crassBut you don't get to dictate or harass,Me or anyone else Take a look at yourselfAll you know is hate and jealousy; nothing else
The reason I like him is not that he is formidable foe to the twins,It's because what he is,he is self-center,he is sociopath,he is obsess,and he never give up,he is one of those people who try to be evil because they can,but in his case he can't but he push it so hard that he became main villain of season-1 remember that thing he said to Dipper in "Gideon rise"? "No muscle,No brain,Face it! You're nothing without the journal" we all thinking that he didn't even realize that all go back to himself,but the truth is Dipper win because he have to but Gideon he tried so hard to win without real reason to push him more than his hatred for Pines family,he even summon the most powerful demon,or use illegal weapon like dynamite while he is at zero risk in his life he actually put him self in danger just to put Pines in worse situation and no other villain can ever top that.                                                                                                           
I think anything is worth trying. Lurking here, I see good things about almost everything. Quick uninformed opinion, if dropping your rig is a common thing, look for a steel tank. If not, glass is clearly your best bet for hygiene and flavor.
Not sure. I thought it was watching cutscenes over, but you can already do that in Voyage Log. Maybe something like a replay feature where you can record your runs. Probably something that'll be implemented later along with Push notifications.
I happened to be watching a comp of their best moments of Shadow the Hedgehog and found the moment you're looking for [here!](https://youtu.be/uIp6c0ucEJ0?t=952)
My guardian was used as an anchor for a huge field covering a large section of Maryland, West Virginia and Virginia.  I got lucky, in the sense it was remote enough that the other two portals were taken out and mine was never touched.Just keep calm and keep recharging. Not much you can do otherwise.
&gt; I thought refinishing decreased value?It does, two of them have already been refinished but not done properly.&gt;How much did you pay for these originally?Less than they are worth.

&gt; I'll curl my eyelashes 1-3 times during a dateWhoa. Do you carry eyelash curlers with you?? I'm incredibly curious -- what kind of purse/bag do you carry (esp. on dates) and what's inside them?
Yeah. I'm in my 28th year, but when someone asks my age I say I'm 27. Same when you're full term, you're in your tenth month, but you're nine months pregnant.
It's not worth it. You can talk to him about it but I would not say fight. This is your fault too so you also have to accept that. It was a lot of money but you knew the risk and you took it and own up to it.
Ever since I hit MGE I've seen a huge increase in the amount of smurfs. Its actually insane. I thought that I was done seeing one every other game after passing the nova ranks.
Asimov and others failing to predict email. People are on star ships still relying on paper based messaging.  The big anachronism in Asimov though is smoking. In a small spaceship. Atomic cigarettes.
Really great post - always inmpressed that you can devlop these things so quickly.I have been working on something a LOT simpler since our conversation - just struggling with teh Twitter API at the moment - but we'll get there.

As a teacher, I find the last sentence funny. I find the first sentence tiring. I'm sure there are some good gym teachers out there. I just haven't met any.
IUDs are a pretty beautiful invention. There is a procedure done on men in India that I'd be willing to have done if it existed here, so the options wouldn't be condom or women's options.
I would be happy to help, but I'm away from my game ATM, though I was in exactly your position two nights ago and she gave me the fight of my life at 29.  I am also doing a Blades of Mercy play through at the moment (though I was waiting for phase 2 of Eileen's quest to grab them, ahem, letting Henryk do most of the heavy lifting so to speak.)It took EVERYTHING I had to beat her.  4 fire paper, 10 molotovs, 19 blood vials and a bullet in there somewhere.  I recommend the saw spear in is long form as your skill will make it hit hard, it's serrated for +20% to beasts, you can buff it, and the second part of its combo can hit her face if you aim well, and the quickstep slashes have enough reach to damage her arms.  She take a LOT more damage to body parts you have injured for a while and you might even get a visceral or two in their.But yeah I'd be happy to jump in and help if you are still having trouble later.  Good luck, it's a doozy at 29.
Yeah, a balance needs to be struck between freedom-of-association and transparency since a lot of the members of these clubs are quite powerful people. I'm not sure what I think personally: I posted the article because I think it raises some interesting questions and thought it could be a good discussion point.
Question: I was offered to be a beta tester but was afraid because I didn’t want it to mess up my note taking for school, are they usually stable builds?
Jenna came to town in 2008 when her mother married Toby's dad. The Jenna thing happened in 2009. Mrs. Cavanugh was already in Radley before all these happen. I like you theory about Black Veil being burned in the Jenna thing but it is unlikely that it's Marion.  Unless the person you are talking about is Jenna's mom whom we have never met. 
The name's a little goofy but the trailer looks solid. I recognise some of the actor's from some of Donnie's previous movies like Ip Man. I think it's just come out in HK - has anyone seen it yet?
I did send a mensage to com2us just 2 weeks ago about bluestacks. They said the only way to play in bluestacks is with modify APK files and and might ban... So continue using ur device, please. Is pretty sad when someone comes here saying about been banned
It's a bit more common than you'd think, but yeah, a lot of people talk out of their ass with their claim. Believe it or not, white shepherd/wolf hybrids are actually one of the more common mixes. You can do a GIS and find several examples that looked just like our Lady. [This one](http://www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures/gallery/dogs/all-by-photo/wolf-hybrids/wolf-hybrid-0126) is the closest that I've found. She was a very large dog with plenty of muscle bulk (totaling ~130lbs) and fairly narrow hindquarter.

It's the playoffs man, and they won't play Cleveland for a few days.  This is *why* you rest guys during the regular season.Edit: Although, as the lead grows ever bigger, I have to agree lol.  Thibs gonna Thibs though.
No one's asking about those things because they are huge divergences and people are waiting to see where they are going with those story lines.  With Balon people know how the story goes so questions are being asked.  The show established Balon as a character, established the Greyjoys as characters and just dropped them (except Theon).  Shows can't just create characters and never resolve, so this isn't a problem with book inconsistencies but rather storytelling.  My point about the leached is that the show heavily foreshadows 3 people's deaths, then 2 out those 3 die showing Melisandre's power and then they procede to ignore the third, its inconsistent.  Also you're the only one who has mentioned the importance of Balon's death and the Greyjoy's importance in the story so I don't why you keep bringing that up.  
If it was "Ich putz nur hier" it would mean "I'm only cleaning **this** spot."If it was "Nur ich putz hier" it would mean "Only **I** am cleaning here."If it was "Ich nur putz hier" it would mean you can't German
Don't worry about it. I'm sure it's just surgicel. Non-sterile gauze would be a terrible thing to pack a socket with. But ideally you'd want the socket to be pretty much healed by now. You don't wanna still be pulling stuff out of  it.
I think I had feelings similar to yours after I first listened to +-. I was kind of hoping for some of the elements that made No More Stories... (My favorite album (by any band)) their other albums great. After a few listens this really grew on me and I love it. I personally feel that Mew has done a really good job of not repeating themselves and exploring sounds that are new for them. So I would definitely recommend giving it more listens. 
You're asking for specific evidence in a game that entirely espouses answers in favor of speculation. The discussion is the point. If you look back on your responses and comments, you're less interested in discussion but half-asking for proof while also saying there is no proof and that the game is about questions.  Sorry, it's not that I don't respect your intelligence; I just feel you're kind of instigating instead of contributing.  AND NO--YOU GET TO HAVE THE LAST WORD BECAUSE I WANT TO BE THE BIGGER MAN! Honestly we're both fucked at this point--let's just admit we both failed in our goals and move on.
What a blessing in disguise. Be there for your brother he needs you and your parents more than ever right now. You've done all the right things in the past despite your parents encouragement to reconcile and stuff with his ex gf. I think right now you need to be the clear sighted voice of reason who tells your brother this girl is no good for him. Not just for his safety and well being..but the safety of your neice and the upbringing she will endure. I say this because he may be tempted to make amends for the sake of his kid. 
He argued it was entirely psychological, though, that it originated in the mind and not in the body. That was his reason for why women shouldn't use pain medication during labor.
Maybe she had thought there was enough time of silence between speaking and dying that she was able to believe that and so say it. It was said later you can lie if it is a lie that the woman believed strongly enough.
In the amount of time it takes to level a tank you'll still be waiting on those dps queue times. You get a 50% exp buff for each class lower than your main class. It would take maybe two hours to level a tank class to 15. OP, the dps wait is a reality in all mmos. If your time is that limited and you can't wait for the queues I suggest you level a tank or healer.
She does this, because, none of our phones have front cameras anymore?  Did they all vanish?  I must have one of the last ones left before the great vanishing... ITS MINE, you can't have it...
Yeah, I'm the one who got her at $6.87. She's the only one I wanted so I just went for it. Anyways, I'll stick around and let the price drop for everyone else.
Interesting, it's a record high that can never be beaten if done by percent of total skin area. I would like better "total square inches of skin" as the metric, that way it is a constantly available goal. I guess I just want to see a giant, fat tattooed person. 
I picked up a pawn shop 37 in 16ga. Not as rusty as yours, but some CLP and 0000 steel wool made it shine, even with a little rust on the barrel and receiver. Taking that approach took me about 4 hours of scrubbing but it paid off. Yours will require a little more effort to get inside and clean out things, but once it's done, you will love it! I have had fuds that are experts at all types of shotgun try and give me some pointers in the field and are baffled when I shoot it: "What shotgun is that? N'er seen one eject out the bott'm before!"
After watching Episode 9 and comprehending what Ian Frazer said about natural food products, it seems that our society has been fooled by the media to believe that just because food hasn’t been ‘genetically modified’, it is significantly better for you. I actually found it quite ironic when Ian mentioned the fact that the food we classify as ‘natural’ today has in fact been changed over the centuries. It almost seems pointless to purchase organic food for almost double the price, when in reality you are buying the same item with a different label. I definitely won’t be caught paying more for the same product in the future.      
I lived in SD at the time (thanks,  Navy! ) and was really stoked when the Chargers got him and LT. (Colts fan first,  but  i always follow local team if there is one).His first couple years were brutal though.  If Rivers hadn't held out,  Brees would probably have been benched, traded,  etc.  Drew Brees as a failed starter/journeyman backup? He owes his career to Rivers. 
there is just something fundamentally wrong with dying to the same gun 4 different times, in 4 different locations, to 4 different people, and all in less than 10 minutes. but this isn't even a random occurrence. its been happening all fucking week. granted not as rapid but this is honestly the straw that broke the camels back for me. and i thought the least i could do was try to shed some light on this problem. but fanboys gonna downvote anything they don't agree with so fuck it. until the devs wise up and stop listening to retards what is the point of playing lolz
This is the only the 2nd person to mention this that I'm aware.  One person was from the press-reveal demos -- one of about 30 different articles.  And, this is only the 2nd.  "common" this isn't.  What is common? People saying it's "magic", "works as shown" and "very cool".  That's 100% universal.  For that reason, I'm 100% sold.
My thoughts exactly. What is super painful is that there was no notice at all, I had multiple playlists with hundreds of songs in them and now I have no record of the music I listened to. One of my favorite playlists i didn't create, and it had some really good songs on it. Now I'm in a position where I don't even know the names of some of those.
I've always had this one dream (or nightmare) I never really understood that happens to me every once in a while. It always starts with me in a normal situation usually with family then I see this same person who I've never even seen in real life and they try to kill me for whatever reason. So I try to scream but nothing happens and it would always end with me waking up as I was about to die. Then one time I decided to fight back and that was probably the last time it happened.
It's not their faults. If I gave you a 4K monitor and you played on it for a year, then it died and you temporarily played in a 1080p monitor, wouldn't you think the 1080p was shitty?
Financially, it is a smart business move. He is well known and is recognized as an all around great gentleman. Mariota will bring a lot more attention to the Titans, people will buy his jersey and faithful Ducks fans will follow him. We actually become relevant. Trading for more draft picks would be great, but it is not easy to find a guy like Mariota, he is a franchise player. He is an exciting player to watch, if he is able to play to the level he did in college. We would finally be able to have interested Free Agents that want to come to Nashville.
That's not /u/Doyle211's point, though. Kishimoto would never do something as fucked up as making Sasuke put Sakura in genjutsu and make her raise Sarada.
Da sottolineare che il professor Clemens non dice mai "sì, l'Europa, il mondo e l'economia andranno alla grande e senza problemi".Continua a dire "potrebbe, dovrebbe, a lungo termine si prevede che le cose migliorino". Non ha certezze e nemmeno previsioni attendibili.

Nothing in this world enrages me more than fat people who think it's okay to ride horses. No.Despite their immense weight exceeding the horse's limits, they physically can't develop a proper seat which further distresses the animal's spine. I want to show pictures like this to my horse when he's being a brat to show him HOW BAD HE COULD HAVE IT. 
The Caddys are nice, why not.  If you wanna lease, feel free to pick your favorite German (5-series, E-Class, A6). I couldn't recommend buying a German though, not for anything past the warranty period, anyway. Are you specifically looking at sedans, or would a nice SUV be fine, too?
What can I do to help myself enjoy it? I have it and have tried on 3 different occasions to get into it. I just did not enjoy it at all. I found that traveling anywhere results in dying and fighting sucks because there's next to no ammo. I made it to the point where I was supposed to travel to the DC monument and finally quit for good because I was having zero fun. I always hear people say how amazing this game is and I'm so sad I don't enjoy it in the slightest :(
Lawyer can take care of all that, get the case dropped, charges reduced, record expunged, etc.  It's expensive, so it's definitely not my first recommendation, however in the case of family, or people who you just can't get away from, it may be worth the cost.
My guess would be it shows [asteroid 2002 MN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_MN) but I couldn't find the gif in any articles that mention it so maybe I'm wrong...
They both look like Peele though.  That's honestly what I thought it was at first.  His face spliced with two horribly plastic surgeried South American sisters I saw here a while ago.
Check out the ones on the Pauline epistles.  To be honest I can make the case from any of the series, it will sometimes be a juxtaposition of verse and an image, or any of the grey non bible text, or the titles he gives to each section.  It's about how what he's chosen to add acts as a comment on the text.
I'm sorry they're doing this to you. It's not fair. It is a game. They shouldn't be behaving like this. I think report them to the police.Maybe change up your game play and look for badge achievements for a while. I was burned out by the local ENL in my area when I was first playing. I'd stop to have a quick walk and smash some portals, before I could finish deploying on the portals a group of ENL would be there. They'd stand so close to me I'd be forced to move away to stop them from touching me. They'd also find every portal I held and take it back. It's really hard to not feel like you're personally being attacked when they do things like that.What really helped me? Connecting online with other RES agents. I have made friends in other cities and while I can't play with those agents, just doing my own thing, getting unique captures and hacks and AP has helped.Hopefully they go away. They're bullies. ENL or RES, you deserve to be able to play in safety.
OP where are you upto in terms of area? It is usually hard to find people to go through the early content, but not impossible. As others have stated #sanctuary is your best bet. 
&gt; Murder is not the point of an abortion, not being pregnant anymore is the point. Too often it seems like people miss the whole purpose of an abortion.I agree, but I think often it's seen as a convenient way to take care of both issues. And by "I think" I mean people claiming to have had abortions have stated that that's their logic on TwoX pretty regularly.
Insted of Trello, I've been using Libreboard.com, it has a similar UI, and its open source! It's just a little open spinoff, I think you guys should check it out.
Great answer and i really understand your point! There are a lot of "bad anime" being produced, just as there is normal films being produced! Character with no depth and personality seems to be a common problem that i have been running into lately.

Vince--huge fan of your work, I'm not exaggerating when I say Breaking Bad changed my life. I'm excited to see how much influence it will have on other series, as it was one of the most unprecedented things to happen to the TV/Film industry. My question is-how much knowledge did you have of the character Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill before you started filling in his backstory? I hadn't realized how little I actually knew about this character until I witnessed him as Jimmy. At the same time though, Saul seems like a natural product of Jimmy's past circumstances. 
I feel like a stream like they've been doing is better format. That way all the questions cab be answered fairly instead of having only a few circle-jerked questions while the rest are lost in the downvotes.

Actually, there are over 80 free levels. All of the red dots are, at least. Maybe this is something to pay for if your kid wants to learn programming, but the free levels are more than enough for a distraction for adults.
I confirm, you will find a lot of usefull information about caitiff on the Time of Thin Blood book. I did play as a caitiff and i handled to obtain the trust from the sheriff and i had a lot of help with characterization from that book.
As a 15m SP character I don't think it's a good idea, in my mind it's very reminiscent of the current trend in mobile games, a rush to the top, then a large plateau of maxed players staring at each other and wondering what the fuss was about, then quitting because they beat the game. You don't beat Eve, it keeps you coming back because it has depth. I'd much rather have only a handful of you 100m SP guys around then a handful quitting every week. The system in you're OP streamlines progression into a very meaningful process, simply chopping off years of that advancement doesn't, it simply throws Eve into the "fast food mmo" pool with so many others. Edit: didn't realize you were OP :/
I agree with you, think you need to swap Shannon for Kona for automode at least. Not sure about bomb damage atm but if everyone else is 6 then you should be able to farm B3. If you can do B3 in around 5min then it beats B2 in overall efficiency. Even if it's a little longer, I would do it for energy efficiency, but longer than 10min is a nono.

So I went to a catholic school where we had nuns and one of my friends got in trouble and held back from some class. When we got back he told us that she called him a smartass when his book fell of his desk saying "stop being a smartass and throwing your books. I mean its not as bad as some others but it was a nun for god sake's.
You fix this by going down on her.We all have to make sacrifices in a relationship. Which is less appealing to you - giving her oral or not getting oral (or losing her)?&gt;maybe I would come around to it in the future That means you'll never do it.&gt;if this was a deal breaker for her why is this only being brought up now?Seems it was, but not in a way that was sufficiently clear for you.You should be aware that there are a whole lot of women who want oral and consider it a dealbreaker or, at least, the price of giving men oral. No one should force you to do something you don't want, but there can be consequences to not doing what your partner wants.
nah. a good guard is the difference between the 2013 cowboys and 2014 cowboys. they can be game changers.still think it was a dumb pick, but not because he's a G.
How so? Crusader Kinds 2 came out in 2012 and they are still working on the game. The dlc packs cost what, 10 or 15. None of these dlc are required, you can pick and choose the ones you think are worth and seem enjoyable. Personally I love the way Paradox do their dlc.
I hope he does a good job on acting and producing. I also hope this is faithful. VG adaptations are notoriously awful and rarely follow the plot of the games. Hopefully this and Warcraft can carve the future for truly good VG adaptations.

Furthermore, if these beings were advanced enough to transfer their consciousness into machines, they would eventually become more and more compacted with information as the technology becomes exponentially more advanced that it could reach singularity proportions similar to what it would be like beyond the event horizon of a black whole, and they would essentially drop out of space-time at which point you might call them interdimensional travelers existing independent from reality as we know it. Whose to say these beings are even 3-dimensional? Such beings may come from a completely different universe traveling from one reality to the next or possibly creating their own. 
Double Thief all the way across the battlefield....Saboteur would certainly work.  I think Conman would be kind of funny as a name.  Pokes a little fun at our resident ninja that happens to steal being summed up as a "Thief"

I think most people aren't loling at it, it's just about the most boring position you can draft. McCloughan's resume makes him trustworthy in my book, though (something you can probably attest to). If he thinks it's the best pick, then it's probably the best pick
Not really, her pay mod was a steaming pile of garbage that was just a reminder of how shitty the entire system was. I'm not sure if she just didn't care or rushed to get it to Valve so it could be a day 1 release but it wasn't worth money...and honestly nothing shes ever created was worth money.
How hard is it to break out of Lego jail anyway? I mean, sure the Lego bars go all the way to the top, but an 11 year old could smash right through, right?
I'm actually okay with college becoming "too casual" as long as the attrition rate is brutal enough and standards are maintained; I'd sincerely prefer everyone to be capable of getting their shot, and for them to use it possibly as an adjustment opportunity to figure out what exactly they need to function as an adult in a white collar job.That doesn't mean ostentatious student loans/other issues are okay, but I'm surprisingly content (as a current college student paying his way through at a cheap uni) with it being "too casual".
Listening to the better call Saul podcasts its because they weren't allowed to name it 'Jello' which would relate to the first shot where Saul wheels the jello through the care home, mainly because Jell-o is a brand name. So they named it alpine Shepard boy which is a quote from a movie (sorry, I can't remember the name of it) and movie quotes were one of the ways they named the breaking bad episodes early on so its a sort of homage to that because they were denied their original title. That's just from the podcasts though and it wasn't talked about in huge detail, just mentioned, hope that helps a bit.

The last 18 months at that place were just plain weird. And set my professional development back by at least that much. Getting acquired will have that effect.
&gt;Since when have you been using logic?I'm done with you. Go troll someone else. You have absolutely no idea how to have an actual conversation without having to try and force it down this specific path that you have planned out in your head, and I have no desire to converse with someone who is so closed minded.I'll leave you with something to ponder. How many of these have problems with food shortages? Why do you feel so adamant that we absolutely need to subsidize these businesses? If we want to help people eat better, we give them welfare, we don't give welfare to the corporations so that they can reap maximum profits off the cheapest product, that does not help the general population. Before you jump to conclusions, I'm not saying these businesses need to be shut down, or that we shouldn't use these products, all I'm saying is that they don't need to be as cheap as the factory farming lobbyists have lead us to believe.
I think it'll be tough to top Jordan until a player is the undisputed best player on six championship teams (a 4peat would also be helpful). Once a player has done that, then you can really start to make a strong argument, assuming the player has been the best player in the league in other seasons as well.If LeBron won four titles in a row starting this season or next season, then imo he'd have a strong argument for being the GOAT.
&gt; I always use those as an example when trying to explain foreskins to people that haven't experienced them.You too?That, and a shoehorn: It coaxes things sideways so they slip into each other easily, rather than crushing against each other until something wedges its way in. 
A bunch of different groups emerged out of Ferguson after the riots there, many of whom seemed pretty radical.  A group called the Baltimore People's Power Assembly was at the center of organizing protests in Baltimore, so they might grow now.  The Bay Area has its own hodge-podge of radical organizations.  But in terms of whether there are any groups comparable to the BPP or the LRBW, definitely not--that's going to be a work in progress.
I recommend RAID 10 (striped, then mirrored vdevs). RAID Z1-Z3 are Parity RAID and, if you don't have a dedicated RAID card (you shouldn't), use CPU cycles that would be better used transcoding Plex video. FreeNAS is kinda awesome in this regard because it can treat a RAID 10 like two RAID 0's (because, when reading, a RAID 1 is basically a RAID 0 and FreeNAS can take advantage of that). So more speed &amp; you keep redundancy.The obvious negative is less storage space. You'd be stuck with 6TB then, but that's your choice to make. 
Just wait till you see the video of it making the worlds most adorable noises when I upload it to youtube and post it in the freetalk thread tomorrow. 
I understand what you are saying and I'm not trying to imply that these girls are doing this on purpose. I would like to believe that it is more than likely an absentminded behavior and not an indicator of anything else. It is uncomfortable for me when my daughter does these things and then looks at me as though she wants a reaction. She doesn't do these things all the time, only in quick instances when nobody is really paying attention. Believe me, I don't want to have any relationship other than a Father/Daughter one, but these attempts at what I think is trying to provoke a reaction out of me need to stop.
It's really hard to tell without being. It could just be that Shirin is an annoying person and doesn't know she is an annoying person, and acts a way that Will can just not tolerate. He tries to, but then snaps and lets it all out. Any other assumption based on religion needs facts to be confirmed.
Ha! Cities fix potholes, I've long given up on that happening where I live. You better learn to swerve like a pro if you're riding down anything but the main streets with bike lanes.
Right,  and 2+2=5. She said what she meant and meant what she said.  She only even attempted to clarify it 48 hours after she said it and the press, mainly drudge,  red linked it and she started getting heat for it. Not only did she say it,  her actions thus far,  by allowing the looting and rioting, speak much louder then her own words. Her actions line up perfectly to what she said. Your reality has been hacked it seems
&gt; we've got a pro bowl guard but it's a fucking guardThis thinking is why we lose all the time...Its the non-glamorous, dirty guys that will do the heavy lifting, that make the rest of the team look good. I'm okay with this pick. 
[From Dan Le Batard's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/lebatardshow):"This account is being run exclusively by disgraced Houston Rockets social media director @chadjshanks until after the Mayweather fight."
No, we gave him a one dimensional, unreliable WR that can only run one route which doesnt work in the NFL, in a draft when we could have solidified the best front 7 in the league (which is how you win superbowls if you are aware of the recent history of the NFL) in a draft where there will be amazing WRs left in the both the second AND third rounds. Fucking blew it. Big time.
The point isn't that the Enterprise wasn't renamed due to the TV show - it's that they didn't have to change any policies or make any exceptions. Hell, it's even Star Trek canon that the Enterprise in the Trek Universe is named after the space shuttle - which was named after the line of warships.
hmm... so he chose extra medpacks on Hypergeek instead of Chem grenades... I personally would have gone for the Chem just in case of a sectopod, but I guess it is a personal preference kind of thing.
I may qualified to answer this ...Long-term partner and I, we weave and dodge country to country (US, UK, DK, D, SE, A, CH) and it's critically important to keep the career going for both of you.At some point, one of you will land a job in:1. A Megalopolis (London, NYC, Tokio, etc...) where you can both gain employment.2. One of you will hit the jackpot with a job that will confer a spousal job (in Germany, this is funded by the national research council - DFG)3. 1700 miles is cake ... in the US that's only 3h time difference.4. You need to leave that US as the rail system and budget flight system is shit.
Also, to make things worse, I tried to make up for it by asking my husband to get me a [Lemon Glacier](http://d3o8wy4pib5ze2.cloudfront.net/image/x200/t/chain_menu_item/8a17fca195932b9d2ac3c6712ad41572.jpg) from the fast food joint he was going to, and those motherfuckers forgot to hand it to him so he paid for it but didn't get one! The universe is completely out to deny me lemonade today. I hate everything.
Just logged onto MUT real quick to check my draft collectibles and saw the new pack. Purchased one and pulled a Jameis Winston base card!! Should I sell it immediately? It's going for about 100k.
Why shouldn't people be allowed to take the other drugs. It's their choice after all and they're ultimately responsible for whatever happens. Why should we continue a highly costly and disastrous war for the sake of denying personal preference?
I'm probably a little late to the party, but I had a teacher's assistant shout at my friend that he was a shit-sleever. To be fair, he was being a shit-sleever.
I did some IT work for an auto dealer in Jamaica. On my off time I went on their lot and checked out their inventory (they sold used cars and Cherys).  My god the Chery's were just bad, body panels didn't line up, interior trim was missing or would fall off when you sat down and closed the door.   They also had to sell them in Kingston because they didn't have the power to make it up the mountainous roads with two people in the car.On the US side the dealer did have a used Nissan Skyline for sale which was pretty sweet.
I'll be removing this as Chapter 10 has not been fully translated yet and posting releases for Chapters ahead of previous translations are not allowed as no discussion can actually take place in such threads and in turn it it becomes redundant. Feel free to resubmit this after Chapter 10 has been completed.
I think if she changed her hair, those bangs make her look 5, she would look better.  However, I'm a female so maybe you see something I don't.  She has a great tan, thin but not that flabby thin &amp; her face seems cute ... She could have horrendous tits but there's no way to decipher that ... Kill the bangs!
I googled it, and I have to say it looks delicious. I will gladly share a rooftop with some Koreans and fire up a pit. We can share bulgogi and ribs, and bond over our shared love of the 2nd Amendment as we take spectacular hip shots at rioters. 
Can I blow your mind then? I worked as a tutor at a local community college and there was a woman I encountered who was returning to school now that her kids had all graduated. She was totally unable to understand the concept of subtraction. Whatever was happening in her mind she was not able to understand that when you do a mathematical operation you can get an answer that's less. She wouldn't even just add instead she would just answer with basically random numbers. Even after just getting her to count backwards 2 digits from 5 she would say something like, and I shit you not... 5, 4, 3 and then write down 6 on the answer sheet. She wasn't my student but another tutor's so I don't know how she turned out at the end of the year but I was there to witness the above 5-2=6 event. She nearly brought her tutor to tears after that session. 
I will also be calling tomorrow. Do you happen to have a contact number? I know it's in one of the posts on here but you seem have all the knowledge about this trade in. They just received a zinger I bought today and I just got my boxes for my 6 valets. Really wish I used the old system! I will definitely take pictures of the valets. Did you also receive duplicate emails?
I'd focus on either STR *or* DEX at this point, not both. Depending upon how much INT/ATT you have you may be able to do a majority toe-to-toe style and augment that with buffs. Either way, find a weapon who's moveset you like and level the appropriate stat. You may be set back in END/VIT if you go that path but that can be overcome.Also /u/Chettlar has a good tip in concern to a special tail weapon.

PLDT is having routing problems as of late. Some claim its some sort of upgrade. I say their aging and overloaded infastructure is finally dying from the load and they're forced to fix it.
Eh,  you can say that about anyone with any kind of addiction though,  gambling,  smoking,  drugs,  etc... Its not unique to fat peopleYour post reminded me of quitting smoking I just had to comment
The better question would be, why does he not feel comfortable asking you about things like that. Kind of a extreme case but might be a goal to reach a point where he can ask you anything without feeling guilty.
Well I can tell you what NOT to get. The ***Missha super aqua cell renew snail cream*** was expensive, heavily fragranced, and didn't seem to do much besides light moisture. x.xAs for a suggestion, I am just now trying the ***Skinfood watery berry*** line: the toner and emulsion. The toner seemed kinda meh. The emulsion is very light in texture, kind of liquidy, but very moisturizing (and also heavily fragranced in case you're sensitive to that). IIRC watery berry has hyaluronic acid, which is very good for moisturizing. Looking outside of this line, look for hyaluronic acid, sometimes in the form of sodium hyaluronate. :D
That's how Kirby came to be my main! I got Melee when I was young, and I loved Kirby games. So I just decided to play as Kirby, and he's been my main ever since.
So this doesn't warrant its own post, but a guy I know from college made a [fake Hawk Harrelson Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=7722290&amp;fref=ts) that over the years has accrued a following of people who think it's actually him. Well, tonight, "Hawk" had [this to say about gay baseball players](http://i.imgur.com/JwofsmF.png). Needless to say, some his elderly followers were a little unhappy...

By shifting his mana ratios into AP ratios and giving him 30% CDR passively, he has very directly been pushed towards a more traditional mage build.  No longer will he deal high late-game damage with 200 armor and high HP.The problem is mage Ryze is pretty crappy.  He's low range, low cc and his damage is much lower when his passive isn't up.  He somewhat like Cassiopeia in as a high DPS mage, but neither is viable because low mobility, low range squishies have a very high threshold to see play.  I was optimistic when I started playing with him. but the stylistic changes hurt his early game and the numerical changes hurt his mid and late games.

It turns on Lightning Bolt? So Lightning Bolt is useless if it cannot be used on a creature with toughness 3 or less? If you can't bolt their threats, you just bolt them directly. And it's not a circlejerk, it is just a poor argument. It is like trying to argue that God is real because you can't disprove it. It's true that you can't disprove it, but it doesn't prove he is real. Same for the dies to removal argument. Yes, Confidant does die to removal, but it doesn't make him a bad card.
i cant help but think that the moons around the blue ringed planet would look better if they where not lined up like that. the rest of the planets don't follow the in game system map style why stick with it for this one? I love everything else about it and thats not even that much of a complaint just a small detail i felt i had to mention. I especially like the detail on the larger planets. 
I haven't watched past the first few episodes of Better Call Saul, so sorry if this has already happened.  Is Crazy 8 going to make an appearance like Tuco did?

It's hard to say between the overlapping regions. I'd say he's the best midlaner in NA. As for EU, xPeke might still be better but they haven't matched up in ages. PoE and Feb1ven are good but a lot more inexperienced. Fox and Soren are solid, but not good enough to match up with Bjergsen.
Look up Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and SoftwareOnce you've read that, check out The Elements Of Computing Systems. Read the Amazon reviews for these two books to get an idea for their reputation.
That's how it went. Cavill was expecting to stay the same size for the sequel but when Affleck met with the crew after training Cavill realised his mistake. I love the fact that they were in competition
Yeah, that'd be like some idiot governor from Texas with only a string of failed business ventures under his belt winning because he had a good GOP pedigree...Do you remember the punchline to *that* particular joke?
Yes, I think Elomi and Goddess typically have wide wires.I mention the full coverage bit because IMO UK brands tend to fit more full coverage than Cacique does, and it DRIVES ME NUTS.I think in Panache or Freya, you'd want the same size. One thing I didn't mention, though, is bands - Cacique is middle of the road stretchy IMO while Panache (and Cleo) can be quite firm and Freya is known to be stretchy.Oh, and Parfait is probably an option too. I have their Charlotte plunge, and I needed to size up in both band (firm elastic band across the bottom dug in a bit, so I wear it with an extender - if you measure closer to a 38 rather than sizing down for stretch this might not be the case) and cups (narrow enough but quite shallow, but gives a nice round shape for me).And of course, if you want to order from Poland, Ewa Michalak is amazing.
I have many friends in many different corps and am marching myself and I've only heard people from troop talk about this so I think this is a troopers thing. 
From what I've seen is that in reality this sort of shared viciousness reinforces and emboldens the participants. People almost sort of one-up each other.I appreciate your point, and if people shared your attitude it probably wouldn't be a problem. But from what I've seen negativity breeds more negativity.
Mid alche is really fun to play and is pretty good at mid. I went just greevil got bot bounty rune and then got stout branches tango into bottle, brown boots, midas then farmed aghs for my team and worked pretty well. Just maxed Q and E and didnt get stun until i started to fight and seemed that all you need to farm well is bottle, boots, midas getting enough runes let me just farm jungle for a while and even though i died a few times i got three aghs for my team by 25 min. http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1435668717 WD with a 13 min aghs is pretty insane as well.
Alright, this is going to fuck with a lot of you but **The New York Rangers**Now based on the rivalry between our teams I should want permanent last place finishes for them but I don't. The problem is that there isn't much of a rivalry between our teams. The games are missing the spark, energy and aggression that we used to see. The rivalry means more to the fans and GMs than it does to the players. So I hope that the Rangers win the cup this year, enjoy their time in the spotlight in hope that it sparks a fire for the Devils players to really put a emphasis in the cross river games and start showing up for them. 
&gt;What if we gave them incentive to work harder?They'll probably work harder.  Responding to incentives is a part of human nature and one of the core precepts of economics.&gt; Is your point that simply telling somebody to do something is always ineffective?Pretty much, yeah.
Im an introvert sober. I like space and peace and would rather most of my days alone. When I do go out, I am the most social person in the world I love company and dont ever want to be alone.

I just looked up the original WWE Network release statement, and I confused the 1-week trial for the 1-month trial. My bad, dude.     I still don't mind though, I pay for it because I think it's worth it.  What new fans are getting isn't my concern. 
Correct. Someone's misplaced empathy just meant this goose will waste a decent amount of time and energy trying to hatch items that will not hatch. They've also put her in danger, because nesting and incubation is a vulnerable time for birds. Another fine example of human emotion harming natural processes.

Yeah, I dont see how this is worse than JR Smith losing his cool, punching a guy, taking him out of the game and having a long record in the past.I can't see it being more than 1-2 games.
I'd be fine with it. How could they possibly utilize all of that talent on the Dline or keep it long term? Not to mention they'd be over investing in one personnel group and neglecting a bunch of others.
Up until a few months ago I didn't even know you could hold B and flail it around, it thought it was the most useless move in the game, not that I think it's a whole lot better than I originally thought.

[ECHELON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON) used to be a crazy conspiracy theory that only crazy people believed in because it's just so crazy. Naming his company IP-Echelon was a bold move, and more than a little ironic. I bet he didn't pay any royalties for using that name.
I thought about that, but decided I didn't want an $800 ticket, even if the odd were slim.  Happy a hell now, I rolled into a Cummins and went ahead and splurged to get them to put the pump on the APU.  Money well spent, now I'm happy.

Bard was a really cool specialization - I'm thinking specifically about the Marjolaine fight, where she brought in guards to attack you, but she herself (who was still the boss of the fight) had no armor or weapons, but just sustained that one Bard ability that stuns everyone around you repeatedly and constantly, which made her actually pretty challenging to fight. (Or maybe I just suck. :P)

So in theory, it sounds great. But the people that seem to succeed on Airbnb treat it like another job... like they are part-time hotel manager. That means they're cleaning, coordinating, available for questions about the city, providing internet access and marketing their room. If you're alright with all that, then go for it. 
&gt;...if Apple is found guilty of spreading gay propaganda to Russia’s youth it could be forced to stop operating in the country for 90 days and pay a fine of up to 1 million rubles (or $19,400 in American dollars, which Tim Cook could likely pay directly in cash from his wallet if you asked him right now).Lol please kick Apple out of Russia for 90 days. The west is evil until Russians realize they make your phones and iPads. It would be interesting to see Russia isolate themselves to a point where they are forced to use domestically produced tech. What's Russian equivalent of an iPhone?
I know the EVGA G1 won't be able to do it due to the 20A 12V rails.http://www.evga.com/support/manuals/files/120-G1-0750.pdfThe PS 1000 does 83A on a single 12V rail. http://www.evga.com/support/manuals/files/220-PS-1000.pdfThe only thing to keep in mind is that you need to use two pcie cables. Essentially this is a crossfire card and each 8 pin power connector should be a separate cable.I've never owned a 295x2 and I'm no expert on PSU's but this is what I got from googling away. I guess he could just save the hassle and throw in two GTX 970's. 
Batteries degrade over time, so you have to plan for that too.  I mean, if you need a minimum of 100 MWh storage and your system can only give you 50 MWh, it doesn't do what you need it to do.  And then there are leakage rates.  If you need to be able to hold the charge for 7 days and by day 5 you only have 80% of what you need, you don't have what you need.  Pumped water is still the way to go if it's available in my opinion.  But, none of the solutions may meet the needs of utilities economically.  That's what California utilities decided.  Maybe they'll change their mind at some point, but even utilities with access to pumped water didn't go for it.

Well I am glad you brought up Oakland. What Occupy Oakland accomplished was nothing short of the very thing I have been trying to say which is civil disobedience. Occupy Oakland did not loot stores or burn down businesses. They trashed a few police cars and used their numbers to shut down the city. The same type of behaviors can very well happen with Baltimore. Yes, there has been peaceful protest, and while it is not covered, it is because they lack numbers. I heard some people argue that the senseless rioting and looting finally gave attention to the issues, but I also think it polarized people too.

Oh my gosh. I don't think I've really suggested that I consider myself a "special little snowflake" beyond mentioning my gender. Also, how is rape against females not a gendered issue when it's predominantly men who are raping females? I mean, if anything this sounds like a men's issue, not a women's one. Ya'll don't seem to be doing a very good job about it though, since it's still happening at alarming rates and women are still being told to not walk in certain places and not wear certain things etcetcetc.Maybe we should just wear full body clothing that doesn't reveal our gender at all and like, never leave the house and only talk to guys our parents approve of? Just to be safe! Lol. Seriously though, you sound super salty there.

I used to love playing with Lego as a child. I know however will never use the product if I ever have kids. The reason is that one summer I went to Lego land and was denied entry because I did not have a child with me. I guess they wrongly assumed I was there to molest some kids. It is there policy they said. I hope a meteor hits these cock suckers right where it counts.
Although this is common practice, strictly speaking (at least in the UK, probably everywhere else too) flashing your lights is only supposed to be done to alert another road user of your presence. In reality people flash their lights for a multitude of reasons, including warning of speed cameras and expressing annoyance. Interpreting it as a gesture of giving way is risky.

First date, I always went to this bar I used to work at.  It's small and relatively unknown, not too loud, great food, and everyone there knows me so I look super cool and popular.  During dinner, I would hint at the fact that I had a hot tub.
I don't think anyone can argue that it's not a perfectly fine thing to look at and go "Huh, that's interesting."  You don't seem to be claiming it's much more than that.What kind of decisions do you think the Bechdel test should inform?Even though I lean more towards the MRA side, I would agree that a lot of media sucks at writing woman characters.  Though I would question how much of that is because they feel compelled to treat them with kid gloves to avoid offence, so their ability to make them interesting is hampered.  At least, I feel this plays a part when it comes to children's media.But I would love to see more and more interesting female characters in shows and movies.
The cops in my city did exactly this and didn't even bother to cover it up. Basically said "yeah. We did that. We can do that. Suck it."Story:They were tracking a suspect. They got the idea that the suspect had entered a back yard. A back yard with a locked gate and a "beware of dog" sign. Did they bother to... Knock? Nope. They hopped the fence and let the other cop with the k9 in. Well, the chained up dog that lived in that yard got in a fight with the police dog. The cops shot the chained up dog in it's own fenced yard. The suspect wasn't there. The suspect was NEVER there. Someone's dog got murdered because the cops wanted to be cowboys instead of just knocking on the damn door.Good job regina police service. This is the kind of reason why you're becoming a bigger joke in the eyes of the community every single day.
If you're having trouble with the Frozen City, grab a shotgun or slugger!The ricochet properties of both and the small level size make it easy to cover the area with shells, whilst sluggers are a death sentence to the Snowbots and Snowtanks; Robot wolves are more agile, but you can save your shells by using a bullet weapon - something fast! Paired with Trigger Finger, the plentiful one-shots mean you can clear out threats without fear of being caught reloading.If you can grab an Assault Slugger or Gatling Slugger, Lil Hunter becomes almost trivial - just remember to prioritise Snowbots and Wolves first, clearing as many out as possible before Hunter lands! 
Seeing as though TSM clean sweeped competitors at their most recent LAN, and choking online against Na'Vi, twice, in the past few weeks, leads me to believe that (as of now) TSM is a better LAN team. Arguments can be made for either side, that's just my opinion :)
Cocaine. And you don't even need a prescription! Jk but seriously good on you!! Keep it up! I know it's hard as hell. I would love to go home after work, smoke and eat pizza but I head to the gym for an hour and a half instead. THEN I go home, smoke and eat pizza ;)
That makes sense.Your point about meat being such a big part of the food budget is part of what worries me. Isn't meat one of the big ones that's getting cut?And I'm worried that since it's exactly the cheap produce that farmers won't grow, it's the stuff bought by poor families that will go up in price--the people who stand to actually have their budgets be affected will not be able to consume as much other product.But anyway, you have said lots of smart stuff. Have a &amp;#8710;
Time-based updates only work when you're not hard-pressed to release new features every time you make an update. If they could make a weekly release every Monday where they simply added everything that was ready at that time, even if it was only bug fixes, and things that weren't ready just had to wait until the next week or whenever they were ready, it would work perfectly. But they can't just go a week without adding new content so the whole time-based merges thing kind of screws them over.
Smoker just needs to master his fruit more so much can be done with smoke. Think about it smoke contains many chemicals is generally Hot, and Toxic. Additionally the defensive capabilites he can make use of are many. Smoker just hasn't scratched the surface of his fruit his Jutte, Haki and time in logue town has imo hindered his growth 
Wearing a trench coat; check.Neckbeard; check.Talks about "chivalry"; check.All that's missing is the fedora and whining that, "nice guys always get stuck in 'the friend zone'."
I love all the branded merch that is coming out! If we could've sold cannabis related products at our shows back in the 70s...http://rawthentic.com/raw-life/raw-wiz/
&gt;...he's voted against a lot of free trade agreements, wants to withdraw from the WTO, and voted for tariffs against money manipulators, meaning China.TIL The WTO, self-serving trade agreements and currency manipulators = free trade.  They don't...far from it.  Remember, private sector elements are just as capable of compromising free market/trade behavior as any public sector entity could.  That hardly makes them free trade friendly either.
I had one while I was watching a film with my dad :-) ended up digging my nails into my flesh so much I drew blood. Do you worry about school a lot? What about it sets you off? 
We don't really want to take unnecessary damage here, especially if it leaves us cold to Stormbreath Dragon.We have no high curves cards in hand, and have plenty of plays for the next few turns without needing to draw into more land.
It's probably just like getting sprayed with pepper spray down there.  Or maybe similar to when you eat really spicy food and then rub your eyes.  The capsaicin (molecule that gives spicy food its spice) is a general irritant to a lot of things.  Also, vaginas are naturally somewhat acidic, not a crazy level though (not sure how it compares with saliva)

Thats what i thought too, I am also an undergraduate mechanical im guessing ill take this course next semester, fluid mechanics wasnt as hard as vibration, which im taking now.
Thanks for the SD tip! Will use for listening purposes :DI guess the bandwidth saving makes sense for mobile users, but it would still be good if it was under the settings tab for people who definitely watch videos through :D
In Austin, TX this has been enforced but police have mistaken ppl taking or having phones in their hand by ppl messing with their hair or things like that... Yeeeeeaaaahhhh
From my own non-indian perspective I would say that Indians have it much worse.Just look how much disrespect indians get on the bodybuilding.com forums, where an asian guy like alan aragon can thrive

True, but every one of those violent revolutions has just involved putting some new assholes in charge.People tend to forget that even the fabled American Revolution just lead to a bunch of rich land and slave owners gaining the power.A true revolution, one that will change the very foundation of what it means to be human, cannot come from violence.
There are actually quite a bit for me that I really like as a character, but generally don't use for one reason or another.The Herons (really all dancers for the most part), Wallace, Renault, Dozla, actually most of the rest of my list is made up of pre-promotes. They're not all necessarily bad, but I've always been nervous around pre-promotes after my first experience with FE.
&gt;if you do well enough on the physics GREThis is definitely not true.. If you do poorly on the pGRE, you will lose out. If you do well on the pGRE, it just keeps you in the game. It's the years of research experience that will win an offer for a student. Also, a score of 800~990 is definitely not hard for a decent American student. I am not sure why we always tell students that it's okay to aim lower..
When it comes to early man...I'm not so sure they were consuming dairy though...like milk. Which means they probably didn't have butter or cheese in their diet. 
Here in Canada we had rebate forms for the HP 5510 when it was sold a couple years back. There was no recycle printer SKU to ring up, just give the customer the form and they submitted it with the receipt of their purchase.I suppose if the Rebate Fulfillment centre wanted to audit the rebates they could, but almost every store that sold the HP 5510, even Costco, was giving out rebate forms.
Lol really? If my gf and I broke up my friends would not be friends with her afterwards. Same with her friends. Why do chicks always try and fuck with a guys friends after a break up. Leave him and his friends/family alone ffs.
The Black Mages is the rock band formed by Nobuo Uematsu, composer (or at least consultant on) almost every Final Fantasy.I love this live rendition of "Dancing Mad," the final boss battle theme from Final Fantasy 6, a true marathon of a fight.Second half of the song [is here.](http://youtu.be/0dMmN8d8TDg)

To each his own. As long as you hold an opinion such as this and leave no wiggle room the cycle will not be broken. And that applies to both Israelis and Palestinians who may share similar entrenched sentiment
Pretty foolish how confident Bulls fans are right now. The best team in the NBA can't make a 40 point comeback? Fuck outta here, as far as I am concerned the Bulls are the ones with their backs against the wall right now.
10,000 of those little plastic bouncy balls. That would be epic seeing how high they all bounce...or disintigrate or splat as the case may be. No, physics isn't my thing but it's fun as hell to think about them bouncing everywhere.
I haven't learned that much about security, but creating viruses seems interesting. There is CCSP, but there is also CEH, CISSP, etc. I wasn't sure what "infosec" entailed. I was talking with a guy who wanted to get into security (currently IT director), but he said he hated networking stuff, so that confused me.

Coding is **awesome**!!!! You be proud of those skillz, bro! And then we'll bring you over to the dark side of skincare and have you using masks and vit c serums. ;)
Exactly the same experience. I find that I cant stand having a watch on my left arm without feeling weird all day so, after a day on my left arm, I switched to see if the experience was different. Honestly, the only thing I found to be different was the fact that the scroll position indicator doesn't line up perfectly with the digital crown any more (one of those subtle Apple design choices you don't realize until it changes) and stays in its normal top-right position where the crown should be, but that probably doesn't matter to anyone other than myself.
No need to edit if you haven't already.  I didn't take offense, it just sounds like there's a few different stories out there.   I hadn't heard what Gilligan said about the Inland Empire, and in my mind it had always been San Fernando Valley because that's what I heard Cranston say many years ago.  Carry on :)
H2K was made up of a bunch of people from prior LCS teams and C9-Eclipse and I can't even think of anything in NA that would really compare. You can't take chances between Spring and Summer split with worlds on the line it's just stupid lol. Will CLG get first I doubt it. Will any team not named TSM get first? Also doubtful. There's just no moves that will get them anywhere meaningful so why bother. If the teammates want to stay together then let them. 
Given that this isn't exactly a high traffic subreddit, I don't think it does any harm getting a local perspective/ get anecdotal accounts/ start a discussion on a topic that may be of interest, regardless of the fact that Google is available. If your question regards Perth, you may get a more concise answer asking here.After all, /r/askscience would be virtually obsolete if you if you discounted questions that could be answered with Google. But it's often interesting seeing questions that I haven't considered, when they come up in my feed.
I actually had netherlands form in my game, though weak, after Austria inherited Burgundy. I was the Hansa, and my dutch provinces kept revolting, so France and I double teamed them and broke them. 
Weird, because I was playing Oracle and didn't have that problem. Which means it's a bug with the item itself and not its interaction with specific heroes. 
This was also posted on the Etsy community and apparently it will only affect those making over $100,000 a year. Still complete and utter bullshit though - thought you all should know about it! 
Come on, man. I know that. But like, which player is it supposed to be for? Or is it just like in general? WHO ARE WE TOO LATE FOR? I NEED TO UNDERSTAND.
It's never a guarantee that your extra hours and commitment will pay off. In my first job I worked a great deal of overtime but I lacked visibility (that is, management was non-technical and had no idea what I was doing). If you're learning a lot, having fun, and you don't mind working extra go ahead. Bonus points if your boss appreciates you. 
I resent the fact that you're pinning the fact that they have 'zero respect for authority' on the fact that they have no father figure. The idea that you need a father figure to teach you right from wrong, to respect authority is, quite frankly, bullshit.
I love the name Sam but don't like Samuel and only kind of like Samson.  Sam Crevan sounds nice, I like the sound and meaning of the name Crevan but when I google it I can barely find any info on it, which isn't a bad thing - I love really uncommon rarely used names
Negatory - Purple Guy and Phone Guy cannot be the same person because we know how phone guy and purple guy died. With purple guy, there was a struggle and then he laughed, audibly. Phone guy simply was stuffed into a suit. Furthermore, I believe that phone guy is a subordinate of Purple Guy because he never claims ownership, so someone needs to be above him

I feel like giving angled armor a notable advantage was the cherry on top of the pie that is War Thunder's ballistics calculations.They didn't stop there either, they added that glorious beast with [freaking rockets on its turret](http://warthunder.com/en/devblog/current/775) to #reckt everything with curved armor or not. They put that cherry on top, and are selling golf clubs with which to whack it off.

I'm in ! I was thinking it was a pipedream you deciding to run.I will be supporting you. There is no way I am supporting another Clinton or Bush. Two peas in the same pod. Corporate war mongering gigolos.
I will 100% certainly be the last person to press. Powerlanguage even alluded to waiting for the Pressiah. That person wouldn't just be some ahole with a low time because we would have found that person already. 
I moved 1000 miles to a county in Montana with 13% unemployment after the crash in 2009. I had no job, no money, and a worthless BA. I'm still here, married, have a son, and a job I like doing. It was/is hard as hell...and worth every second. Everyone thought I was nuts. Now they want to move here. Sometimes you have to roll the hard six. 
The Man From Earth is one of my favorites and I tend to think the low budget aspect is part of it's charm. Another amazing atheist film is "God On Trial." It is based on the play by the same name.
I work with a 24 year old who has 2 kids from 2 different men, still going around with random guys. Whenever she's within earshot of the rest of us making plans to go out, she will never fail to mention something along the lines of "You guys are so lucky you don't have kids so you can go out whenever you want." It's like, girl please. I wasn't the one who doesn't know how to use protection, not get knocked up, and be stuck a single mother of 2 who longs to be free of responsibilities.
We've discussed this and totally for it, but I want to do 13week stints for travel nursing.  Kinda live place to place wherever I am signed a contract.  
And the world also widely considers homosexuality a sin. Doesn't mean it's right. Appealing to popularity as a validation of an opinion is a poor argument. 
Right now if you own a bike, all of you, take a fucking picture with your phone of your serial number. At the very least this will help you. It did me. Dude wanted proof and  i showed with proof from a brand new pic of a bike followed by date stamped serial numbers. Either way he was a POS and it was all a distraction while my buddy grabbed my bike back.
Im pretty sure a larger percentage of gay people understand that others can be attracted to a different gender than they are than straight people do seeing as homophobia is more prevalent than heterophobia. 
Nope, you've got it right: the Cobra is a ship that lets you do *anything*. Well, maybe not high-profit-through-volume commodity trading, but yes for pretty much everything else. I've got 25 million in the bank and another 40+ million invested in various ships... and right now, I'm flying a Cobra.
Isn't there some WoJ that says the magic community will be exposed to the world and wont be able to be covered up? If that happens I'd assume she plays a big role.
For a really high winding engine, I can see revised gearing being appropriate. I remember some cars back in the day also didn't always like shifting much at higher RPMs, I wonder if they've maybe tweaked the syncros and/or whatever else you do for a trans you expect to be shifted at high RPMs regularly.  I think I heard some things about clutch windage/vacuum sometimes even being a thing once you get up a bit. 
Man that's *bad!* I made fun of someone's stutter by *accident* once and I *still* feel bad. How could someone do that to a child and not feel like shit?
A vote you have to pay for????  I think you need to say that in the post since your post does not meet our requirements.. You need to tell a story and let people know it cost money
Honestly I don't remember, and I can't think of any reason why I wrote what I did to get that number. I'm going to change it to make it clear that it is more nonsense than the other (still silly) numbers.
It is a known irritant, penetration enhancer and damages the skin barrier - this may not be obvious to the naked eye. Small amounts are not likely to do any harm but I never recommend products with larger amounts, certainly not in products that should be reapplied, like sunscreen.I also notice having a sunscreen with alcohol leaves people with no options if something goes wrong: Say they over exfoliate or get a surprise allergy, then sunscreen is burning and worsening the problem.
Haha sorry i forgot. It was a really weird situation. On incoming i did L tatsu into shinku hadoken and aimed it straight down. When the opponent came in the landed on my right side away from when i was facing but was getting clipped by the beam! Ill try and record it tonight to show you. 
Yep, they all are HA, or at least should be. No egg moves on any of them unfortunately. I do also have an HA Eevee that I can breed, although not in a dream ball or with any egg moves.[Here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gNT6FpRjfbOz8aI45_K7veI1oEZeHfy4vi-HxfkE2NA/edit?usp=sharing) a spreadsheet I made of all my HA pokemon.
Thx.  For me, it depends on the number of pics.  If it's less than 7 or 8, then I'm with you, cause I know I'm gonna see the result soon.  More than that, I want to see the after so I can decide if it's something that interest me.  I definitely see your point, tho'.
I have given you an example of an entire nation - a nation with a lot of rural &amp; dangerous urban area, like America - being mass-shooting free because of gun control. We don't have school shootings, or shootings in cinemas. The rough urban areas aren't riddled with guns. People can still own guns for hunting &amp; animal control. I'm no psychologist, but the fact that you feel the need to carry a destructive, life-ending weapon for no good reason - &amp; you have offered no good reason - suggests that you are a violent little man. I feel sorry for you, your family &amp; the person you inevitably end up killing. 
Im nof sure if it is something psychological,  but you may have a interuption in spinal nerves in your sacral area that deals with the reproductive organs. I suggest getting xrays of your spine and making sure your alignment is correct. 
I think you're splitting hairs.  Your concern was getting enough food.  Whether you want to maintain or gain is irrelevant if "1 protein" doesn't meet your goal.  But hey, thanks for the fitness lesson champ.
Our problem was we had logic in the middle of views. It was awful. We're doing our best to fix this, and feel free to look at our stuff between 2.11 and 12. That was our first real attempt at fixing this. We're all on github, so if you want to have a look, or even better, offer some suggestions, please don't hesitate!
I love love love the new movies. It's flashy yes, its action packed yes...but to me it's still Star Trek. Trek for a new generation. Remember all the grumbling when TNG came out? All was fine and the franchise thrived. Hoping for another great round of NuTrek movies.

I was so desperate to get the fuck out of there the first that I left with thousands of useless as fuck Sierra Madre chips, never looked for the snowglobe, and only had like 4 gold bars. I didn't even loot Father Elijah, I just fucking ran. 
Yeah, the smashing of the guy's phone at the end was the icing on the cake... it was purely out of spite, they could have just as easily handed it back nicely. Is this what David Simon calls a "humble"? (https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/04/29/david-simon-on-baltimore-s-anguish)

I was thinking more build a giant metal cage capable of holding 1000+ people shoulder to shoulder and dip it in the ocean for 15 minutes, open the bottom and dump, rinse, repeat.
I think it may also be that some songs they release now may have been good if they were from 20 years ago, but now they feel like rehash even if they are good. Love and Peace, we get it already.That being said, The Joshua Tree is so much better than their recent stuff.
You can work in the design side for a contractor or engineering firm. You can get into compliance via the city/town, third party firm, engineering firm, or insurance.Large manufacturers typically have subject matter experts, researchers, development.You can go into law enforcement like the atf or state agencies to do arson investigationTesting and listing like underwriters laboratory or FM Global.The military and particularly the US Coast Guard have fire protection engineers. The federal government has the GSO.It also depends on what are of fire protection you want to deal with. Active fire protection like fire alarms, suppression systems, and smoke management. Passive fire protection like building construction, and smoke management. Or become very knowledgeable about the building codes.
Indeed. Sempre pensei que podia usar as duas formas do participio passado, desconhecia que só uma é que estava correcta.Mas pronto, que todos os problemas de português fossem deste tipo... 
&gt; Me and the Warlock had a bit of a scuffle over whether he adds both his Charisma modifier and proficiency bonus to his spell damage roll, or just the former.Actually, you don't add either of them to spell *damage* rolls.The Agonizing Blast invocation lets you add your CHA to the damage of Eldritch Blast, but it still doesn't affect any other spells.
Agree. There should be zero action taken unless a court convicts an individual of a crime. The only exceptions are non-criminal activities that are still against school policies.

I used to buy rice wine and do this but once I got more money in game I felt it was a waste of time/resources since I could better make money elsewhere. The reason people buy rice wine from the TP is because it is usually one of the listed ingredients on the cooking guides but the cost of the time to waypoint and find the merchant outweighs spending a few extra copper to buy it from the trading post. 
Fair enough. Obviously it depends on your use and VR is definitely not universally enjoyable, since there are still issues with headaches and the like. I'd define entertainment as interactive in VR. If it is simply putting a normal movie then there is no benefit in that versus a big screen like you have. However, with 360 videos becoming more prevalent and even interactive animated movies, along with games, it is a very enjoyable and affordable device IMO.
Same! I love it - wasn't bashing at all above, that was aimed at the M9. I have a OnePlus too, but in the end I got won over by the 6. Got it on launch day too, and I'm deeming it a great successor to my 4s.
Chat on IRC. Reddit. Watch anime. Maybe play a game or two. I generally don't feel bad about it because I find it just as fulfilling as others find extreme sports.My excuse *would* be that it's good to unwind and do something simple for once, except that "for once" has been going on for two years now.
If you compare the time it takes to get 75 woodcutting and start chopping magic trees to the time it takes to get the stats and gear needed to farm Zulrah, you would've chopped way more logs than you think. When chopping magic trees, you are usually watching Netflix and mindlessly checking the game every couple of minutes, you can't do that with Zulrah. You are also spending money to get those resources through supplies and armor repair.
-- to you. Value and cost are subjective. To me (and probably to a few others), the skin has some value and the cost is negligible. You are welcome to have your own perception of ‘worth’, and so are we.
You're right, there is a new message in the protocol (24326) that they pass the location of the teslas, traps, and the castle garrison in.They've removed the teslas and traps from the scout message (25000) but not, for some reason, the garrison data. 
It's okay. I read Twilight. I actually had fun doing it, too! The horror ;_;. (I never defend it, though. Just was able to have a good time with it.)
Born and raised in Northern Virginia (mainly in Springfield). I wanted to try and get out of my comfort zone a bit and decided to take a teaching position down here. I don't know how long I'll reside here, but I'm definitely enjoying Richmond so far!
It's just some slang basic bitches (and I do mean bitches) came up with trying to be clever. Observe that top comment: "if you don't know, you probably are one hurrrr." Then they circle shlick and congratulate themselves. Really, it's unimportant and means nothing, a lot like the sluts that use the term. Ignore them and move on.Edit: Downvote away, cunts. Point proven.
I became a fan of WE too. I followed them a bit after IEM to see if it was a fluke that they beat GET or if they were actually good. After IEM, WE actually had a pretty good record in lpl. I think they had the 2nd or 3rd best W/L from coming back from IEM to playoffs.I also really want to see SKT at MSI. The midlaner showdowns at that event would be sick.
"the tag simply caught my attention"&gt;"Interesting. Animal rights.. pedophilia... animal rights...Oh yeah we're all fucking morons mate, good one!! You clearly meant nothing by it!! Smug asshole
If i just use the matchmaking in the game, team deathmatch still has thousands of players. Stuff like domination is usually pretty easy to get into as well. 
OK, I kinda hate to admit this but I need help with Push. I fucking love MNIMN but I've never taken the time to get much deeper into his music. Where do I start? How many albums do I need to chase down? 
&gt;Dylin hesitated for a moment, then said, “Then, I’ll go with you to the Infernal Realm.”TarossexDylin giving LinleyxOlivier a run for its money. Guess Ren has got fanfic material for the next April fool's chapters... and it'll be just as hard to tell if it is real or not. (ಠ_ಠ)
Yeah, lol I like that plan. And I also thought that with 25$on the line I got nothing to lose answering some questions,  I'm cureous how much they will send since they said (paraphrase) "up to 2500 neucoin depending on how much effort you put into your answers" 
I just looked at the dresscode for the Ballet Society of CS -- it's crazy! &gt;Dancers are required to wear **canvas, split-sole slippers** that enhance their training, movement and appearance. Ballet slippers are the most important part of your dancer’s equipment and can seriously affect their ability to articulate foot movement. Although there are many brands of canvas slippers that will work, the following brands are not approved: Bloch “elastopsplit X”, Grishko, and Russian Pointe.This sounds far too prescriptive to be a fun class.  
I don't usually mind fools being parted from their money; in fact I normally welcome it, but pretensions of bottled water consumers affect sensible people too.
That's why I asked if he was an employee or a student in a dorm.  In my mind there is a big difference in privacy expectation between getting mail at an employee's office and a student getting mail at their place of residence.

The next episode, Graybles 1000+, is likely set a thousand years in the future, so there's that.There have been time skips and adult Finn in the comics.
Well with calorie counting, if you exercise you can eat more, which is a big reason why I exercise. I love to eat. What matters is your deficit, not your caloric goal. Eating 2000 calories a day, and exercising 800 off is better than just eating 1200 a day with no exercise. 
News flash when you fuck over the people you are supposed to protect they get pissed. When you rig an entire power structure against them and they see no hope for change they become violent.
On my Find my Friends list, I have my wife, my brother and sister, my parents, and 3 or 4o friends.  It's a massive convenience.When my daughter get a phone, we will likely add her to the list too.  It wouldn't be about spying or constant monitoring, just like it isn't between my wife and I, or my friends and I, or my parents and I.  It's just a convenience.If she requested we don't have that capability, I'd certainly entertain the idea, if she could present a case for it.  Simply wanting privacy may even be enough.
I only speak from my own experience, but in the engineering faculty no one seemed to give a shit about that stuff beyond first year. Absolutely no one cares in the industry.Maybe other faculties and industries are different.
So, if I get it right, Vietnam is only communist/socialist in name? You don't have democracy, you still have money, and capitalists invest in the country.
This fine Israeli is a scumbag with a capital "S!" He donated hundreds of millions to the RMoney campaign in exchange for an unbreakable promise for a war with Iran when RMoney became president (it was still looking good for the nutso Mormon at that juncture).Luckily, both pieces of shit lost their bets.
Large parts of the Satanic Bible were taken directly from Might Is Right by Ragnar Redbeard (Arthur Desmond). Might Is Right is the foundation of the social Darwinist philosophy.LaVey edited (censored) large excepts from the book, removing opinions about race, women, Jews, etc.In other words, Satanism is Darwinist but without that pesky, politically incorrect concept of "inequality".
&gt; Which is very understandable since winforms is a much older technology, and they've probably been working on all that way before WPF was a thing.Ok you now are just changing your argument.  I said that the control suites were not at parity in 2009.  You asked for examples and I provided them.  &gt; None of that makes winforms less uselessYou apparently have a strong inflexible opinion on this so there's no point in arguing.
MJ only lost the years when his team was not good enough to win. When he had a good enough team, he won, point blank period. Lebron has had a good enough team at least 2 times and he didn't win (Mavs, Spurs)
Ah, ok. I kinda had a feeling that gentrification was driving people to neighborhoods like that because it's cheap.&gt;Also, Principal Skinner would like to see you in his office. lol
I have met many people who have been told by their doctor to "you must take your adderall/vyvanse daily." While they only combat a rise in tolerance by ever-increasing dosages. I'm sure ADD is a difficult and debilitating disorder, but (to cite someones actual prescription) 70g vyvanse in the morning followed by a 20mg IR Addy dose at noon topped off with Ambien to sleep is NOT even close to a solution. And it's scary that doctors seem to explain it as "cure" rather than a short term bandage. It should only be offered in conjunction with other methods of therapy like cognition/retention  training.But it's also nice to have a multitude of cheap, pharm-grade amps floating around the country.
Hmm the website lists these as viable courses.&gt;English: ENG4C, ENG4U, ENG4G, ENG4A&gt;Physics: SPH3U, SPH4C, SPH4U, SPH4G, SPH4A&gt;Math: MCT4C, MGA4U, MDM4U, MCV4U, MHF4U, MCB4U, MTT4G, MAT4A, MCR3U, MAP4C (with minimum 70%), MCF3M (with minimum 65%)From memory (waiting for my transcript to arrive), I recall getting a 79 in eng4u. 75~80 in grade 11 and 12 physics (university level, don't remember the code), 90 in advanced functions (MHf4u I think), and like 65 in calculus (I can't find the code for this).Think I'll be ok?I also had a bunch of 90's in computer related courses... hope they'll look at that haha.

Looks like a peanut butter mixed with play dough consistency... just as advertised... and looks same as I recieved.  For the price can you complain about potency?  Also next time ask him to put in one larger parchment (he might prepack his stuff I dunno) but he seemed nice enought he would.  
Well Danielous appears pretty often on that list, not sure if its because of him having a bunch of money or other reasons ;)Either way, enjoy your trade retirement ;) Remember I am always open for a chat :p
President Davidyan: More like a sugar coated land grab. It looks like you Turks learned some old tricks from your former masters in Washington. What's next? False claims of WMDs? Give me a break!
You know what my father taught me when I was like 18? Are you getting what you agreed to? Then don't complain. Worry about yourself not what others are getting.I'll add one more question. Do you want the Network and the WWE to succeed? Then let them do what they think they need to do. Unless you'd like to go back to paying $55 for PPV's.

Anyone know, or hazard an educated guess: What will happen to our 5-day solo characters? They get integrated into the base leagues, or are they gone for good?
This R1 doesn't seem to sound as deep and throaty as the old crossplane R1. Maybe having a single pipe as opposed to two causes low frequency sound waves to destructively interfere.
I can't attest to the Devacut just yet, but I can say that none of the stylists at Ulta near me are trained in cutting curls. Believe me, I tried years ago and found out the hard way. And they charged the hell out of me (thick hair, more $). I would try the DevaCut, even if it is more expensive. 
The shock should act as a deterrent, certainly did with the husky but she was soft as anything. Honestly I would go over and tell them they need to dig the fencing into the ground but provided OP with some other plausible alternatives 
I already installed the update to my main hard drive, so I'm not sure how accurate a number I can provide.I unplugged my hard drive, and connected a USB flash drive. It asked for a drive with at least 190MB free. I'll actually go through the download and update, and see what kind of data it uses.
The riot in Huntington was well-documented and played on the news several times. There are also plenty of factors that make the Huntington riot much less severe than the Baltimore ones (No injuries, lasted less than a day, had nothing to do with race or hate). And once you take into account the fact that the rioters in Baltimore are supposedly rioting over a black man killed by police, something that the media has been covering (sadly) much too often lately, it makes perfect sense for their to be less coverage of the Huntington riot than there is of the Baltimore riots. I don't disagree with the message he is trying to get across, but it is done poorly.
I had the same exact issue exactly a year ago and ended up in the ER for a night because I thought my heart was pooping out on me. After they ran some tests they found I was normal and sent me home when my heart rate went down. I was instructed to see my family doctor to get more hell. I was given Lexapro 10mg and 30 Xanax tablets (.25 mg) when I started having the panic attacks. My doctor begged me to see a therapist, but I didn't until February of this year. One thing therapy made me realize is my anxiety isn't about my heart or general health, it's an innate need/want to control everything around me. I grew up in a very unstable home as a kid, so it made sense to want to control my surroundings to make sure nothing bad would happen. 
Is this another attempt by the agricultural PR front to distract Californians from the fact that all of the water is getting poured on almond trees and alfalfa fields? Because bottled water is *not* significant in the scheme of things, and there was another attempt a few days ago to incite anger at Nestle for bottled water...

*As Jason comforts Tay, she continues bracing her head. Her body wanted to cry, but her head was in so much pain that her thoughts could think of nothing else other than 'make it stop.' She had stopped asking it to as well after a few moments, but the pain was not becoming any easier to bear.**When Jason asked Laura about how far away the nearest hospital was she looked to him concerned, but it was becoming more apparent he valued Taylor just as much as her mother did.* "At least ten minutes away if you're commuting normally. The ambulance should be here in a minute if they left when you called them." *She puts her hand to Taylor's shoulder, attempting to comfort her however she could.

&gt; modern tiptronic systemsHell no. Modern tiptronic systems are absolutely garbage. Unless you mean a DCT (which is entirely different), tiptronic does nothing more than pushing the automatic lever into one of the lower auto gears.
Is there any documentation of what the inside of these vans look like? If he was on the floor, handcuffed, and not strapped in he could have hit his head in a stroke of terrible luck. I am curious to see what these vans look like and where the exposed bolts are... I would assume the prisoner compartments are "child proof" to prevent this kind of thing.
Talk it over with your peers in your design group, the people you're studying with and doing the assignment with.  Ask them* Should we intentionally violate the command to use exactly 1 resistor, exactly 1 inductor, and exactly 1 capacitor??    * If yes, what alternative circuit topology should we try?  {which three circuit topologies should we try?}
George shouldn't be left to die by an act of omission. People tend to forget about adoption, but depending on the situation, the feedback can be very negative or pitiful. It's a sad world and the baby shouldn't have been bad. on a side note, the typical teenager acts of pregnancy and sex are ridiculous. Combine these with a selfishness and young aged attitude, it makes for horrible thoughts.  
I think this should be rephrased to 'I think the state of American politics more closely resembles a Plutocracy because of the power of corporate money, interest groups, and the media.' I don't think anyone here would dispute this. That said, your solution would involve a transition so drastic that it's not really feasible. The wealthy and powerful have always run and manipulated organized society, so no one is going to suggest that it's even the best idea. &gt;It should be illegal to lend money and/or no "funding" agencies should be allowed. So, normal people will have the chance at least to be heard.How would you enforce this? The only way you could do that is the government itself. And if you give them the precedent to do that, that's a pretty good way to keep new movements and ideas under wraps, wouldn't you say?&gt;I believe in individuals not a group of money driven people. The honest people among them have no chance to survive.What? Where do you think power comes from?
so what are the "spices"? the ingredients for fire sauce includes jalapeno peppers. weird that no peppers are in these ingredients. what makes it spicy?
There are probably over a billion people who would give up everything to be American.  These blacks are here and this is what they do.  I'm glad Obama identifies himself as black.  That way he doesn't have to make some fake statement about how much he cares about the victims here.
I remainder them being sad yet hopeful, particularly the prequels because you knew they where doomed to fail. I really don't want to go back, I have the lego movie for that.    
A quick google gave [this](http://japanesepccompendium.blogspot.com/2013/10/giten-megami-tensei-tokyo-mokushiroku.html) as the first result. This has a download link that might be it, though I have no idea what I'm looking at or how I should go about playing this.
My impression is the downvote button shouldn't be used to indicate disagreement, it should be used when a comment isn't adding to the conversation.While I disagree with ihsw's post, it's arguably adding more to the conversation than a one-liner asking if anyone else is pissed off with the Russians.

This is most likely an upgrade, but it seems stupid when Steelback hadn't really done anything wrong. Fnatic played great this split and looked like they were only going to get better, but now they've mixed it up again. I'm sure it will work out, but it still seems pretty scumbaggy when Steelback did everything he was asked to..
Not really enjoying it. My 100sl for pvp easily gets outshined by the most basic chikage builds. Spells don't do enough damage and you're pretty much forced to use a +10 ludwigs if you want any chance at competitive damage.
Now I know how dlift held his ground at LCS for so long. He's the true entertainer. Gotta love him making a fool of himself over and over and over keke

Just an update, I talked with Linda at TFA today.* Greek Yogurt **does not** contain acetoin or acetyl propionyl!* The cereal flavors were all released (quietly) a few weeks ago and sold out very quickly. New stock on May 7.

You might consider Morrowind. It has a lot of different environments (desert, swamp, island urban) and offers many RPG elements such as character customization, skill points and branching NPC dialogue.
I have learned to never expect much from the Bucks though. Not saying we can't/won't be good, but I have had high hopes crushed before. Here is to a fun series that was chippy but got a little too out of hand in the end.
Why don't they know the difference?Maybe if they paid attention in school or hell even went to school they would understand it?That's also making the assumption that they even care about laws.By all mean keep trying to excuse and defend their actions.
I never said poor people shouldn't go to college. My point is that people shouldn't complain about their debt if they choose to take it on. And people who say there are no other alternatives are foolish. I understand that rich people have a step up on people, and that seems unfair, but why wouldn't they have a step up on people? Money solves tons of problems. That's the point of getting rich.
FPs are also optional, and can contain some incomplete features  (try out session recording in 7.6, blast from the past).  Understandable that many choose not to implement a fp
We wouldn't.We either have replicated all of the functionality or are working on a system to replicate it and will have it within a few years.* As a heavy launch vessel the SLS out does it.* Dragon will be a more reusable launch vessel* As a crew launch vessel the dragon2 matches it's crew capacity AND has a crew escape functionality, something the shuttle was sorely missing.* Orion can goto deep space something the shuttle couldn't* The ISS has more science labs/functionality than the shuttle and stays in orbit. Also has coffee now.The shuttle was designed as a all round vehicle and in my very humble and amateur opinion was so far ahead of it's time that it came woefully short of meeting it's requirements.
Not really trolling, i was asking politely at the start if they were considering any anti cheat to take action against the cheaters in GTA:O i asked a legitimate question, instead of an answer, i just got the timeout, after that, maybe i was trolling a bit, because of the way they behaved.
Maybe if you went on /r/monsterhunterclan and found a group it would go better, because 2 minutes per run x 5 runs comes out to 10 minutes, which is your estimate for one solo run.
There used to be, AFAIK.   Hell, even in the Bible, when Jesus outlaws divorce (probably one of the most strict interpretations of marriage in human history), He makes an exception for a cheating wife.  Feminism has drove the world mad.
Yea if they didnt get me so into nintendo in general again, i wouldnt have bought any new games or the new 3ds. Wii fit amiibo made me start thinkin about wii fit again and so i got wii fit u and im staying with it. So amiibos also made me fit

It also goes the other way, though. I have a store in mind near me that goes out of their way to charge about 5-10x market value for comics that they think the public will assume are "rare."Any "value" is to be taken with a grain of salt, regardless of the source. I've got a copy of The Walking Dead #1 and it's market value is between 1000-1200... but I probably owuldn't be able to sell it for more than 750.
Due to the insular nature of the Jewish community, identification of Jewish DNA seems to be fairly reliable.  So you very likely have Jewish heritage.  However, three percent is too small to attempt an estimate of how far back you would have to go to find it.  It could be a great-great-grandparent, or it could be much, much further back, beyond the scope of modern genealogy.There is no way to narrow down which branches of your tree it could have come from without testing relatives.Also, I'm not sure what you mean by Celtic blood.  Are you referring to the 22 percent Irish?  That is far too high a percentage to attribute to vikings.
I would like to add to this that the people who store data that gets stolen should be held liable as well. In the past year my data has been stolen 3x once from my insurer, once from my landlord, and once from my car dealer. Each one sent me a letter offering me credit protection service.These people allowed their systems to be non-secure. Punish them.
Flight Simulator X is a good starting point, and you can branch out as you decide what you like in a simulator.As for hardware and peripherals, absolutely get yourself a HOTAS.  The price has been coming back down on the [Thrustmaster T-Flight](http://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-Flight-Hotas-Flight-Playstation-3/dp/B001CXYMFS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430441120&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=t+flight+hotas), which is a fantastic setup for the money.  If you don't want a setup with a throttle, at least get yourself a good joystick.  Depending on how you want to sim, you may make the switch to a yoke, pedals, etc.

Even $100 seems kinda high for me. Some of them are just prints for 100-200. I figure I can do paper cuts around one I print out in a nice font for like $5 tops. 
I recently checked into this issue with regard to my insurance. For them, they said the vet has the final word. Of course when I took my puppy to the vet, they just asked me to put down what mix I thought she was.
Yes, and I feel sorry for all of them. Maybe after he grew up to be the person he is, his adoptive mother tried to pawn him back off to his biological mother.
"Well come on that's just evil." *Jax says softly into her faunas ears as she leans back against him, running the water over the soap to begin to get it sudsy.* "I thought you just liked the company but now I know you really just like driving me crazy." *Jax says with a soft chuckle as he brings the soap to her skin, gently rubbing it over his lovers body, starting at the collarbone and making small oscillations on the way down to her sizable bust.*
Am I the only one who found it majorly hypocritical of Dan to talk to Shirin and apologize for what Will did and what not when he attacked Jenn just a few episodes back?
That was definitely not acceptable. They mentioned on commentary multiple times that he was an ex WWE superstar who went to Japan and has come back, so they weren't trying to dance around it. However, fans chanting Albert was the primary thing that killed his push when he returned.
Also.. What if you get the urge to play again? Do you just say: "oh, I formally quit last year, I can't allow myself to touch it."? It's such a strange thing to me.

I used to love .73mm Tortex/Ultex for 10 years I never used anything else...then I got a Jazzmaster instead of a guitar with humbuckers and can't use anything other than the .73 Dunlop Nylons. They are more flexible than the Tortex, and take some of the harsh edge off from the single coils. Soon after I switched, I found out most people who have Jazzmasters use nylons for what I assume is a similar reason.
Here is the one that I have just been trying out:[Dragadin](http://i.imgur.com/NDRtuvG.png?1)I managed to tilt a game in my favour against a druid by getting a solemn vigil down to 1 mana, drawing a dragon consort to discount a hungry dragon, with the coghammer already equipped to kill off the 1-drop. Only running 1 solemn vigil for now because I am going to be keeping the lay on hands in there. With the Azure Drakes also in there I don't struggle for card draw.
No, that is a basic programing class. My basic computer science class forbid variable assignment for the first few weeks because we were doing dataflow in a lisp dialect.
I'm not attempting to be confrontational, but you're making it sound like they have a large development team, when as far as I know they don't. They certainly have the resources to hire more people, which is another matter entirely, but at present they only have a few people working on the PC game.
I was thinking a skill and # of games ceiling, say max 1000 games and gold being the top rank to be mentored. This is not set in stone though, and the entire process is going to change as I materialize it in the next few days. I am elated by the number of Diamond/Master/GM players willing to help!
I'd hit it like 10, 15 times easy.  7 billion people in the world, the odds of any of those 100-150 people being close to me are virtually nil.  I'll risk it.But only like that much, I'm not greedy.

No. I've been to the Studio Movie Grill once and the Venetian Theater here in Carrollton once. Never again; what a fucking rip off. And no, I don't buy popcorn or sodas in the theater either. I'm an adult, I can go two hours without shoving something in my mouth. 
would it have cost at least 30G to buy the barrel? if not then no he is a brat. unless you massively favor the merchants and the players are paying more than they can get then it's not unreasonable. 
I guess it was only just a dream... But Dupree + Gurley/Gordon would have been awesome. I love Fowler though, super happy that we got him. At best, we can get double-digit sacks. At worse, he's at least a competitor that can stop the run and disrupt the QB. Chris Clemons will help him quite a bit.
I hate (insert ethnic group here).I can't stand it when people say racist things. Yeah, I understand how stereotypes work, but I hate it when people hate an entire demographic based on one bad experience or general stereotypes.
What really bugs me is places like Whole Foods (who I've tweeted repeatedly about) place these right in with the non-dairy milks. I wonder how many people grab these by accident? I bet it'll take a lawsuit from someone with an allergy to move these away. =(And it's such a dumb idea. It's almond milk with skim milk powder and lactose added:&gt; INGREDIENTS: FORTIFIED ALMOND BEVERAGE (ALMOND BASE (FILTERED WATER, ALMONDS), CANE SUGAR, TRICALCIUM PHOSPHATE, CANOLA LECITHIN AND/OR SUNFLOWER LECITHIN, SALT, GELLAN GUM, NATURAL FLAVOUR, CARRAGEENAN, SODIUM BICARBONATE, VITAMIN A PALMITATE, ZINC GLUCONATE, RIBOFLAVIN, VITAMIN D, VITAMIN B12), SKIM MILK POWDER, LACTOSE.Funnily, they don't even list it on the Earth's Own site, it has its own site: http://amoredairy.com/
nahh, spotify is a piece of shit.they trick you into getting hooked and after 6 months they inform you your trial has expired and you only may listen to a few hours of music a week
I figured English was not his first language. He seemed to struggle to find words for most responses. Hodgman ignored many of bad comic timing comments.
[This](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/217980-controldragonpaladin-brm) is a pre-Blackrock build that was more or less what I was running originally. Since you've already gotten to Nefarian, though I'd say you might have more of these cards in [this build.](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/217980-controldragonpaladin-brm) A lot of subsitutions could probably be effectively made there. You could put pretty much any dragon in besides Nefarian and be fine. 
That would be waterbending.  You can use it to bloodbend and puppet people.  If you're really good, you can mindbend people so they're no longer benders.

That you're safe from lightning in your car not because of rubber tires but because the car acts like a faraday cage and redirects lightning around you. If you were wearing a suit of metal armor that Knights wore you'd also be safe because the electricit would go through the suit rather than your flesh.http://youtu.be/eNxDgd3D_bU
yes sorry i must have read it wrong before.  it is specifically referring to a brethalyzer and not a field sobriety test.  so your arguement that "it" is voluntary in the state of alabama unless you are under 21 or on parole is wrong since we are discussing field sobriety tests and not breathalyzer tests.
http://nypost.com/2015/04/30/baltimore-police-hand-report-on-freddie-gray-death-to-prosecutor/Not only did Gray torture and strangle himself, he then used the last bit of Negro magic to make 3 different cops forget a stop.Remember, the cops will all get off , the people of Baltimore know this and their fucking pissed. Then again you'll believe all cops are saints up until they break into your house and kill your dog.
The pay was terrible and the sole reason why I didn't accept the offer in the end. I think it came out to around 1500$-1600$ a month (in Canadian dollars). There was no relocation either. However, I don't have much experience and was only applying to a staff associate/level1 position. 
How effective are airbrakes in real life?  What did Squad model inaccurately to make this exploit (/amazing invention) possible?  Did they just make a configuration number too big or small, or is it something more fundamental, like treating a nonlinear system as linear?
I don't see Fenix losing to ltk in a bo3 for obvious reasons, they are on another level.  the 74-26 odds are justified in my book, going med on Fenix.e: typo
Given that 'faith as belief without evidence' is far removed from the official meaning of faith for almost all Christian sects, and so you're in the position of being technically correct most of the time, why do you want your view changed?
"*I guess you right. Worked very hard on new Flight model and visual effect. However, I cannot let you go. You did not economy change and make RP gain lower to increase grind. As we know, grind make game longer, make game more fun. People do not like playing game like Battlefield 4. Campaign, too short. If you make grind longer, then maybe... two days maximum*"
There's a few improvements in the gen 2(08 and on) but nothing dramatic aside from the body work.  The latest year supposedly has better suspension though. 11k is pretty low for a klr that looks like it's been well maintained. 
UD is in DELAWARE, RU is in NEW JERSEYIt is like comparing a 4 bedroom house in Delaware vs. a 4 bedroom house in NJ. We make more money then people in delaware.
I've gotten great use out of [HP's Instant Ink program](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-cheap-printer/), which is a ink subscription service that tracks pages printed, regardless of quality or quantity of ink used, for a monthly fee.The cheapest plan gets you 50 pages for $3/month, a really good deal for color printing.
Ah okay, my bad - I thought you were just taking the piss!But yeah, you are mistaken. There are other boxers out there that can take the mantle of 'PPV King' and keep the sport alive after Mayweather and Pacquiao retire. For example, look at Alvarez who is only 24 and is already considered one of boxing's biggest draws!Hope this helps.
This was actually attempted in the late 90's.  Initially the results were spectacular.  However, those with hives quickly rushed to find solutions.  Burt's bee's then mashed 1.5 times the bees created in order to supply sufficient face cream.  Bear populations were the worst affected by the tragedy as the drop in honey production resulted in mass bear starvation.
It can work that way, if you have a credit card. Thing is, you need to have a good history of paying people back. An alien concept for a lot of these assholes, I'm sure. 
The late morning/early afternoon post-church Sunday crowd is one of the rudest, bitchiest subsections of people I've interacted with in retail, food service, or anything at all.
Agreed, your point on the fuzziness of values is definitely valid and would be an interesting problem to try and deal with. I just thought I'd point out that most of the values you listed as 'not available' typically are, at least in a 'fuzzed' state.
If they can differentiate between legitimate/illegitimate changes by eyeballing the account details while you wait then it must be trivial matter and easy to automate.If they haven't then I expect that either they weighed the options and decided they will keep more money this way or it is a legal requirement.
I was just looking at it more closely and noticed a small hairline crack near the handle that is on the side of the pan. Do you know if this can be repaired?http://imgur.com/3lp2ijg

Thanks for posting! I have some more interpretations:&gt;100,000 recitations of Vajrasattva's hundred-syllable mantra (purifying hatred/aversion)Can be a general purification of karma. Also used to repair samaya.&gt;100,000 mandala offerings (purifying attachment)Generally used as a way to accumulate merit.&gt;100,000 guru yoga practices (purifying delusion)Usually this number is higher. It may be calculated by doing 100,000 per syllable of the mantra used in GY. Such as 1.2M repitions of the vajra guru mantra (12 syllable mantra).
Fallout 3 blew me away. Every single second was just a joy. I've played through NV and it didn't have the same feel, but it was also a wonderful experience.Never played two, but one is great after you get passed the learning curve.

Your mentioning ladders gave me an idea, so last night we trained on deploying water from up a ladder, getting people comfortable with that, good incentive for pump operator to pay attention. Was realistic and useful. Thanks. 
I'm down except for the very first point. Can someone explain how tighter border control is bad in this context? I don't want Mexican cartels smuggling drugs into the country.
With the proprietary nature of Apple products, I wouldn't think they would be very open to having to conform to the SYNC system in order to be used with Ford vehicles. Shouldn't it be the other way around, given how much power Apple has nowadays?

Have you considered making a Male Nen? I havent looked into the play styles of each, but i heard M.Nens are pretty decent. Maybe you would have a better time with him
The i7 can't possibly reach that clock speed on a chipset that is rated for much lower voltages! Heck, if H97 mobos are power locked to 1.2V, this could very well mean that it could fail the POST, or at the very least put huge strain on the MOSFETs, if it can even run at the base clock speed. You might as well opt for a B85 chipset;Workstation GPUs usually support much deeper colour ranges, or have specialised compute capabilities (double precission or mixed). The 970 is only a good value from a gamer's perspective, and that only for 1080p, since it could run into that caching issue at higher resolutions... Hence why it's something OP should be aware of when buying a GPU with a 12bit colour depth. After all, he will be using it for image and video processing...
Yep. In fact if you and your friend played an elaborate ruse on an otherwise unsuspecting person, such that you wooed said person as a joke, had your friend dress up as a priest, and you got a marriage license with the mark, you and your friend can cop to the ruse all you want -- if your victim thought it was real, it was real.
Yeeeah, I had the opposite. Only picked Morrigan and Alistair for origins (like the others fine, but I wouldn't call them favorites); 2 had me picking Fenris, Aveline, Carver, and Varric, and inquisition got me picking like....six characters? Cole, Dorian, Josephine, Leliana (who I previously didn't like much), Solas and iron bull--and oddly enough, not Varric. Dunno why.
Most 450 or 1350 IP champions are generally easy to use and can still be effective. Annie is straightforward, teaches how to CS (with her q refunding mana) and you can just spam everything on one target to be effective and 100-0 them. Taric is how I started playing, just stun the enemy and heal your teammate and walk around doing whatever you want.

Open them on a level 50 character if you can. For doublons and linens. I don't like to sell them to TP. It's a small gamble I take. T6 materials are also nice though. It's your choice to open on 50 or 80 depending on if you are going after a colossus or if you are short on t6.
Man I learned that lesson with Brawl. When Smash 4 came around, I knew I wasn't buying anything until I had already had a chance to play it and knew I liked it (I didn't).
It just seems way more prevalent with straight guys. I just know so many of them like this. Gay guys will either walk, or have a open relationship. If it's not working sex wise, we breakup but still remain friends.
I think the great thing about the scarlet letter is that it can be taken both ways! Hester was forced to wear the scarlet letter in shame but when the town saw what a wonderful person she was, they started saying that it meant "Able" and looked up to her. Hams should be ashamed of themselves, but if they lose weight and prove themselves, they too can be useful.
Be careful with this. What PCI scanner are you using? If you disable TLS 1.0 support, you're going to access via some web browsers. IIRC you're going to break IE 8 - 10 under Windows 7 by disallowing TLS 1.0. If you're not allowing your users to use the sslvpn portal via web browser you're going to be okay.
I took it to mean WWE is phony, like how they all told him he had the match of the card and was the real main event, or how they all just were phonies but not that wrestling is phony. It's phony if you believe they don't listen to the fans too but I'm not sure about that.
See I asked general chat about this and basically got ignored or told I couldn't until a higher level. But good to know, I'll try finding a wiki or something to figure out where to go.
x3840? so 2 1080 monitors? that's awesome that your framerates were so high... wouldn't it have made your targeting reticle get split by the bezels though? Or is that a resolution you can hit with an ultrawide monitor?

My in-laws were also told by a psychologist that my brother in law, who recently graduated from college, would never go to college.I think some psychologists are under the impression that they possess some kind of super human level of insight about others.

What the fuck is Miller getting pumped about he gave up an HR to the pitcher. It's like a safety dancing around after he tackles a guy for a 26 yard gain.
It's not really like Far Cry 4. I loved FC4 a whole bunch but other than being FPS games I found very little between it and Borderlands to be similar. It's more along the lines of playing a FPS with RPG elements. If you ever played Mass Effect or Diablo it's more like those two than the former.

Doesn't look like Skyrim. I know a lot of ENBs, and this isn't one. The twigs under the snow isn't in any mods, since it would take so long to put twigs under all snow. The trees in the distance are a different type than in Skyrim, though the other ones could have been a bigger trees mod. And finally, I know Skyrim's landscape, and this isn't a location in Skyrim.
Man seriously, time is a cheat?  If your going to play the time card I revert back to my previous comment about not using any tools or sites.  The fact that yourself probabaly does, its irrelevant how long it takes you to process it.As Schwoates comments above, using the steam browser you dont need to even alt tab, is that also cheating ?Lets agree to disagree.
Nobody here wants to have one except maybe you. All I see is ," bernie good" no reason why. I know he's a socialist and a fascist. And don't fuckin call me a republican lol , that seems to be everybodies go to when they disagree. 
The actual type returned by find_first_of should not be assumed to be an int - in fact it is almost certainly not an int - so for platforms where it isn't (most, or all) you need to use the string::size_type typedef to guarantee your code will work without horrible and hard-to-diagnose problems like the meaning of -1 (a possible value for npos) for that type.
IIRC there was a terror mission in TNX that ended with a dead MSGT and Beagle ragequitting to go kill aliens in Beyond Earth.Then in L&amp;I you got the classic Frag's Finest (losing Frag was a disaster, damnit!), the Mumbai trainyard terror and that landed large where he got out-ayy'd and somehow managed to trigger the outsider post first while cut off from the LZ.
When I was in middle school, a family member of mine was one of my teachers.  I was in that rough puberty phase with the acne and the glasses.  After getting my hair cut short (I am female), the family member teaching me confronted me one day by picking me up from school and roasting me about how all of my teachers were saying I was homosexual and that it was reflecting badly on her.  I was forced into a makeover that I didn't want and spiraled into a dark depressive period that very nearly ended in suicide.  Twelve years later, I am more horrified that my teachers spent time debating the sexual preferences of an 11 year old than anything else.  
Kiwi here, we vary between football and soccer. I've noticed that most people who call it "soccer" are rugby fans who wank over how much they love rugby. *they even sometimes have the nerve to call rugby "football"!* cunts.
True. I guess I was trying to say we didn't have rioters over the situation even though there was and still is a split amongst the community on this incident. But I shouldn't lump protesters and rioters together
Outside of LA, SoCal reminds me a lot of Texas. It's the only other area I could ever imagine living in. I'll actually be going to San Diego again next month.

After calming down a bit, I do like Amari Cooper and he'll be great with Derek Carr. There really must be some major concerns with Leornard Williams with him falling out of the top 5.
We have had frank conversations. Hell I spent the night at their homes, worked on their cars with em. We went hunting and fishing. I think a lot if this shit is more rural vs city. People don't trust others in cramped and diverse areas like cities. You know I tell a cop what I'm doing when reaching for my wallet too right? It's being decent since he doesn't know me. I keep my hands in my pockets in a store too. No need to finger everything I'm not buying. I don't attack citizens at random when walking around neighborhoods just because they followed me. Good way to get shot for being a idiot. You seem to have a victim complex. Like you expect the worse or only you do these things because of your race. I do the same shit. It's called being a decent human and not trying to cause drama when none is warranted. 
Fallout 3. Fallout 3 has a lot more to it that just makes it an all around better game.For example, the game is set in DC. You get to wander the capital of the US and look at all these amazing buildings and sights, all blown down or degraded due to the nuclear wars. Not to mention the story is a lot better and the game is harder (which adds to the survival aspect of the game).Fallout NV is set in the desert, so other than the actual city of vegas (which is separated by 3 loading screens and massive doors) is bland and repetitive. It's basically all desert, sand, and boring atmosphere.
Yep.   You sound picky too, which is understandable, I'm the same way, don't put up with drama b.s.  Try exchanging digits and feel em out through text, in your hermit hideaway.   Then you can go with your gut.  This shot's for you, fucker! 
That being said, most of the time the disc will have the copyright release on the label... "Holder may reproduce pictures on disc at any retail location" or something like that.  I see that a lot with wedding photos.
I'll use it when it gets swipe too. I only have one thumb and typing traditionally is massively slow. Not to mention a bit uncomfortable on my note 3.Honestly my biggest problem is having to actively gesture to go to the next word, as opposed to the Google keyboard where you just lift your finger. 
I don't know very much about the application process, but does this seem a little low for a requirement (the GPA, I mean) for [University of Manchester] (http://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/international/country-specific-information/usa.htm?page=2) ? &gt;We require a minimum high school GPA of 3.0. We ask for SAT I Math, Verbal and Critical Writing, with a minimum score of 600 in each. 
I had a gym teacher do the opposite. We had a special ed student in my class and another kid made fun of him. The gym teacher grabbed the bully by the arms, pinned him up against the wall, and screamed "DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN!"
Yeah, and it is not like the FBI doesn't want to bust cops for violent acts, because in many cases they do.  It is just a bitch to prove because qualified immunity in most of the USA is bulletproof in court.  The FBI would be a hella lot more useful if we reexamined qualified immunity, and gave the FBI a bone to chew on when civil rights are violated.  
This argument amounts to:I know one thing, therefore I know all things.More specifically: I have the ability to know one thing, therefore I have the ability to know all things.Premise 4 does not follow from 3.

Depending on how he's looking to buy it, you may end up paying the same by buying ARR now and then HW separately later. In fact, both Amazon and Steam has the ARR game for under $20 on any platform right now, and the HW expansion will be $40. So, it would be the same cost if you buy them separately or together.Plus, new copies of ARR come with the 30-days free, so you won't start paying a subscription right away. Not sure if the bundle has that perk, my guess is it does, but it's not stated on the product page. (Edit: The Amazon page states that the bundle also has the 30 days free.)If your friend is set on the bundle, what he can do (if he hasn't already) is play the trial for 2 weeks before the release. He'll be maxed at level 20, along with other restrictions, but he could start a character and at least get a small head start on the game. Note that characters are only stored for up to 45 days after the trial, so he'll want to wait until closer to the release date to try it.
I used to teach physics at a school that was crowded enough that each room was in use every period, with teachers bouncing from room to room. One day a student who'd moved here from Russia mentioned that he'd grown up very close to Chernobyl. The chemistry teacher was in the back setting up a lab and he shouts "Ooh!" And runs into the storeroom. A couple minutes later he emerged with a Geiger counter and proceeded to check the kid.

"Pay to Win" generally means that spending cash offers an **unreasonable** benefit compared to spending time.If you want to argue DB steps over the line somehow, you'll need to be a lot more specific than "money can get you something that isn't purely cosmetic". You've also got to weigh the impact of that thing and how much time it takes to get it-or-something-equivalent.
You could be right. Are you an expert about definitions? I'm not, yet. It will be at least another year before I finish my dissertation in that area. What year are you in?
to be honest, the Exclusion Zone on Mars *is* the best farming spot. that's the place where you can max your glimmer in about an hour. There may be others, but just about anyone you ask will tell you that's the spot.
Yes, perfect exactly. Because the effects that women are experiencing and are concerned with in those respects are at the hands of men. The concerns here are not problems for men at the hands of women. 
You're correct that the State has money, but our client's primary drive is changing the voyeurism laws in CT. Since 2011 she has appeared before the Legislature every year in support of that effort. Though, real harms also require real compensation.
Part of me wants to actually start focusing in on teams now... I have a hypermax haku and 297 dmeta, I could easily max out my whole pandora/okuni team (basically the same team) but then I'd have to start stoning for plus eggs i guess instead of rem rolls haha
Maybe not. I would put them ahead of Calgary by the numbers, but the Flames have some fucking weird hockey joojoo going on right now and I would be unsurprised if they exceed everyone's expectations (*more so than they already have*).
People always say that but I reckon for many people including myself only know of Roland because if Sennas death, I feel even if senna won the race then brought out the flag, considering Roland was not a highly sought after or recognized driver around the world I fear that he may have gotten a few news paper articles and news broadcasts over the remaining of the week end but we definitely wouldn't be talking about him 21 years down the track.

Her face turns beet red as she quickly gets up, off of Jay, and scoots her back against the bookshelf, sitting on her knees.*"S.sorry.. J.jay..."*She nervously stammers in her quiet voice. It was riddled with embarrassment and anxiety. She quickly dropper her head down and looked to her right.*
It was more frustrating because the Bulls were playing so bad, I don't blame them for getting excited.  It reminded me of when Nate Rob and the Bulls stole one from the Heat in 2013 before losing 4 straight lol.
Walk outside, go grocery shopping and make an awesome meal, maybe see a movie, clean my apartment (this is an ongoing project, I'm a mess), video games, etc. I also would maybe search for things to do nearby, like a museum or maybe take a day trip somewhere. 
You totally belong here if you are interested in anything related to ex-mormonism. Just because most of us happen to be atheists doesn't mean an exmo-wiccan-Catholic doesn't have something to contribute.We do see pantheists, deists, unitarians, and nondenominational Christian types around here. They usually do great. Every now and then a believer comes in here and goes "hey now that you've figured out Mormonism is a fraud you should come believe in MY church which, as it turns out, is the REAL church." They don't do so well.
NASA is one of the fee government programs I will never expect to waste money. They do so much with so little, it's hard to believe they ever had much to waste.
Story time.  We went to buy a tiny SUV.  Liked the design, make, etc.  The sales dude at one point offered up "we can throw in that trunk cover thing for free."  A couple of hours later after drives and researching we were in the PROCESS of signing papers.  One paper had the bill for the trunk cover thing.  Like $185.We asked about that and said it should be free as offered and he gave some BS response.We walked.  F you, little car turd.  Keep your little car.
I think the key phrase is 'my personal experience', which implies Mike doesn't consider his personal experience to be universal truth.  He also said it right after Dan and Rodney said more misogynist things.

I personally wouldn't I would check the bag as fragile and have it stowed instead of as a carry on, its not really needed.  My carry-on usually consists of a days worth of clothes, a gameboy/laptop and other essentials like soap and shit.treat your carry on as a 1day "survival" kit, not for really bringing your really expensive valuables like PC parts.
I love this idea! The only thing that sticks out to me is the tired "save the girl" trope. It works very well to make a simple story, but I would love to have an option to switch the gender of the person in need of rescue. Just a thought.
[[Teysa, Orzhov Scion]] is my best friend here. Before here it was [[Vish Kal, Blood Arbiter]]. I just like to sac and recur things for value, while beating down with tokens.
No way, I'm definitely willing to spend the money needed.  I just wonder where to find these people.  Etsy sounds like a nice place to start.  I've never really given an effort there.Thank you for the help.
Yeah no stress, did you use their REST API? I'm making a couple of other tools to improve my Jira workflows as a lot of the information I need I don't really need to log in to find out so getting the important data out to a single html page that updates every couple of hours should suffice. 
This is the most detailed MRA argument against it I've come across:http://mensrightssydney.com/2014/09/29/i-didnt-fail-the-bechdel-test-but-i-cheated-you-kind-of-have-to/
agreed. My students told me I was boring when I first started. I did too much talking and direct instruction. I mix it up now with groups, pairs, lots of technology, creative activities...whatever works. 
Para mi la venganza es un sentimiento negativo por lo que la justicia penal no debería tener tanto en cuenta el hecho pasado sino la probabilidad de hechos delictivos futuros. El reincidente nunca debería haber salido
As much respect as I have for the Skywind team and all the work they're putting into porting art and voice acting (and I certainly hope they'll allow usage in Morrowind mods) Skyrim just doesn't have the heart of Morrowind. You can't just stumble across the best items in the game in Skyrim. You don't go from nothing to god, you just go from someone decent at something to someone pretty good at something.So while the effort is appreciated, I'm comfortable here thank you.
Lol you'd be shocked how angry that makes people. Every debt success story gets met with "that's not really impressive, you just had a high income, show me someone who paid off 100K in debt living on 20 grand a year and I'd be interested!" But most of the paying down high amounts of debt stories require some income... there's only so much you can cut living expenses.
I'm just paranoid that something will happen and I'll end up owing money. I think i'm going to keep it at 0 exemptions.1. because It's money i won't even think about  2. I'll budget better because I believe i'll have less money to work with.  3. there's something really nice about getting some big check of money.  
Gearbox needs to make a claptrap given mission in BL3 where you try to gather everyone (Scooter, Zed, Moxxi, etc.) for an intervention for Lilith. That would probably be my favorite quest.
It is indeed not. In fact that part is finished. I'm just trying to figure out my favorite way to allow you to select if an item is base, +, or ++ right now.

Maybe in stats they will examine the correlation between being a chicken shit coward and gun ownership.  I expect the R^2 value to be quite high - maybe 0.7?
I would say the M80 if you don't want to buy batteries, and a charge. If you don't mind buying the batteries, and charge go with the Sig 50w. Even 50w is a pretty warm vape. 
Actually I dont think ret should publically claim.  Mafia won't attack them because they are useless and will instead attack someone potentially more helpful.Better to try and bait the nightkill.
Okay, so you improved yourself and she didn't care.  Are you now not at the point where you look for a more compatible person?  That's partly why you go on the improvement journey.  It obviously has personal benefits to get your shit together and that's amazing, but also it lets you know if there is anything to salvage out of this roommate agreement.  She doesn't seem able to or want to engage, so now it's time to let her go and take this new improved you and find a woman who wants the same things you do.
I just agree with them, then not do that. It uses a lot less energy than explaining why they are wrong and I can then use the saved energy to grow more beard.
Yeah, 5-7 is a bit OP when running. On an eco round I rushed long doors after smoking it and picked up a 3k against AK's just running and spraying at their head with the 5-7.

That's likely to happy.  Unlike Jumbo Joe, Backes has actually been a little bit incompetent as a captain lately.  Maybe it's Hitch's system, and he's frustrated with playing that style, but he's been very immature, and he can't seem to ignite a fire under any of the team.  This sub is probably 50/50 on it, but I think there are at least 4 players that'd make a better captain than Backes at this point.
As a mother currently at work, every single day I wish I was at home with my family.I never wanted to be a stay-home mum until I had a kid and by then it wasn't an option. Leaving each day feels so unnatural and just wrong. 
yeah, i use pings a lot (and im getting used to pinging in hots since you can do different things with it) but sometimes they just dont even care. when your team is 5 gold away from turning in and this guy has like 13 gold, I ping and tell him to turn in but he doesnt.

Although **some** have had trouble with bentons essence, I love mine and it's helped tremendously. I personally think it's worth it just because it's helped my skin so much. The masks from benton work so well for me too and I see a noticeable different after using them. I'm also using ost c20 and I'm enjoying that too. 
Two wrongs make a right? It's not even like if the Arabs or Chinese immigrants had a hand in systematic oppression. If your only defense is *tu quoque* or *non sequitur*, you might want to re-evaluate the situation.
As much as I want Batum to stay (I love his jack-of-all-trades style of play), I have to admit if he went anywhere I would want it to be the Spurs. He is a perfect fit for their system.

"Not until the whole front page is about Sanders and even then I won't be satisfied. Sanders isn't a socialist you say? Lalalalalalala I can't hear you, lalalalalala. Why is there no discussion!?" Repeat ad infinitum.

Girl here. I always get a little teary eyed too, because I hate seeing anyone cry, especially a man because it takes a lot for a grown man to cry. Even if I don't know them, I give a hug to anyone I see crying and try to convince them that whatever they're going through will be okay.
I think it's because you're trying to load an entire Web page. Maybe some external resources are being pulled in as well.You really shouldn't try to extract data from a Web page. A large website should have an API that lets you get data in a compact form for machine processing. This site [does have one](http://magicseaweed.com/developer/api), though it requires sign-up.
I recently saw the gif that converts an NBA stadium into an NHL stadium. How long are you alloted to convert, and how long does it normally take?If an NHL game was about to start in fifteen minutes, and you still weren't done converting the arena (e.g. let's say the rest of the job would take thirty minutes to an hour - you run into major problems), what would happen to you? Lose your job?
It says on the text that the photographer will restore any green colored item in the final print. So I guess they'll just create a mask in Photoshop. But that's not as funny.
I'm sorry about your mum:(But my dad plays pretty consistently still too. My GT is Gojirra if you ever want to play with us and you're on Xbone version :) going to be doing some iron banner shortly.

How can he call it tldr when he takes twenty minutes to do what mkbhd did it 3? Skipped ahead to him talking about the removable battery: " its good that its removable, don't ever get a movable battery! Needs to be RE movable! So you can move it out, re move it back in, in out in out in out" that's as far as I made it.
Yup, this is the saddest bit. As someone who has a speech impediment, a couple psychological disorders, and a pretty fucked up life, you had better believe the teachers won brownie points with the kids by making fun of me in class. And you had better believe I dropped the fuck out.

That sea snake is gorgeous. Interesting too. According to Wikipedia it lives entirely in salt water but can't filter the salt so it relies on rainwater floating on the surface for hydration. Can supposedly also be found together in the thousands which, if true, would be something amazing to see.
You need to know that part of working on this when you're in marriage counseling is honesty... if you can't fess up to what you did and it comes out in some other way, you're going to be in for a *much* bigger shit storm. It is way more respectable (and potentially more forgivable) to own up to your mistakes on your own than to try to hide it until it comes to light in some other way. You may not have cheated but you had marriage issues and decided to seek out attention from other women. It's something that isn't necessarily unforgivable, something you two could probably work through, but not if you keep it a secret until she discovers it herself. 
Don't say anything. Invite her and ignore her. If she acts rude at the wedding everyone will see and will only make her look bad. You can always kick her out also. You seem to let her act this way so if I were you I'd start standing up for myself ASAP so by the time the wedding comes around, she'll know better. Sometimes it only takes one time f putting someone in their place for them to change real quick.
Go ahead and get into it with a manual, and I mean really get after it with a nice curvy road that requires real concentration to stay on. Then try it with a tiptronic auto. The differences become quite blatant real fast.
Thanks! I miss them, but they are all still alive and well. They were bought by a family that lived with them at their own house that had an attached barn, just like I had. When I had them I would let the horses and goats hang out in my front yard when I was home. They were all family pets like dogs. I was so stressed when I had to sell them because I did not want them to get separated or sold to someone who would lock the horse up in a boarding facility and only visit him once a month. They all needed daily interaction and attention. So I was so lucky to find a home that would treat them the way I did. So I sold it to that family for a price they could afford. Because even though it wasn't the price I was asking, and I had higher offers, it was the family environment I was wanting. 
If your choices are Fallout 3 and NV, then I would say go with 3.  I would honestly suggest that you start at the beginning, because all four of the flagship games have been more than worth it.  I played the original Fallout about 15 years ago, and my friends and I still make references to it.As far as DLC, do it all.  Someone paid for that, so you should use it.  I'm not sure as far as the order they're supposed to go, because I played through them as they came out, which was not in the order that the content matches with your level the best.
If you want more money in education it's not gonna happen or at least be well allocated  with a republican plan or a more states power plan. I don't think sanders has much on it besides keeping the dept. of education 
I've been working under the impression that "God" was a member of the first group of Cylons who elected (or was assigned, or who was designed specifically for the purpose) to oversee the looping and that the Angels were from a subsequent generation... they realized what he was and were all like "hey, we'll stick around to help". Add a few thousand years of Cylon-speed directed evolution and they're indistinguishable from deities.**Edit:** Given more thought, I'm not even sure it's necessary for further Cylon evolution. If there is a Cylon, or a quorum of Cylon, directing the cyclical nature of: build AI, enslave AI, suffer for abusing AI, try to cooperate with AI, integrate with AI, rinse-repeat... then it's not that far of a stretch that the Cylon who are orchestrating the events we see transpire might just be waiting for the gene-pool to have stabilized into an equilibrium of peace.Note: I've seen S1-3 four times, but only seen S4 once... I'm sure I'm missing something.
I guess I pretty much knew I had to quit as soon as I found out about the owner/boss's criminal record. I think I just needed to make sure I wasn't overreacting and to get a few impartial opinions. You're right. I'm quitting tomorrow by phone or maybe via e-mail, and I won't be going back to the office. All I have there us a box of tissues and a pen, so he can keep those things.
I think its obvious that this was geared towards isolation work, not a compound exercise that is going to involve the forearm flexors, biceps, tricep long head, and lats.And I think you would be hard-pressed to find someone over 6' tall who can do chin ups with 45lbs added for more than 2-3 reps.
Museum-going crowd at a craft market... Tote/shopping bags? One plain, cheap. Fabric inspired by the other exhibits and lined with a custom dyed cloth. One more rugged, maybe with a pieced feature in the front. One that's all out with zippers and pieced parts and pockets a-plenty.
For some reason guys at my school changed a lot on the floor. So walking by you'd see down their boxers. That sweet little bottom of the cheek... Killed me every time.
I know right. I wish I could experience the same level of pure joy my dog does right after the mower goes off and she has the whole yard back to herself. She always gets ecstatic and want to play. 7 years old now and she still acts like a pup. 
Don't wear a cotton shirt! Good lord just don't do it. I don't care if you're on a team and you all made funny shirts, you will regret wearing a cotton shirt. Trust me
Don't try to fix yourself all at once. Do one thing at a time. Honesty, the easiest thing would probably be starting to work out. Research stuff online, then stick to a lightweight lifting/cardio schedule for a month. Then, once you're in that rhythm and have that habit down, start working on something else. You'll get there man, just don't give in to quitting. It gets easier as you go along. 
If you invade and die in the hosts world you temporary lose your souls but you can pick them up at your bloodstain in your own world afterwards.The rest has already been answered correctly.
I hate to break it to you, but that video was even more boring than the one I linked.Edit: Also, I've played War Thunder Sim before. If you think that DBG is actually capable of creating anything that is more like War Thunder rather than what Dice did with BF4 with the constraints of "fixed-wing aircraft" on the shit show that is the forgelight engine, you're in for a rude awakening when they try to add another new vehicle and suddenly every vehicle explodes when you get in.
I agree with both of those statements in the case that you're fighting someone with little experienceGoing back to my original point though, I would prefer my odds against a skilled, self-aware player with a hunter's axe or saw cleaver than I would with a chikage; however, I would agree with you that against button mashers and straight up newbies, chikage is almost always an autopilot win
I imagine people would be, however the only issue is most people will just post their channels/videos and never visit the subreddit again. You'd end up with tons of links to chans/vids but no community willing to view them.
&gt;A good working relationship with your mold designer or vendor is key here.This can't be stressed enough and what can really differentiate suppliers (plus, not all suppliers do both tooling and injection).Occasionally, I've seen injection shops place freshly ejected parts into a cooling jig to get bosses/critical features to stay (or coax) in position. Come to think of it, this was only for really big/thin parts (large TV bezels).Also to add - tools wear. For high volume or long life tools, its important to consider how things change over time such that you aren't forced to EOL your tool prematurely.
TBH I was raised on $23,000 so I think ill be able to get by but I never even considered the cost if living. Ugh. Im glad I dont have to get a Master's. You guys have no idea how much better I feel since I found that out haha
Most level-headed response I've ever seen on property in this sub, also 100% correct. If you can weather the potential volatility in cashflows, understand the full opportunity of deductables and have an additional benefit of it potentially lowering your tax bracket, it would be worth it. Essentially, it's delaying your income to a later date with a lower tax, contingent upon stable/ modest capital growth. A lot of people think that property is some magic bullet for investment or a pit of doom when really it's just tax arbitrage.
I suggest not reading the comment about how bullying should be allowed in special cases then. That alone made me more enraged than I've been in a long time.
The Bang Stick (tac 19) and the Damnation (arx) are both fucking worthless to me. The bang stick has the range of a knife and the damnation is only good in hardcore. 
I have to wonder where they're even getting that information. Like...in elementary school and in high school, I remember taking what I think was an IQ test for acceptance into certain programs, but it wasn't something that was administered to everyone and I was never told the results.
Yes.  It's bullshit.  All the pro-manual arguments are bullshit, in fact.I DD'd a manual car for many years.  It was fun, I liked it.  I enjoy manual gearboxes quite a bit.  But if you also like manual gearboxes, just like manual gearboxes.  Don't come up with all these stupid bullshit reasons as to why you think it's "better" than some other type of gearbox.  Some of the most careless, stupid driving I ever did in a car was in a manual gearbox car.  And that vague shifter wasn't exactly the last word in communication.Long story short, manual gearboxes are fun.  They're great.  I will never not own at least one car with one.  But let's stick to facts and stop making up silly terms to justify a personal preference. 
Pretty sure i fused away a shida or two before he became a staple unit in FH teams. And an elimo, but i have since drawn another elimo, either anima or lord, i can't remember. 
Hey guys, remember when we moved up to the 3rd pick and were happy as fuck... and then we pick Dion Jordan and we were all scratching our heads but kinda cheered anyways? Good times..
Everyone feel free to finish my rares after 30 minutes. I'm concentrating more on the henchmen so I'm not bothered about mvp or final hit. Also apologies for anyone's regulars I accidentally took. Been having a lot of sync problems so had to start triple syncing every time
They *are* allowed abortions. It happens naturally, and no "refusal" is going to change that. The female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. Don't worry. If it really was rape, then the refusal won't be able to stop her body from shutting it down.
I doubt it. I'm teacher of the year twice. Good teachers have a knack for making everyone feel loved and good about themselves. I'm a bad person for recognizing the obvious?  I doubt you're innocent of venting yourself and you probably don't deal with clientele who know full well they can say to you whatever they'd like without much repercussion. The difference is a professional chalks it up to teen angst and doesn't hold it against the kid for being a dumbass and does they're best to keep the kids ignorant of your true feelings by still treating them the same and giving them the benefit of the doubt for their behavior and shortcomings.  It's foolish to think teachers should for some reason not think about people the same way everyone else does. It's just that some of us know how to get even the worst kids to trust and respect you despite the fact that you don't think they have many redeeming qualities.
There was a store near me about 3 years ago (Wholesale Sports) that had Rapala branded polarized sunglasses for $5. I bought many pairs. Still on the first one. 
my point is it doesn't really matter in the long runboth seagate and WD have had bad batches, there is no way to predict when one will happen until you are already getting boned by one, so realistically buy on cost/specs/warranty 
Williams would have been the sexier pick, but we truly needed to get a true polished number 1 receiver to help Carr. Plus with a defensive minded HC I think it is even more imperative to sure up the offense so Del Rio can focus on the defense. Mack will have his running mate tomorrow, but tonight our offense got stronger and I can't be happier about that. 
As someone who doesn't feel informed or involved enough for more controversial opinions, I just want to say that my main takeaway from this video was learning that Kes from Star Trek: Voyager was in American History X
The pi runs a few arcade emulators including mame4all, advancemame, gngeo and fba. Luckily it's a pretty black and white issue if a game will work or not - check the day files herehttp://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/mame-versions-and-romsets-on-retropie/#post-92997Personally I often use gngeo to run the neogeo games, SNKvsCapcom is great. 
You'd think so, but then that wouldn't explain how Huffernudes always manages to queue into *exactly* the streamer he intends to snipe, every single time.   (Kappa)
I felt the environment was not as reactive as the second game. when [late game spoiler] (#s "Reggie dies he says he is proud of you not matter your karmatic alignment." )
Hmm, not my typical kind of fare, but you might enjoy [Upheaval: Breaking Point](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/10157/upheaval-breaking-point) and its sequels - *Twilight discovers a big secret; the peaceful and harmonious Equestria she knows is in fact only part of a whole; outside it lies more dangerous pony territories, and enemy nations that fight against them. To the ponies outside, what Twilight knows is called the Heartland, and they defend it and despise it in equal measure. But knowing that ponies are fighting and dying to preserve her home, can she really go back and forget? Return to being a soft Heartlander? Or will she risk everything and join the fight - even if it might mean a civil war...*
Honestly maybe I'm biased but as far as I can admit he's sometimes irritating on the pitch, there is no football player that deserves admiration off it as much as him. It's really inspiring how much he gave to the poor, even though many African players raised in Europe like him cut off from their homeland. My one and only THE favourite player. I hope he lives for another 70 years at least after he retires to experiance the change he made.
No. This is only for stores without fresh bananas. Ours arrive already frozen in a box with our pastry order. We don't sell bananas by themselves; they're only used in smoothies. 
Earlier today I said "Give them their day to celebrate."  But the rudeness and childishness of some of these people are making me re-think that.I'm starting to feel about Bernie Sanders the same way I feel about Jesus Christ:  Awesome guy, unfortunately a lot of his followers are just assholes.
Interested in manipulating these educators trying their best to deal with 150+ teens per day? You said it yourself, you were a detestable piece of shit
As a general rule, when the state has an interest in protecting life, that interest is considered compelling. For example, a non-compelling interest would be something more along the lines of setting a required minimum frequency of lawn mowing. Granted, simply having a compelling interest is not a sufficient condition for overriding otherwise retain rights; only a necessary one.

My brother's best friend does something like this all the time because he's from Egypt so he likes to say "As an African American..." Which always cause black people to freak out even though he really is originally from the African continent and a naturalized US citizen.
What youre suppose to do is get a court day, they conveniently put all the officers cases in one date, the cop will make room in his schedule for that day. You then call a couple weeka before and reschedule. The cop will say fuck that and not show up
Erythritol however is almost identical to sugar in taste and sweetness. I use it 1:1 to replace sugar when I bake. It's good shit.Oh yeah, edit to clarify also that stevia is not an artificial sweetener, it's all natural. Derived from the leaf of a plant, it's been used in Japan (I think) for centuries. 
SWG was my first MMO, so I was spoiled in a very similar fashion. It ruined MMO's for me forever since I refuse to subscribe to the Theme Park-based MMO's. The only MMO I've ever gotten and played long term since is EVE Online.
Thanks for answering my question! Sorry if it rubbed you the wrong way in any way, I didn't mean to make it sound like streaming was a bad thing, it just seemed like there were a tad more stream videos (I could have completely missed stuff though cause I wrote it pretty late at night).Sounds cool with the collabs. I'm pretty busy now, but hopefully when I have more time I can contact you. I'll PM you when that happens. c:
Wouldn't using that lower the game resolution considerably? Still sounds pretty fun though. Especially if you get to have your friends come over and play. Street Fighter on a movie theater screen?  Yes please. I might have to start an "old school gaming" event with friends to get retro game night going virtually. Who doesn't want to play mario kart at a theater?
With only a degree and no experience you don't bring a lot to the table. Even worse, you won't be surrounded by other engineers to learn from, which is essential early on. You might want to work for another firm early on to learn best practices and develop a network, then strike out on your own. 
You're right about rubi axles, but it's dangerous on sports. I ran 37s on sport axles for a few months and went back to 35s in fear of snapping them on the trail
Give our ratking some love!But man i was so afraid of getting out of soulrange for Door of Pharros that i agaped :/Back then i ran an archmage build (every magic mastered).With Chameleon and Soulspears this became so easy.Or shock, shock them off the cliffs.Hope that's not too cancerous. They are the intruders after all.
The coil heads in very light lettering will say on them the ohms and what wattage is recommended. I'm still trying to find replacements for the new heads even though the old ones will still work because I like those larger channels for the juice to get wicked. The lower the ohms the higher the wattage you would go to get the same amount of flavor/vapor. The .3 head puts out a ton of vapor and I love it, but the .5 is great too. You just want to make sure you're giving it enough power for what it's built for (Even though the .3 is rated 70-80W I've kept around 60-65 for it, 25-30W for the .5 coil head). 
What exactly have they been handed? I'm a fan of theirs through marriage, and from what I've seen of them the last decade, theyve earned those 1st overall picks by being horrible. Even still, what have their fans done that deserves your scorn?
I've been using Slick for a while, and the biggest pain in the arse is the constantly fluctuating API. Every release is just different enough to be painful upgrading. If would be nice if they could at least attempt to stabilize and maintain an API for more than 6 months.
What's My Age Again is a bit difficult for a very beginner... if you play it the exact way.Anyway, Dammit is probably the easiest. For notes basically the whole time except  the bridge.
Depends on the gun tho, AK 5 shot the first 2/3 are fairly slightly down but [the 4 to 6th bullet](http://forum.ssrcg.com/uploads/default/1248/ab8d5ce17e8f3a9a.png) make a big peek, so need to adjust fairly big for these. 
Gmail also doesn't work very well on iOS. Your choice is either use the superior native email app and give up push syncing or get timely updates with the gmail app which is deficient in many ways.When on iOS, I actually auto forward all email to an Outlook.com mailbox then add that account via acitve sync.
Went to another trial muay thai boxing class without fear in the locker room due to wearing a sports bra. No fear! That class kicked my butt for sure though and the people were very encouraging and nice. Might actually sign up. I'll learn self defense despite wearing glasses and being pre-op. :D
I highly doubt its true, or if it is, that its not a very significant correlation, because I really find it hard to believe that there would be so few factors contributing to gender identity. Since when is anything with the brain that simple?Also, because brain physiology differences between genders is affected strongly by whatever hormones your body produces.Remember that story a few weeks ago how birth control in women was altering brain physiology? Note:This was before responses with sources, so they had not yet been taken into account.Also, I'm not being skeptical that there is any philological differences in the brain. The claim was that the brains were more similar to the brains of the gender they identified with, that qualifier makes the actual scope of my argument quite small. 
Umm... I have a speed boast Carvana/Sharpedo, but currently the only real pokes I need are Weak Armor Omnynite and Swift Swim Anorith... otherwise I'd have to ask what you have
Don't know if this counts as in town. But down south, Robert Is Here fruit stand has some of the most amazing shakes. They will make any combination you can think of. I stick to chocolate banana. Worth the drive.
I definitely started out in the red my first few months. But I was fine with that scenario going into it, telling myself I would "invest" x amount of dollars, and if it didn't work out, then fine. Well, I'm sure glad I invested money upfront, otherwise I wouldn't be where I am with these sites today.Believe it or not, I've never tried using an expired domain for a money site (only for my PBNs). From what I've seen in the SERPs, that approach still seems to be working. I may do a case study on it.
Be gentle and forgive yourself easily.  I find that when I fall into old habits if I get angry and down on myself I further attach to the behaviors.  But, if I forgive and let go, then the behaviors fuck off with more ease.
Desperate Housewives' 4 year jump was the point I stopped watching. I really hope Grey's doesn't end up making as drastic of a jump by the end of this episode. 
[The Ballad of Mona Lisa] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOgpdp3lP8M) -- [I Write Sins Not Tragedies] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc6vs-l5dkc) - both by Panic! At The Disco. Not exactly like your examples but these two songs where immediately what I thought of. Mostly for the intro and (motif I think it's called?). Some of their other songs are very circusy too.
My husband "doesn't like sweets" but he will tear up some cheesecake. And chocolate chip cookies. And pound cake.You can decorate a cheesecake with buttercream and fondant, fyi.
If you need an XY chart with the origin in the middle of the plot area, manually format the axes and set the minimum axis bound to -N and the maximum axis bound to +N (where N is just a placeholder for a suitable numeric value).
Scherff is a great OL. And our OL was horrendous. We beefed up the DL during free agency, and our OL is still bad. Good pick. He'll improve the line regardless where he plays. 
"I am the LORD, and there is no other; apart from me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not acknowledged me,"   Isaiah 45:5   Just one, many many times Bible states that there is only 1 God. There are lesser things people "make" their gods, but nothing like God. 
Yea, I appreciate you trying to help. I didn't think I'd get a real answer out of reddit but what I did get helped a little.So tomorrow I'm gonna take care of it.I appreciate your help!
Probably has something to do with not being within 5 hours of a micro center or Fry's.. There was a "tiger direct" "CompUSA" or whatever they were calling it... Like an hour and some change away... But I suppose these are all first world problems
Thank you for your kind words. She's got a tough girl attitude and is very confused, angry and in pain. I can't even imagine it. We'll all be there to help her during her mourning. Ride safe out there
Usually there was a chef's pasta type thing that was quite good, it changed week to week.The voodoo sticks were usually a pretty good starter, and the kettle chips were awesome. I don't know if this make a difference, but i usually went to the one in Clayton park. I went to the one in Dartmouth once, and had an "experience"
How many calories are you aiming for? I would probably try to get as many calories as possible from tons of dried fruit and nuts instead of processed junk, to make sure to get a proper micronutrient supply. Seriously though, having to eat way more food than you actually want to eat sounds like a nightmare, especially to an ex-fatty haha.
played on the public dayz servers and joined a gaming community that ran one, they adopted me and i now have tons of friends and we play all sorts of games.
Im on cataclysm, I used elementalx for a long time and it was good, on 5.1 it started having problems, it made chrome freeze a lot and the battery was average. I switched to code blue a couple weeks ago and the chrome freezes are gone and I get 3 - 3 1/2 hours screen on time daily compared to ~2.5 on elementalx. So I would go with code blue.

https://www.padherder.com/user/weew/teams/siegfried and the blue knight can be max skilled without too much effort as they're farmable.  If you happen to roll hatsume, that's really good.  Nearly any blue orb changer is good for this team, a blue orb changer with rows = great.  But max skilling them is the real key.
[I've reviewed this thing extensively](http://beyondchronic.com/2014/06/magical-butter-machine-review/) and I can tell you categorically that once you add water to the mix, you are especially fucked as far as capsules are concerned. The water *never* comes out of the mix and it will eat right through the capsules.
My friend who is paralyzed tried to kill herself by banging her head against the wall. It was a lot harder than she thought it would be and her mom found her after the first few knocks. 
Is there *any* solid scientific data to back up how humans behave?Social science is called a "soft science" for a reason - we can make some highly educated (and therefore, effective and useful) guesses, but there is no "is true" in social science (I say that as a former Economics major in college - there is little-to-no "hard science" in Economics).
Free PPV at work. Our company operates 24/7, so there will be employees on Sunday. I don't have work on weekends but I might go there to watch the fight with co-workers :)
I may have social anxiety. But other times I don't feel like this. I'm a sophomore guy in highschool, but I'm not 16 yet. How should I tell my parents that I may want to try a therapy session or two? 
I have mixed feelings - He's a good prospect, but I would not consider him the best player available. However, our team is in desperate need of improved offensive line play.I believe we could have traded down (and acquired him with a later pick), but well - We absolutely needed to address our offensive line if we wanted to make any decent assessment of our offense.
Why cant you say "partial additions" instead of claiming it all to be your work? Additions allows it to sound like you've added something of value, which I imagine you have, and it's vague enough that the client/employer would have to ask if they were interested beyond what you've already told them. 
With the 6th selection in the 2015 NFL Draft, the New York Jets select BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
If computers got powerful enough and facial recognition software got good enough, a computer that could simulate an absurd amount of 1080p quality pictures by randomizing pixels one day we you could just google that idea for a picture and see a high resolution photo of it. I'm high.
Yea but it's quite rich for the Lakers fan above; a team that generates a gazillion bucks a year and gave an ancient Kobe a million times more than he deserves or needs, to expect Rondo, an nba champion and former all star,  to take the minimum.  Mad entitled.
I think people are just getting a bit tired if these posts. They're becoming somewhat regular.Personally, I love Flanno. I'd be ecstatic if he gets healthy and back to form. I'd bet most people here would agree, even the downvoters. It's the type of post, not the player himself that's getting hate.
No BB is a yonko because he took overtook WB'S territories. I think you are just underestimating BB's power. Remember that he was given the chance to be a commander in WB'S crew but he turned it down.
Does he not realize that all he has to do is utilize this moment to write a beautiful college essay on how he changed and he'll get into any college he wants.
Seems like it was a pretty universal belief that the detail brushes weren't very good especially considering they were sables. Even the guy that owns the local GW store would steer people away from those. He always said the specialty brushes and such (dry brush, etc) were fantastic but the detail and fine detail brushes were a waste.
Most of the people I work with have invested 40-50 years working. They're all in their mid to late 50s to their early 70s. And they're still working, because they have to. They've worked hard their entire lives, and they *still* have very little property to protect. This is a story I'm seeing *everywhere*. To suggest that capitalism, or at least capitalism that's advanced to the point our system has, is actually even a little bit beneficial to the working class is ridiculous at this point.The rich are getting richer, the poor are staying poor, and the middle class is disappearing into the lower class. My solution is a turn towards more socialistic policies. What's yours?
Are you aware of a church in your community that only does circlejerking about Jesus and does no formal charity work (what you and I would call charity)?  What is the public perception of them? Do they take social and political stances (gay marriage, abortion, etc).
Everyone does it differently. I might introduce fish after two weeks if I see no signs of ill health, or I'll wait for a month if I have to treat them. Tbh, I shoot from the hip. Plenty of people do it longer, and being cautious is often better. 
What does it do? I've always liked the meals more when I brown the meat first. I read when you are using ground meat it keeps it a little clumpier. As in if you don't brown your ground meat it will crumble. What does it do for cuts of meat like this though? My pot roasts come out a lot better when I brown that shit.
I love O-linemen too, I was actually lobbying that we might want to consider taking an O-lineman had we traded down, haha. I mean, RT is arguably our biggest need, and with Mett's lack of mobility it would be vitally important that we shore that up. For some reason our fans think that O-linemen aren't something we should constantly be using first round picks on :(
Yeah, because I totally love having all the way to the other room to get on my computer so I can memorize "Msg XxXMLGSnlperG0DxXx3502 xx for invite" only to have to go to the room with my console, enter the name, message them, and hope that they aren't away/already started/full/even the person that they claim to be.
/u/dizzyvonblue Sorry for the late thank you post! I thought I had posted it and just realized I didn't I had a :O face when I realized it. My son loved his birthday present. Thank you!
Got a bug where I can't buy mangos, even if I leave base and try to buy it that way. (other items I could buy np) I had enough gold, it made the purchase sound but still wouldn't let me buy. Confused. Anyone else had this?
Finished **A Thousand Splended Suns, by Khaled Hosseini** this tuesday. What a book, my god.. I started **Life of Pi, by Yann Martel** yesterday, and I am loving it so far.
You see reddit lately?  The circle jerk is on the other end now.  If anyone mentions not being religious in any way the first comment is usually "Looks like /r/atheism is leaking again!".  Give it another year or two for atheism to become popular again.
Oh, it's up to you. The "friend network" is pretty much the only way to get a good apartment on the peninsula. You should contact your new workplace, and ask those people to ask around. Since you're doing vista I sort of assume it's Prebble St. or the Maine Bike Coalition or something similar.

Kinda hate how Real can seemingly charge whatever they want for their players and people will pay. No way he's worth that much and don't want to give them any more than we have to. 
What if you're drunk too? At what differance in BAC is it considered rape? Not saying you're wrong but I think for each situation there are a lot of variables to consider before blowing the rape whistle.Edit: I do think if one person is getting the other person drunk for the sole purpose of fucking them then yeah that's rape, just wanted to clear that up.
That's only because of the relativity of simultaneity. Some observers will say one end of the ladder exited the "carrage" before the other end entered it. Other observers will say that the ladder is short enough to fit. It depends on their relative velocities to the scene in question.
Mdr faggots j'ai choisis ici évidemment, marre de la bien-pensance. À la base Internet c'est le cynisme et le second degré, pas des baltringues hipsters like #JeSuisCharlie&lt;3
And with the 7th pick in the draft the Chicago Bears select Safety Giannis Antetkuopumpo, a big tackler out of Filathlitikos. He can put his hands up, stands almost 7'. Aaron Rodgers is going to have a hard time throwing over this guy.
In fairness the flags are in a vacuum, subject to liquid nitrogen to molten lead temperature oscillations and unfiltered sunlight with its extreme UV content. I wouldn't be surprised if they were dust! And, how does anyone know :-)
I'd love to see large areas mapped my detailed range finding lasers. Generate a point clouds of the terrain so we could create an accurate 3d model. It would be cool to be able to walk around on the moon virtually, like in a FPS game.
I just gave a speech at my pinning. I worried about it for weeks and procrastinated until the night before. I just said fuck it. I am not reinventing the wheel here. I thanked the people that needed thanking, faculty, admin, a big special thanks to family and friends. And then I spoke to my class and thanked them for being awesome and that I will be sad to part ways but optimism about the future so on and so forth. Just keep it simple.
Employee must have been new!  There must be dozens of Disney meltdowns daily in that very store, based on our experience at Disney.  Oh how I wish we did not have to pass through a store at the exit of every ride.  Even the sweetest kids struggle at some place like Disney.
He's head of creative for LU?!Then mad respect for the [oiled-up dancing baby-man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlXR-RGVhfY). I died a little inside when he was let go from WWE.
All my photos from a few months ago all say I'm a late teen/early 20s. My recent photos say I'm 30 or late 20s. I've been having better luck with fakes in recent weeks so that's cool.
No, I have not been to Arizona, and while I am sure there are many examples of cross-bedding in the Navajo, the beds in the image supplied by OP are clearly not cross bedded. edit: perhaps, in the very upper left corner there might be an example of cross-bedding.
Pretty sure a pro athlete won't be in the hospital for a heart attack at 20 nor for an amputation of the leg from type 2 diabetes at 30. Also, pretty sure they could lift themselves, ya know, being an athlete and all. 
Together? I've never tried it. I could see it being good together, but the beef stew recipe would have to be built around the idea of cottage cheese being added, otherwise I don't think it would be that great.EDIT: I just read your entire question. If it works for you, then by all means, have at it.
It's more than that for the Cowboys.  The entire Cowboys OL improved and played great last year.  You can find good guard prospects much later and their impact is not worth the 5th overall.
From what I've gathered on playing Irelia is that Triforce has only 1 real wasted stat (crit) on it. She benefits from every other stat given to her. The sheen proc is massive especially when paired with her E and then activating her W. Not to mention each cast of her ult procs it as well. Not to mention her Q applies on hit effects. Phage gives Irelia the ability to stick to her opponents and once paired with boots it's hard to kite her. Zeal gives just enough attack speed to make her W active hit hard and take down squishies or deal massive damage otherwise. I've built BotRk on her after this a few times if I'm massively ahead (along with my team) but otherwise I build tank.TL;DR version: True damage is awesome. Almost no wasted stats (6/7 are useful even minus the passives it gives). 
The article sites incorrect usage by Shakespeare but it's all bullshit. From OED: Strictly speaking, whence means ‘from what place’, as in whence did you come?; Thus, the preposition from in from whence did you come? is redundant, and its use is considered incorrect by some. The use with from is very common, though, and has been used by reputable writers since the 14th century. **It is now broadly accepted in standard English.**
Is there any official ticket exchange through the festival itself? Like if i buy one of these tickets am i gauranteed to get it? Last year my friend got two physical wristbands from craigslist and when we got to the festival gate they were reported stolen and the person he got it from had got a refund for them already. Any way to prevent this?
I'm actually very happy about this.  Our line got an upgrade at either guard or tackle.  If the football gods finally show mercy on us and Spencer Long is legit, RG3 may finally learn what a pocket really is. Oh Yea,  and A Train.
How would that be a fold after he 5-bets? He can't have anything better. All he did was call pre. Best he has is AQ (and he'd probably raise that pre) or a straight draw. This is 5NL. It's never a fold there.
Alot of that stuff was being talked about in PWinsider and the Observer very very little of whats Mets was unique information from him.In all likelihood he stole information from Meltzer. The John cena and Daniel Bryan stuff was already being touted by Meltzer and Alvarez as was brock going into contract negotiations. So I think its misleading to say he scooped anything.I think its obvious he was nicking information from the Observer and PWinsder and passing it off on his own the circlejerk then downvoted anyone who pointed this out so it made him look legit when he was full of shit.Keep in mind he said Wyatt couldn't walk after rumours arose he was injured  so I think its easy to see he was bullshitting.Though I guess everyone on /r/squaredcircle is a master scooper if they predicated cena winning.
I quite like my Firefly picks, though I've lost track of most of them now. 4 for $150 makes them expensive to lose.In general I prefer a thin flexible Fender pick, it looks like see through abalone or something similar. I don't know what gauge it is, but it's thin enough that it bends a little but not too much.I've found that I prefer flexible picks on guitar, and non flexible picks (like the Firefly) on bass, particularly my Squire Vintage Modified Bass VI.
I'm a 16 years old female. Here's some advice for you/anybody need it. Be here to listen to us. The best thing my parents do is they listen to every little feeling I have. They let me cry if I have to cry. They don't patronize me for my feelings. Don't do that, your kids will feel like they cannot talk to you. So if you listen to them and their feelings, your kids are bound to be better behaved. 
Go out to eat.  It's like the one time that we can just talk, completely uninterrupted.  At home we can't really do that because we have pets and they are always all up in our faces.  Love them, but ugh.  Some space would be nice sometimes.
Nah that's not cheating imo. It is using whatever you can think of to beat the game. You could not 'make up' a console cheat and you would probably have to find it on the internet. In that situation you are beating the game with external resources, wich is cheating. 
I know it's a matter of taste for everyone, sure.But so far all of these recommendations have been to douse the zucchini in lots of other ingredients. Nobody likes *just* zucchini.  
Hadn't seen the Legend trailer until now--jeeeeze! Intense! And the Roy Orbison song playing over it really adds a lot of atmospheric "oomph"...so good! 
&gt; Women are judged by something that they have very little control over -their looks  I think women have enormous power over their looks.  For me at least, and I would wager for many other men, whether a woman is in shape or not is the majority of what determines her looks.  I'd find myself much more happy to hook up with a woman with a well-toned figure and an ugly face than one with a beautiful face and an obese body.  The majority of a woman's physical attractiveness, at least to men like me, is within her control.
I had a teacher say to me infront of the whole class that my UNIFORM skirt was too short and that it made he 7 comfortable to see me in class.It was knee length as everyone else's I just had long legs for my age. Definitely not something you need to hear when you're already uncomfortable and pubescent.Canadian teachers...
if you have some chain blades you can do a couple fights with chain blades. Chain blades gives you range and a lot more sustained dps. You lose cross cut and become a lot less reactive in your approach to fighting. If you are solo you are probably going to want to twin swords though as you will have a much easier time since everything is targeted at you.
lol idk what to build for a third run. I've already done bloodtinge/dex and str/vit. I saw a couple vids of badass flamespitter take downs. Not sure how viable that is tho
What I love the most about Dark Souls is that regardless of knowing the structure, the nature of having everything set in place means that there's time to focus on that question that nags you in the moment.  To go through the game and reflect.  And because you can't put that on the back of a box like a feature, it's easy to take for granted.  I'd prefer that, rather than the tedium that is feeling that the novelty of procedural generation, you having so succinctly defined its logic, is taking away from that process of examining why the environment is constructed the way it is.  Why an enemy has a certain item.  Those are mere fragments at best as they appear in Chalice Dungeons.  But this game is still a worthy successor.  I won't be having a tired conversation about formula just yet.
First, Breaking Bad is probably my favorite show ever made. The way you guys nailed the ending was especially impressive. Second, Mike's death was the saddest for me. Thanks for bringing him back on BCS! He's really one of the best characters on TV. I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I heard BCS was going to happen, but it's quickly become one of my favorite shows as well. I can't wait to see what happens next season :)
&gt; completely inoffensiveAnything can be offensive in the wrong context. Eg. Offering your friend a BLT sandwich to cheer him up is not offensive. Offering him a BLT to cheer him up, cause his pet piglet just died is.To some people: beer + not saying no = offensive.     Is their offense justified? It doesn't matter. The goal of advertising is not to take a stand what phrases should and should not be socially acceptable. The goal of advertising is to make more people like (and then buy) your product. Bud created a slogan that made Bud less likable. It will probably have a negative effect on sales. The slogan was a bad idea.

I'm a little confused on what you mean for the header and the menu. By that I mean, when you say set the positions to a good average and relinquish control.
Sounds more like taxi drivers. They pull in and out with no consideration of any other drivers; I've had so many near misses with them. Conversely I've had no issue with bus drivers.Edit: Didn't realise this was coming from a passenger for a bus. Harsh considering the circumstances in which they drive.
Their CS, RM, HX, HXi, and AX series PSUs are excellent. Don't generalize based on a brand, most brands buy their different PSU lines from other companies.
Personally I'd be annoyed, mainly because I have one and it's a missed chance for something I don't have or want another one of! I can imagine it would be great for XBox One players, but then I think it would be a bit counter intuitive of Bungie as every XBox player would buy it and have it from day one. I think they'll make it so that you have to get it from a loot drop!
The mechanic is so dated. It was a valid thing to get mails when your holding of sov was directly tied to the number of moons you controlled, but now, it's kinda stupid.I'm hoping that with the new structures we'll see the mails and such go away.
Ahhh so we're pretty much in the same boat! I imagine it means something! Most people don't just randomly hold hands it seems like. Except the girls at my school love to hold hands with their friends, but only their friends that are girls. They don't seem to do it with their guys friends. It is:) Hands Like Houses is one of my favorire bands. I've seen them in concert twice and met them all. Gotta love them:)
Faust:I'm sorry you feel that way and you will be missed. I hope you find a writing home where you feel comfortable and that you continue writing in it. Your gift should continue to be shared with the world in some way, even if it isn't with us.Thank you for what you've written in the past. I'm sorry you've come to think so poorly of NoSleep.Be well.
The crazy part is the maggots are actually probably helping. Maggots are really good at eating dead, infected, and necrotic tissue that would otherwise spread and kill the guy and stopping at the actual living tissue. Its an evolutionary trait developed by parasites to keep them from bothering the host so the host doesn't try to get rid of them, but it is actually part of a useful/ experimental method of saving what can be saved from frost bite victims and gangrene victims.
No no no, I didn't mean I was defending it in any means.  I don't agree with it either, but I do not think that the negative effect of male circumcision can be compared to female circumsion, especially infibulation
Just to piss you off.Actually, there is no better way (for a male, anyway) to quickly pass through metal detectors than being able to undo one latch and toss everything into the tray at once.
&gt;do I still need postage or are these some kind of special envelopes that don't require them?The postage for these types of envelopes are paid by the recipient at a later date, hence the 料金後納 ("fee to be paid later"), so no, no stamp required.
Inb4 1 second per clone duration. Might be neat to cast two quickness bubbles or start a fight with two pistol phantoms. You could use it to eat a hit but you could do the same with distortion. So.... It might just be a gimmick.
The other side of the argument is that paid mods discourage cooperation, sharing knowledge and assets and overall detrimental to the community, while bringing zero value. I don't believe that you are entitled to charge for something that is arguably and inherently harmful for other people, be they buyers (forced to pay for low-effort mods) or content creators (locked out of high-effort mods, because authors of said mods would not want to share in any way and compromise their revenue). If you want to charge for you game developing skills than go for it, became a developer and create your own game. In fact, a lot of modders did and still doing just that. And they where able to do it because of the learning and sharing and all the support that community provides.
Kind of looks like you're underwater... the way the light is hitting you, the type of foggy blue, and looks like you're holding your breath. Weird that you are doing literally the opposite of diving
Dude this reminds me of those frat bro type teachers that just can't give up their glory days. That and Matthew mcconahay in dazed and confused. Alright alright alright 
You're purposing a straw man with your wealth argument. Countries need natural resources. Try living without water and tell me how it goes. All that IP doesn't, in and of itself, mean anything if you can't use it to manufacture anything. You want a thriving technology based economy? You're going to need the proper resources in order to make those computers.
The first dragon defender i got was on my 7th kill and i died with it so i had to get another and that one took me around 23 kills so i think i am pretty lucky but then again i died with firecape tried getting that back got jad to half health and dced... -_-
For me it was the SNES/Megadrive-era up until the end of the PS2/Gamecube-era.I am a sucker for good JRPG's and they are few and far between now sadly.
Yeah maybe but time management is important when you have 6 finals to study for. Furthermore, an analogy: Why would I lift a boulder using my bare hands when I can use some kind of pulley system? And if I don't know how to build a pulley system, why wouldn't I politely ask someone to build one for me? After all It's not like I'm asking for the answers to the actual questions.

they have a silver metal body with a rubberized battery cover that comes in black and soon to be silver, they will be releasing a black body with same battery cover color options
&gt; I got a trembly hand with a refund check in minutes.Why a check?  Why can't they just hand back the deposit in the same way you paid it, so you know you have it right now (a check could bounce couldn't it?)
If you go to any subreddits on the app and hit the three dots in the top right corner there is a button that says random. When I click it, it takes me to /r/random with nothing there.
The only bad things me or any of my coworkers have to say are about those who are just assholes. Assholes who are just assholes for the sake of being assholes certainly exist, and by 17/18 it's pretty much set that they are just assholes. Having said that, one teacher said she had a student who better hit the gym because the only thing in her future is stripping and porn
I feel like the jets are going to take Williams and give me another reason to hate them, like I didn't already have enough of those. Edit:  officially one more reason to fucking hate the jets.  I don't even want to watch the draft anymore. If the beats fucking pick a "WR" like white or Dan fucking Shelton I'm going to be livid.
I was tellin a guy earlier about the situation, what happened was a guy said these GK terminators here have hammers instead of spears that was it. His opponent said no and he had to leave cause he needed the hammers to deal with something specific otherwise he woulda been tabled.  The rules thing is a moot point now cause I recently found out that you can do 30k vs 40k if need be so I wouldn't have to change anything. I could just say these guys here are whatever legion and they are using that same legions rules and weapons, they all are just colorblind and painted their shit the wrong color.  
I think everyone would be a whole lot more chill about how long it was taking if they were just honest and regularly updated people with progress reports.
A contract isn't pricey at all. A single GC contract is like 5k margin for 120k notional of gold. Net gain/loss MTM at EOD. If it goes up 10$ you make 1000$. If it goes down 10$ you lose 1000$. Minimum fluctuation of .10 or 10$/contract. Same thing with equities. 4k margin for 88k of Nasdaq or 5k margin for 100k of S&amp;amp;P500. Different fluctuation values though. 8-20x leverage depending on the instrument.
I didn't really 'get' functional javascript, the point of currying/partial application/etc, until I started to use Ramda. Then lots of things started to click, and really enjoying it. By having the data come at the end - things start to get cleaner and make more sense.
Moisture is a big reason, and the way the tobacco is cut is another. There's also no real good way to get the specifically cut, properly dry tobacco into prefabricated tubes unless you own an industrial, automatic cigarette-rolling machine. Flavored tobaccos are definitely out because they're moist, produce no throat hit, cut in a way that is not conducive to properly "packing" a cigarette. It needs to be more like a 1/8in ribbon. 
Not every one has the Internet to support the download sizes of games this generation, it would just cause those people to not purchase the console when they learned they would need to download 40+ go games regularly and regularly receive 5+ gb of patches day one.
I really wish Valve added a counter stat to all items that are actually rare, to tell how rare the item is. They actually did this during the Summer event for the crafted items, kind of a shame it was removed.
He means that Far Sky is only good for one playthrough. It's kind of like an underwater Minecraft.You're taking about Race the Sun, which is a timed racer. It's certainly designed to be played again and again, and only ends when the sun sets.
I thought he did a pretty good job addressing all of Japan's transgressions in there. It wasn't the focus of his speech, but he did dedicate a good amount of (very limited) time to it. Of course the Koreans would complain even if he had directly addressed it, but that's a whole other matter. 
Hey man hit me up, Ive got a few guitars, a drum machine and a synth and some mics. I can also play drums to a decent extent, but I don't really mind what I play.
I'm a middle school teacher. I regularly call some of my students lunatics, silly and crazy etc. to their face. I also call them sweetie, love, and honey. I think it's a lot about the relationship you build and your underlying message (e.g." I'm calling you crazy because your body is being crazy, sweetie.")P.S. I also regularly say "s/he is being a dick today" with my co-workers. Because Jesus Christ sometimes they are.
I'm still going back and forth about if I should continue the guards series or read them in order. I just can't commit to a decision I don't want to make the wrong one.
if you're talking about casters they can't be biased similar to articles that aren't taking anyone's sides. If you noticed Jatt's interview he literally stated that c9 was at their ceiling cap with hai and needed to replace him in order to contend internationally but he never said that as a caster.tl;dr articles and casters from riot are suppose to be neutral and just point out the team strengths and weaknesses as non judgmental as possible not just say they suck. 
&gt; We "killed" a Singaporean frigate because of that.curious about what this means exactly.  Like perhaps hailing the Frigate somehow (by floodlight/radio/siren/?) to transmit something along the lines of *"hey dumb-asses! someone's smoking on deck; you've just been sunk"*....?
OK. Is she part of a larger agency? If she is Remax or Century 21 or something else? (Don't say who she is associated with) There should be someone who can help you navigate this. How long ago did you close?
I'm typing this on a high end custom gaming PC I built myself.  It isn't that you're wrong, but most people don't care, most people buying PCs are actually buying laptops, and even most desktops sales are the cheaper ones. Most people don't and will never care about picking a PC part by part, or even paying someone to do that for them. They are going to say I need a PC, let's go to best Buy,Wall mart ect. Even though a PC like mine is objectivly better in every way, it is 3 times the price, and they just want to browse facebook and pornhub, I on the other hand do that, as well as Skyrim with 160 mods, among other very demanding games. Skyrim not actually being very demanding I know, but the mods!
I seriously can't stand anything lower than 480p. Sometimes i watch YouTube on my Xbox 360 and streaming in 360p or lower ruins the whole point of an HDTV. If both PLDT and Globe claim in their PR bullshit about Filipinos being dependent on our so called "digital lifestyle" why do they still have data caps and throttling in place? 4K TVs are slowly rolling out to consumers at a much affordable price and Philippines can barely stream 720p or 1080p let alone 4K. 1-3 Mbps is the standard in the Philippines unfortuately. Meanwhile in the US, the FCC has declared a new standard of 25 Mbps to be considered Broadband.
Fortunately this boat has been laid up for a few years. The thing that always gets me in Duluth would be [walking by this](http://i.imgur.com/NuTp6nu.jpg) because my mom loved seeing the bridge so every  time we would visit in the winter my family would walk there. I would look over the edge and see the swells moving the ice around, pushing up against the cement and imagine falling in to the water but unable to get above the ice floats.
It was a perfectly fine season of under the dome. But since it wasn't under the dome it was terrible.They apparently decided to undo all the development of half the characters, and for no apparent reason make Zoey win basically every challenge
I'd like to say the Jat Kittag, pre- and post-buff.  I always felt it was the absolute best melee weapon due to its massive range, high damage and its awesome utility.  Not something I'd use in a PvP situation but anyday for any PvE mission.  I barely ever saw anyone use it before, but I'm seeing it a lot more often now.Is it reasonable to post builds on r/Warframe?
To be fair, he did say for the most part. And being him, he can only judge from his own experiences. Don't bring the media into it because for all you know he may not even watch the news. 
Well I just [threw it in google translate](https://translate.google.com/#auto/en/hapis) with auto-detect on and it gave me 'prison' (Turkish). I'd say that's a bit more plausible.
Sounds like a good use of your resources then. People often underestimate the psychological impact of these sorts of things. BTW, if you need any advice on stones, etc, I used to be a gemologist.
It would be way more than that. It would be 32 x 32 = 1024 even if they knew the 32 1st rounders, which they wouldn't. Really if you think about it just having a bunch of letters is the EASIER solution.
Then you haven't watched him play!!!!  We dont need a walking highlight reel!  We need a WR that gets us up and down the field.

&gt; The very next dealer I went to, the salesman sat me down and pulled out a binder. It listed all of the cars they sold with three prices. He said this is the MSRP, this is the invoice price, this is what I can sell you the car for at minimum. Their minimum price was a little higher than the previous dealer, so I asked if they could match that. The salesman asked me if that "low" price was the out the door price. He said his lowest was what they added tax to and that was the end price.I don't understand why this isn't how cars are sold.  You'd think if you had a reputation for just giving a low-ass price and not bullshitting, you'd have a) a much easier job than the poor slobs that have to pressure and lie to people all day and b) insanely high volume
This remains to be one of my all time favorite movie scenes. I always think back to when I was a child watching this film numerous times and being terrified every time. 
I just did 5 sets, results:* 95 CB Ronald Darby (+1 STR)* 94 DT Malcom Brown (+1 TKL)* 94 OG A.J. Cann (+1 RBK)* 94 DT Jordan Phillips (+1 TKL)* 94 DT Eddie Goldman (+1 STR)
what im wondering though is say you have every cross class skill from all of the crafts being 50, and then you have to pick them out from order of usefulness as if you were leveling a fresh new craft from level 1, so say at level 5 you'd pick steady hand II, then at 10, careful synth II, and so on.
And someone with standards in that situation would say "I won't endorse something I haven't read".People make it sound like Dr Karl had no choice in the matter.
I was a bit more clearheaded. Nothing crazy noticeable though. What was noticable was how stressed I am. I passed my exam, and I'm still on edge. I had a toke tonight and it totally did not help. Made things worse, kind of like a panic attack. I didn't like it. Especially since usually it helps me relax. I'm going to try to have a good sleep tonight, and hopefully tomorrow I'll feel better. Its my birthday after all! I just don't want this feeling to continue. 
I think Superiority doesn't actually work on those anymore. I used to take it on a couple heroes (ok, just Gazlowe) to counter some Zagara stuff and then they did this:&gt; Fixed an issue which caused summoned units to deal half damage to Heroes with the Superiority Talent.http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/17345414/heroes-closed-beta-patch-notes-january-13-2015-1-13-2015
As a transgender vegan, no. Stop. I risked being disowned in coming out, whereas being vegan is just an oddity, even in the Deep South. While gay folks may have a bit more recognition and acceptance these days, the consequences for being openly gay, bi, and/or trans is really variable depending on where you are. No one is going to hurt you for being vegan, unless they think that you're gay *because* you're vegan.
We have not affected the button going down at all. We get the satisfaction of not contributing to the timer, and the satisfaction of pressing. And we get a beatiful bright purple flair to boot. I highly recommend it.  
Yeah, I think the down the rabbit hole metaphor is very true. Sooner or later it just becomes about pushing boundaries to get a new rush but it can be so damaging. It's strange, I've never told this to anyone irl, in fact, I think this post is the first time I've admitted it, even online. It can become so ingrained in your life that you forget it's HOCD.And thanks!
Thank you and I love it! The colors are just as blendable as I had been reading. The pigmentation is really good and I'm obsessed with all the warm colors as I'm lacking in my collection of cools haha! I would give it an 8/10 just because the packaging is stupid. It would have a 10/10 if there was a mirror and the palette wasn't so difficult to open!
&gt; here were two guys next to me who were actually having a conversation about how "all that fedora hate" on the internet is just from trolls that hate themselves and other such nonsense.I don't wear hats, but in all fairness, the internet is full of bullying assholes who dress like douchebags, but somehow feel comfortable pissing on the poor fashion sense of others.In other words, shut the fuck up and let people wear whatever they want.
I do not like pocket carry. At all. It's too slow and cumbersome. But I also carry a bag every day almost solely because I don't like the feeling of having things in my pockets.FMJ is not defensive ammo. I'm a fan of Federal HST. It's a hot round, but it feels solid and re-assuring when firing, and I haven't heard a bad word about it. That being said, it's an expensive proposition to try out a bunch of SD ammo to see what your gun likes....but that's probably the best way forward.A for girl carry....I'd imagine more girls (than guys) would have to adjust their wardrobe. And holster selection is even more important (to ensure the big block of metal doesn't interrupt curves in places guys are generally flatter). But, I've known girls to carry the same way as guys (strong side, behind the hip, appendix, etc.) with the same general kinds of concerns. Purse carry is absolutely a terrible idea...even worse than pockets.
It's a completely different skill to be able to read a script than it is to produce your own humor. Given that these scripts are all pretty tacky, I can see how someone with very little acting experience can have difficulty with it.

There are so many holes on the roster that cause them to be perpetual bottom feeders they cant afford to limit their incoming talent by drafting to need. Most teams use a rotation of interior lineman so it is not like they are set at DT for years to come. If they are passing up a player who they think is better it is a stupid pick. I assume they just think Flower is the best player available.
Thank you both for your replies :)I'm gonna keep building stations for the Argon as i can't find a decent income doing anything else while i save up for the HQ. Saddly i seem to have got my combat rank that high i can't run combat missions anymore without setting up a fleet.I'm on the send incarnation of the Phanon corp and they seem to be  no threat at all any idea when they become an issue. As in at what point will they actively start to patrol?Have either of you got to the stage were you are taking on the OCV? I'm very interest in hearing about peoples approach to dealing with them.

I know it really doesn't count, but the Vietnam scenes in Forrest Gump were pretty intense, and there could definitely be an argument that it has too much of a fantastical feel with Gump pulling everyone out, but there have been real stories of men saving their entire squad so I'll submit it. 
That would be his death nail if there were just indifferent. Wrestlers need you to either hate them, or love them to have that connection to be on the big stage. Else Vince won't put you on it.
Only really hyped for the British planes because I'm garbage at GF. I'm also garbage at air battles but only slightly less, so hopefully when I research the new planes I won't be shit like I am in the Spitfires.
Danielle is actually really underrated. Good in challenges, very recognizable and apparent personality, fights with people, and is surprisingly competent in strategy. She could've been like the evil-Amanda to Parvati in HvV, especially if it was someone like Shane or Penner out there instead of Russell. 
Actually, it's not the same, because the gun is a concrete object that can exist in the absence of any person. Religion is an idea that cannot exist unless someone is thinking it. If the religious persons, ALL religious persons, disappear, so does religion. 
You know, I wasn't playing stealth character like never, and after reading Fallout Equestria (I know, pony stuff and hatings) it feels so unimmersive when you can kill whole town in one room and noone even suspect anything when you pille up bodies then loot them and then hide just before them with chainsaw and go arround last guy who sits merely with head of budy who exploded on him when he was talking about weather with him 30 sec ago.
i think people can do it easily (if it's not too hard to take apart the outside metallic parts) you can just get an iphone which people are selling for parts and then use those parts. But it is very unlikely to come across dead iphone 6 devices so soon.
Very confusing. You need to nail down the rules of this world and not break them.Also, pretty much nothing happens in this story. Draw the story / character arch. For a high concept, nothing happens. 
So I started browsing this sub and collecting figures around 2 months ago and just never got around to taking any pictures, (mainly because I dont have a good camera) so I finally decided to take some pictures with my phone and share it. Many more figures to come later as well!
Of course!  I got the QEP grout saw from home depot for about $7 if I remember correctly.  It came with two blades:  a steel toothed blade and a carbide grinding blade.  The carbide worked better the few places I was able to use it, but was too wide for the vast majority of our grout lines.  Based on your pictures, you will not have the same problem.  The steel blade worked alright, but was soft.  I wore the teeth down and had to buy a second saw.  Our home depot had replacement carbide blades, but didn't have replacement steel blades.  I would *highly* recommend you go a different route.  If you have more than 10 or so linear feet of grout to replace, $30 or $40 would be a reasonable investment to make the work go quicker.  Just to put it into perspective:  If I ever have to replace the grout in that bathroom again, I will eagerly knock out the walls, hang new dry wall, and retile from scratch.  Removing the grout sucked that bad.  
Wow! Awesome work! I actually love that you left that space open. We can stick new releases in as they come out or get fan translated. Can I rely on you to add to this when it becomes necessary? I really like the work you've done.
&gt; And you can't take a day off. Ever.Isn't that why sleepaway camp exists? Win/win. Boarding school seems like another option, no? (Not a parent, just speculating, maybe I'm off base here.)

The only one I have seen was Assassins surviving a leap of faith. He used the time they took to fall and the real life height of a tower to conclude that gravity is different in AC. Completely ignores that they have repeatedly stated that the city isn't 1/1 scale so that tower is nowhere near the height they think it is.
Right, I see how it works. I could say that you *perform* acts that would be seen as terrorism, but don't complain that I called you a terrorist because I never said that word!Of course, pay no mind to the fact that he basically goes and dismisses all the negative response as an "angry mod" that "harassed Valve". Or that number of game developers and modders who said, outright, we don't approve of paid mods.Oh, and around 55 minutes or so, IIRC, McCaskey compares the people who didn't approve of paid mods to terrorists.
Australian here - the way they dress. I was grocery shopping and spotted a young guy in a turtle neck and with a man bag over shoulder. I knew he must be from Europe because no one dresses like that in my area. I was right - I had a chat to him, welcomed him to Oz and found out he was from Germany.
Sorry for the confusion. We had to rebuild this environment indeed.What I meant is that, rather than deploy directly to our prod environment and let Beanstalk do the swith over which works 99% of the time, we now clone our prod environment, deploy to it, and switch DNS after testing.
Perhaps they will, if not I don't really need people in my life that do not accept me for who I am. *I smile a little.* But, I'm sure you are right now and again. Maybe this is my chance to be happily surprised?  *I chuckle.*
Pickup trucks are body on frame, and have a separate bed box and cab/front group, typically. That means the only structural member connecting the front and rear suspensions are the two frame rails. Any truck that would "snap in half" (they're made out of steel, not balsa wood) if you pick them up at ANY point on the frame between the front spring eye mount and the rear A arm mount would ALSO snap in half the first time it his a large bump with a load in the bed.
Is English your first language? Closed means zero, none,  nothing.  If you close a gap that means you are caught up.  You could be "closing in"  on your opponents before you catch up. That's about the only way you can use the word close in that way.

My SO is just uncultured swine, so he's never read the books despite having been that age group. I talked him into letting me read the books to him. I've been getting really into the voices and sound effects. We are just starting book 2 so we haven't made it very far, but its actually really fun.
Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Portal 2, Civ 5 all run fine. Can't max out settings though. With my n64 emulator and a high res texture pack I get lowish framerates, but with the default textures it does fine. If you do very light gaming, or older games, you'll be fine. If you want to run anything more modern or taxing, wait for the 15" refresh and grab the discrete graphics option.
Bloom works great to take out a group of enemies. I use shatter and bloom and if you get one and a little of another the bloom finishes them off. I've gotten double and triple kills off of bloom.

Burn Incents. When I was 16 I had a house party while my mom was gone. I invited 15 people over to get shitty, ended up being close to 50. Nearly everyone was smoking in the house, cigs,pot, one guy lit up some meth.We ran out of Febreeze and in a last ditch effort we lighted about 6 fruity smelling incents. Cleared the whole house out of any funky smells. Downside, the house smelled like John Lennons dirty laundry.
Yeah that happens when it cools down too much. We figured out a solution at work- fill a thermal coffee pot with hot water, dump it out and fill it back up with the hollandaise. But again, large amount and has to stay good for 4-7 hours. When you make it, just be sure to temp the butter and make sure it's no more than 150
That is a good point, but as a keyboard hobbyist, I am quite prone to impulsivity. I don't have the money for it rn in my primary bank account, so hopefully the desire will have gone away by the time I make my next deposit.
I'm with you except for this part:&gt; You mean negates the effectiveness of LRMs in any capacity? Let's see, things that over-ride ECM: Tag, Narc, BAP, UAV, PPC fire hitting ECM mech, other ECM in counter mode, destroying the ECM component on the ECM mech.There are plenty of counters to ECM. There is only one counter to LRM: Breaking LoS, preferably with a solid object that will take the hits for you. It's disingenuous to act like ECM is imbalanced vs LRMs when there are so many ways to overcome ECM and only one way to counter LRMs outside of destroying the mech using them.
I just double checked and the offer is now 30k. It was 50k this morning.Any ideas on if it will go back up to 50k? Should I call and ask for the 50k offer?EDIT: Opened a link in my email from AA, the offer exists until May 15th. The public link says 30k, though.
Oh baby, you are describing a Tiefling. If you are using 5th edition DnD, they are a core race in the Player Handbook. Google them or read up on them in the PHB and go nuts. Briefly speaking, they are descendants of a spell placed on some humans to seal away an evil demon/devil/god. As a result of using their souls to bind him, they began to exhibit demon physiology (horns, red skin, tails, etc) and some magical properties. These days, tiefling magic is gifted to them only if they decide to honor that heritage by creating a solemn pact with a god of their choosing.
Brianna's "on the way" obviously has a much longer timeline that one would assume. Just like the number of death threats changed daily, xe makes it up as xe goes along. 
The only reasons im seeing against the bale transfer arent good ones.Youd rather have gundogan hummels and clyne? We can have all of em . We have enough money.It will push di maria out? No it wont.Di maria will go on the opposite wing or in a 3 man midfield.
Hayes mech brake calipers are awesome and cheap. I'm running pricier shimano cx77s on my gravelized/dirt road bike and they suck compared to the hayes cx experts on my cross bike. The hayes feel as good as the hydraulic avids on my mtb.
Hi Vince,Im a big fan of BB and BCS, and I really like reading this AMA. You seem like an awesome guy. I got a funny idea while reading here: Could I become a side-character in a BCS season? I never did acting before, but my idea was about playing me, with my personality and charisma, in the story. No need for acting skill if I dont have to act like someone else. I got some crazy good ideas what I could do and I think that I would fit very good into some scenarios with some of the characters I already know from the show.  I wouldnt be disappointed if you say no. But IF you tell me no, pls also tell me what you think would be a good idea how to get into crazy situations that are maybe very dangerous, expensive, illegal or stuff like that. Without taking the risk of dying, without having alot of mony, and without landing in jail and stuff like that =DThanks for everything, you rock!
If you want to do c3s and gas/ore sites solo, a passive Gila will work fine. Rattlesnakes are just so damn slow to align and put alot of mass through a hole. A pair of remote rep Rattlesnakes can do c5 sites though. If running in groups, ishtars are really fast. Just assign drones to someone who is paying attention and mash dscan. 
The use of that is to preempt something he knows is going to be said in response to his post... Inb4 doesn't necessarily imply truth or falsehood on the statement. 
In case you haven't played Bioshock, he's not a typical bio-engineered big daddy.Like /u/Soundwavetrue said, he's just a big guy in a suit, physicality-wise.
Ringworm on near the pad.  Heck of a place to try to keep ointment on and around.  It's getting better and it doesn't bother him at all, other than the bandage.
There had been zero evidence to suggest the Apple Watch does not work on wrists with darker skintones, it seems incredibly irresponsible to report that. A small handful of people have reported issues with wrist tattoos, but to insinuate anything about issues with skintones based on one article asking "Will the Apple Watch’s coolest feature work for people of color?" is asinine.
If you want, you could install Nova launcher, which (I believe) has the option to tint the top and bottom of the home screen to provide more visibility of the white icons. 
I won't bother to read it as you just went onto my list of companies never to deal with because they copyright software. You are in the wrong economy.I wish you a lot of fun trying anyhow!
Bucks really couldn't have asked for more realistically. Valuable playoff experience for every player on this squad, showed grit and grind against a very good Bulls team. So much potential once Jabari comes back too
&gt;Authoritarian leftI dont care much about right vs left but I do care about authoritarian vs libertarian (political spectrum not parties)Me and my personal freedoms will sadly be looking for someone else to vote on (if I do)

I dated my wife for the first time when I was 23, I knew I wasn't in any sort of position to be building a true long term thing, me and my life were too messed up, mainly because frankly I was young, so we broke up after a year. Seven years later we got back together, married a year later, now have three kids. What changed was me, I matured and was ready.
I guess I would agree it shouldn't be passed on the grounds that it wasn't written just right. Possibly if they amended it with allowing certain modifications 
That looks more like a running fastball. Lots of spin from that view. I might be wrong though. I used to throw my running fast ball in HS exactly like this, with a circle-changish grip. 
Go to the match, there's nothing quite like seeing an AFL match live whereas you would be watching the boxing on TV, and there are likely to be replays of it straight after the fight.
I'm so patriotic my house ir red white and blue!I'm so goddamn patriotic, I piss red white and blu! Doc said it was prostate cancer. I said he needs to shut his goddamn comie mouth!
Never had an issue so long as it's not incredibly obscure. Heck, it's successfully identified music that my neighbors were playing filtering through 2 closed windows across the driveway.
Dang I wish we had radio stations that played other country than Luke Bryan and Florida Georgia Line garbage here in VA. I don't even listen to our radio stations...
Hypergamy is sort of the ultimate self evident truth of TRP. If you can't see hypergamy daily in your life it just means you aren't opening your eyes. Women clearly are looking for the best alpha possible with the highest level combination of looks, money, and status. If hypergamy wasn't real then Justin Bieber wouldn't get the insane reaction he does from women of all ages when he's spotted in a public space. You don't see rabid swarms of men gathering en masse all around the world just to catch a glimpse of a famous attractive woman the way rabid swarms of women of all ages gather for a famous attractive man.
You know you still didn't actually define abuse, right? From what you've said though, I don't really disagree. I guess the thing I don't understand is you're saying that systemic poverty etc are part of the problem but you get angry when people call poverty abuse. I don't quite understand why? Do you just not like that word being applied to it?
I wouldn't bother even asking this. Last time I asked a question about Acc caps in non-coil, I got downvoted to hell, and people generally just replied with "Negligible". Even though, at 419, I was missing a fair amount, people would still say 419 is more than enough.  On-topic though, I tank there with 419 accuracy, and haven't noticed any misses. It would be quite a fair amount lower for the flank (if there is any accuracy requirement)
I'm "mildly annoyed" that we're still on 5.0.1 while pretty much every other, older nexus device that's getting updated is on 5.1.x.I'm a lot more annoyed that the Nexus 9 on 5.0.x suffers from lockups, redraws, screen flicker, etc. Google didn't give it to me, or to anyone else for free. It would be nice if it worked properly. 
This was fun. I'm 22 and it reports back as 32-36 depending if I use a shaved picture or an old bearded selfie. I'm not that old. But have consistently been told for ages I just look older than I am. Got mistaken for a professor once. I hate my fat classmates. 
&gt;Backes was a very good two way player before we had Hitch, he just scored more haha.How do you figure?  He's consistently in the 20+ goals, 50+ points range during Hitch's tenure. (with exception to lockout year when his SH% was down)  That seems pretty solid for a player of his stature IMO.
I had a maths teacher in high school who would totally (and maybe did) fuck students. He was also orange and apparently terrified of how old he was. And generally a fucking cunt unless you had one.I can't think of anything about math specifically that would make one a pedophile, but it seems to be a bit of a trend.
I still struggle to see how that helps anyone but the company. The customer suffers longer. The cheater gets a longer period of time to abuse the customer. The Cheat developer gets a longer window to sell his cheats. The company gets to do less work.Edit* to add this this, Valve has been doing weekly banwaves recently and the community is going nuts over how good the cheater problem has become. 
Still it is the content that matters why should you be worried about the emery its displayed,if the content is there And clear than It there who care where it came  from
Keep in mind Slinker was pretty good at hiding and the Crystal Gems aren't the best at finding those who hide well, see the invisible gem monster from *Island Adventure*. Also it was only 2 Gems fighting it and depending on the monster they need all 3 working together to win.
Playground St aka rape alley. I swear every sexual assault email I got was about something around that street. I had an ex that lived there for two years. I basically lived with her senior year because I wanted to walk her home all the time. And then well you know. 
&gt;Its fairly obvious you didn't bother reading his post.You don't need to be so disparaging.  We're having a polite conversation.&gt;However it is incredibly easy to throw together an assortment of statistics using poor data or misrepresentation to prove whatever suit you.Well, not really "easy."&gt;The biggest correlation of how much violent crime is in a city is the percentage of population that is black, much more than the percentage that is in poverty.How is that racist, though?  If race is a better predictor than poverty, is it racist to point that out?&gt;He also tries to prove that race is the stand alone factor in several other segments.He seems to be suggesting that race is the STRONGEST predictor, which doesn't imply race is the CAUSE.  
You probably couldnt of known what your teacher was doing was wrong because he is supposed to be a role model so when he made fun of him you just assumed that it was ok 
By the way my GT is: Mr GhotiI'm usually always in for a raid even if I've done it for the week. Like to help and get more experience so if you need a filler shoot me a message. 
What kind of programming did you do? .Net, etc?Also, I'm asking mainly because I've dabbled in amphetamine and other stimulants and while I was always more productive, I tend to write better code when I'm slower. When I have so much energy and focus, I tend to be OK with doing it the long way because its also the easy way. I feel like less typing with more thought has helped me to become a better programmer, and that amph isn't that conducive to that besides having energy.

Supposedly 20k people came in from out of town on Easter to go to this church. That's crazy when you consider that the population of Lafayette is 24k. 
Yeah seriously, this would only upset people looking for things about the movie to be upset about. This could easily have an explanation in the SW universe. Even the two ships being together during the same time period is enough to not worry about it.
ya im with you guys. but i think the titans with met and marcus especially have a good shot at finding their guy. i wish hoyer and mallet were each a few years younger haha.
i think this would just result in a lot of AFKers...  to be honest I love the fact that TDB heroics are actually hard.  I have wiped a number of times on the killing Crota's soul doing it solo - since then i found a really sweet spot that is quite frankly sort of a cheese, but i enjoy the challenge.the key for rasputin if you don't have a ghorn is as much burst damage via heavy as you can muster as soon as the ogre spawns.  also, if you have enough heavy, shoot a rocket as the wizards spawn when they have the 2 or 3 spawn at once to limit the # of vestiges you need to deal with
This was a terrible pick for them.  If they truly believed he was their answer, you wouldnt have heard so many rumors. I think they just couldnt get enough of a good deal and went.  Well..... might as well pick him.
There is no report, it's just some trash someone on reddit made up. PWTorch doesn't have any article like that on their site and neither does any other dirtsheet.
Interesting to see all of these 90's properties coming out in the near future. Hope the delay helps out in the end. Maybe the could get the original Green Ranger to play a mentor role or something. 
I'm here! Just got home from work. No blood on these hands. I vote for evil genius. I suspect his visions are a manifestation of his being a werewolf.

No, you're closing the bread buns on the shit sandwich before you wipe the nutella off.You're making more of a mess to cleanup.If you dabbed some PB on bread and then realized you wanted a ham sandwich, would you smash the bread together and then pull it apart to wipe the PB off?
Yeah, I want 1) Kojima to not leave the industry or at least make a comeback under another studio whether he is directing or producing and 2) in said comeback make a horror game with Del Toro that just isn't named Silent Hills if they can escape being sued.
&gt;I would recommend 'Buddha in the Palm of your Hand' as a guidebook for these practices,[Words of My Perfect Teacher](http://www.amazon.com/Words-Perfect-Teacher-Translation-Introduction/dp/0300165323) is also really good. I've read it, I think, 4 times.
Depends how much you want temp control, I own a rdna 40 and absolutely love temp control. I don't want to blow it out of proportion as many people seem to do, but the ability to dial in temp for certain juices can make flavors really pop. The ipv mini 2 I do not own but I do have a friend who owns one and swears by it, and I really haven't heard anything bad about it. 
Yes. It's in their [employee handbook](https://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf). Strange as it may sound, it's really how that company works. It goes a long way to explain why things are the way they are.&gt; Are we really to believe that Valve don't have any janitors/maintenance people and that devs vacuum the floors etc?Don't be silly, those are contractors. Not even regular tech companies hire their own cleaning staff.
My thoughts on Mooses Tooth and they are common with my friend group:  Don't go there expecting to find an amazing simple pizza.  That is not their strong suit or where they shine.  They shine in their creations.  That is what me along with everyone I know love it.
What's funny about these things is squirrels can learn to defeat them, but rarely do. In Indiana when I was younger there was a squirrel that would dyno these... He was probably to smart for his own good though
Top: Oh well. If we are living in the past i would go with Wickd, Diamond, Froggen, Forg1ven, Edward.Jungle: Saying one player "made the team look goos" is just pathetic. Mid: When? He was banned until today since the Qualifier for LCS split 1. He didn't. Also i am not saying he is an asshole. He has a toxic past and that is a potential risk. However Incarnati0n is the least crazy name on that list IMO. A Superteam hast to be prooven tho. ADC: He is clearly above average. But he is clearly below Forg1ven and Rekkles (only if he finds bis form with Yellowstar again obviously).Support: ...
Yeah that's great but what is it that makes it good? Just because you laugh at a comedy anime doesn't mean it's good right? It can have the worst plot possible and still be funny. But that's just what i think.
Smoke grenades, and i used to play a field that used pull pin grenades with M80s in them so once you pulled the pin you had a few seconds to chunk it before you lost a few fingers. God those grenades were fun. Put an end to tacticool moves like diving or picking em up and trying to throw em back if they didn't go off
I like how they use the blur to imply they are nude but if you have ever seen it they are fully clothed/in underwear. Hax can't change models for other players buttheads.
yea thanks for the words and most likely meant to be but i couldn't even make shit up in a movie how much life can swing back and forth over a short period of time in life
Strela is a great watch, I have that model. It is a little hard to read at a quick glance for me, the silver hands and numbers get lost in the dial. Check out the poljot24 website (not sure if I am supposed to link to stores), their prices are a bit lower and the customer service is top notch.
Yeah, this is actually pretty shitty.edit: [actual budgies pictured here.](https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/peeps__140422233738.jpg?w=446&amp;h=299&amp;crop=1)
I only know of 3. Dave and Busters in the Waterfront, Tilted Kilt, and Latitude 40. No BWW or Primantis is showing it, they're just charging way too goddamn much
The obvious: I'm just not interested in 6 on 6 based on how the games play out. It's too small, too many of the classes don't function as intended, and (sorry) I think it's too much about individual play and not the big, messy, NFL style scrum that attracts me to the game. Not enough improvisation, too many players are relegated to pure support.I'm happy that people are going to get what they're looking for, but I'm someone who thinks HL, while acceptable, is a little small for my tastes. Nothing is better than the 12v12 matches I've had on good servers where everyone's actually playing and most of the field is pretty good. I'd rather queue 10 minutes for that instead of 5 minutes for a 12 man match, personally. It's a shame, because I've got 1000s of hours of play time, but if it's 6's I'll end up sticking to pubs.
My sub (StockingsPorn) or /u/Ghost978 's sub (FF_N_Hosiery)? Either way, both are good :)If there are women with this fetish, I'd like to meet them (or follow them online). Yeah, my gf too. She's indifferent about them, but wears them for me. There were a few stockings she was honestly excited about, which was great. One would think a girl would love having a 'you pick I pay' policy with lingerie and stockings... The one thing I would love her to be able to do is learn how to tease properly with stockings (I tried teaching her, and she was a good sport, but no success). Now, I don't know your relationship, but I found it's best if you make picking the stockings/lingerie a fun, lighthearted activity for both of you. 
My family has fighters from both side of the war, North and South. Dad is intelligence for the South; his uncle is high ranking intelligence officer for the North. During the war, the family reunion lasts 20 minutes and they have to hurriedly depart. There is no animosity, just concern for well being of each other.I help maintain site about the Vietnam War. I don't share the same view of the site editor.
Yes it would it's called deliberate indifference and I would be charged with negligence if I let it happen with my knowledge of it happening. If I walk away from the area and I come back to do my check which my checks are done once an hour. And I find a dude hanging in his cell, step one is get on the radio and call a medical priority, step two get inside and hold him up if he wakes up and starts fighting me and I can't reasonably restrain him by myself without hurting him further I back off until other officers get there to help me. So it all depends on the circumstance to be honest. 
If you have strong examples to showcase your point, use them. &gt;There is a HUGE problem with expectations and entitlement in this country./&gt; People believe because we are the richest nation on earth that they should also enjoy ALL the luxuries of being the richest on earth.I mean yeah sure if that's the point you're trying to make don't use basic cellphone service and a TV as an example for expectations and entitlement.
Thanks again! You really helped a lot.When I can't find info on something and eventually figure it out (with or without help), I put up a youtube video so as to maybe help others looking for information (and it helps me keep track of what I did too). So I put up a quick clip of the trace and how it was done :)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1Pwg6cpcOA&amp;feature=youtu.be
Pretty sure it's just XInput capable devices that are supported, but even then there's probably mapping issues for any wildly alien controller. Check the back of the controller in question? XInput / "Other-Mode"  to be on a toggle switch back there on most gamepads I've come across.

I like this point you made about Mass Effect. My gut reaction to this announcement my was skepticism, but I like this analogy and I think I'll be open minded about the game f r on now on.
well, is kinda messy, but the thing is, in the show im loved, but in real life people just say, what a douche, and im not even in character when im with friends
*Rukin takes the cup and sips from it* "Thank you very much. Hmm interesting. I have to agree with you, together we can cause quite a bit of damage. And we would have more sway politically. I accept, but I need to know a couple things before we make this official"
yeah limit the pump shotgun to battle royale where it belongs. where no one gives a shit about dying. there is simply no justification for having it in it's current state in the domain of survival mode. literally insta death any time you are around it unless you are lucky or just run. but even so the odds are the shotgun just wins. what kinda backwards design is that? please feel free to try and defend shotgun. i am curious what you have to say.

How often is suicide accomplished by self inflicted blunt force trauma to the neck? Seems like shooting yourself in the chest with a nail gun would be more common.
You shouldn't list everything you do on your business card. Your business card is given to people that you want can provide value to – so unless you’re meeting and networking with a bunch of church volunteers regularly, you don’t need one for church. I had 3 business cards at one point:- For-profit company that was professionally designed, thick card stock, company branding, *no job title*- Non-profit charity that I ran, had all of the contact info, no logo, no job title. - A media card that has my pseudonym on it, email, phone, and said in italics "*Activist*" this is for when I was talking to the media, giving my card to someone I didn't really want to talk to again, ect. As for ordering business cards, just stay tuned to places like Slickdeals.com and other deal websites. Very often promotional deals will come around "250 1-color business cards, $5, free shipping". That's the cheapest way I've found to do it for my charity and media cards.

Well with the stellar broadcasting RTE has had in the past. I think this move is in the benefit of everyone to insure the tax payer aka tv license payer doesnt have to write a cheque for defamation like they have done in the past ( like the primetime special on the rapist priest, whose lawyers hightlighted that they he wasnt a rapist. Rte still broadcast non-factual report anyway).
Ugh, over half her recent posts are just a link to that fucking stupid guardian post. No, spamming a video of some old lesbian "debunking" all the shit we know about homosexuality so far with only unsupported assertions and anecdotes which show, if anything, that she has always been a lesbian but was pressured out of accepting her sexuality doesn't help your "argument" that anybody can just fucking become gay on a whim.Why don't we just get rid of everything? We don't need all this male-centric bullshit, I can be something between an electron and a plasma if I fucking say I am, stop oppressing me and pls send Patreon moneys.
The bucks were dirty and physical all series. The Bulls get physical back and the Bucks cry all game and act like children. They are literally the team version of psycho T.

I am pretty sure, but I only found it reported by Nintendolife and they referred to models and their comment section assumed model kit. I know Kotokbukiya produces model kits, but I am not sure if they produce figures.

Got the toddler packed and out the door with her father to go camping for a few days.  So now it's just me and 12 week old for a few :)I may not cook for the next few days :)
&gt; What do you mean by 'better.' If you have no objective morality, there is no 'better' and 'worse'.When you say a certain food tastes better than another food, what do you mean by "better"? If there is no objective food-taste, then there is no "better" or "worse." See how awful your argument is?
Parents sometimes have an unhealthy habit of scoffing off their kids' mental well-being as a product of school-related stress, etc.It may be wise to point out some scientific sources for them to look at, as some people are unaware of the true nature of depression (even in this day and age). In some circles it still carries a certain stigma.
Doubtful. The data shows this was a bad idea. GabeN openly said if the data was bad, the idea would get scrapped. If they try it again, it will be a very different set up under very different circumstances.
I'm not sure if these kinds of things are allowed on here, but holy shit. I just stumbled upon this "article" when wandering the depths of the internet and it makes me feel so dirty. Ugh.Edit: the website is full of opinions just like these. See: http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-things-remember-you-love-person-with-divorced-parents.html (10 Things to Remember If You Love A Person With Divorced Parents) and http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-things-real-man-does-when-hes-relationship.html (10 Things a Real Man Does When He’s in a Relationship). It's just so toxic. 
How about not taking my opinion as a fact then genius, no one's forcing you to, i can generalize my point all i want, that's how an opinion works and it's based on my real life interactions with people in the fieldand wow, really progressive research you're doing there, how to make planes fly like birds, next you'll be researching if the world is flat or round.
The D750 was enough to make me sell my 5Dmkii, 7D, speedlights and a couple L lenses.It's a spectacular camera. The 50 1.8 is amazing on it and is quite light. I managed to pick up a Tokina 28-70 2.6-2.8 which is outstanding, but my find has been the older 105mm 2.5 AI /AIs. Manual focus, and absolutely incredible on this body. Best $200 I've spent on a piece of equipment.
i can imagine that urban beekeeping is an issue that would definitely require some restrictions or at least careful thought. first thing that comes to mind is a child getting a terrible allergic reaction and ending up in hospital due to bees that inhabit a hive just over the fence; how do you legislate against that happening while also allowing people to use their property? it's difficult.
I'm not saying i wouldn't wear a smart-watch but something like a zen or a pebble is closer to where id want it to be than this iwatch, which is hilariously moot anyway because theres no way I'm going back to the iphone which I think is required for it to work. Also whenever I see the iwatch it just makes me wish I could afford a ressence type3.
No it's not!  Dirt 3 might as well take quarters compared to this.  Check out what folks are saying over at /r/simrally I for one am really enjoying the challenge of it. 
Actually in the west and east coast, large amounts of forest need to be cut down to clear an area for wind plant and roads. That land is wasted.There is some indication that farm animals are not real happy with the racket from the wind mills.
People aren't even running it once a day.  Making it per character would not do anything to increase activity.The reason ppl ran it before was for the blueprints.
&gt;forgot to mention we've been together for 3 years and this has really only started up in the last year.If I were a betting man, I'd bet he has told you a major lie within the last year.In my experience, those who are the most paranoid about being lied to are those who lie the most. It's kinda like how cheaters often suspect or accuse their partners of infidelity. They're projecting.

It feels so great to not be alone. I was a quarterback in high school and threw probably 100+ (real) passes a day (not counting warming up, etc), 4-5 days a week for 5 years. My right shoulder just hinges at a different angle than my left. It's so annoying. My left leg is also longer than my right. Dammit. 
Absolutely the kind of story I wanted to hear!  Kinda how mine went. My buddy kind of said "oh shit!" about 3/4 of the way through my hit. Not good when that happens. I milked that sucker yellow.

never sold my crap unit if it is not duplicate. some of crappy unit I still keep is behemoth, emilia, eric, darvan, etc.glad I kept will, Alice, lava, ronel, golem, etc.*tbh I don't own any new 7 stars batch despite spending $40+*
Attacks are made by rolling 2 D6 and adding the results together. Defense rolls are the same with whoever rolling higher winning the duel. Ties go to the attacker.If I get 3 attacks for the price of 1 with a -4 to hit, what is the chance of hitting vs a single attack with no minus. How much does it change if the rolls are made with a -3 instead of -4?
There's a dozen pictures of random people walking down the street on the front page at all times. What makes you people find this one offensive? There were exactly zero insults. 
I think that technically there may have been other important individuals and security outside the room that could have entered if they thought they could avoid the attacks. Besides, as Khan was blackmailed into being a Section 31 agent for some time prior to the film he may have known Kirk's face and name already.

Did u stencil it out first at least? I'd love yo try this but not that good at drawing. Maybe if it was traced onto the wood and then I just had to burn it...
Hybrids, like Jogani (they're like, fox/wolf mixes aren't they?) could also be a thing... I imagine species being treated in an anthro world as race is in the real world. Species is to race as breed is to nationality. Canine from Ireland might be a corgi, but one from Germany might be a GSD. Both are canines, but they're different flavors, if you will, of canine.
I want to be helpful, but asking "what the deal is with charter schools" is basically like asking "what the deal is with public schools." Some are amazing, some are horrible, some are okay.[I spoke about my experiences](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/nyregion/at-success-academy-charter-schools-polarizing-methods-and-superior-results.html?_r=0) (anonymously) from working at a Success charter school (I hated it). But, I have coworkers from that same school who left to work for KIPP and love it.Make sure to do as much research as possible before you accept. Ask to spend the day observing, talk to the current teachers, talk to the students, talk to the admin.
Thank you so much, seriously. This message means a lot to me. I've been extremely stressed over this for months now, and it's just, really nice to read that. I hope you have a shit ton of fun with history, dude! :D
I love the UI, but I always like upgrades as well...and from what they are saying, when Win 10 gets a full release and Universal apps become a common staple...the X1 UI will get an overhaul.

I lived in Nairobi, Kenya for a while -- it's a pretty fun place, though the infrastructure and safety isn't the greatest. http://ihub.co.ke/ is the local hub for tech stuff. Before that I was living in the Seychelles, off the coast of Somalia. There's not really any tech (or cities, really) to speak of out there, but it's a beautiful place. And they've got much better internet these days, I'm told.
I was going to nominate him but you beat me to it. Pioxys would be a great mod. He shows a fair bit of bias towards a certain Pokemon but he'd still make a great candidate.
That sounds awful. I should add that e-mailing them is next to pointless. I e-mailed them many times regarding account issues, and wouldn't really receive a reply. My problems were only resolved when I called them and spoke to someone directly.
Yeah, I starred at a clock unblinking for awhile, I know it was a clock so I should know how long but I was more concerned with how I hadn't blinked in a long time and my friend asleep next to me might wake up and be like wtf? I ended up blinking through sheer will 
Did I? If so, it must be terribly forgettable... Hell, they didn't even name it after a bird of prey like the others. Even the Condor got a name :P Farragut is the name of an Americal Cival War admiral, but if the capital ship has another name its probably a raptor of some sort.It is kindof a black sheep though. Eagle and Vulture are both highly agile, somewhat fragile strike craft, and the Dropship.... is a tank.
Half of mine are yellow too... The yellow ones are actually the worst. The black I can rub off. The yellow just smears everywhere and makes a huge mess.
Another person says, The main piece - complete interception of the storming of Grozny 131 Maikop Motorized Rifle Brigade. The brigade was encircled and fled to / Railway station. Almost all of the armor was burned. Hoarse voice (single voice applying mate in the air) belongs to the brigade commander - Colonel Savin. His call sign - the tenth, as Calibre 10. He saved a few survivors. But he was killed by a shrapnel wound to the eye. After intercept heard that the commander looking for, but it is no longer alive ...

...so what?  Same thing, really.  And it's still a silly thing to say.  Not all manual gearboxes are that great to shift.  There's plenty of paddle-shift boxes that are very engaging. 
no they can not. When you check in with the starter you have to present the resident card. It's a photo ID. The best thing they can do for you is reserve the round with their pin. 
Where are u seeing the Revo S for $110?  On the Abu Garcia website, and on Tackle Warehouse, its $130.  Whatever the case, I would recommend against it.  I have one, and while it works fine I still prefer my Orra SX or my Revo SX because they have magnetic braking dials on the side, so its easier to get the reel dialed in.  Since you seem to be more on a budget, I would probably recommend the Orra SX
There is actually one thing that makes me ALMOST SURE that there will be NO LEGACY:The attack speed buff from 1.05 --&gt; 1.15 APS would effect all existing copies. Meaning legacy copies would actually receive a buff. A buff alongside with the new Wrath buff.Would GGG really double-buff an already OP unique and then NOT go for a retroactive nerf, but make it legacy when they could easily prevent legacy versions? I don't think so.
I personally think he (and we) would enjoy a Kerbal Space Program series. Kurt and Zisteau really enjoyed it, and it seems like the kind of thing he'd like. It has so much variety, and it came out of early access only 3 days ago.

I have the 2015 abacus and ride it just slightly set back. Definitely rides like a freestyle board and I recommend it! So much fun on the way down and skin traction is still pretty damn good despite the rocker profile. Edit: it's the 158cm abacus and I weigh about 180 all geared up, works great!

Driverless, electric vehicles as commonplace.Eyeglasses and Contact lens descendants of HoloLens have largely replaced TVs, Phones, Tablets, and computer monitors at home, and maybe in some other settings.Majority of the world powered by renewable energy, and some small percentage powered by Fusion as the technology continues to develop.Some kind of basic income or other good welfare reform in many/most countries to offset the effects of technological unemployment.
Have Gruden scream at them like he used to do at practice. My god, that man can whisper and put chills into you. Also, anyone can get me a picture with those glasses on him.  I have never seen that in my life, he put them back on.. I wanna hang it up on my wall.Too, why the fuck are ya booing, i'd shove my foot up their ass. 
i am just trying to give you a little advice my friend. i understand what you are saying. your writing is crystal clear. some of my advice was more just being comfortable being out in public and new situations. that is all. its not about making friends, its about continuing to putting yourself in new spots, going to new places, and by doing this gaining confidence in yourself that you can handle the unknown. if you have to bring a family member that you are close with that is fine. but if you shell up and don't put yourself out there, of course, you won't have confidence in yourself. it is important that you leave your house and put yourself in situations that you are unaccustomed too. if you are close with a relative, bring them with. it is one step at a time.

I believe Windows is reading the EXIF:ModifyDate tag which is data internal to the file and different from the file system's FileModifyDate.  My quick test shows that Windows will read that date from the file if it exists and use it for the Date column, otherwise it will use the file system's FileModifyDate.  The info can be changed depending upon the software used.  Inside the file there is probably the actual date and time that the picture was actually taken (EXIF:DateTimeOriginal).  Though for some reason, Windows doesn't actually use this date, from what I can tell.
It seems as if Accenture has a reputation for having a lot of people on the bench compared to the Big 4 / a string of hiring freezes. Do you think that Accenture is simply not able to obtain the business they thought they would have (and therefore have too many people)? Or staffers not suited to current projects, etc? 
Because she's the only person in any series ever to be called Khaleesi, let alone in the world of game of thronesThere has been a bunch of different kings, knights, ladys, lords, commanders, etc. If another Khaleesi appears as a character people will start distinguishing with the names. 
You are correct when it comes to CSS2. There is however a module draft in development progress that allows the content rule on any element and via any selector, which is why some browsers already support it. I cannot predict whether that will make it into CSS3, but if it does, it solves many problems with responsive images.

I'll tell you if I come up with one."Under what banner could you dismantle one-half of the ideology of the political left across the entire western world" is a hard question. edit: dunno, maybe a casual starter could be #realjustice and then along the way ask SJWs "did you ever think of being a real justice warrior?" or "an actual justice warrior". Would be an argument magnet, so you need good answers. Would also need sloganeering.
My 10th grade science teacher called me out in front of my class since I was doing vocabulary homework in his class instead of paying attention. He called me "a lazy sack of crap". I wasn't mad since it was true but I was mad since I was actually doing productive work, sure it was for another class but it was actual work.
As someone who just discovered Freaks and Geeks on Netflix and watch the last episode last night I can totally agreed. Why is there only one season of that fantastic show?

Congrats! It's a rewarding profession for sure. I'm sure you've heard this, but try to get at least a couple, if not more, of the exams done in college. 
You're welcome dude. I very vaguely recalled learning about problems developing from lack of physical affection from my high school psych class, so I knew the research existed *somewhere*. And your childhood sounded horrible, at least from what I can gather from this snippet of it. What's your relationship with your parents now, if you don't mind me asking? (And feel free not to answer, it is a rather personal and somewhat off topic question, I just wondered how they could possibly justify that treatment of kid you.)
Didn't tried it on timber yet, but from others you listed it's good only on invoker, maybe core ES. In reality it's great luxury item to reduce cooldowns on items and ults/not low cd spells. It's best on splitpushing heroes, or cores like necro, inv, puck that like to go for high cd items and have great ultimates too.
I like Barzal, but there's not way he's being picked at #4. And comparing him to Giroux? Not even the same type of players. Giroux's strongest asset as a prospect was his defensive abilities and his all-around game. Barzal is an amazing playmaker, he skates fast, he's creative, but his defensive game is average and he creates a lot of turnovers.He reminds me a lot of Brett Connolly.
If you've got a controller, you could use something like xpadder to get the controls to how you like.  Things like the Logitech G13/Nostromo game pads are great for older games too.
When i was in second grade, my teacher told my parents at Parent-Teacher Night that (and i quote): "Starzajo will be good at whatever he does in life, whether it's legal or not."  
While I wish we had female player models, I have to agree with you. Rust has a ruthless player base, and I can't help but feel like adding a female character model would probably cause more problems than it would solve.
All you're doing is spreading CoE's damage boost over a larger duration. You're not gaining any damage, especially since Skull Grasp inherently results in you losing a lot of damage when using 6WW pieces.Not to mention you typically have at the very least 60% of your total damage coming from dust devils. Spreading the remaining damage across multiple elements will not only be insignificant when it comes to dealing more steady damage, it will also lower your total damage by using runes that might not be ideal and/or benefit from your elemental damage on bracers/neck.
I don't have roommates anymore (for a reason!), but back in college I had one who was just non-stop loud. She talked loudly, she laughed loudly, she had loud guests, she had loud sex with her boyfriend, she listened to loud music, she watched tv on max volume, she slammed doors, she clattered dishes, her footsteps were heavy, her dog barked constantly, and I swear this girl snored so loudly you could hear it outside the building. That entire year there was not one minute of silence in our apartment.

&gt;Strawman.Oh, were you describing what you're trying to do?&gt;The rioters being rioters does not negate the need for police brutality, among other things to cease. I never said anything of the sort.  Police brutality and other institutional problems in the justice systems are serious problems that need to be solved.  Just because I'm criticizing the rioters doesn't mean I'm focused 100% on that issue.
[I'd always heard this term in relation to fashion](http://www.thevine.com.au/fashion/news/what-the-fashion-where-did-the-fuccboi-come-from-20150409-299135/)
For ease of math let's say your base paycheck is $100.00 and taxes are 25% and you're doing a 10% contribution. If you go Roth IRA you'll pay $25 in taxes before your contribution. So 10% of $75 is $7.50 contributed. If you go traditional, you contribute before taxes so 10% of $100 is $10 in contributions. At a rate of return of 5% annually you'll make more money on the traditional. $9 over 30 years. But you'll pay 25% in taxes upon withdrawal. So you get to withdraw $14.25A Roth plan with the same rate of return will give you a $4 return over 30 years. And you don't have to pay taxes. So you withdraw $14.00. The traditional IRA wins. Time is the most important factor in investing. The more you have in longer the more return. 
The patch file is literally the folder in your "C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin\Origin Games\Dragon Age Inquisition\Update" folder named "Patch." To back it up simply copy and paste it onto another place on your computer so you have a clean version of it in case P7 does break mods. ~~This is only necessary if you plan on reverting back to P6 to mod if P7 breaks modding.~~ EDIT: You should actually make a backup if you plan on modding the game. A clean version of the patch is required to compile the mods. So make a backup before you start modding!You could wait and try modding P7 when it comes out but chances are P7 is going to break modding so this will do nothing for you. It won't break your saves but it could break the game files which can be easily by repairing your game files in Origin.Hope this helped. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask! :)
And the worst part is the student thinks she can do whatever she wants and the moment there are consequences its "he hit me!" "Omg so disrespectful!" It is seriously a mental illness or something 
The only thing better than a low interest rate is no interest rate, ie no payments at all. I'm of the opinion that cars are a horrible investment and nothing is worse than having a 20k loan on a 15 car. Pay what you feel comfortable with, but make sure you're not sacrificing paying off other loans and you're still able to invest for retirement.

Hoestly, if all she does is make little catty comments I'd say invite her. If she were nuts and going to make a scene that's one thing, but a snide remark isn't going to be worth you deliberately and publicly snubbing her. Plus, if she really dislikes you so much she might not even come!

That's the opposite of what I was after.That said, I don't know your motivations, so I see no contradiction in asking for more information and then suggesting that you might not want to answer in the same post.And that said, since you think I'm *baiting* you, I'd suggest you go read [this bit about getting hit](http://www.bikeforums.net/advocacy-safety/784360-if-you-ve-been-hit-motor-vehicle-all-members-read.html) on bikeforums.

As long as Dan is remembered - which I think he will be - then he's accomplished his goal. Not every "great" has to be a great person or player. Most people remember purple kelly and naonka and they weren't 'great" at all.

So this is hard because you have to *take it upon yourself* to make a change. There's no magic pill that will fix you.You just have to get up. Make yourself some tea or coffee or juice or water, and some toast or cereal or *whatever!* Eggs are good. Oatmeal.The first ten minutes of any day are the hardest. Making breakfast will distract you. Just have will power. "I don't want to get up, but *I'm going to anyway!*"
We can all agree that the 7.3L is the best engine of all time.  :D  From what I've heard, it takes about $2K or a little more to fix the issues the 6.0 had from factory. Which is what people are 'usually' referring to when they say bulletproofing. But because of this, you can find some 6.0's for a real bargain. 
&gt; one of them won't even address concerns with me directly, and will text my s/o instead.This is common behavior and should be expected.  Its a way to avoid confrontation for both sides.  I mean you can live with your SO for years and not learn how to address concerns with each other.  Relationship therapists will tell you to write it down instead of saying it.
That could work, imo. Not everyone has ALL those. Maybe someone ONLY wants to provide their Instagram. From there, people can find their other accounts but will allow to narrow it down for the mods/voters in this subreddit.

I'm not a teacher but when I was in kindergarten one of my teachers informed me that I would never be able to read, ever. This lead to me hating reading and eventually getting put into a special program in elementary school because I couldn't read. Eventually though I got through it, and now I avoid the bookstore for fear of emptying my wallet.
Oh god yes, please bring back combo videos. I'm really tired of those montage parodies that everyone seems to be doing now. The first few were funny, but they got old really quickly. I want more high quality cool diverse combo videos like "awesome" x2 and AriqueNuubs
TBH I've never even heard her say that (but if you can actually provide proof/ link, that'd be great!). Merely going by the standard of what the actual Miss Congeniality entails for my criteria.
I had a substitute in 5th grade (was a 4th/5th split) that threatened our lives twice in one day, until we reported him during lunch time and he was banned from the district.We were talking in the hall and he hushed us. When we went back to the room he *yelled* and I mean *bellowed* "If I ever have to tell you to be quiet again, you will never again see the light of day!" and, later (keep in mind, we were coming or going to recess, so it was high excitement time) "You won't see the sun rise tomorrow if you make me raise my voice!" (while voice was obviously *very* raised.Yep, no subbing in our district again. He was old, too. Our principal or assistant principal taught the rest of class. Came in and basically said "Hey, so... your substitute had other... nope. He was wrong. You don't have to worry about seeing him again. That was very inappropriate of him. I hope we have a quiet day."
I am truly not as up on these circumstances as you appear to be, however, i have not lived on the moon.Yes, the attempt is to make the game safer. I agree.What i do not agree with is putting this crop of kids at risk to prove what is, as yet, just a theory.
&gt;not signing any baby's birth-certificate until a dna test has proven you the dadYour signature is not required for you to be listed as the father. A woman can just name whoever she likes with no penalties at all - it doesn't matter if she lies.In fact many US states she is *required by law* to name a "father" in order to receive welfare/assistance. The state then goes after the "father" to recoup the costs.In some areas if you do not contest it within 6 months you are legally forever the father (assuming you were even notified about your "fatherhood" which is not required) with no ability to contest it even if you have DNA proof.
&gt; Everyone knows Counter Logic Gaming is one of the oldest and most well established gaming organizations in the esports scene.    Wtf. are they serious? thats pathetic. CLG isnt any older than league of legends. There are WAY older organizations in other games in esports
I agree with you on this one. Funny story on this note, though: I was watching Breaking Bad while living abroad in NZ, and down here the show was coming out about 1.5-2 years after the seasons debuted in the US; so when the season finale came out, we were only halfway through season 4. I remember the very last episode was when they tried to kill Gus with a car bomb. I tried to keep myself insulated from spoilers, and I was really good at it. I went home to the US a week after that episode, and while I was home the finale showed on TV - which I avoided watching, and again successfully avoided spoilers. Then, literally less than a week or two after the finale (I think), they showed a news piece about people visiting the fake grave of walter white in ABQ - which alone is sort of a spoiler, fine, but then the asshole Reno NV newscasters were like "Well Walter White dies at the end." "Oh haha Tom, well I guess that's a huge spoiler. Oh well! Moving on to the weather..."
On a random note I just read from Lockdown, apparently NeoNET has some kind of facility out in Albuquerque that just shipped something to the Boston HQ. Then the crazy quarantine zone happens. Could be coincidence or NeoNET's Albuquerque branch could have something to do with CFD.

Wrong and wrong.[Wikpedia entry on Cousin Marriage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage)Excerpt:&gt; Children of first-cousin marriages have a doubled risk of genetic disorders (although scientists contend this is relatively small of six percent, compared with three percent risk for children whose parents are genetically not related to each other).It may sound like I'm promoting cousin/cousin relationships, but really I just dislike misinformation.
What class are you using this for? Most pistols are only "good" under 25 meters or so, but any of the NS guns can be used further out (at the cost of being less reliable in those up-close-and-personal situations).
I pray you don't get down voted because you speak truth, that said I'm pretty indifferent to whether it goes legacy or not.Truthfully I potentially stand to gain [significantly](http://i.imgur.com/SJCbozJ.jpg) if it goes legacy however in my relative short time playing (I started playing in September. ) I've noted that for the most part while GGG enjoy seeing people break the game with entirely over powered builds eventually they get toned down. So from my perspective it seems futile to worry about going for the top face roll builds that vaporize content because eventually they will break it. Seems more enjoyable to find niche creative builds that aren't game destroying than worry about min maxing then get upset when you get nerfed.
I agree. As much as I would like to go to college, I feel like it will be a struggle for me. It also doesn't help that I have a friend who tries to force me into going to college after high school.
Well it's a game of definitions.  My inclination is that standards will always go up fast enough so that some people will be considered poor.  People always compare themselves to their neighbors, never to the previous generation.
That's insightful! Thanks! I'm sure you know, but if you don't, you can always change the pressure sensitive setting (it's a check box) on the top bar when you have your brush active. 
I'm on NA, and I used to be an ADC main. My support and I were (and still are) best friends, so we always preferred laning together and we made a pretty good combo (I miss the early days of S3 and our MF-Leona combo).Now, though, I've switched to pretty much being a top main, after we started playing with a group of guys where one was a big ADC main and I had already started playing topAs for champs, I play a lot (And I do mean, a lot) of Nidalee when I'm able to play, and other stuff like Hecarim, Poppy, and Skarner. Last summer, I actually got a reputation with my friends for bringing out really unusual stuff (Anivia top, AP Blitz top, AD Blitz top, Jinx, Lucian, basically if I owned a champion, I would play it top)

I think if they can do their job, I don't care how old they are. Everyone ages differently, and unless they give me a reason to believe their age is a problem, it isn't.
Well you can't *un*hear something, right? So there ya go. You can go around expressing your opinions all you want, but if someone *actually listens*? Well, you've forced it on them. They're stuck with it now.
I know a lot of us Blues fan want him, everyone WANTS him. Leading the Blues to their first cup would be a story.. but Edmonton works too.  I hate this speculation though. Very likely he will just stay in Detroit.. get all our hopes up for nothin'
The dominant religion in Russia is Christianity. Christianity propagates sexual repression through shame; consider stigmas on masturbation, pre-marital sex, and the view that sodomy and homosexuality are sins.I have no idea why China is or is not anti-gay. That issue is wholly unrelated to the sexual repression influenced by Judeo-Christian cultural underpinnings.
That is certainly a fair point (I don't disagree that each person makes their own choices), but it doesn't really make sense in the context of this conversation. I was responding to a comment saying caffeine and tobacco are the same as heroin and crack. Whether or not someone should be allowed to do what they want is irrelevant in that regard. 
&gt;What if the culture doesn't value your help as a foreigner? Are you saying that the Chinese are racist? And, by extension, racist to the point that they would refuse assistance even if they were in need? I'm hoping I am misunderstanding you.
This has been happening to me for years. I'll be going about my day and suddenly something will trigger a dream recall that causes my brain to have some sort of panic attack. I'll feel light headed and sometimes even totally forget what I was doing during the minutes leading up to the recall. Still trying to find a way to prevent it!
That sounds really interesting. It looks like a nice balanced (and slightly unpredictable way) for all players to have creative license on the story.Are you finding players are having any trouble selecting a bond or having a hard time coming up with an explanation for the result roll? 
made all these moves? the fuck you talkin about?he traded away mccoy who isnt good in the red zone for two backs that are. upgraded LB, arguably upgraded S(jenkins last year) and made a big effort this offseason(mccourty, cant force him to leave the patriots), brought in good young WRs and TE's. added Sproles. lost maclin in a bidding war that got too expensive. and at worst sidegraded at CB.his only questionable trade was bradford, for foles and a 2nd, which assuming healthy is not a bad trade at all.
Why is it false? Because I used the term "criminal sciences" and you translated that to a tv show? So you are saying there have been no advancements in technology and/or criminal sciences then? Or maybe you are saying tons of innocent people are being sent to death row. What exactly is false about the comment that you replied to?
You're right. They should direct hospital funds away from staff and equipment towards specialty equipment for lifting the obese patients who are only there because of their preventable illnesses.
Is it a gas?If so, standard conditions for a gas are commonly 0 deg C and 1 atm pressure. But there are variations. Check your book for what you use for STP.
And to add to this, no offense OP but how are you a single digit HC and you're losing that many balls *per round*? I rarely lose more than a single ball in a round and I'm at a 17.5 (according to The Grint). I'm just not understanding how you can have that many penalty strokes and maintain a single digit HC. Am I missing something obvious? 
You can invest in e series without a td direct investing account, avoiding the fee for &lt;25k balance, which is the reason CCP recommends tangerine over e series for smaller balances.
I can turn off the notifications on the watch just as many steps. I just figure the watch should be able to quiet notifications when I turn on Do Not Disturb on the phone.

Modules these days have output degradation of or around .5% each year. So after 20 years they will still be producing ~90% of the power of a new one. Also, solar panels don't increase the probability of a lightning strike. Other equipment on site such as inverters, transformers, recombiners, etc. are just as likely to be struck. I do network engineering for sites like these throughout southern California, these panels are engineered to put up with year round abuse from dust and wind. 
Cavs still scare the fuck out of me, but if we can take advantage of their absences and somehow beat them. I think we can take anyone we see in the finals.
I think it'd be fun to see Sammi playing alongside Cooper with Carr throwing to both of them. Mack and Williams would have been an awesome defensive tandem, though. 
I am saying nothing of either rich or poor. I am saying that discussing what a rational actor is in any context other than ourselves is a waste of time. Everyone does what they do because they find more value in it, even if that value is not monetary value. The two of us, attempting to rationalize the actions of others, does nothing to support or dismantle the "rational actor" theory. Every sane individual is deemed to act in ways that are rational to their own self interest. 
They're called "Dragon Ball Mini Figure Selection"Here is a list of them all: Set 1: http://myfigurecollection.net/search.php?type_id=73457&amp;root=0&amp;type_strict=1&amp;type_p=-1Set 2: http://myfigurecollection.net/search.php?type_strict=1&amp;type_id=75038You can find them pretty cheap on ebay or if you can proxy, on http://www.suruga-ya.jp/ ebay sellers have a habit of not knowing the name either though so if you dig through the "Dragon ball figure" search you could find more. There is also a "Mini Figure Selection Plus"http://myfigurecollection.net/picture/773460&amp;ref=item%3A169226
I didn't find them to be too much stronger than normal.Executioner's Gloves, Tiny Tonitrus, and Flamesprayer/Rosmarinus can be pretty fun. I was really disappointed by A Call Beyond.There's also some fun to be had with Oil Urns, fire weapons, and charged R2s.
Fair point and valid opinion. But, it's also nice to believe we can learn from our mistakes and experiences. It's not so nice to believe a single mistake defines us for who we are. It's not like he has "must post curious things on reddit" ticks.He'll do fine. Let's raise our torches and pitchforks when he starts comparing himself to onions and pulling wax candles out of his ears.
First, probably the thought of life after death. And the threats (in their words, promises), about burning if I don't. I let it get to me and I've been feeling unsure I guess
/u/IAmNotAnImpersonater didn't say it was rape.  They said it was wrong and I totally agree with them.  There's something super sketchy about picking up a drunk girl when you're sober as a judge.  People are more susceptible in that state and taking advantage of that is really messed upIf someone does that kind of thing I think they're a shitty person.
I will prepare for a date and i will make everything perfect since this is the only thing i haven't done with my partner until now and when time unfreeze i want him sitting in-front of me.

I love Jim Sterling, but I find it difficult to feel bad for him when his videos get taken down. I have no problem with those games being called out for what they are, because in their state they're not worth the money they're asking for. But Jim almost always ends up insulting the developer, which is completely unnecessary. It's entirely possible to critique a piece of work without ever mentioning the creator.
Not yet.. I actually got hit by a car yesterday while on my back and can't handle packaging atm. Planned to send it today, going to have my wife help and get it out tomorrow 
Fathers and mothers die in combat all the time.  The kids will probably have someone to look after them,  maybe an uncle or aunt if not her man.  I seen it happen before.  I will say that I do believe you are wrong about having despair, I think it might have to do with brotherhood.  That is a big thing civilians do not understand.  
Australia - [Bonds Men's footlet](http://www.bonds.com.au/mens-logo-footlet-3pk-satq3n-03k.html), I bought a three pack 9 months ago and they're still great. They've got the silicon on the heel and sit about half way down the "top" of your foot.
He sucked with the Celts too.All he can do is pass, rebound and defend a bit. He can't shoot, so he can't attack the paint since he sucks at FTs. And that kills his ability to kick out.He's skilled. But he has a whole lot of negatives that are just not worth his positives.

As good as Kendricks may be, we have serious depth at that position. Cox could continue on as a stud but it's not like D-Lineman are particularly hard to come by. And frankly I'll take Mariota with the Eagles over Bradford who I think is good, but has serious question marks concerning health. 1 to 1, I'll take Mariota.I'd do that trade in a heartbeat, wouldn't even think about it, but that's not enough, they would have to trade draft picks, and that could be very significant.
No one is more upset about the Leonard Williams thing than me. He was my favorite USC player the last three seasons. He's the big cat. But our offensive line was atrocious for years. I hope Scherff becomes a Pro Bowler. Welcome to DC, Brandon.
Shoot, you're right. I was just thinking they complimented each other in terms of personality. At least, when it comes to the easy-going aspects of their personalities.

Well, no, but that wasn't the point. He may have wanted to review his work before trying to teach it to 300 students. That's his practice. Not to mention he throws out the "obviously" or "clearly" lines. Not knowing an answer off the top of your head isn't stupidity. Acting like you do, and then clearly not knowing, then coming back and acting like you do after you obviously did... It's borderline stupidity. We know you didn't know, just admit it. 
I'm going to try making some of these for newborn stage:http://www.adventuresinfluff.com/2011/08/how-to-sew-your-own-recycled-t-shirt.htmlI picked up a 10lb pack of t-shirt scraps from Princess Auto (supposed to be shop rags) for $10.  I've got them all sorted and ready to cut.  I just need to get going on it before the baby gets here!

Yeah, but it's clear they changed design direction. witcher 2 looks very simillar to witcher 3, meanwhile w1 alpha w2 is very simillar in design. The cinematic used for W1 also looked much like the design in-game.
Lil Jay is dope that's why, but regardless no Chief Keef is a better rapper than all those dude's you listed besides maybe Herb. And secondly I said this was /r/lewronggeneration because OP didn't say he doesn't like Chief Keef's rapping he is acting all superior &gt; Both. His lyrics are stupid, and you basically have to be stupid to like his musicHow can he Chief Keef not rap? He is drill. listen to these songs of him actually trying in his prime, I mean he damn near paved the lane in Drill for all those other dudes.[Strapped 2014(He Still can rap)](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=QOnQJczdIYA)[Everyday's Halloween](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS8OMv8VF70) [I Don't Know Dem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLo-Lw6idVU)[My Lil Niggaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T5F8DPsejs)[Everyday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD3xowIXjAA)[Aimed at You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBinh6AaSao)
Leo can't even bench press right now. He didn't bench at the combine and didn't bench at his pro day. I wouldn't want to pick someone with those injury concerns either.
Ahh, destroyed on Reddit. I knew it wouldn't take long. Thanks for being my first. But to be fair, you're right. Although there's a bit more to be said, that's the gist.There's no shortage of "5 things" marketing articles out there. Some of them even say they're strategies, but really they're just tools (e.g. posting on social media isn't a strategy, it's just using a tool). And that's exactly what I warn of:"Don't be deceived by increasingly accessible Web technology."Strategy is how you get from point A to point B. Those points are determined only by your company's goals and challenges combined with your games' goals, challenges and audience.Not tools, not standard things to do.The truth that no one wants to hear (not even me) is that selling video games is really hard. And no standard solutions exists.Hope that helps make more sense of the article for you.
Caps and Wiz during the playoffs are fine, but a) it's just a draft and b) as /u/carfey said, it's drowning out talk about the actual game for which this thread was made. 
After reading this comment I realized I care a lot more about the story of how you got gold on your birthday than I do about why John Connor is a terminator.Cheers on another trip around the sun, dude.
Recently hit 120kg for a single this past Monday, though watching the video i took, the depth was slightly questionable. Previous best (with good depth) was 115x2 :)
First questionable pick of the night.Edit: Yes, I know Winston is risky, but he fills a need. Jets are stacked on their D-Line, so unless they trade Wilkerson, I don't get this pick.
If you have no mutation for it but have mutation for any other ability, then use the ability you've got the perk for. Otherwise you'll just be wasting energy.
He already has a slow stand before he actually jumps, I feel like adding some signal in addition to climbing the ropes, standing up and maintaining balance, then finally jumping, would make the process take way too long and feel more unbelievable than top rope moves already are. 
In the Orangerie museum in Paris there is a stall with a bidet/washlet in it in one of the restrooms in the museum.  I wanted to use it because I have one at home and was tired of using paper like some kind of savage.Unfortunately, there was a line of Japanese tourists in front of the stall, and no line in front of the other stalls...I wonder if there is a guidebook for Japanese tourists listing all of the available public bidets? 
I can see how a union may over-protect less than stellar cops and therefore protect the ethos, but racism and brutality are found in many other populations in different time periods. So how can you attribute it just to unions?
Pick up a dinghy I bought super cheap on eBay (is there anything more wonderful than a brother-in-law with a ute?) and hopefully take my boat for its first official sail...weather dependent. Which probably means I'll be at home, sighing at the rain outside.
I would steer you towards reading "No More Mr. Nice Guy" and stoicism.  My favorite book on stoicism is "The Obstacle is The Way."  Side note:  having a strong frame is a mindset.  It's something that doesn't change over night but develops over time.  Learn to be assertive and ask for what you want, and say what you don't want.  Learn to channel your emotions.  There are so many ways to do this and it is a lifelong project IMO.  Good luck.  
I'd be very grateful to you if you can share a screenshot of it with all the traps etc visible.The main reason I wanted to find out the name was because in my screenshot I have no clue about where to place traps.Thanks :)Update: Just found it out from your history. When in doubt, stalk. Hehe.Thanks a ton for your post bro! :)Update 2: I'm wondering if you've placed your Air Sweeper already? If so, where? Thanks.
I'm sure that I don't.  I wasn't trying to say that Pentecostalism is MORE cultish than Mormonism, just that they are all cults.  They all use brainwashing techniques to keep people going to their churches and giving them money, etc... etc... 
If I was Mettenberger I would be patiently waiting for Mariota's athleticism to catch up to him. Rookie athletic quarterbacks love scrambling out of pocket when things get hairy. 
I'm totally fine with paying for the pro version, but what I'm disappointed in is the way that Textra is trying to confuse people by stating there was a free trial period and their sarcastic responses to people mentioning this in their reviews of the app. It's a good app, but the people behind it seem rather dickish.
I know I'm late &amp; you probably already fixed this but download Malware Bytes, (its free) end all of your other processes, disconnect the internet, &amp; wait for malware bytes to finish scanning your PC. Boom! done 
I'm a middle school education teacher and within this past school year, I have had several teachers and *the school principal* refer to one of my students in a derogatory manner regarding her disability.It may not be the most scandalous or unique, but man it makes my blood boil every time.
You need to fix both.If either of them breaks while you are driving, you are going to end up stuck on the road at best, and in a bad accident at worst. Especially if the axle gives out while you're driving on the highway. Heck, even if the u-joint gives out while you're driving on the highway.Please don't be one of those people that drives their unsafe jalopy on the highway with me. Pretty please?
The only problem with having a layperson read Foucault (or most original works of social theory, for that matter) is that they will not understand most of it.  Foucault's writings are dense, and the people flooding Twitter and Facebook spouting ignorant shit aren't going to make the connections between the real world and what he's writing about.
What is that just dried up clumpy blood? Once at the movie theatres I went to the washroom and one of the stalls was fucking gross full of blood all over the floor, toilet and clumps like this everywhere. Looked like someone got shot.
Yes his prior driving record was awful, he should not have had a license.  But MPI did not take it away and therefore deemed him fit to continue driving.  I don't think it's criminal negligence to drive when you are allowed to. If he was drunk or on a suspended license, then he is a danger and should absolutely be thrown in jail. Anyone driving on a suspended license should receive a short jail sentence. If the guy hit my dog I would beat his ass myself, never mind my daughter. But leaving emotion out of it, the man was driving with a valid license and made a terrible, idiotic mistake. Take his license, impound his car, give him a hefty fine and some community service. Even house arrest or probation, But don't spend $100,000+ of tax money per year to jail him.
He had a sort-of embarrassed smile and admitted it, then teased me about knowing more than him, which in turn made the class join in. Damn it! My nickname was Dictionary for a short time.
&gt;To be fair, 25% of Blacks live in poverty vs 12% of whites. So twice as much.And yet the murder rate is SEVEN times as much. Also there are plenty of other groups that have lower socioeconomic status, such as immigrants from Asia, and they don't have anywhere near the crime rates.
I haven't seriously been reading for a long time, probably since i was in high school / college (australia) and i'm now 23 and thinking i should get back into it, but i have no idea where to start.. i have read the odd sports autobiography in that period of time, however i miss reading a good novel.i've always liked 'clever' or intricate plots with a lot of twists, and have always enjoyed elements of either fantasy, mystery, psychological / scheme based scenarios, and some sci fi when used tastefully.where should i start?
awesome great to hear, enjoy your new cab, if you follow that wiring diagram everything will work great.  I actually really like the zero delay boards. 
I find it interesting that people are ok with a customer admitting she was having a bad day and was cranky (we all have those days) but the minute a sales associate is not all warm fuzzies and friendly people jump all over the "oh my gosh, how terrible and rude, call customer service" bandwagon. 
I'm like 80% behind the idea, but rather than propaganda aimed at getting kids *into* military service, it is shown to them in the modern day to showcase the atrocities that their enemies perpetrated upon them during the war and portray them as literal monsters like old timey propaganda comics and cartoons. Propaganda designed to glorify a country usually avoids showing the failures of said country, and the characters in A Slap on Titan are in a near constant state of having their asses handed to them.
There has been an international push towards political correctness in young people (&lt;30). There is a very real phenomenae where some younger people see potential to offend as an actual offense.I am not trying to defend someone that is actively being a jerk, but I do not trust claims made by others and reserve judgement until if/when info is released.To me the question is: were they acting poorly, or just using language deemed problematic by the language police?
Key word being occasionally. Yes, it was something out of this world, but people act like that game (which was obviously going to be a massacre) defines what Brazil NT is.
Pittttt!No Box Preferred, I plan on opening it and wouldn't want to waste something that could eventually go to an NIB collectorNonePit is one of my favorite characters, I pre-orderd him and waited and waited for him to come in the mail... and by the time I realized my BB never went through, he was sold out everywhere.
For those who dont understand the clock and the pick (time between). They hand a card to a guy, that stops the clock. Then that card is handed to someoen else who writes some stuff down, then its given to Goodel. Then Goodell takes him time coming to stage.
No no I get it, I understand that is the norm in most parts of Europe. The exceptions I think are Ireland, Greece and Italy. I think about that stuff too. Were Adam and Eve real, or just an allegory? What about God creating the earth? But for me what usually brings me back is that I see a lot of things in the world that just scream that they have a design to them. They just don't look like they happened by sheer chance.
I've given up on Agora and have moved to BlackBank which is always up. Not as many listings but I know I'm going to get my order and not that dreaded message when I try and access the site
Yeah, 24 hours worth of bullshit! My order was marked "shipped" yesterday, now it's "pending" today. The responses on Reddit and Agora don't match up. Do the math. Read the P.M.'S sent between us I posted. Those were yesterday!
&gt;I'm going to guess the majority of people upvoting the "History" comment are interpreting it differently, but I read it as commentary on the fact that history classes pretty much focus on white men. It seemed like the gender equivalent of "Why isn't there white history month? Because that's all year."Where did they get white? 
You weren't far away in BP.  I did enjoy growing up in USC. Always loved My Lebanon, though (a little north on RT 19).  Strangely Mark Cuban is from there.  
HOLY SHIT, KUZY RIPPING PEOPLE OFF, OVI PLAYING LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD, GREEN WITH THE SPEED AND THOUGHT, HOLTBY ON THAT REAL SHIT, BEAGLE DOING BEAGLE THINGS.  I'M LOVING OUR PLAY.
After knowing Todd personally for the past 3 years, I truly hope to see him in a Falcons jersey. I know we need defense, but this guy is such a stud! Either way, RISE UP! Now that Williams is off the board I am all for VB or TG. Not all that excited about Dupree though!
The worst thing you could do is outright murder him. I wouldn't murder him by toruture, or even killing him. I'd stop him from killing himself, then let the Allies have him. That is the best way of killing him indirectly.
Honestly there is no other ADC I would have in the west at worlds rather than Turtle. Turtle may fuck up in the regular season but when it comes down to the clutch games when plays need to be made Turtle is almost second to none. Just look at last year's worlds arguably Turtle at the lowest point in his career was out teamfighting Uzi. And even in the series vs White he was actually looking really good. Season 3 didn't lose a lane as far as I remember and made some nice plays most notably on Twitch.  All I'm saying is TSM can win a championship with Turtle because Turtle will always show up.
On behalf of the NFC North, I'd like to announce that I now kinda like the Jets.  Fucking thank you for keeping him away from Chicago!On a sad note; RIP Tom Brady.  Your division is primed to fucking kill you this year.
I was also a little offended that men climbed out of the tank. The tank spin scene got laughed at because the barrel would just tear before it supported a 40 ton tank, but I hated it more because after he throws that sucker the movie is sure to show you that the soldiers inside are fine.I liked the jumping. This movie got that far better than any Hulk movie. 
Lol Mike is getting way too handsy but still...the Bucks obviously do not understand physical playoff basketball. Better get used to it if you wanna be in it.
Yeah names are bullshit lol"Hello, my name's ~~~" Me: "Crap."Caravaggio for renaissance. Big fan of Wyeth and abstract expressionists like Rothko and Richter. Modern street art really appeals to me too. Also really enjoy gothic and Islamic architecture.

Thats what I thought, but a recent game I brought said, requires 40gb hard drive, but then only installs up to 16gb.So that leads me to believe its a requirement of total space not install space...?
I'm planning on getting involved in food retail, directing my sales mainly towards restaurants by providing specialty and international goods.  Do you guys have any experience in providing goods to restaurants, tea bars or cafe's?  Also, how do you source your teas internationally?  How do you go about establishing relationships with sources abroad?  How much does it cost to pay off USDA, bureaucracies, etc?  EDIT:  Christ I just finished visiting your site.  That's gorgeous.
I'm left of center, thank you for your assumption that I enjoy Ted Cruz and his loony theocratic ideas. I used the article for it's direct sources to the Clinton Foundation's tax returns. And as for how great those accounting firms are, they are [refiling their tax returns](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/23/us-usa-election-clinton-taxes-exclusive-idUSKBN0NE0CA20150423) for the last **5 years** due to "misreporting" it's list of donors. Great accounting.Where's your sources, bud?
Regarding witness testimony: Some cases man's testimony is worth less than women'sRegarding period: By the fact that man can pray more because they don't have period means more good deeds. Regarding women in hell majority: Muslim scholars have also come to conclusion based of Islamic text that there will be more women in heaven then men. Also, one hadith states that a sign of approach of day of judgement is male to female ratio 1:50 I believe.Regarding women rib hadith and al-Ghazali:This is what I mean about layman interpretation. Al-Ghazali is saying exactly how this verse was interpreted throughout Islamic history: That Muslim husbands should not attempt to try to change the character of their wife's, but rather leave them be. Again, I can link you Jonathan Brown video on this topic.And all of my above points rely on looking at ALL RELEVANT HADITHS before making interpretation. This is why it is important to look at the issue from all angles.
6.5/10Lovely lips, cute eyes. Not a fan of the nose piercing. From what I can see, you have a great body, tighter clothes would show that off better for sure. I like your hair color, but not the cut as much. I really like your face, you certainly have TONS of potential.
I'm not gay, but I support their right not to be ridiculed. Anyways, what I wanna know is who's this Rorschach guy and why does he only paint men having sex

I am mixed about this. I think if you actually cared enough you could just use the webpage and the advantage is gone. I don't really need to use these features anymore. I do see the massive potential though and that is why I do not want to see a community driven project squashed so easily. A good idea cannot be ignored. I think he should be working closer with the development team. *If you want to see what happens when the community creates for the company look at [GameHeart](https://twitter.com/rtschutter) for StarCraft2. Blizzard incorporated it into the game and eventually hired him. Fantastic story and a great addition to the game.* 
*Jake watches the new kid from afar. Strangely he feels at ease, not peaceful, that would be the wrong word more like the feeling he got around Fiyero. He felt comforted, stronger, somehow more whole. After a while curiosity got the better of him and he approached the new kid*
Thank you everyone for the compliments.Although I still don't think I look all that good, I just think I took a few pictures that may have made me look better than I actually do.
The idiocy was all mine though. The poor guy just happened to be watching us that night when I crashed my bike and broke my thumb/wrist on the sidewalk. Unless you're calling me an idiot. Which is fairly accurate.
14nm is now. 10nm is totally doable (according to Intel) in maybe 2 years from now. 7nm can be done without anything super fancy (again according to Intel) in around 4-5 years.And then we can start stacking 3d. At first maybe 5 times the density, and later perhaps 20 storeys and then 100 storeys high.That's a pretty clear path for Moore for 10 years. And we know how much things changed in the last 10 years! We will not run out of Moore any time soon.
Nurse here! You're right, a lot of tissue would probably come off. The yellow skin is sloughing tissue and it's very fragile. It also looks like he has a pretty nasty infection, and sometimes infected skin can have the consistency of jello. He needs some serious wound care and IV antibiotics to save as much tissue as possible, but it's going to take a long time to heal

Your comment didn't say anything about assuming negotiations. In fact it said the opposite. Consent should never be assumed when it comes to con-non-con. Negotiation should never be assumed in BDSM as a whole. 
My freshmen year of high school, one of my teachers got fed up with my horrible high school jokes( yes they were so immature) and yelled at me in front of the entire class "how did you even get accepted into high school, you're an idiot"... Well jokes on her now because I was accepted into college as well.
Confine him to Pasco County, get him a fishing pond or some shit and for god's sake, don't let him out around the stadium after dark, especially on the weekends. 
You're completely dumb or?Group C: SSB was the second best team in the world.LMQ has been number 1 in NA for the whole split before playoff. Got problems in playoff and ended 3rd NA, but should have been n°1 at the time.And OMG was still really good.Anyway, I'm not even the one saying it was group of death. But if you think group D was the hardest, just let me laugh.Group D: Kabum, worst korean who attended because of a lucky spree, 3rd stronger NA, very unstable Alliance ... Yeah, seriously, just shut up.
Be careful with their eyeshadows, they are *super* hit and miss. They're either fantastically smooth and bright or they're so chalky and poorly pigmented and terrible. I'd recommend being really careful when picking their shadows out. On the other hand, their blushes are gorgeous and super easy to work with!
People need to be okay with the fact that we got 6 seasons of a show that should of barely even got 2. It was gonna be canceled for forever and yet we passed 100 episodes. Let's wind down and get the movie in. I'm more than fine with that.

&gt; movement-based ones can require aiming, like Leona, Lee Sin, or Amumu in LoL, but I don't think any in HOTS work like thatnitpick reply, but... as someone who never played LoL, I submit that Sonya has an aimed, movement-based gap-closer in her spear: You have to hit the target, and then it moves you to them if you do.(It also does a lot of other things, but...)
If u can pick at 58% why would you fuck with this stupid system. Just bet games straight up ATS you'll make a killing. You wouldn't win here because of any system, you'd win because you can pick 58%. Do your homework. There's no reason to apply martingale here. It's a losing system in situations where the player has no edge, which is where it's intended to be used. I'm a little more optomistic than others though , I believe it's possible to pick 55%+
Cheers for the feedback!In the passages defense, there wouldn't really be much point in rushing him. Ormal has been ambushed half naked in a brothel, One-Ear has a weapon and is the superior fighter. The monologue is less of a "villain speech" and more a "one final effort to twist the verbal knife before getting killed". Ormal knows his goose is cooked, and so does One-Ear.

Which is going to be best experienced from inside a VR headset. 360 degree videos are going to be a major source of content for VR. The ability to record a VR ready experience and share it is one of the reasons Facebook bought Oculus. Go Pro wouldn't be doing this if VR wasn't about to take off like it is now. So while they are not making VR goggles, this it totally a play at the future of VR and its role social media. 
We joined a FC for the mean time, yeah we would love yo have you two join us and it's great you are a healing class and he is dps, I'm a tank and my wife is dps so we can run all of 3.0 together. 
It's weird when sometimes some things and techniques work, and then the next time they don't, and vice versa. Are there any things you've tried that have helped, or at least made things easier, even for a little bit?
It's sad how unfun this turned out.It doesn't score on how close your drawing was to a circle, but on random other factors. I drew a pretty good one, but I drew it quickly, so I got only 912 points. Then I drew an oval. Almond-shaped. 10,000 more points. Drew 3 dots in a triangle. 30,000 more points. Scribbled everywhere randomly: Over 100,000 points.
One reason is that many necromancers produce far more undead than they can control, relying on magic like hide from undead to avoid there minions. It's dangerous and reckless, like summoning demons it can get away from you. Anything self-replicating, like shadows, ghouls or apocalypse zombie is playing with fire. That being said, I've let a player be neutral and be a necromancer. His character concept was based off the idea of Tibetan sky burial, where the bodies of the dead are hacked up and left for vultures. The belief is that bodies are just vessels and unimportant. His character was from a culture whose environment was harsh and they relied upon the animated bodies of the dead to protect and serve them. He ended up guarded by a trio of bloody skeleton girallons that had a ludicrous number of attacks, but that's a different story.
I'm not playing anything. You're lookin at overall cost effectiveness a longer term Arimidex would be cheaper. Also a more likely chance of getting legit pharma AI. Also with masteron you will shut down and may feel like shit. With Arimidex you will still have test production.Just my two cents, you're going to do what you want. Let us know how it goes.
Really? More baseless accusations? This is hilarious. If the community takes you seriously I'd be very disappointed.Step 1. Cheaters have cheatsStep 2. Face heimbot.exe on stream, monitor capture as always, just like most of the best comp players do and always have forever, and lose, then get banned from MWOggThere could seriously be one perosn behind all of these alt accounts claiming there to be cheating in competitive MWO. What a joke. No proof. Lying about PGI.This is literally trying to publicly smear PGI. Does anyone else see this shit? Hahahahahaha it's blatant as fuck.
&gt;Capitalism is NOT perfect.  Socialism is NOT perfect. That's fine, as long as we keep in mind that socialism is a lot more "not perfect" than capitalism.  I think most folks advocating a best of both worlds approach tend to forget that.

&gt; "Well today, my ipad crashed and when I went to power it back on, it asked me to connect to my macbook to recover. The notification said it would it would reset my device and all data would be deleted."Whatever data was on the iPad is already gone. If iOS corrupts or somehow in an unreadable state,.. then the file-system encryption keys are probably also b0rked. (that's why it's saying the only option is to reload iOS)So yeah.. your photos are pretty much gone. (why you wouldn't be doing Backups of some kind,. when Apple makes it so damn easy to do.. just boggles my mind). 
I would prefer not to name my game when speaking of it in a critical tone. I wouldn't want anyone thinking I hold any ill-will just because I point out the flaws.As for why it is not allowed, I've never been given an explanation that satisfied me well enough for me to be as willing as some are to rule out ever trying it again regardless of changes in the community over decades of play.
I mean, splash damage is so crucial for sollies. DH makes him super weak against scouts. But the LNL provides no new hard counters. 2 pills make sense because it makes him weaker against buffed sollies and whatnot.
I find what's most bizarre about this sport is the absolute lack of strategy. These people seem to be unbelievably clued out. It's like watching particularly challenged toddlers play their first game of soccer.
Actually, I wrote an essay on Internet vigilantism and this was one of the cases where 4Chan found the girl (I think in Bosnia?) and reported her to the authorities. Unfortunately, it doesn't always turn out so well...
Yup and it can easily be reloaded with a single shell by 'rearming' the trap. However, I think this should be treated like a landmine as well in that doesn't discriminate against who it kills.
We allowed the 2nd most sacks in the league last year. Sherff addresses that glaring deficiency and is a mean, mean cuss. I, for one, applaud the pick. 
I went to burning man the past year, my gift to others was the asian facial mask. They were a hit btw. Everyone loves to be pampered on a hot desert day. I gave to everyone in my camp. I saw a bunch of people in my camp laid on lawn chairs with facial mask on. That includes guys and girls. Treat yo self. Ps. I took my husband to his first pedicure. He loved it.

With this mod, you can place them at a lot more places than Traffic Manager, and you have more control. Traffic manager tries to be all things to all people, and is a bit lacking in some areas, even though it's great overall.Try it yourself! It's a small download.
Hell yes I'm in. All in. I will sweat, and if need be, bleed to achieve your vision. This must happen. The people need you. The stakes are too high and there's very little time left to act. We must seize this moment in history if we are to preserve our future. Let's do this.
I tried it out in the test client with 5 properly-outfitted svens (BKB/Heart/Satanic/AC/Treads/Daedalus) and a bristle with Heart, AC, Shivas, Crimson Guard, Octarine Core, and Guardian Greaves, and that video isn't 100% misleading. If all the Svens ult &amp; warcry and hit him from behind, it's all up to daedalus luck as to whether bristle or every sven dies first. That is ignoring the fact that bristle should instead be stunned and surrounded, but octarine core is actually very good on him based on my testing.
When I was about 8-9 I woke up during the night to the sound of shovels hitting concrete, I looked out my window and saw two men just hitting the floor with shovels. I woke up my two brothers (I shared a room) and asked if they could see it and they could, so we got our parents and when they came in to look the two men had gone and when my Dad went out to check for marks in the morning nothing was there. We don't know if there was actually anybody there that night or just our minds fucking with  us. Either way, pretty scary shit.
Well, it does matter that Shirin had no chance of winning that immunity in the context of people saying they only offered two necklaces to save Shirin. 
Playing with friends and my teeth start crumbling and I keep spitting them out with blood. Never any pain though, so that's good. Come to think of it, I don't remember ever feeling pain in a dream. Does it even happen?

Of course... That wasn't my point at all. the fact that their insightful comments are hidden is what gives me grief. I'm not saying that we should take verified peoples predictions as law, but it would be nice to maybe have a conversation with them instead of wading through the bullshit first. 
Don't forget rape laws that define rape as penetrative therefore making men who were forced to penetrate not rape victims.Oh and the Duluth Model for domestic violence that means men are more likely to get arrested than get help if they report their female abusers(U.S.)
They already have Richardson/Wilkerson I wouldn't have taken him as the jetsedit: Richardson or Wilkerson don't remember which one plays the 5-technique 
Never said it was the only solution, but its a start. Another option is to stop acting like women are 'inviting' violence by leaving their own homes. I suspect that the public espousing of views like that ironically actually invites more rapes.
You won't regret explicitly returning `NULL` in your `ELSE` case.Explicitly defining behavior is preferable over database-specific behavior which may change in a future release.
Fellow MIDA user here. And no. Giving it full auto and slowing down firerate is a terrible idea for balancing it. I use it because of its quick fire rate compared to other scouts and it hits much harder than an Auto so I enjoy it
Let's see what happened. Christ died and rose from the dead and then sent his Apostles out into world preaching that God is alive and real and forgiveness is at hand.
That's totally up to you, I often land mine because family members make the best allies, but just so you know, strongest son always inherits, so if you give your best son a duchy and the rest of them counties, it doesn't even matter if he's your last male child in a line of seven, he'll inherit your titles, so you can abuse that. 
Excuse you. My personal taste is the perfect *objective* meter for good comedy and Trixie never made me laugh ONCE. Therefore this whole list is garbage and we should burn the author's house.(srs) I clicked on the title and was redirected to the main sub without realizing.

I watching my friend hang himself. My friend committed suicide a few months ago by hanging himself. I've known him for 14 years. I lost touch with him for the past 4 (long story) and I didn't think it would effect me as much as it has been. I keep dreaming about him and just seeing him hanging there. 
I'm going to add a little to what woz60 said. It's a matter of natural selection. Let's take eating rotting meat, for example. Those of our ancestors that liked the smell of rotting meat (or at least couldn't distinguish it from good meat) most likely ate it and died from some sort of infection. Thus, they were eliminated from the gene pool. Vice versa, those of our ancestors which avoided rotting meat most likely avoided those infections and survived to later reproduce. 
Can you blame our 37 year old quarterback for getting a jump start on working out? God there are some absolute beasts in our division on every d-line. 
Idk if I'm too late to comment but I'm going to anyways. I second what /u/rhythianne said about dangly earrings! But if you're looking for shoes similar to the model loft is having 50% off everything right now and [this](http://www.loft.com/strappy-heels/370174?colorExplode=true&amp;skuId=18199215&amp;catid=catl000022&amp;productPageType=fullPriceProducts&amp;defaultColor=6600) is pretty similar! 
Based on my HG and heartburn, everyone was CONVINCED that I was having a girl. All the old wives tales pointed at a girl too.But I thought it was a boy all along, and even had a dream (which could be interpreted as a gender dream) that was about it being a boy. I was right ;)
He'll be playing in the same stadium now just wrong color. That's what blows. Edit: Wow reading that out of context it sounds bad.. I meant he will be in green and not blue. Felt the need to clarify just in case... 
You should head over to orangepower.com the week before the game -- the fans are a bit of a mixed bag if you decide to post -- but they usually sponsor a tailgate. I never tailgated much when I was in Stillwater, but from what I read, you should be able to walk around in purple and get a hospitable response (and food and drink).
True the mouse is more precise but a lot of people have a hard time realizing just how much more exact you have to be on a PC fps.Console FPS games walk the crosshair onto the enemy for you so they are used to only getting kind of close with the game helping them get exact and not doing it manually.
You are not alone.  This is the beauty of not being a GC, I think I actually turned out better for being ignored, especially after I dealt with the grief.
Just imagine how much energy was used and how much waste was created just to build those low efficiency panels which require constant maintenance to ensure they stay clean and useful.
I don't want to say some dismissive comment, but see, I literally just cannot imagine this being the case with something like a Mathematics PhD, or certain other ones. Not just because "they're so smart" or something (but they generally are)-but because the field is intrinsically so rigorous, unambiguous, and so totally impossible to bullshit, that people get weeded out *quickly* if they can't take the heat. When you are analytically solving a problem (or numerically) and there's literally infinitely many wrong guesses, well, you either know how to do something or you don't.There's absolutely no way you can bullshit yourself into a Mathematics PhD IMO. It just doesn't happen unless it's literal degree milling/fraud, but I'd wager that there are some fields where it's nigh impossible to fake it.
You are playing a division with jj watt, clowney and wilfork with such a ridiculous amount of sacks given up. The defense can only be so good when the offense can't stay on the field. Give bortles some time to throw or the running backs some room to move.
/r/fatpeoplestories will bring burgers, fries, Doritos, and a big box of Little Debbies, and as always a 2 liter of diet coke. Then they will proceed to eat it all because of their cundshuns! 
TWC has their own, but it isn't the same as Ookla's and it tells me I'm getting the 50mbps. although when i download from games I'm getting the 13Mbps speedI thought it might be the firewall too so I turned it completely off and checked again, but still had minimal speed.
First off, I don't see why Viktor can't be played in a tank meta with a Liandries-based shed build; your E can apply the shred twice and your Ult just poops out Liandries stacks in close fights. But, if you want a champ who feels similar but can put out more sustained damage and survive getting dived on? I think you'd like Swain. He feels kinda like Viktor in his playstyle but he's much more sustainable and pumps out great AoE.
Curious about how textile lobbies would lose profits? Do they think hemp will start replacing a bunch of textiles? At that point wouldn't hemp just be considered a different textile, one that might theoretically be cheaper to produce than cotton, etc. 
I think it's also different because there's a power dynamic. Unfortunately, white people do hold a lot of power in our society. What percentage of Fortune 500 companies are run by boards of white men? What percentage of political leaders in your country are white? What about public figures like celebrities? Or authority figures like teachers or law enforcement officers?Yes, our culture often does look down on white people, but it doesn't impact white people the same way that certain groups of white people treat black society.

I disagree about Mariota, but I'm not confident about Mettenberger's ability to be the guy. If you don't have the answer, you have to keep trying. QB is the only position that matters. We shall see, but I'm excited about the future. 
Sounds about right. Although, I'd argue that people were still ordering small bands even after they were warned and very well knew better. There was a time ~3 years ago where I think a LOT of the english speaking bra fitting community was, in general, wearing VERY tight bands, lots of distorted wires, lots of way too tight bands and way too big in the cup.

Oh so because they have the same qualities he's going to make the HOF.  Got ya...which is basically the same line of bullshit hyperbolic reasoning you threw at me. Do you want to go back and look at all the 1st round WRs projected to be stars that didn't do shit? You asked a question and I answered it. Stop pretending like you know what will happen in these kids' careers.  
You're pretty much agreeing with me here. I think you might have misunderstood because you took my use of 'try' way too literally. I just use it as a filler word, basically. My point being that we can't expect people to not think bad things, just to be decent enough not act on them.

You'll find that most Asian food shops and restaurants don't pay award wages to their employees. They usually hire international students and give them about $8-10 an hour from experience. Same with most Indian restaurants. Sadly this is also true with most 7/11s where they hire Asian (mostly from India) students and underpay them along with servos, car wash places and grocery shops. Don't know if that is the case with the shops you refer to. They seem pretty good for me. I kind of feel bad wondering how low their margins might be though.

Natural Doctirne has been called the worst game on ps4 by a fair few people. I just bought akibas trip it's fun if you like beat'em ups some times though it feels a bit wonky
Agreed re: swinginess. Most other games use a die pool because you get a nice bell curve making extreme results (high or low) a lot less likely. In D20 it's completely flat, making any result as likely as any other. I've been contemplating trying 2D10 (added, not as a percentile) instead of 1D20. That doesn't make a bell (it's more of a low flat-top pyramid) but at least it mollifies extremely low or high results. Auto fail would have to be on a 2. The main problem with this is it makes crits extremely unlikely (1% rather than 5%), so you would have to say that a crit happened on an 18+ 
"That's kind of why I didn't bring them up around you," *Mint says sheepishly, looking into her menu.* "When you were talking about what happened to your parents, I just couldn't bring myself to complain about my own..."
The set I use is:**Kecleon @ Assault Vest**Adamant / Protean / 252 HP / 252 Attack / 4 Def- Fake Out- Shadow Sneak- Ice Punch- Drain PunchOther options I've seen used and/or had a go with are Sitrus Berry or Life Orb for the item, and Trick Room, Rock Slide, Feint and Sucker Punch as alternative move options.No investment with Assault Vest gives Kecleon a nice 210 Sp.Def at Level 50 which I think is awesome. It just needs that little bit of physical bulk to be perfect, but I really do like it with Assault Vest. This entire set has just worked better than any alternatives for me, so it's stuck well.
Thank you , right now AL is all I have to talk to about this. Been feeling ill all day, cold clammy palms, no appetite, only ate a bowl of cereal today. :(
I have a few with some applications. I still don't get how it takes out the color from the app but my guess is that actually famous apps have the color hardcoded inside the themes and those that are actually not that famous takes the color from the icon. So for example, if I change the color of my Tweetings theme the keyboard is still blue (same color as the icon) even though the interface is not. The same happens in Fenix and many others. But overall it's still my favourite theme since it looks nice in almost any app I use. 
By the way, I am now able to use CloudyNights. I emailed a moderator and he manually validated my account.  He said that the reason that happened was because they have a very strong spam account filter that some times marks genuine accounts as spam accounts.
You should do a bit more research before giving out advice on removing something.Crawl-delay is actually extremely helpful, it tells bots to wait at least 1 second between page loads. Although Google is pretty good at not killing your site with traffic, there are a lot of robots that aren't and do in fact follow this. Google does follow this setting.
[M] Native means of indigenous origin or growth. We don't know if Sugar Cane was transplanted to the Solomons and just took off there or it was native which was why I used that word choice. {I mixied up Yams and sweet potatoes, I meant yams which are native to southeast asia and surrounding regions, sorry about that.} 
Yeah I was told because money was already taken the rep could submit the price match but he wasn't sure how it would work out because usually it happens once it ships or after. Going to be interesting I'll see if I get an update tomorrow!
Not gonna happen, CERO C is like Teen, it's extremely unlikely we'd get an M rating in the first place, but I think IS would censor anything applicable before they got it rated anyway.Censoring happens man, blame all the people who get all up in arms over this shit
Despite the blunderism, just know that you always had great taste in Guitars. I own an Ibanez RG Prestige and a 12 string (as well as a 6 string accoustic). So these pics were a little close to home. Rock on brother.
Who would not do this? Are there people that just help it across the road then make it face the road again? Or do they just put it where it started facing the other way?
Vlads, necro3, his entire kit, and taking rosh still does not exceed TBs capacity for pushing towers. And TB doesn't even need many items before he can take towers.  2 wraith bands and a yasha is all he needs to start his tower taking. And the entire point on my post focused on TBs tower taking potential. 
&gt; They never knew if the respawn timer was too long or not. Now that the system getting some actual testing, they can find out if it's good enough or not. in a 15 minute game i spent about 5 minutes waiting for respawn. it isn't fun. if you can't get healed you will get killed and have to wait for respawn, nothing you can do about it.
I bought my 07 Z1000 with 4500 miles on it last year, it was basically brand new, garage kept and well maintained. I already doubled the milage on it and it runs like a beauty still. Your friend is not a smart man. 
I recently read a fantastic book called *Schuyler's Monster* written by the father of a girl with polymicrogyria, a rare condition meaning that you can't speak, have poor co-ordination, and may be retarded.She was tested on co-ordination and her parents were told she was in the bottom 1% of the entire juvenile population for co-ordination.Turns out she was tired of endless tests and refused to do most of what she was told. Refusal meant a zero mark. Thanks, tester.
Hey now cousin, I'm all for spelt. Sometimes I even throw a "u" into color for a little extra flavor - but *why* in the hell did you kooky bastards spell "through" that way? Surely "thru" or even ''throu" makes more sense. Is it because of the Welsh?
DAMMIT! So, are we boycotting Starbucks? Because I, like, need my weekly Frappacino to function. And yes, I am a white, 20-something girl. We feed off of the tears of the poor and neglected.
Salad dressing. Blend with juice of a lime or lemon, a garlic clove or two, cilantro, salt, pepper, cayenne, and olive oil. Add water until you get to your desired consistency.I like to eat it with a salad of mix lettuces, baby kale, baby spinach, cumin seasoned black beans, diced grilled chicken, bell pepper, jalapeños, cucumber, tomato, green onions, and shredded cheese.
This made me feel both he and I were unattractive.  Date was going really well.  We were both having fun, probably a little too much to drink.  We're at this bar with a band and get up and dance although no one else is yet and we're dancing terribly but it seems hilarious (yeaah alcohol).  Then go out for a smoke and he's complementing me, "You are so much fun and you're beautiful, you have the cutest little hands, and perfect smile and an ALMOST perfect nose." I was laughing cause I thought it was the strangest complement and asked "Almost perfect nose?"  And he's like "Ya, you know its almost perfect".  I never had nose image problems until that date. I've heard jokes about guys making girls feel slightly insecure so that they feel they need them.  But nope that's not really my thing, I don't look for and definitely don't point out other ppls physical flaws, so keep it to yourself.  
&gt;I'll maybe collate them into a book called "A drunks guide to not getting drunk . . . written by real drunks".Hey, that's a fine idea and all, but finish your other book first. I need to know what happens to Sgt. Major.  You get us interested, bring us to the edge of our seats, then make us wait a year for the next update.  You're a regular Vince Gilligan.  
&gt; Oh that's okay. I knew you didn't have a shred of integrity the moment you completely ignored the arguments on American Medical Associations criteria for recommending circumcision simply because you knew you couldn't refute them.&gt; Thought to myself, "Yup, this one is going to be dishonest to the core. This person wants to win arguments more than he or she wants to actually be right."&gt; Now you're posting dumb circular links and I'm thinking thanks for proving my initial low opinion of you correct. Cheers.I shouldn't feel bad for you, but I do.
Generally regarded, no your absolutely right, but a consensus or at least a quorum seems necessary for community retribution to be appropriate, and to hold someone accountable implies pursuit of retribution.
Hey 650 I was thinking we could set up a skype call with a few of the people that participated in the hex editing to see if there is more stuff that can be done because after TheSkyrae found loads of uses for the editing maybe there's still some more to be found. But I also do remember him saying he messed with every single row of text but I haven't actually talked to him about it.
Baltimore riot, though.It's high time black people weren't allowed in public without a minder, at least in groups.Doesn't sound so good when you flip it.
My chair retails for $4k. It's titanium and came with useful but stock wheels. My aluminum chair retailed for $3k and came with shit wheels and was missing some add ons I needed to purchase on my own. And I didn't have anything fancy. People who need one arm drives (because they only have one arm), or other special features have to spend more. The durable medical equipment market has us crips over a barrel-- if we don't pay, we don't get out of bed and live our lives. They can charge whatever they want and they know it. 
Usually takes some time for those guys to do whatever they need to do to bring the mounts to your server. Buying stuff like that is sketchy, but you'll get your mounts. Any time I've ever bought a mount from one of those guys I've had to wait about an hour.
Agreed - just telling people to work harder is silly.  Bit examining why a group isn't putting in the necessary effort (if that is indeed the case) and trying to address those needs is valuable.I've seen some individuals transform when somebody just expected a lot from them and gave them mild encouragement.  Telling someone their life sucks because they're oppressed starts to limit their range of options.
I'm going through this to the n'th degree in my  biology class. I love being outside, learning about animals, evolution 'n shit. When we took a field trip to a local bird refuge and I could name animals by their chirping everyone looked at me like I had I grew a second head. My classmate asked "How do you know all this?!" I didn't really know how to answer so I just said "I go outside a lot?" I just kind of picked up after a while which birds made what sound and looked them up based on pictures I take. 
Find yourself and dedicate your life towards your likes remember that you are you and no one else will be you so do what you like no matter how mad the person next to you gets remember that happiness is a choice so don't let other people choose whether you are happy or not 
Doesn't make them less monstrous to me! I'd rather cross Walter than any of those other guys. He'd just kill me (or maybe kill someone else). But he wouldn't physically torture me for months.
Sleeping. We both have crazy schedules and both have a hard time sleeping. We both had night where we just stayed awake for no reason this week. When the weekend comes and were able to sleep together, it's so nice. 
I like Scherff more than a lot of people on this sub, but was he BPA?  I'd be very interested to know if he was actually ahead of Williams on Scott's board.
Dear Jets, Thank you for cockblocking the Bears from top DTs two years in a row. Like the Rams you're on the good side of the rest of the NFCN now.Thanks,NFCN fans

Heh, I mean it's not an incorrect statement - often pro athletes, especially in american football, are rushed back from concussions.  But it's starting to trend towards the opposite, and there are some major concerns brought up by ex-players.  A lot of research is also going on here to look into repetitive heading leading to neurological issues later on.  I'm not fully convinced that it's a large issue, but people here are very concerned about it!
I've had dreams about pens. Honestly I thought it was pretty embarrassing but funny. I've only ever told my girlfriend about them and we have a good laugh. 
It's really only the more 'extreme' branches of Christianity (most of the U.S./Bible Belt forms of the religion I suppose) that hold the bible in such a place of reverence.If this is something that frustrates you about other members of your faith, then remember that the Bible is only a book. It's there as a reference, and to provide a moral framework through the stories and parables that it contains. If you follow a religion, you should follow the teachings and overarching message of said religion, your holy book is just there as a reference.Not religious myself, but went to a Catholic school, and Bible Belt Christianity is barely recognisable as a branch of the same religion now.
I'd go hogs.35 Hogs, 17 Arch, 2 Wiz.CC with 2 Witches and 1 BarbLure with 3-4 hogs pull them to the south with a few archers drop a few archers as distraction, then cc right after. drop an archer every second to keep witches alive. then all your hogs with two fingers.Heals in a Mickey Mouse by the wizard towers.

Mods should be free, no contest, but how cool would it be if people started creating expansions on par with the official ones? The talent is out there, for sure, people are already creating mods of comparable scope. Only thing lacking is the economical feasibility of doing it fulltime, which was amazingly possible for a couple days before Valve succumbed to the masses of rabid douchery. Saying people should donate more doesn't make it happen, it's more doubtful they would donate than more after this, than all the supposed evils of paid modding ever happening.
&gt; I know it would be devastating to him to find out the irreparable damage he has done to me. Devastating to him?? devastating to H I M??? Im trying to type this as calmly as possible but what the fuck.Im trying to put myself in your shoes. He's your husband, you've been with him for a long time, I get that. But why on Gods green earth would you ever let someone who's that important in your life disrespect you like that? What "loving" husband would say something like that to his wife? and again WHY are you worried about hurting HIS feelings when HES BEEN HURTING YOUR FEELINGS FOR ALL OF YOUR MARRIAGE?! Seriously, imagine you as a little girl. Do you think your past self would ever want something like this for HER future?! Don't let her down!! Communicate what to him what a insensitive jackass he's being and figure out why he keeps insisting you're not pretty.
They don't care if they have folks on their side. These billboards cater to the exact type of person they want to recruit: pseudo-hardasses who feel superior because they carry around cool army toys at work. If Michigan State Police (or any PD really cared about fostering community, they wouldn't start with a billboard; they would start with changing their policing methods, hiring process, and review board, among other things.
I'd really consider KL to be more moderate difficulty.  King Jin is definitely on the easy side and I'd say reptile is on the difficult end of the spectrum.

The problem isn't you :( Stop thinking you are the one who needs therapy. She needs therapy. If anything, you need therapy to build your self-esteem back up after the number she did on you. Her levels of jealousy are not normal and she is actually abusing you.
Almost reminds me of worlds SKT vs Najin Black Sword. People hadn't seen Najin Black Sword play in over a month and they turned out being the best competition for SKT
I went to school in San Diego where a lot of European men studied abroad. A lot of the frat boys would wonder why "All the European guys were gay," because they cleaned up well and used bags instead of backpacks. It's funny because I think a lot of them thought they had nothing to worry about because the European guys were "gay" when in reality their accents would make girls cream their pants. 
Depends on what you consider "cheap".  You can get Lumia Icons in decent condition on Swappa and eBay for about $200.You could also look at a Lumia 928 or 822.  That's about it.Verizon requires phones made exclusively for Verizon. That's the breaks when you you shitty CDMA (that and you can't use the phone and data at the same time).
You the one sippin' on Lemon-Slime, breh. J'eard mah? No, but in all serioisty, this picture's been posted here a thrillion times the past two days, just a heads up.
Are you referring specifically to horror screenplays, or horror films in general?I've read a lot of horror scripts that don't completely convey the tone of the final film, because more than any other genre, horror is very visceral. It relies heavily on lighting, direction and music.I also think that horror films more than any other genre are successful even (in fact some may say "especially") if they are bad. They can be made cheaply, and without major talent, because people will watch them for the hook. And if they're cheesy or bad, then people will watch them just for a laugh.
I loved this whole series, but Adamat seemed a bit off..Initially, I loved the 'old guy' character, but as the series developed into later books, his experience + wisdom seemed to become abused, to the point where he became stealth overpowered. It honestly felt like he could do everything, uncover every single secret and solve every issue by the end of the third book. It seemed like he would notice every single inflexion in a man's voice, twitch in an eyebrow or a slight change in draft in the wind, and avoid an assassination attempt, or discern a lie. Nothing seemed to be left ambiguous, as after many meetings with people, he would be able to conclude that they were being honest.By the last book, he was crushing every mystery and outwitting every foe
[I don't remember him saying that](http://imgur.com/EWgMYKl)He survived because his body was more durable then Gai's final kick. Plot didn't save him. 
My test and quiz grades were never below a B.  Due to attendance policy I wasnt allowed to get credit in any courses other than the 1 class I had an interest in (power &amp; small engines, the closest thing to auto shop offered). Wound up having to get my GED. (98% on the test though)
So do you have a fleet of buses just sitting idle waiting for the handful of peak times that only happen 4 days a week? That doesn't make any sense and is extremely expensive.
I can see why you'd thinking this. 4k is actually 4 times 1080p. not exactly sure of the math but this should sum it up.1920 x 1080 = 2 million pixels 2560 x 1440 = 3.7 million pixels3840×2160(4k) = 8 million +So by that 2 million at 400% would be 8 million. 
Lol @ all the overreactions. Yes, Williams was practically lobbying for Oakland to draft him but the FO has seen much more tape than I'll ever watch and went with a potential #1 WR in Cooper, which we desperately have needed for years. I'll save judgement until the rookies see the field. Welcome to Oakland, Coop.
For a entire year, every night in the shower i would wash my face twice with Lush's fresh farmacy, then once with coal face, then scrub with herbalism, then scrub with dark angels. I'd then dry my face, get a makeup pad and squirt it with proactiv toner and then stick the pads to my face and leave them on for 20 minutes. Owww it hurts just thinking about it
Well it was 15 first off, and she'll probably get out sooner. Would you rather be brutally killed or serve probably less than 15 years in prison, and get out when you're in your mid 30's, free to live your life?&gt;Hester said Roberts admitted to Cogdell she had violated the terms of her bond by drinking alcohol and taking drugs — heroin and cocaine.He said Roberts tested positive for drugs while she was going through a rehabilitation program as part of her pretrial release and Roberts indicated she would lie on the stand about her drug use during cross-examination.And from another comment I read, it's alleged that she tried to run from this problem before she was sentenced.Please keep defending her, she sounds lovely.
So far, I've lived here for the longest time that I've lived anywhere, and I still don't really feel at home.  My dad's from here (so I have cousins and family and stuff here), I speak the language, I'm "well integrated" etc., but there's still such a cultural disconnect that I just want to leave.  Unfortunately, due to health issues, I'm pretty much stuck, which just makes me feel worse, almost.  Not that moving would be the answer to all my problems, but being forced to deal with a whole society that I don't feel 100% embraced by, or 100% affectionate towards is quite grating.Anybody else?[TCK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid), for the uninitiated.

I've seen the office band together to upvote and downvote posts on Reddit.  They don't do it in office, they go home and do it.  Links will even be shared in group Skype chats with people from marketing asking for upvotes.  The downvotes have less of a paper trail, some employees openly talking about it in an attempt to rally others to do the same.
&gt; lot of intelligent people would have do a lot of really stupid things in sequence for this to develop into something serious.Well, that's OK then.

This thread has turned into "What do you dream about doing at your boring mundane job"  To get fired at mine I'd have to sexually assault a coworker, or completely disregard my or someone elses safety resulting in an accident or a near miss in the shop or be a total fuck up to a client.
Hey guys! For starters I'm nowhere near a pro photographer, but I do have a big interest in photography.  I shoot just for fun, and for myself. But I would like to buy a photo editing software to further enhance the beauty of my pictures. Photoshop may be a bit too much and out of my price range since I don't practice photography as a career. My question is, do you guys have any recommendations for a editing software that has a lot to offer, and maybe competes with photoshop, for a much lesser price tag?
Well, if you really want the more serious answer, Christianity is about eliminating our beastly nature.  We evolved from beasts who are ruled by desires of power, sex, food, etc...   These things can cause harm to the species if they run uncontrolled.  Hence why a phillosophy that promotes the elimination of our "beast" was adopted.  The beast in the bible is not a mythical creature, it's our animal nature.

&gt; Fuck you... you shit in a baglol k. Can't say I'm anything less than mildly amused at the level of rustled jimmies from you over what was little more than a debate about a hypothetical rule. The idea that a bunch of lurkers will always give the top mod implied consent for any rule he can think of is a silly point not even worth discussing.
Not taking sides here, but there is a big difference between nutritional information being mandatory and people flipping shit because their food labels don't include something like oleic acid.
It's very common to use it do assembly hacking during the build stage. Instead of compiling to an object file directly, we often intermediate stages between assembling and linking. Further, it's good in general, if you need to do any sort of analysis of the symbols in the generated binary.EDIT: Learn Python. I would say the primary use case in text file processing.
Of course an additional recklessness is preferable. However in a context in which you would not gain anything from AM, Seige Breaker is better than ravager on a purely single target fight.
Thank you so much. You always give such thorough and thoughtful replies. I am still trying to process the 10 days of constant disrespect and abuse, honestly, and I don't know what my next step will be. I do know that I am so sickened by the entire situation that I have no intention of seeing him or acknowledging his existence any time soon. He has combat PTSD so I am really trying to be understanding and a good woman, but this sort of treatment is going to break me. He has no rights over me, my belongings or my son, though, thank god. 
There was an old guy in a brand new ES350 driving on the freeway doing 60 in a 65 in the left lane and drifting to the left. As i passed him and looked over, he looked like he died 3 miles ago. At some point, people need to be told they can't drive. Operating a 2 ton machine is not something to be taken lightly. 
If I had to guess I'd say he just panicked and lost control. May have considered moving over and then realized the white truck and over corrected. Looks like he's mostly okay. Best wishes from a fellow rider who is very familiar with that particular intersection. 
That's good to know, thanks for the info!That's kind of lame, though. I could see that happening on normal, but on higher difficulties, I would think he should be able to kill you if he grabs you. Especially since not only is the drain attack not that damaging, but you have a few seconds to run away and heal afterwards anyway.
Ugh I'm so upset I can't make it. Unfortunately I will be spending tomorrow running around Chadstone looking for a dress to wear to an event on Sat night :( Have fun ladies, please buy on my behalf and i'll definitely make it to the next one!
Don't forget we're paying Ludwick 4.5M and Hanahhan another 1M just to go away. The Phillies are paying half of Byrd's contract but still, without that horrible Ludwick deal we could have maybe found someone better.Jocketty's failed to improve the team in the last 3 offseasons. It's ridiculous he has a job. A corpse would have done at least as good a job.
I honestly love this video. The models the author used are a little awkward, but they're consistent, so it looks OK. Does it also seem like the arena looks like a hollowed-out nuclear power plant to anyone else? It's pretty cool. 
Isn't organdy a sheer fabric? I wouldn't use gift-wrap ribbon, not even the fancy satin stuff for something like that. The dress in the first picture was made using a rayon-acrylic blend ([this yarn](http://www.ravelry.com/yarns/library/naturallycaroncom-spa)). The second picture is too low-res to really be able to tell what it's made of, although some of the other 'organdy ribbon' dresses really do look like they're made with rolls of ribbon for the yarn.
You can reach lvl 26 with TDB rare armor I believe. Either way, I personally wouldn't do a raid if I knew I wasn't prepared for it. That means I wouldn't raid until I get some nice legendary weapons and exotics lol.
^Totally agreed along with OP's post. My mom, till this day, would rant rant rant about how I am not good enough. That since I am born in Canada, that society has messed me up by being too liberal and therefore has made me lazy. Luckily for them, my rebel streak was non-existent. But unfortunately since I never had a rebel phase growing up, I still get shit for everything I do. 
My beard is so course and wild it does what ever it wants about 90% of the time.  Even with wax my moustache is often all over the place. Waxing does help quite a bit.  You can buy it or make some.  It is easy to make. 
I've published several technical articles. I know from experience that the editors are just going to remove it, but fuck it; I still leave it in my drafts out of principle. Edit: I also run into issues with ending a sentence with the period inside or outside of quotation marks. I pretty much exclusively keep the period outside of the quotation marks because I'm usually using them to denote a specific technical term or phrase where syntax can make a big difference.
I would like sandbags that you can place to force the Z's into what ever trap I have setup. As for new traps rigged shotgun's, Drop Pits, Fire traps - Hay bales that can be set on fire.
In this case, count me as the minority. I can see *how* athletes can make absurd amounts of money, which I assume mostly comes from advertising, but I can't grasp *why*. I have nothing against professional sports, but it's just something I have trouble wrapping my brain around on many levels. 
I would not make such a bold statement, my ForeFlight crashes are actually being blamed on my hardware by the ForeFlight team. Also app makers have no control over a lot of OS design decisions/flaws/bugs.
He owns Nihilum, for one. He was also in the first Blizzcon. He's been around the whole time, he's just not a dedicated HS player. Pretty sure he was Legend this season.
It was great in the poro King mode because of the magnet affect the king had and the spamming nature made since because you needed to summon the king. In basic ARAM though it is way too short of a cool down and the fact you can barely see it makes it really difficult to play against. A longer cool down would make the spell much better and viable on less champs which would be better for balance overall.But then again, it's only been a day so...
Nope, I never take it out unless it's my ring-free week. According to the directions you can take it out for up to 3 hours for sex but I've never seen the need to. It hasn't interfered with anything, ever. It's great.
Thanks for the advice! I've actually got it all planned out. So every year you get like two months where you get 3 pay checks instead of 2, so that extra one will go to the principle balance.Then, when I move to Germany for a couple years for my job, I'll rent the house out to someone at my work. They wouldn't dare mess with someone at work just because our employer is very strict about employees having legal or financial issues. I've thought about this long and hard lol. 
the crash is affecting all currencies, bitcoin $1,200 to $200, litecoin $30 to $1. Nxt, Dark, Pay, Redd, ALL have fallen sharply from its peak.Dogecoin is in a privileged position as 3rd most important currency. And they are more than 500 !!!!And this is due to the effort of time and money for a year. Dogecoin is solid as a rock.
I can't get over "Women have always been the primary victims of war." Either it's something she actually believes, in which case "unelectable" is the least of things I have to say about her, or she was only telling a specific group of completely BATSHIT INSANE people what she thought they wanted to hear. The latter is slimy lying politicking, that when combined with her immense corporate funding paints a very bleak picture of a corporate interests puppet who will say anything to get elected but once you're in, you're in. The other implies that she believes men are (and always have been) the secondary victims of war. Which is fine, if you're a *Portlandia* sketch. Less fine if you're a senator who voted for the Iraq War.I mean, she voted for the Iraq War and publicly shat on all veterans living AND dead, either way. She will never get my vote, and if Sanders isn't on the ballot I'm staying the fuck home.
Ugh guys I went to VS today for the first time ever because I had a gift card and need a strapless bra last minute. It's terrifying in there, and I ended up in a "meh it works I guess" 34DDD which is hilarious. I tried two in that size and one fit okay on the tightest hook, while the other could have slid over my hips--holy inconsistency. Trying to explain to the woman that yeah, I usually wear 30F/FF and no, I don't want to be measured was difficult. She was very sweet and empathized because she is a 30 band too, but she kept saying "So because you *say* you're an F..." all skeptically. Never again. And they cost so much!
Yikes. I'm not too fond of sleepovers too. Going out and having fun is awesome but I need to sleep in my own bed. Super freaked out this will happen to me next fall.If your school offers it, look into getting a single dorm. Might be more expensive, but probably worth it in your case.
Wise words. Puppies are amazing though, I mean, I would do it all over again. But, I think my next dog will be an adopted adult from a shelter, in many, many years hopefully. My puppy is 1 1/2 years old, so he's over trying to eat grass snakes (that's what caused him to be sick in the first place). Fun fact: some grass snakes carry the salmonella bacteria. 
You are right it was a choice. They are choosing to not have their service used to raise money to pay off fines for illegal activities. It is wrong to discriminate because of who some IS, like race sex etc...not wrong to discriminate based on what they DO. They are saying they do not want to serve raising money to pay for fines for criminal actions. NOT the same as saying they do not want to serve gay people.&gt; however a business owner should have the right, and if enough people really don't want businesses doing that thing, the business should fail that way.The problem is sometimes they would not. In the South 60 years ago a business would thrive not serving blacks. Should it be acceptable for no one to serve a group of people at all because of bigotry or hatred?
As a new grad, how can I avoid joining a team like this? I recently interviewed with a pretty small shop, and think I would really like working there but it involves a cross country relocation and I would hate to be stuck in this sort of position so far from 'home'.
If nothing else, Onion titles tend to be short and pithy. The day they publish a title including something as awkward as "rabid and self-entitled Tumblr armchair-feminists"...
Thanks for the kind words. When I'm ready to date again, that's what I'm going to look for in a partner. I think right now I'm going to be single and fully get over this. I don't want any damage from this relationship to affect any future relationship of mines.
thanks!  we do already have all the footage, so we're set on the different layers -- and yes, was thinking it would require a good amount of masking.  just not sure on the best way to bring about the execution of that.thanks for taking the time to answer!
In my game, it emerged from a revolution and Austria was off fighting Poland or the Ottomans or something. But it wasn't formed by the AI, just revolutionary neglect

I disagree. The rangers have 5x multipliers between 525-725 to let them catch up because of that, hence why it's optimal to re-gild later Heroes once you can get your previous one to 1500 (or 1525 really) while still insta-killing.I tried (and proved this) when I was somewhere in mid-game and wasn't even a frequent visitor of this subreddit yet, when experimenting on when I should re-gild from Atlas to Terra. Atlas was at 1625 and Terra was at 1100, meaning Atlas would have a higher DPS because of the extra 4x multiplier, but losing 80 Souls for each re-gild to Terra would still increase my DPS.I would definitely advice to re-gild to whichever Hero you can comfortably take to 1000 during the run and use that for the push.
little passive aggressive comment.  I like it.  They have horrible chemistry together.  I can't wait until they have a fight.  I know they are trying there hardest to get along, but it's bound to happen eventually.
This is a cogent point and I guess I should probably crawl out of my middle-class, middle-america shell a little bit and get back to my ghetto roots more so I don't ask stupid questions like this in the future.
Specifically for Batman though, one of the earliest big comics to shift tone in this manner was Frank Miller's *Dark Knight Returns* (which is great).  His loner, brooding character traits were reinforced significantly after *A Death in Family* in which the second robin died.
reminds me of the ridiculous movie [Priest](http://imgur.com/HQp86Iw). sadly I cant really find a picture of the scene where he drives out of the walled in city :(oh, and it's not really good, so don't bother if you aren't into that kinda thing.
I stopped having sex altogether for a while because using condoms was almost worse than no sex at all. I would much rather have sex with someone I love where we don't have to worry about STDs, trying to find a condom, and just generally better sex. I guess the best way to compare it is when you have really bad vision and you get glasses for the first time.However, I can't emphasize enough how important protecting yourself and your sexual health is. I've never had an STD or STI but the horror stories, stigma, hearing about the pain, itching, and whatever goes along with them is enough for me. And especially make sure the girl is on birth control, kids aren't worth unprotected sex and it's way cheaper than a child or abortion.
Here's what I've done to break myself out of my depression:  I think of things I used to do that I enjoy, and force myself to do them.  Don't ask how I forced myself, I just wanted to get better and leaped towards the only branch I saw.I did anything and everything I could that would give me a natural sense of feel good.  I played video games for the first time in a while.  I drew.  I organized something.  I cleaned a thing. I cooked a food in the oven, AND on the stove.  I did these things like my life depended on it, because I knew it did.  I didn't want to continue the cycle, and I knew I could break it.  I just didn't know how, so I tried all the healthy things that made me feel good.I'm not sure what you can do with that advice, but I hope it helps.  I hope you have a realization along the lines of "I haven't done X in a long, long while" where X is the set of things that you used to enjoy.  But I hope more that you get better, because you deserve it.

They could have just said "basketball activities" if that was the case. I'm assuming the writer didn't want to pigeonhole it to just mean fitness related things. Players can relax during the offseason too. I've just never seen it worded that way. 
Since American folk art is primitive, it lends itself well to applique (you could sew or fuse) and painting.  You could do garden flags, tea towels, zippered pouches, pillows, shirts, scarves, shawls, totebags, aprons, sets of sachet bags, mug rugs, potholders.  I particularly like folk art animals (roosters, cats, cows).  Lots of patriotic imagery in American folk art, too (tea dyed flags, stars, checks, stripes).
Generally.. but there's a few occasions where she does it right after the circles/hailstorm, and you're getting back to her just as she's firing, particularly if on the outer sides.  It's still very possible to dodge it, obviously, but just a little slow reaction time can be an issue.This is especially an issue when they're turned just a few degrees short... it looks like you're right behind her, at a moments glance, but you're just the tiniest bit too much to the side.Rare situations, of course, and even in the worst case scenario, it's very much dodgable, but I think you're overstating it a little.
Wow. I played hundreds of hours of fallout and new Vegas. I spent God knows how much time drinking out of water fountains, sinks, toilets, streams, etc. And I never once knew you could hold the button. I'm an idiot. 
Again, this falls into the ideals of human tainted perceptions.You are using a human idea, the idea of the technological singularity, and implanting that idea into a possible alien culture. For all we know, even if they do have technology similar to ours, they wouldn't have a nervous system for that technology to interface with. These ideas are all based on the aliens being like us. That is my issue. We can't know they are like us so any prediction we make is tainted by our own experiences as a species.
Not an expert, but here's my hypothesis. Basically sound is recorded as sound waves, basically look like lines that go up and down (imagine the line from a heart beat, but with higher and smaller dips and squished together based on the sound), so after it records a segment of that song let's call it a finger print, it starts looking for an identical finger print. once a match is found, it'll display it as the result. Since no two songs can be exactly %100 the same, Shazam works most of the time. sorry if my explanation isn't as simple as you hoped it would be. 
So, just to tell this story, because it's funny. My MIL bought my son a Spurs shirt that said "I want some nasty" on it.  He was never, never, NEVER allowed to wear it to school. This year he put it on after his shower and I told him that he needed to change his shirt tomorrow before school. (He sometimes forgets and it's not my hill to die on, because everything with this kid is a battle.) He said, "Okay." I kissed him good night and that was it. For the record, he has no idea what it means in the real world, just that the coach wanted the players to play harder. I'm sure you see where this is going. He put his sweatshirt on in his room, and in my sleep fog I totally forgot about it. I have terrible cell reception in my house and when the school called the call never came through, but they didn't leave a message. So I had no idea until he came walking up to the house, and he was wearing his sweatshirt around his waist.  The kicker? It was picture day. Awesome.
I recommend reading the original. You will see a lot of familiar things mixed with totally weird stuff. My favorite was a drum covered in mystic symbols. Every beat of the drum produced a genie. A short but lively tune could produce an army of 50,000 genies, ready to cause havoc.
I agree! I always hit Saturday night around 8pm or 9pm.  No one blocking the aisles, no kids, just a few other souls who spend their WILD and CRAZY Saturday nights grocery shopping!  It eases the anxiety immensely for me!
They're not going to have williames, Wilkerson, and Richardson on the field at the same time. Lol there rotation is going to be ridiculous, but I aint even mad
I am beginning to think part of that is by design. They are getting a lot of headlines for AoU. Just when he was talking about IM4 to get additional press he would not have gotten otherwise for just The Judge. 
My dad did this to the hairdryer (only allowed one) because we'd take it out of the bathroom so the next person could get in to shower before school and we could still dry our hair. Apparently drying our hair in our bedrooms was The Worst thing Ever???Edit: spelling
Yes, but why?  That's the question you need to be asking.  They don't oppose Free Trade agreements for the sake of opposing Free Trade.  They oppose them because they don't serve a legitimate economic purpose in the U.S.  Free Trade history in the U.S. substantiates such opposition based on the litany of trade deficits and widespread economic damage that has resulted from Free Trade in the U.S.
That a "ceremony" requires powers of mind, I grant; but relations are accidents of individuals, and real relations have a real essence based on objects in the world.  Complimentary sex organs, once used on each other, establish a relation that ends at death; the Bible calls it marriage.
even with williams we would have been far from the best front 7, get realistic. Cooper can run every route on the route tree, and run them damn good. I agree that there are good wrs left in the 2nd and 3rd but none on the level of Cooper. 
Your dismissal of one person's movie-going experience based on your own was more of a conversation-stopper than his (rightly) calling that pretentious.  
I personally feel that it's designed either for NPC-centric use, or for something to build a campaign around. Otherwise it can cheese/derail things too much.
The only positive in this story is that at least they do say that the drone is "hacked" implying that, no this is not a default and integrated feature of the phantom series.
Captain America is the personification of the absolute best in humanity and he should be portrayed as such, not as some jack-booted thug that does the American government's will.
This comment is ridiculous. People will buy a girl a few drinks because she was already gonna have them and instead they're paying for them. A couple of drinks does not impair your decision making. It may loosen you up, but that does not equal impaired judgement. By your logic, is 2 drunk people having sex double rape?
Well if it's with an office with more than 2 or three people, there exists sexism against men.  According to Realtor.com women make up 57% of real estate agents.  This employer does not reflect that with gender balance in employment.  If the firm only has 2 or 3 agents, your getting to the fringe of statistically probable.  If the firm has 20 agents all women, avoid this job.  You will either not get hired in the first place or accused of something career destroying.

It is more of a short term option but I suggest that you pay off your car. If you already have the money for your student loan payments factored into your budget you can shift that extra cash towards the car to pay it off much faster. Even if you just put half towards the car and half in your savings it will still be helpful.

But I can top arena any day. I top arena'd on the reddit community night arena vs LE+...The day I got 4x4k in one match, 7x4k that day, plus an ace and at least 12x3ks (over 3 a game, 4 matches) was the first day of my Ritalin prescription. I have ADHD and I do incredibly stupid shit which just gets me flat out dead before I have a chance. my aim is good enough to get me accused of hacking - wether or not I have good aim is a different issue, it is clearly better than my rank or I wouldn't get hackusations. My gamesense is undeniably horrible. I never avoid flashes, always get smoked, and generally get rekt by people SMARTER than me. I look at my demos - I almost never get directly out aimed, just out smarted. Maybe for you all of gold nova was bad aim bad gamesense, but for me it is just one which is horrible, the other is at least ok. I would send you a demo, but I'm going to sleep now. message me if you want one.
Moore's law has nothing to do with storage. It's specifically about transistors in a processor. That said, yes, we've seen exponential growth in many technologies.

Apathy is what makes democracy fail. The *act* of voting is essential for the democratic system to work. The reason why unpopular candidates get voted in sometimes? Their supporters are more motivated than apathetic people who don't think their votes count. If every eligible person voted we would *actually* see how the democratic system is supposed to work and get a realistic representation of what the people want. I'm a historical researcher and it really upsets me when people (especially young people such as myself) don't take advantage of the privilege we have. Less than 100 years ago women couldn't vote, and so many countries today are having wars over democratic freedoms. With so many important issues and inequalities still prevalent in North American society, I don't understand how anyone could honestly think that not voting is an option.It also takes 30 seconds and is free.
Yeah I feel ya, but my perspective is that MOST MEN are "beta", regardless of race, but nobody else has to backpack those losers and suffer penalties for em like we do.  Plus, we do actually face real, documented discrimination, both deliberate and unconscious, in a lot of different areas in life and it's really frustrating when dudes be in denial or downplay that shit.  Have totally seen that bananarang shit in action too, it's fucking disgusting.  Ugh.
It is crazy to see the way the culture in the U.S is going. I agree it is really sleezy to wait until someone is drunk or otherwise not sober to try to get them to consent, but to say someone is not resposable for their actions because they were drunk is straight up bull shit. If that same girl consented to her desire to go driving while drunk, would the girl be absolved because she wasnt able to make good decisions? Many people use alachol for the inhibiton lowering effects, and maybe the girl is too shy to talk to that guy she has been interested without alachol. Tellung a woman she is not capable of making decesions once she has been drinking should be offensive to the woman.

&gt; In what sense is it rightfully his? Marriage doesn't mean that all assets are instantly joint possessionsIt certainly does in this case.&gt; Since he owned his house prior to their relationshipThe ticket wasn't bought before they got married.&gt; In this case, she won that money, not him, so it was really hers.While they were married, with joint property. Pretty clear here.

He's undoubtedly talented, but there hasn't been a game of him I've seen where I felt like he dominated the game. I'm sure there has been, but whenever I've seen him live, he would make some plays but not as consistently and often as I would expect from someone with his skills.

I think I'm going to just use #13. I just got it in the mail today so I haven't worn it yet. It is a little bit light, but it's the right undertone and #21 looked so weird on me..

If they are smart, they will just use this as a way to incorporate the Texas Guard into Jade Helm 15 at some level as a counter surveillance training simulation. It is doubtful that the Governor *actually* believes any of this garbage, but he is doing something to symbolically address concerns. It is hard to condemn him for writing a letter to "monitor" which could be interpreted any way from watching the news to authorizing training exercises.
To add to this, there are three novels planned to retell the original trilogy from different characters, and those will also be canon, while the original novelizations only partly canon. They are only canon, when the story matches the events in the movie.I still hold Revenge of the Sith novelization as the "complete" version though, because of how amazing it is.
Hahaha, thanks! Nice to meet you as well. Humanism is nice too, but I like feminism because it conveys a progressive mindset in addition to equality, to me at least.

I'm really shocked. I thought their attitude about this whole porting thing would be something along the lines of "well, you should only use this for existing apps..."I never thought they'd be so willing to let people write Objective-C apps for Windows from scratch *in VS*. Honestly, I love that attitude they have: W10 is language-agnostic, so just go write a Windows app any way you like.

US West Coast resident, voting in the US model-designated West area as a rank-and-file member. Plenty of people hold voting positions in other model government simulations and vote in US models as rank-and-file party members, and vice versa.

Wowzers. Many years back i met Pete Poulos, fairly well a legend now, may he rest in peace.The amount of forethought and planning put into these works of art reflect a dedication bordering obsession.And many tend to forget, even Michelangelo painted over some mistakes.

Yes, that is correct. But the oxidation mostly takes place in the cytoplasm of the neuron, not in the synaptic cleft. That's why the high concentration in the synaptic cleft is not directly neurotoxic (It it indirectly neurotoxic though, because it raises the temperature). TAAR1-activation shifts a high DA-concentration of into the cleft.
They've been incredibly lucky in re-catching 096. He went after a guy in a relatively small town, and killed everyone who saw him before they could upload pictures online. The foundation's gear suffered complete failure every step of the way though, and things could have been MUCH worse. Imagine if someone in New York City saw 096's face in a photo thanks to some other group. You know AWCY? would love to plaster that face in times square. TV would pick everything up, and that'd be that for all of human civilization.So far, 682 has been easier to deal with than expected. He's obviously a danger, but as a keter he's honestly one of the weaker ones. He gets out, kills a few agents and farmers, then gets fucked up enough to be recaptured every time. And usually the escapes are because of stupid experiments.Also, yes, it's happened before. Also see SCP-2000.

What I like about IUDs is that you can't fuck it up. Women can skip the pill (intentionally or not) and get pregnant but you can't do that with the IUD. You can also verify she has it in by feeling for the strings near her cervix. What is the procedure you speak of for men?

I have been physically attracted to not good looking guys, because of their personality, but then the same personality on another guy might not attract me at all.
Add half an avocado to a protein shake. That's my breakfast most mornings! Makes a bland shake taste richer, and the added fat makes the breakfast more satiating. 
Seriously? That much money for a player who has shown he isn't worth it in my opinion. He was great in the PL and hopefully he can be that Bale again but I wasn't impressed by him at Madrid. Guess we'll have to wait and see.
Of course, another thing that I always do to warm up when I play are just hammer on exercises going down the neck, starting at the high E. So I start with my forefinger on the 9th fret and then hammer on the 12th fret and then just move down a tone and repeat, but I'll either hammer on a tone, semitone or a tone and a half depending on my position (you'll be able to tell if you hit a bad note because it'll sound wonky) to work out all my fingers, and I'll do that on all the strings, and when I finally finish on the low E, I work my way back up the neck and up the strings back to the high E.Also, I like to practice my pinky movements by doing just simple three note, two hand tapping exercises. On your fretting hand, just use your forefinger and pinky, and then with your picking hand, tap with your forefinger, but it's important to slightly pull the string down with you're coming off to get the note to ring.
hey! NOLA here :)Facebook certainly has its merits. It is a great way of generally keeping in touch and up to date with people's lives. And like you said, passive keeping in touch without actual direct phone/email/text contact. I probably could have significantly improved my FB situation by cleaning out about 95% of my friends list.But I found myself spending too much time comparing my life to those on my friends list. Which I know is certainly not FB's fault. The biggest thing was their horrific privacy policies.

Fractal R5 is the case you want. It's absolutely amazing in every way. Sound dampening, lots of options on the inside, plenty of cable management, ability to place 140mm fans=less noise, sleek exterior/minimal look, high quality build overall. I have one and love it. 
I'm definitely also an HSP, so I can understand and totally feel this. I can say the things that help for me are music, walks, and, sunshine /time away from the tiny area where the people are annoying me. Not easy however in dorm life. Sorry! Hope that it passes with time, I couldn't share personal space with anyone who wasn't my partner, and even then he has been very understanding and I also have been very understanding with him about or schticks. 
High school has become too casual. It's sad when you are revered as an incredibly intelligent being when you can solve for x in chemistry and do other basic maths such as multiple and divide. 
You're missing the point. People changed the focus of rioting to a "romantic picture" in the middle of people looting and destroying stuff. The riots were played down and weren't made a big deal beyond a couple days.

He survives all the way through the movie, through all the action scenes, through getting shot, through a car wreck, until we get to the very end scene where the remaining protagonists are celebrating their victory with the support characters, and he chokes on a bite of food, aspirates after a poorly performed Heimlich, and dies drowning in his own vomit before the ambulance can arrive.

Get about a 50-60% yield on this half melt. The better the hash, the better the yield. Just remember the pressure is more important than heat. It's all about finding that prefect middle ground, but; Pressure &gt; Heat.
Did I say there was no investigation? I said that **I** immediately took it to the principal and the teachers ended up losing their jobs. It wasn't "oop, there it is. you're fired," it was a few hours of questioning the teachers and my friend after school, and then the next day they reviewed some of the things that my friend supposedly did and when me and a few of our other friends would defend him, the principal thought we were lying. After hearing the two of those teachers clearly saying the things they did and all the evidence stacked up against them, one of them admitted it and the other denied it, but they were both still fired.
I have. I'm technically a senior, but I still have a year and a half. The experiences I've had here are going to be worth more than the price tag, for sure.
The one I saw was when I was a tourist here years ago, right by the waters edge - though I forget exactly where (on the Big Island, East side for sure - might have been down along Red Road).  Haven't seen one since I moved here in the '90s.
MILF isn't really affiliated with IS (or even AQ back then), they were currently in peace talks with government to form an autonomous Muslim region. MILF hardliners split off and formed BIFF, which then pledged allegiance to IS. 
You gotta be prepared to do a ton of laundry if you host one though.  Seriously, find a commercial laundromat because there will be truckloads of sheets to wash.

My dad collects knuckle busters, I'v always like the 60's ones more though from a design perspective but the pre 20's for mechanical. They used to do some weird mechanical stuff to get people to buy them.
There's no quick fix needed for some temporary inflammation in your oesaphagus. That will make swallowing feel weird while it heals. It will be feeling better by tomorrow and gone by the next day. When you say "I hope it's just that', what's your worst fear? Say it out loud, and it can help you assess whether its a realistic fear or not. Go well!
Sound is definitely enhanced, taste is... changed. Touch is (obviously) all but gone. Smell is completely underwhelmed in the trip, but still works as normal as I can tell. Sight... is complicated. You develop the double vision (your eyes are just sort of crossed for some reason). Yet, I personally think it enhances to an extent. Your vision is filled with CEVs/OEVs, and your vision comes in one and a half the amount of picture that's unaligned. But during the moments of clarity, I feel I have more visual focus. But, then again, it's rare. So I guess vision is a no... sorry for the late response :p
As someone who has ten rapid on vinyl, I am jealous of your young team. It's essential but I just don't wanna shell out $80+ for it.  I got lucky collecting their eps and stuff years ago for great prices. 
I missed catching him during his last couple shows he was doing; so I'm hoping it isn't too long of a wait. Next time I'm clearing my schedule and will have a better money situation by then. Enjoyed his latest solo album and been watching the recent live performances online. 
I walk past a local pharmacy in Richmond Hill (Queens) that has a sign declaring it to be a "compounding pharmacy" right off the J at 121st st.   Its not a wealthy neighborhood, so if they can do it, it should probably be at a moderate price. I would give them a call (if you can't find something closer I mean)[Triangle Pharmacy](http://www.yelp.com/biz/triangle-pharmacy-richmond-hill)
I suppose I am worried about getting pigeonholed as the implementation guy. I'm used to managing projects and various products (New, ground-up development).   Edit: I'm not having second thoughts, I'm very happy with the decision. 
That would be amazing to have.  There are many guns I would love to spend a weekend with that I wouldn't spend the money to buy.  Would be awesome to have a public armory to make guns available for rent.

No just reusable diaper on their bum... Or if that makes you nervous put a swim diaper on underneath, but don't do a regular diaper underneath because it will get wet 
They don't just share a name.  They're not like the BC or Quebec Liberals who are different parties with the same name, they are the same party and their staff often goes back and forth between fed. and provincial politics. 
I'm on my feet 10 hours a day, six days a week (I own a shop). 1. Get properly-fitted, well-cushioned shoes. Don't skimp on quality and make sure they're breathable and don't cramp your toes. Also wear good socks. I prefer Asics and use gel insoles which I switch out every couple of months. Shoes usually last me eight months before the cushioning goes bad.2. Do foot exercises and stretches once you get home. Rolling a tennis ball under your feet really does help!Mostly, you'll just have to get used to it. The first couple of weeks are the worst, though!

the notion in both the lyrics and music that life is bigger than one could know. there's a lot of salvation in the lyrical, thematic, and harmonic content that i think would really take a person out of a self-absorbed place and help them along to a larger world view.
I'm just unsure why you are trying to come at me with all this information.  I didn't ask for the Guatemalan history of coffee.  If you want to tell the OP something, address it to him.Not all farmers in every country live in poverty.  And they definitely do drink their coffee.  And a latte in Guatemala would not cost 3 dollars. And I have had Puerto Rican coffee.  But, please, keep making assumptions about me and enlighten me with information I'm not asking for.

Great post.  I would like to see if anyone has any real interpretations of the meaning of the last two glyphs.also, my semi-unrelated thought is that the eye-glyph on top of the mural (whatever it is) has *seven* lines around it , whereas the other glyphs have only 3.  If the 3 on the other glyphs means 3 am, isn't it possible the 7 on the mural means 7 o clock?  or do you think the lines around the eye-ufo thing on the mural are meaningless?
You just listed a bunch of Corsair PSUs in response to a comment about Cooler Master.  Did I miss something, or did you?For the record, I have an AX760 (Seasonic) in my machine, and I put an RM430 in my dad's.  The latest HX ones from CWT have had a few issues, and there are other lines I prefer at the CS price point. But HXi, RM, and AX/AXi are excellent.
Holtby hasn't Ben really challenged in a bit.  All the shots are coming from outside or bad angles.  Need to get in closer and get some screens on him.  
Maybe obvious from /u/jdylopa's post but he didn't say it outright, so: if you screw up the timing even a little bit, and your truces don't overlap, you can get real boned real fast. 
Glad I can help out as many perpetually offended liberals as possible. Time will win you over for me, we all grow up some day. Eventually, you're going to run out of fucks to give because you blew your wad of fucks too early on bullshit like getting offended over jokes. You'll get there one day, son. 
Kind of related, but I was talking to my AP English teacher after I graduated and she told me that 90% of the English department at my high school were on Xanax. I suppose thats one way to deal with all the shithead kids that went to my school.
...or maybe they shouldn't have taxed the carmakers into oblivion while making it impossible for them to deal with the unions on an equal basis, so the carmakers didn't feel it necessary to move to places where those things weren't the case.
Williams is a great player, but the Jets just used a huge pick on a player who might not even start with their roster (essentially what we did in 2013) 
I should have clarified the context of "wanking" in my article. :) I too wank all the time, and find it does produce massively creative and satisfying material. But in the context of working on specific exercises, I think having a focused approach is important for the sake of maximizing results without distraction. Like having a razor sharp focused approach rather than being all over the map. To get those creative juices flowing and for songwriting, just rocking out on the guitar is excellent. It's great for also reinforcing ideas and putting the individual pieces together for sure. Both approaches are definitely important and relevant for personal growth. Thanks for your feedback and for taking the time to read the article. I appreciate it. :)
My apologies if you're the OG P.E.N.I.S guy. I saw it on a YouTube comment having never seen it before and felt like sharing the funny. If it makes you feel any better, I don't get to keep any of this sweet sweet karma.
You can do it but it will be slow and imo it is more difficult than reading for example nhk news for kids. I play pokemon x,y,omega ruby and alpha sapphire all the time and i "try" to learn vocabulary from it the problem is that unlike a computer you cant copy/paste the kanji/vocab so its very slow to find the meanings etc....but I still enjoy playing those games though.
Ugh, my SO has learned that I can be such a bitch. I have a really bad temper already and it is just multiplied by a thousand. He is such a sweetheart now that he knows and can predict it but for the first couple times there it was bad. I try really hard now to recognize that I am feeling really angry and it is probably because of PMS. Even if I can't stop myself from being angry I try to say "I really am not actually angry right now, please know that." It's tough :(
ENBseries had commented close to GTA V release that there was little he could improve upon and that he wasn't going to work on the game. He also went on to say that mods would never happen, so take it for whatever its worth.
1oz flour (weight) is about 1/4 cu (volume), or 4 Tbsp. It should be listed at the top of the nutrition panel, something like "Serving Size 1/4 cup (30g)"If you can guess how much water and flour you've added so far, you might even it out a little by reducing the amount of water you add, temporarily.Edit:I just read in the linked article instructing to measure 1/2 oz flour by packing a sort-of-heaped measuring-tablespoonful against the side of the bag. So who knows how much flour you've actually been adding, if you followed this method.Edit 2:In answer to your actual question, just keep feeding/growing it until you have enough volume and activity so you can remove some to bake with and continue feeding the rest.
I've wedged the trunk carefully and triggered the release before but the last one (2005) I did was keyless entry. Ended up pointing her to a keymaker (I don't make keys..yet..)
What do you like doing? What does she like doing? Does it intertwine?   Talk about that and how you are doing it later after school.     Then ask her to come along on said event with you.    Is it a date? I don't know but best case you get to spend more time with your crush.     If she saids no then her lost and go on to the next crush.     Worse case, You have to deal with rejection in social groups. 
I think it mostly tightens the time between firing during the burst, which means you can conceivably fire more in less time, but you may want to invest in some reload speed as well if you go that direction.  Also, unless they ever come out with Prime Fast Trigger, you might be better off maxing damage as much as you can instead of going for throwing more bullets down range. 60% fire rate is nice but you only have so much ammo.Also, to be fair, I'm not a fan of the Tiberon, or pretty much any Sniper/DMR anymore since they seem to have succumbed to the power creep in the game, so I may not be the best judge of what is effective on those things.  If it was a straightforward sniper, I'd say go all hog on Damage and the higher base damage means 60% increase is so much more effective, but that whole burst fire thing throws me off.
One word of advice, if you'll take it. Be patient. I started out at 125 and I couldn't wait to be 150. Then I hit 150 and I couldn't wait to be 175. Now I'm 185 and can't wait to not being able to fit through doors. We're all going to make it, I'm rooting for you.
Minimum wages higher than 50% of median wages are known to reduce total employment.  That's based on emipirical evidence that /politics refuses to acknowledge.Danish citizens do not get anything for free.  They spend about 55% of GDP through government, not 38% like you claim.  The effective middle class tax rates are between 40% and 60% there and cost of living is higher.Sanders single player plan places a 13.4% payroll tax on the working class.  Low income people currently pay 0% for Medicaid.
nothing wrong with it, I just thought that it would mean that they dont have to pay taxes on whatever thing they can say fits as under the job, but I didnt really look into it before and hadnt planned on being an entrepreneur

There is no choice. We have to track down and neutralize these ayyteam maggots. They are doing far more harm than good, they were useful back when they derailed SJW hashtags, but right now they're outright sabotaging GG. Don't give me any of that just a group of friends bullshit, they killed GG on 8chan and now they're lending credit to the bumfuck retarded SJW narrative. Specially Moff Alexander, or whatever the fuck. He is the fucking ring leader. 
The Bechdel test isn't a good test for individual film basis (as per your example), but is fairly good at marking trends throughout movies in general. If one movie doesn't pass a test does not make it sexist or anything, and a movie passing doesn't make it a good representation of women or a "feminist" film. But if we take all the movies that pass the Bechdel test and all the ones that don't and compare, it would show a very telling trend.
You should in all honestly learn to play Demonology. I am not quite sure about those DPS numbers, they are a bit lower than what I was doing when I was 640 but that was pre-Highmaul.Affliction and Destro will both be potent in 6.2. Learning how and when to play all three specs will make you much more of an asset to your raid team and make the game a bit more fun.
&gt; I have to admit Kia is starting to look a lot better these days too.I think with the exception of the Rio, every car in Kia's lineup looks damn sharp right now. While I don't think the Rio looks hot, it's still easily passable.

I think that your last 2 sections could be reworked; In regards to your 'you should message me' I get the humor of '2 peas in a pod' but I think you should refer to the 'Critiques &amp; Advice' section on the right on a better one! Overall I get a jokester/goon vibe-which is great but I think you should elaborate on more things in a serious manner such as your career goals, and personal goals-since you are looking for a long-term relationship those would be things I would want to know about a potential mateGoodluck out there, and I hope this helped in some sort of way! 
You are skipping a middle ground where both is true at the same time.We keep saying "two wrongs don't make a right", but in reality that is EXACTLY the thought process that drives an inconveniently high number of decisions.So from that perspective we have quite a number of situations where a person might reasonably understand that what they are doing is actually wrong, and still act that way with some perceived  notion of "comeupance" or paypack or twisted sense of equilibrium.
That's what I am thinking too..I have Korean descent.. but that doesnt keep the discrimination even though I look Korean.. when they know that my Korean skills are not that good.. they have this certain kind of treatment...
So this will take nothing but the Funding element out of the Career mode? We will have essentially unlimited funds and all I have to worry about is science and tech trees?
I feel like a surprise baby is the only reason for this crazy time jump. Or Shondra's so pissed at Dempsey that she wants to deny Derek a proper send off and not have to bother having anyone mourn him (except, you know, the fans).Or she wants enough time to pass that she can immediately throw Meredith into a new relationship. Gag. 
Yes I saw that line, but it does not say the detection is restricted to multiplayer.  And Bethesda and Valve have already shown a willingness to make bad decisions regarding modding, despite it being a huge selling point for Bethesda games - which is why I used them as an example, but it could be _any_ developer, big or small.
they don't need him, but i bet it will still be a good pick. i'm sure they'll find a way to balance them all (or given the sport just end up plagued with injuries).
Thanks! I'm 8 months along and ready to meet this little one, already! I made him/her with my favourite person in the entire world so I feel like it will be so awesome!My mom's MS seemed to have been largely environmental. When she lived in BC, she was wheelchair bound and very, very bad. When she moved to Ontario, and was in a less stressful environment, most of her symptoms disappeared. She gets pins and needles if she's in heat for too long, (no hot tubs for mom) and she has numb spots - on her ankle, for example, and she can get "zingy and zappy" if she's stressing about something or not getting proper sleep, but aside from that, she's great! It's been 30 years since she was in a wheelchair!
Jets still have Dog shit at QB. Yeah Their D is gonna be sick but Im not even sure if they can get 21 points on the board and we just beat the the best defense in the nfl in the Super Bowl. 
Edwards was literally nobody to Derek, so if she doesn't like his SISTER's method of grieving, who the fuck cares???  Don't instruct someone on how to grieve for their close loved one because it makes *you* uncomfortable!
It depends on the value and on the source of the funds. If the funds are from the central bank, then there can be basically no interest. If the value is digging holes and filling them in again, then yeah, useless work. But there is a ton of work to be done to maintain what we have let alone building new stuff. 
Wow I never thought of it, but it makes a lot of sense to do this. Say he does give the idol to Shirin then Tyler automatically goes home UNLESS he had this plan where it would be 2-2 and then a revote and they would definitely vote out Dan I feel like over Tyler in the moment. Also I feel like this might be true what you are saying because how does Will know to vote Dan in the heat of the moment? Doesn't make sense for Will to just randomly vote Dan out of nowhere.

You dont have any bullets for your machine pistols.  Nor do you have a non-lethal option for fighting.You don't have an image link, ergo, you don't have a way to read AROs.  Suggest buying a rating 1 contact with image link.You have goggles headphones at rating 6 with nothing in there.  Suggest reducing the rating and stick with the basics for now.I would get English knowledge skill to 3 or better.  With rating 1 in English, you will be able to understand daily life things.  However, you should (depending on the GM) have a difficult time understanding English if the Johnson is trying to be more flowery with their words.  Remember, everyone in Seattle speaks English and not very many speaks Sperethiel.
I got a new car last summer and the stock stereo system had a dock for an iPod. Didn't want to use my old classic style iPod since it was slow to boot (either HHD or battery) and didn't want to use my old nano since it is part of my alarm clock. Didn't want to use my iPhone or iPad, wanted an iPod I could just leave in the car - so I bought a used iPod from a pawn shop. 
Amethyst /was/ there when Greg met rose, though. Her gem is included in the temple, on it's bust :)The temple was probably formed a long, long time ago. After they found Amethyst, but long LONG before Greg was ever around. Hell, I have my own theory that Beach City was built around the temple, rather than the temple being built on beach city.

The LCS I frequent most had many of the Forever Evil lenticular variants months after they came out.I think most variant covers are sought after initially, but after the initial hype dies down, they're readily available.
You're trying to come off as smart here but it's not working. A simple google search with the key words is all a person needs to do. If a person cannot figure out how to do that then they probably won't be able to get a job at McDonalds let alone any other job.

Yep, that's what I'd want for the TR too.  Belt/Backpack-fed ammo has been suggested before a couple of times, and is a great idea.It's well balanced well against the HEAT mechanic too, because you can continue sustained fire for as long as you have ammo and even dump your whole ammo supply if you want (advantage over HEAT), but your supply is still limited so you still have reliance on ammo packs (disadvantage).Although you might want to put in a limitation that you can't pick up new ammo while firing, otherwise you could sit on an ammo pack and just hold down the trigger until the pack disappears.  Imagine the dakka from 3-4 TR with Butchers camped around a level6 ammo pack with 1 Engie to supply ammo.
I just started the series, but the innuendo is pretty strong. There was an episode where I believe Anakin and Obi-Wan go to rescue Padmé from the Malevolence, and the PA says, "mind the gap" near some trains. Also, Anakin says to Padmé, "the things you do to get me off." Unless I heard wrong.
I thought it was a good movie. I also thought the kid was a damn good actor. Your point definitely stands though, the kid was supposed to be insufferable.
When I tried it on test client I really liked it, although you need to build up some quill stacks before it becomes really strong. It's extremely easy to keep up 7 stacks of warpath now though. I think this item certainly makes him stronger in the lategame, although the -5 ms from the patch was really noticable in the early game imo.
I don't like to listen to happy music. I'm not a happy person. It just feels fake. Especially pop. I listen to things I can relate to and just lose myself in.A few examples (Mostly from the alt rock genre):[Eddie Vedder - Long Nights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mev_FBj0Fyk)[Band of Horses - The Funeral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPW8y6woTBI)[Nirvana - About A Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhcttcXcRYY)[Pearl Jam - Yellow Ledbetter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs8y3kneqrs)[Childish Gambino - Outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXahuQhadV4)[Pixies - Where Is My Mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrdpliMfoAM)[Sonic Youth - Incinerate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP3ovD8ZSS4)[Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub Rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-KE9lvU810)[Red Hot Chili Peppers - Wet Sand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWNDW5KtiKk)Hopefully there's something you haven't heard here. I'd love some recommendations too.
And they've got fakebook now, where they can post about their brat's latest bowel movement, this social media has got to be feeding the narcissism.  I swear, I think some of them are getting pregnant just so they can compete with other mombies for "likes" on fakebook.
I'll admit I was one of those cretin engineering majors who picked on the liberal arts field. Then I took an ethics course and it was one of the more enlightening courses I have ever taken. I realized that while philosophy will almost certainly lead me nowhere it was damn fun to think critically and analyze the theories of others (more specifically to rip apart weak half baked fallacious arguments). I was tempted to change majors but I really need to be able to support my family. 
The thing that amazes me is that all of these women talk about those who "have survived assaults" or are "survivors".  I seriously wonder what percentage of them that claim this have been actually assaulted?  Maybe 5%?
As someone who lived in southern Utah that blue sky is accurate. It always surprised me in the best kind of way to see that amazing color of blue contrasting on the red rocks.
May the lord be with you. I hate my own language lol.For some reason German seems to be atleast somewhat popular, a year ago I never would've believed that people "want" to learn this language in school. (Czech Republic, Sweden, Latvia, Russia...)I might give it a try again, it's still on my "curiosity-list" together with Nagato-Yuki, UBW and AssClass. I just really *really* don't like feels or negative/melancholic emotions whatsoever so I don't wanna dive into anything like that...
I believe that's due to the Dodge Grand Caravan. It became so associated with minivans back that it stuck. Similar to how people refer to them as Band-aids for all rubber bandages or Coke for all sodas.
A heat gun used gently to soften the glue before you pry it off.  Be careful not to heat too much or you'll go through the clear coat and paint!  If you use a flat screw driver to pry, you might want to have a rag handy to place between the paint and the emblem as you pry.  The holes are only guide holes to make sure the emblem is centered correctly. Use rubbing alcohol to remove leftover excess glue and grime before re-installing an emblem, etc.
I did something similar to this... but with pictures of my coffee! Sadly the microprocessor broke after about a week (probably some coffee in it). After that I got bored with the project.[link](https://twitter.com/makincoffee) for those interested in pictures of my coffee from almost a year ago
Kinda hence why I toned the percent of dodge and target chance lessening down and also geared it towards not having armor to gain that. IE You're still more prone to be taking shots though you'll move faster. IE sounds like more legit dodging of rounds by using speed rather than RNG based chance it's also to let you get up closer on your target quicker which would suit dodge builds where users perhaps preferred shotguns and melee or being able to get up quick and if need be BACK quick. Also it's more prone to making you use cover to cover tactics over standing in the open which is slightly ridiculous.
Concerts are more understandable though because theyre meeting their idols irl. What op probably means that he doesnt understand because it's *just* a video on the internet.I went from quiet dude to crazy fanboy on my first GG concert and meeting crayon pop at the airport
"Lady Alysanne Rogers of the Amberly my lord," She said politely. "I am glad to hear *some* managed to make it. I saw too many broken wheels and carts on my journey here. As a matter of fact they were critical in slowing me down. Thank the gods my carriage made it to safety in one piece. Now I hope you pardon my intrusion my lord but if you don't mind I wished to speak with his grace over very *urgent* matters concerning the state of the Stormlands."
Sczesny is one good game away from this flipping.Ospina hasn't made mistakes, hence he stays in goal till he does.WS did make mistakes in the FA cup, being at fault for a goal, so he's considered to be on bad form.If the reverse were true the WS would be dropped for DO. Simple as.Does WS want to stay? Probably, big teams won't go for him and I don't think he's been shown the door.Hence; likely stay :)
No, the repairs weren't in pursuit of the noise. The FR bearing was on it's last legs as well as the FL balljoint, so I just did the whole front end. The old bearing was like something out of a textbook: awesome grinding noise when I turned it in my hand. But the whirring noise isn't like a bearing noise. It's much... Smoother? Thank you for your reply, I'll check out the tires.
Gluten free is not a fad. It's a treatment for a potentially life threatening medical condition known as Coeliacs disease. I contracted the disease some time in the past 10 years and moved to a gluten free diet as treatment for it.It has caused me untold agony, sickness, wasted years in just pain and lethargy and brain fog.When I stick to a gluten free diet it's like night and day. My health spontaneously improves within 3 days. Once you get over that 3 day hump your health just goes from strength to strength.I've gone even further than gluten free lately and have moved to cut all processed foods out of my diet. I try to only eat natural foods like fruits vegetables and meats that have minimal to no processing apart from cooking and preparation. It's even better than gluten free.With some added exercise you can lose about 1 kg of fat per 24 hours on this diet, with 60 minutes vigorous exercise per day.
Don't be so hard on yourself! For a first digital painting it's absolutely fantastic! Although the source was a bit off, your shading in general was great; very nice color choice and good forms worked out through the shading. Keep working with it. I can tell you'll improve very quickly! One side note, I'd advise doing more work completely on your own, rather than using a base or source image! It's definitely more comfortable and easier to use a base, but you'll improve 10x as fast if you draw the base on your own! You're doing awesome though. Keep up the great work!
Not really sure how to structure this so I'll just blah it out.I've never been religious. My dad tried to make me catholic, but that didn't work, and I never gravitated toward anything I read about. I recently made a friend who happens to be Wiccan, and when I showed interest, she directed me to the wiki/FAQ here and sent me Scott Cunningham's book on solitary practice.I love just about all of what I've read about so far, and think I can safely say I'm Wiccan now. It feels right.So, hi! :)
OK, so they brew it every other year.  It came out last year, so next year you should be set!  Not the best news i know, but that should give you some hope lol.
Same. So many songs and playlists saved in there...recreating everything is going to take a long time.There were also a few songs on Grooveshark I couldn't find elsewhere, so this really sucks. :/
If you want to go with Telstra for the better coverage, their BYO plans have been a bit better lately (although still expensive nonetheless).https://www.telstra.com.au/mobile-phones/plans-and-rates#dataThe L plan seems decent, $70 a month for $950 of calls, unlimited SMS and 6GB of data, I'm tempted to switch to it myself.
Well we don't have to go trough the trouble of acting on the spot. We can just take a break mid typing maybe watch a youtube vid or something else. Reading something text based is at least for me a bit de-personalized. It also feels like a 1 on 1 session  wich is doable. At a bar there are many people and things are happening around you so it is harder to focus on talking with someone and that is just really draining. This is how I experience it others might have thier own reasons. Hope it awnsered a bit of your question
I managed to build it on Ubuntu 15.04. I installed the following packages:     mono-xbuild libmono-microsoft-build-tasks-v4.0-4.0-cil mono-mcs nuget monodevelopI also updated SSL certificates so nuget wouldn't complain:    mozroots --import --syncOpened the project solution in Monodevelop and after tweaking a bit to get YamlDotNet installed, I could build it.
As drugs go it's safer than smoking and alcohol ten thousand times over. as for deaths caused by mdma most are due to drinking or bad pills that are sold as mdma but are other more dangerous substances and all those good be solved with education and regulation
Drivers are up to date, should I try uninstalling them entirely and reinstalling them? Is there additional information I can provide to further help diagnose the problem if that doesn't work in the meantime?
My fiance has it so that the PTO she earns throughout the year has to be used by December 31st. So the vacation time she earns on 12/31 doesn't count toward 1/1. And she works a job where everyone can't take off at once, so it's this weird situation where all of the senior people take off most of December because it's "use it or lose it" vacation while everyone else is stuck losing their vacation time. You basically can't take time off in the first part of the year because you haven't earned enough time yet, which is strange to me.
Mostly i Would Say a lot of Dex and Endurance to use it, You could try Richards Rapier, that's a really good one, also i think one drops down in the ruins of new londo, in a pot or something before you cross the bridge after coming down from Firelink Shrine.
Can you please quote the section where multisig is described as the central invention? Obviously you've read the whole thing in detail (right?), but like most people I'm not versed in patent-ese.
I can't sympathize with either side in this current issue, but I especially can't sympathize with a bunch of people who think destroying and stealing everything is going to make the world feel bad for them. I can sympathize with peaceful protestors who get hurt--they seem innocent and have what looks like a noble cause.But lately I keep hearing things like "some BLACK guy broke the law, and ran into the WHITE cops, which murdered him. Then everyone decided to break everything and start stealing TVs." That whole thing sounds stupid for everyone involved. People shouldn't break the law, cops shouldn't straight up murder people (unless it was really self defense, I don't know what happened), and people shouldn't just riot for no reason.People be stupid. Cops AND rioters.
Ok so if you want to play weekend north at twilight for non resident(past 2pm) it will run you $75 plus $25 per cart(not rider) if you want weekend non twilight it's going to be $125 for north course. For south you want to double those costs. 
It also means that apis can take advantage of the terser interface. The new streams api is fantastic because of it, without lambdas it would be nearly unusable.
Yeah good idea, Am actually starting to love this game now that I understand how to play more. If you reckon Kotor 2 is worth a play, I will give it a go once I'm finished Kotor.
They'll take an edge rusher...I can feel it.  It'd be such a mistake to take a receiver in their shoes imo.  If they take him, I hope he busts like a MOTHAFUCKER I hear they like waynes too.  My god would I be happy if they take waynes.  Teddy will slaughter him 
 Another comment,This is russian radio communications from Chechnya. 31.12.94. - 20.01.95. 60 russian soldiers fought against 300 soldiers in Grozny city.
All good stuff, and I agree with all your points, I'll have a read of the study in the morning as it's 0145 here.As for the starvation mode, I don't think it's fat logic, if you're eating a tiny amount of calories, you will lose weight, that's 100% true, however, you body will eat through its own muscle, your hormones will go out of whack etc. Of course you can't become obese and add 100lbs from eating too little, which is definitely fat logic, but under-eating is not the solution to a healthy cut.I want you to look like [this](http://img1.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2013/01/04/04-male-gaze-christian-bale-american-psycho-1.w529.h793.2x.jpg) at the end of a cut and not like [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HJj6jneSQKE/Us2WCE4PbbI/AAAAAAAACY0/sanuYtCwX-M/s1600/christian-bale-the-machinist.jpg)
Still learning...2006 Dyna Street BobInstalled a kuryakyn panacea taillight. Had to lose stock turns to install bags. Don't have a regular plate, have a side plate. Panacea light has integrated turn signals. Light turns red. Turns work. If you turn on the turn signal then pull the brake, those will then turn red. If you hit the brakes there is no change in the taillight. Making me think the brake light is stuck on. Rear brake switch checks ok. Checked front, no change. Replaced front brake switch. No change. Any ideas?
I'm ok with that. After all the bucks in 6 talk. Which I found pretty funny, a good fan base needs to come back to earth and know that they need to improve a lot before being title contenders.  Shit just realized your name. Haha well my point stands
&gt; I don't think anyone wants another Bush OR Clinton.I cant possibly even imagine giving it another thought at this point. No more Bushes no more Clintons. Its over let it be over. You cannot convince me they just so happen to be the best people for job! "What a coincidence!"Its not a coincidence.
Yeah but it comes with the territory. The more superman like Harry gets the more time he has to spend saving the world from asteroids and the like. Less time spent stopping bank robberies and getting kittens out of trees. But that's ok cause that's what the justice league is for. They get to tackle the "human interest" problems while Harry is out fighting the giant squid.
Wow, way to cherry pick your data there. That looks like the start of a really scary upward trend in 2009, which is the last year that your chart shows. Except if you look at the numbers the following year, there's an even sharper decline.    http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/types/cervix/incidence/uk-cervical-cancer-incidence-statistics#trends
There's a couple named Mike and Dana Thar who for about 20 years or so have delivered lunches downtown and on campus.  Fixed menu, $7, and usually more than you can eat.  The item for the day is announced on an email list, and via FaceBook (https://www.facebook.com/MikeAndDana).They also do a Saturday Night Supper Club, which is a fixed-menu multi-course themed dinner.  This weekend they're doing "Tour of the Exotic Far East."They've both been in the restaurant business for years, and Mike owned the OLD Barbeque Train on N. Walnut back in the 80's, early 90's.Full disclosure: I'm an old friend of theirs and help them with their Facebook page and mailing lists.  If you want on their lunch or supper mailing lists, PM me.
Yeah, the end of Tennant's story was the last part of Doctor Who I really enjoyed to the fullest. I liked Smith's story, but not as much. I really liked Eccleston for the season he was there, though.
idk about the US, but most catholic high schools in canada accept non-religious people via optional attendance. pretty much half my school's student population are atheist/another religion 
I have no problem being recorded provided the person doing it is not actually interfering with me doing my job.But this could present a very real officer safety risk:&gt; Not only that, but it also alerts nearby users that also have the app installed that an incident is going down. So you'll potentially have hostile people who are not involved with the contact arriving on the scene midway through the contact...
Keep in mind that the Patriots usually pick in the late 20's.... which makes it very arguable that BB has been the best drafter over that period.Edit: Just read your post. Wow. Thanks for doing this!
It's even more awful because there's this tone of "we are so logical and academic and scientific" in their racism/sexism/etc. It's horrible. At least when ignorant people are racist you can just write them off, they don't know any better. But it is so horrible to have endless racist threads with the comment sections hosting chains of self-validating pseudo-scientific/sociological shit. 
Honestly, I would consider going to school in the British Isles or Canada if your goal is English - the US is probably the most expensive place on the planet to go to uni, and not benefiting from an in-state residency/US citizenship puts basically everywhere above your budget...

There is a limited pool of HS students to hire from (most of whom can't work anywhere near full time), and ultimately there may be scenarios where you want a worker who is a little more mature/educated and are willing to pay a premium for them.
Wasnt there a monster harry faced or something in the past that spoke directly to his mind and it had an accent because thats how harrys mind interprets it?
I dont understand either. It's like the apex of your life is working that job, for real? I can kind of understand if it's your own company because then you get into your personal legacy which some care about but if it's someone else's name on the building I don't understand how people get so obsessed about that part of their life. Don't get my wrong i actually really like my job, but it's not my goal to work as much as I possibly can. I'd rather work smarter and leave those other people behind at the office. 
That cat is awesome. I need one for hubby. I had a fit of giggles the other while watching my little pony (with my girls I swear) when I saw the grumpy cat as a cutie mark on one of the ponies.
Here I thought there would be a ton of trade talk, and at least one trade. I even had people base their drinking game on the word "Trade" and there hasn't been much mention of it at all. 
I'm not supporting Labor's current approach - it does seem to be trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  But it's worth bearing in mind that pretty much everything in this case, and pretty much everything most politicians do ever, is "playing politics".Recalling the Ambassador was done as much to play to a domestic audience as to express dissent with the Indonesians.  Tony Abbott's comments linking the cases to foreign aid was playing politics.  Most of the public commentary from all the parties has been playing politics, much of it unhelpful.So it's a bit feeble to be crying outrage at this point.
I want to see the Frey/Tully storyline so bad but since Jaime is going south to Dorne [AFFC](#b "instead of to the Riverlands this storyline will either have to be changed or completely aborted")
That's true, but they've also started the workshop and started paying for and using models made by the community. Admittedly Valve has been acting more "corporation-ish" recently, but if they don't take risks with new programs, then Steam can't really evolve past being a game distribution platform. I think they might benefit with close community interaction during the planning phase of programs to avoid another paid mods fiasco.
Factory reset the phones or if you've had them for a year, sell them or something and get new one's.  There are several deals out in the Interwebz that you can take advantage of to get solid phones for cheap.  Perk is honestly the only option right now and the fact that you can run passively run multiple devices per app makes it a pretty darn good option to say the least.  There's no other service that compares to it.
I have plenty. Now I just have to come up with an actual multi element team. Ive been running Feeva, Elza, Ciara, F&amp;F and Andaria. But im sure I could muck up some others. :)
When I was in college as an English major I often read a lot about authors before writing any literary criticism essays. Most people focus only on the text to figure out its meaning but the author's life is at least as important.
*Ozymandias is knocked off target by a sudden hit received to the Reaper Flagship, knocking out it's mass effect field for several seconds. C falls down as well and is astonished when he stands back up to see Cable, Rowe and Constantine standing in front of him. Rowe charges at C while Constantine freezes Harper solid in place. Cable doesnt waste any time, and begins sprinting toward the Reaper's RFI core.*
There's a difference between selling quality cosmetics that took time to make and shitting out reskins and making grabby hands at your wallet. Promoting the latter gives no incentive to bother with the former. I absolutely loathe "gold" skins for this reason (that and they universally look like gaudy shit)
#FeitoriaA Tile Improvement replacement for Trading Posts. Yields equivalent to a Trading Post and also grants an additional 1 Production and 33% Defense to any friendly units on the tile.

*He wraps a hand around his neck, lifting him and pinning him to the wall.* I told you to get off of her... *He punches him in the stomach.* But you just didn't listen. *He sends another punch to the stomach.*
Grain of salt, as I know nothing about your industry.Does your company tend to promote or pull in people for promotions?  Quite honestly, if he is performing so highly, chances are he might get scooped up for a different, higher level position, like a manager or lead.  He sounds like he could easily quit and become an asset elsewhere, so if your company is smart, they'll retain him and give him more to work on.So I think you may just be waiting it out until he either is promoted, or bounces to another company.  In the meantime, I think it is worth getting to know him and asking how he learned what he knows.  He sounds like a cool guy and you might make a new friend.

See, I don't understand MAC finishes. I was going to make my own 15 shadow palette the other day, but the variety of finishes and lack of description made me so lost. I looked them up and had a nice palette at the end, but I ended up not going through with it because I just wasn't sure. What the heck is retromatte?
I know it wasn't going to be similar to the desktop version but can you tell use what you can do on it?I was thinking we'd have access to programs like the Microsoft Office or even IDEs.
I would if i wasn't concerned about airflow, which bothers me really. Woould tou post picture of  your two 295x2 inside a case ? I would like to see what you ended up with

[Gee, I wonder where anyone got] (http://christophercantwell.com/2014/02/22/government-social-media-bots-exposed/) the idea [that Monsanto might be paying] (http://www.globalresearch.ca/monsanto-has-a-discredit-bureau/5440296) to [influence customer perception through social media?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/lutzfinger/2015/02/17/do-evil-the-business-of-social-media-bots/)&gt;Monsanto’s discredit bureau is also similar to the technology espoused by Big Pharma. Social media “bots” that automatically counter comments that are negative toward vaccines. I’m fairly certain I’ve seen these in action. Likewise, a viral and heartbreaking post about a mother whose baby caught measles from a non-vaccinated person was a complete sham fabricated by an upper pharma rep.
We didn't even get a reaction from half the cast of the show.Also, really? Thanksgiving? I hope they save this episode with Meredith walking back with Derek at the end. 
A cop friend of mine told me one of the big mistakes people make with pepper spray is buying ones that spray a mist rather than a jet.  A mist is easier to "aim" in that it covers a large area, but it requires you to be closer and the potential for it to blow back into your face is high.  The jet kind takes some practice to aim, but has a longer reach and less potential for pepper spraying yourself like an idiot.
I had him too. Never bothered to study. Didn't attend much during the second half of the semester (grade was based partially on attendance). When asked to list other students in the class on the first test, I listed "James T. Kirk", "Mr. Spock", and "Jack B. Nimble."I got an A in the class. Reed Benson was an even bigger idiot than his father. 
I cant believe williams fell to us wow.. This is amazing!Edit: boys we're keeping Mo there is no reason why we would trade him or let him go. Hes a beast, a leader and a motivator on our defense. Our defense line is going to be INCREDIBLE.Now the rest of our picks for the offense and we'll be going to the superbowl!! :P
Meat is mostly produced in places other than California.  And animal feed isn't a big product of California.  California's big thing it specializes in is vegetables.Also, you're a little mistaken about what's cheap in agriculture.  Produce is high value stuff.  Even the cheapest vegetables in the grocery store are quite high price as far as crops go.  The cheap stuff is bulk commodities like wheat, rice, soybeans, and corn.
After forgetting to bring my textbook to class, my teacher told me I was a flake and if I was a nurse, my patients would  end up dying because I would forget to give them their medication. And she said this in front of everyone. 
My only problem is that I could use a witness that would pretty much guarantee me winning in one of the cases, but getting a witness to use during the hearing is a hassle, and having a witness for the wrong case would be pointless. I was just looking for advice on how to obtain more information about my case. Also, the employer would most likely use an attorney, and then it isn't really a matter of who's right or wrong, but if the attorney can get me to say the wrong thing.I understand that it isn't the most serious matter, but I can't afford to go into nearly three grand of debt because of this. 
By dead, it means *Baghdadi is getting facelift and then be given new name or perhaps back into IDF/IOF or may be off to Goa or Nepal for relaxation and then back to ISIS with a new name.

Yea but with out rank one passports we can fly to whichever commie country we chose and enjoy the things we don't have here before returning to the beautiful land of the free!
I saw it at Celebration Cinema GR North (the other theater showing the true experience in Michigan). The sound levels were off on purpose, because I remember a sign outside the theater saying "the sound is fine, Nolan wanted this blahblag". According to one of the sound mixers on the film, they said “There are particular moments in this film where I decided to use dialogue as a sound effect, so sometimes it’s mixed slightly underneath the other sound effects or in the other sound effects to emphasize how loud the surrounding noise is. It’s not that nobody has ever done these things before, but it's a little unconventional for a Hollywood movie.” I heard every piece of dialogue (Michael Caine's last words were purposefully quiet/cut in post production), but I see where you're coming from. Since I'm kinda young (15), I ended up liking the sound because it worked for me emotionally.
I'm conflicted on this one, I like how the amount of fish has increased for shore fishing, but  I would like to take the canoe down the river for fishing too, is there a diet coke of dam option?
Christian here. The primary argument is that marriage is a union before God between two people. Since (orthodox) Christianity has historically taught that Scripture says homosexuality is a sin and marriage is a God-centered union, under (once again, orthodox) Christian doctrine, the term "homosexual marriage" is a contradiction; God wouldn't honor the sinfulness.I think a big problem with most Christians is the term marriage. If they just said "civil union", you'd hear less of an outcry in my opinion.
I got a playlist if raiden combos I have made. Check em out. I write out the combos in the desc. of the vidshttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL71WAKbLu1StsSigHe5v8EpJQ5LT13Ya4
The problem is qualified immunity for police officers.  That little protection alone wins almost every single court case brought against an officer.  Want to know why DAs drop charges and civil suits are settled?  Well in some states when they bring charges against an officer for assault, they lose over 90% of the time.  The inverse of the conviction rate for civilians.  Something needs to change, and that is stripping of qualified immunity when charged.  
There should be a chance of it but if it does happen, Soviet Union should be split up into different Reichskommissariat.  It seems to happen everytime in SR, where in HoI series it is more variable.  Darkest Hour is the only one that seems to do it correctly with the Reichskommissariat areas.  Only problem with the latter is the Germans don't know how to defend thew new Russian border, which you can see in my Darkest Hour 1939 - 1964 timelapse at the very end.
It says starting difficulty hard so yeah it's supposed to be a bit of a challenge. Try not fucking with the sassanids or their puppet states? More experienced people?
I agree and disagree. I've played GTA since I was probably like 9, but I was mature enough to understand that doing this kind of stuff in real life is just not ok. I was always aware that stealing cars, killing people with chainsaws and going on murder rampages is totally wrong and something you should only do in video games and not even consider doing in real life.So far, I've never hurt anyone other than defending myself or others.I do think its a case by case type of thing though. Parents should decide if their child is mature enough to play these games, as some are just not, while some are.
Yeah, I've noticed this too. It finally gave me a contract to fly by Minmus but I got impatient, landed there and jumped to three different biomes. Missed out on a load of money, but I only would have used it to send a new ship anyway.
The food is great but it's not as sweet as you.The food is good but seeing you made it better.Hey uhm, what time do you get off work usually? Do you want to get a cup of coffee? 
It's a terrible indicator. Name one great player who has let himself get ejected in the first half of a playoff game. It shows a huge lack of self control. If he was competitive, he would have tried to win the game. Instead he quit on his team. 
Thanks! I hooe it leads to some good changes. I struggled making friends in high school, so I'm looking forward to making some in college. Congrats on your graduation! Are you moving across the countrh for a job or just for a change? 
Mate when the issues been addressed like 7 times by devs, and the questions been repeated like 5000, it starts to lose any meaning. Currently I'm not happy with the state of the game, and am not playing, as CLE was too good, and the rollback is boring as fuck. Zombies aren't great, but there's a difference between being honest about the state of the game and repeating dumb questions. 
I agree with the MCW thing being worse definitely a flagrant 1 by how the NBA has called those this year while easily just a missed common foul on Giannis, but still no excuse for that retaliation by Giannis.  It shows he was passionate and Dunleavy the veteran got in the 20 year olds head up 20 so I understand where Giannis's mind was at. He clearly just lost his cool and didn't look big picture, but as long as he learns from it and doesn't become a repeat offender I think this in the long run could benefit the Bucks who clearly still need time to grow up.
I used [this link](http://serenesforest.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=25963) to do mine. Note that it more or less requires some sort of image editing software (I used Photoshop).
Other than dedicating time to creating all the necessary ingredients, and then cooking in large quantities, there's somethings which take time, and often cooking is one of the biggest time consumers.Just budget your time better around it.

They're sworn in to uphold the state and federal constitution and all laws local state and federal. Municipalities can place restrictions on their *own* officers, however.The power to operate throughout the state comes in the form of state law, which is where the authority for all police powers within the state come from. Since I'm on mobile I'm only going to provide one state's statute.https://iga.in.gov/legislative/laws/2014/ic/titles/035/Section 33 gives arrest powers, saying that if you are a law enforcement officer by meeting the requirements under state law, you have power of arrest within the borders of the state.

Unpopular opinion time: Keep your mouth shut. It's not your business and after so much time there's really nothing stopping her from claiming that you are lying and there not being much proof left.She cheated on him years ago, they broke up, she suffered through heartbreak over someone who was just using her for sex and then trying to make up to Jack and get back together. She already paid for her mistakes. Also, if she as going to pass him an STD, she already would have. Sex on the side and some drug use don't automatically mean STDs. It's just not any of your business and frankly you will probably just come off as petty and jealous versus caring and concerned. The messenger is always shot in these situations. For all you know she already told him and they've already moved past it anyway. Their relationship is their own and you need to butt out of it no matter how your feel about your friends past mistakes. 
I have a feeling that titania didn't care much about lily. I actually think she's going to get better now, Sarissa is family, having her niece around, having family, might make her...better I guess.
Yeah, but the idea was that only nobility or the very rich could afford to *be* fat, which means that the people who could actually get fat were also the ones who were well-off and therefore being fat might end up being considered a good thing. 
I use coconut oil as a moisture mask when my hair feels too rough.You might have a protein sensitivity causing the roughness on the ends. Try posting in r/nopoo or r/curlyhair they are both great with figuring out ways to moisturize and if you're products are working with you or against you.

Every morbidly obese person assumes every skinny person is anorexic or malnourished, because they don't want to imagine a world where thinness is actually healthy.

what i'm saying is it isn't worth to bet on 1-1 and choice a team for both games because there are much chances to get points since the order of the win matters.   basically guessing AT LEAST a match with a 2:0 bet is 75% chance,  guessing at least a match with a 1:1 bet is 50%
This was a "recommended" battery on the website so I already bought it I ordered them together. That's why I'm asking if I need to cancel the order or not
Will you win regarding the phone? That depends on what the deal between you and her was regarding the phone and phone bill.~~Will she win for harassment? No idea.~~  (no idea why I thought she was threatening to sue for harassment, my bad)As an aside, she has no control over jail. She can make a police report regarding you witholding the tax return. You could get into legal trouble for that but that would be up to the policeOne more thing: stop lying. the phone was not stolen. 
They are okay but definitely overhyped on this sub. If you are in the USA i wouldn't pay that much for a squire when you can get used Fender Strat for ~$250. 
I believe the point is that the extreme positions of Ted Cruz and many other GOP candidates, eager to appeal to the base, are stigmatizing the party, in the minds of many independents, as dishonest, anti-science, and favoring government intrusion into our personally lives.
What kind of shoes are you using? I recently switched from really old gym shoes to flat shoes with a decent grip and I feel so much more sturdy when walking out the bar. If you are scared of falling down backwards then try box squats. Lower box gradually over time.

&gt; Having kids is no longer idealized. Children are shown in popular culture as involving a shit-ton of work, stress, and shit.This is basically what I'm finding as I get older. Initially I was sure I wanted kids but as each year passed and I remained childless I started to focus more on myself. I'm just starting to get to the point where I have the discretionary funds available to do whatever I want. So what I tell people now is that I think I'm too selfish for children. I like doing whatever I want with my life and while I could incorporate a significant other, I don't think I'd be able to essentially sacrifice my life for children.I may miss the love and joy that comes from having a child but at the same time I'll get to focus more on everything else that makes me happy. Oh, you always dreamed of going to Italy but can't feasibly go until the children are out of the house? That's too bad because I'm going tomorrow.
As for the speedometer, I think in most cars it tops out at 100 or 110ish for some reason.The upgrades seem more noticeable with sports cars. The things I have noticed with the transmission upgrades is: Less miss shifts, more torque to the ground, and a slight increase in acceleration.
The short answer is no. I've never heard of a shop that misdiagnosed or installed the wrong part / improperly installed paying for a repair that was corrected at my shop. That said, there is not enough information here as others have pointed out. However all you can really do is explain them the situation and see what they'll do, if they aren't willing to make it right then you have a choice whether or not to seek legal counsel. In which case, make sure you have lots of paperwork and preferably pictures.Typically when a shop messes something up, you take it back to them and they fix it at their cost. Demanding money after the fact is not likely to benefit your wallet.
Yeah I get that, but he's at the end of his career, so I'm just wondering if maybe there are some good younger, lesser-known fighters out there who would stand a chance. Seems like the consensus is a big fat "NO"Full disclosure: I'm not a big boxing fan

I like how she talks about being more confident at a size 18 and people still messaged her so it was better to be fat and confident. Or, or your just older and more confident; and would be way happier at a size 10 again.
I'd never heard of it either. From the 1999 USMA Cadet Hostess Office "Guide to the Military Dining-In":*The Vice addressed as Mr., Miss, or Madam Vice (shortened to Mr/Ms vice in this pamphlet) is usually a junior officer selected for his/her wit and speaking abilities.**The Vice is the person responsible for the evening.  He/she is the first to arrive and the last to leave.  He/she starts the cocktail period by opening the lounge, sounds the dinner chimes at the appropriate times, delivers the appropriate toasts and keeps the party moving.  He/she is also responsible for testing the main course prior to it being served and announces to the members of the mess, that it is fit for human consumption.  Mr/Ms Vice sits at the end of a table or alone at a small table on the opposite side of the room facing the President of the mess.*
&gt;I heard a teacher refer to a student as a "stupid whore who will ruin her life before high school." She did get pregnant in eighth grade but still that's a fucked up thing to say.Sounds more like an apt prediction than an insult
I'm a Utah Utes fan and this guy can play I had to go pick him up. His stats a decent as well. Three 99 stats and good zone and man. I would also say he's a sleeper of the draft. 
assuming its real lsd and properly tested and from a trusted source. ill take lsd over shrooms any day of the week. the only time I really take shrooms instead of acid is if I have shit to do later and I cant be tripping for 7-13+ plus hours lol.   OR if I haven't eaten shrooms in a while and having a craving, but don't want to hippie trip. I love lsd but its not unlike anything else, anything in excess is never a good thing. be responsible and safe. have a magic journey.
This is how I always viewed it. If the base game was worth the asking price, I'll buy it. If I find the DLC is worth the price being asked for it, I'll buy that, too. Otherwise, I'll buy something else and consider letting the company know why I passed over their product.
The reason I said what I said was because to prevent the spread of misconception that a state law will nullify a federal law, as it does not happen and has been proven that major supreme case courts in history. I do agree with you that the federal government will not and, in my honest opinion, should not enforce it. The number of states that legalized marijuana will increase and probably steer the nation to legalizing marijuana completely.
I do think that if you are consuming under 2000 calories, there's a good case for the issue being metabolic or hormonal. IMHO, Removing the IUD is a great place to start, and if you are still having trouble, be a squeaky wheel about getting some hormonal testing done...it could be stress or lifestyle related. Paragard over here... but I haven't had my period in a while... It's either due to low body fat (I'm the lowest I've ever been in my life right now) or the IUD... but either way, I don't miss it, and I'm glad that I have assurance I'm not pregnant! 
17, male, US. I caught up via Hulu in time to start watching live during season 4. Dan Harmon's voice was so specific and recognizable that I became obsessed with the show and have been ever since.
Jay knew details of the crime before speaking to the cops. He was telling people Adnan killed Hae before speaking to the cops.That's what makes the theory of 'the cops encouraged Jay to frame Adnan' preposterous.
I can't help with what that is, but why were you "prying" the ram out? In your model it should be a very easy spring loaded arm that lifts up the ram and allows you to easily pull it lightly with your fingers. Perhaps follow a guide to ensure you are doing it correctly. 
Most labels for groups of people are like that.  Religion, ethnicity, race, political affilliation, all can have 2 groups of people each claiming to be x but for diametrically opposed reasons.  Hell, even gender can get tricky in the borderline cases. 
Since the [**HUMOL**](http://imgur.com/UNWei4I)'s speed has slowed, it now uses the excess of digestive acids as a hunting weapon. The range is not far, but one it hits, the creature becomes slowly digested. 
I honest to god just had this dream last week. I won 120k which came out to 81k after taxes. Enough to cover my loans with a little change for some fun. Woke up to a very strange ride of emotions that very quickly turned into a low boiling disappointment for the rest of the morning. 
It happens a lot actually in more underprivileged areas where the students lack any consequences or have no parents around. Happened all the time back in middle school where I attended. Its sad
It could be something interesting is going on, but given the huge amounts of physics they would have invalidated or that would need to be written, (unfortunately) it's much, much more likely they've just fucked up the experiment.The equipment they're using is supposed to be accurate down to about 10 micronewtons, and their signal is 50 micronewtons, but that's still a fairly small margin.It's reminiscent of an experiment at CERN that seemed to show faster than light signals. Eventually they found a loose cable:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_neutrino_anomalyBasically if it sounds too good to be true, it virtually always is.
Chewing gum served as an excellent appetite suppressant during my own weight loss journey.In any case eating properly has to be a lifestyle change, not a temporary project. Otherwise, you'll gain it all back.Do it again. You've done it before, now go do it again.
Depends on how old. for 3 months + I just use bars. They prefer to jump. 2 months, they'll probably still jump most the way still.So i'd go between 30 and 45
After watching him in these playoffs, I really hope he doesn't. Also Jordan Clarkson needs to soak up all the minutes he can. He's great, I'm getting serious Westbrook vibes from. Lakers don't need no aging stubborn point guard stealing development time from him
Awesome. Will do. I spent some time trying to figure out a way to configure the network and sshd from the rescue mode to no avail. CentOS 5.2 rescue will let me config network but not sshd. Centos 7 rescue will let me configure sshd but not network. I realized i was wasting time instead of actually trying to fix the problem. So, I'm not in front of the system right now, else I would remote in and work on it.
Halp! On April 10th I was gifted an Attack on Titan bracelet but I can't find the gifted post and it didn't come with a gift note. Could someone help me locate the gifted post so I can post a thank you? 
Honestly, when I think about population I am usually thinking globally. There is a possible "red heads heading towards extinction" side effect kind of thing with different groups, I get that.But the global population has gone from about 3 billion when I was born to over 7 billion. That's less than one lifetime. That shit *should* be scary.

I don't know if it was the most emotional for me, but I happened to rewatch this episode today and it hit me hard - in the Season 4 opener when Latrice talks about having been in prison and having to miss his mother's funeral because of it, and what a difficult year that was. 2012 (same year that season aired) put me through it - my mom died very suddenly in May of that year, and then in July my husband left me with very little warning and I didn't have a steady job, health insurance or a place to live. and then minutes later in that same episode Jiggly talks about /her/ mother dying so it's just a really rough one for me to watch.
&gt; But if you asked a random basketball player on the street to go against LeBron, he's going to get destroyedThe problem with that analogy is that he is only one player. If the NBA followed that standard there would be only maybe twenty players in the NBA total. Who would recruit a player who was worse than Jordan, Kobe, Vince Carter, etc.? No one;LeBron is in the top for a reason. There are hundreds of players far below him. Similar to LoL players. There are thousands of players who could compete in the LCS. It is just a matter of dedication and opportunity. There are players in Challenger who, while solo stars, are better than a majority of LCS players. Yet they are not on teams (for a variety of reasons).My point is: You do not have to be the best at something to be apart of it. You just have to be in the right place at the right time, and show that you are both skilled and dedicated.
That had nothing to do with why it caught the 360. It caught it because it had the word "Playstation" at the front of it. It outsold the 360 every single year apart from 1, even when it had no good exclusive games.Exclusive games really don't have much effect on console sales these days, havent for years.

No it's the tube for the intake from the intercooler. Just keep an eye out for a check engine light. If it's not on, good. If you had a boost leak, you'd get a p0299 underboost code as well as a little bit more turbo whistle than normal (maybe).
I had an error once, it prevented me from starting the game, I restarted steam and it worked again.But that aside I haven't experienced anything like that of what you explain.However sometimes I get a failed to save error message and is forced to main menu, I don't know what causes this, but I learned to live with that.

You can't do that with the fifth amendment. If you worked for a private company, sure. But police are employed by the government. So being fired would be a punishment from the government, which is prohibited by the fifth amendment. 
It's because of Samba that it can "push" its name. On a Windows network the NetBios protocol can be used to translate hostnames to IPs, allowing you to SSH by hostname. Linux by default does not support NetBios but it can be added by installing Samba.So in short, if you'd like to do the same with your CentOS server you'll have to install Samba or you can edit your host file and add a manual entry for your server. I would recommend looking up how name resolution works.
The At-Bat audio stream is about a minute behind, judging from the game thread.  I saw that run happen before it happened.Makes me feel like I have powers of premonition.
Yes, opportunists will be assholes, but that is true in everything. It would be more "beneficial" to aim their violent desperation at establishment totems, but those are often heavily guarded whereas protester's own communities are not.  To me, the painful irony is that they destroy their community to protest that their community is not deemed valuable enough to protect. That and that the media seems to actively want to throw fuel on the fire.

The fact is that AAA developers still want to squeeze the consumer of money however little it amounts to.I have not seen many developers, much less AAA ones, make their games free after such a time has passed.  One such example would be Saira.
She has the same picture on her cell phone and laughs about the guy named Taint with all her friends. So next time one of them meets a guy with no finger nails they'll ask if his name is Taint
A guy did this to me this morning on a fucking MOTORCYCLE. Had I a camera I may have held back on my braking for just an instant and smeared his ass on the concrete.  I know I'm an asshole for thinking that but he did it three times...he'd "lane share" between cars, get in front of me and then brake check me in the "fast lane" and I'd pass him and move on and never be in his way. He just didn't like being passed. 
Ah, I don't watch pretty much ANY other streams, actually! I'm not a fan of streaming in general, but TwitchPlaysPokemon was such a unique experience that I put aside my mild distaste for streaming to check it out! As for other games, I've been playing a LOT of Smash4WiiU lately to practice for the TPP Smash tournament and generally I play indie platformers on my PC. That reminds me, I do need to get back to playing Shantae: Risky's Revenge when I'm less distracted haha.
I think this creates more harm than good.  Grad school is already a place where basically everyone feels inadequate and worries that the faculty members are ranking them.  Reifying that into a formal process would only provide additional insecurity for people.It's really hard to compare "worthiness" of someone's PhD.  How do you define that?  Who gets the most citations?  Publishes the most papers?  Works the most hours?  Has the most inherent "genius?"  Across areas (even within departments), these stats aren't useful for comparison of the "goodness" of students.  And even when you have them, it's hard to judge relative quality of work. 
I definitely don't like the side box art as much as a standard BD/DVD, but I also got the one SAVE DVD I have on Black Friday when it was on sale, so I take what I can get.
I was off today. I haven't combed my child's hair all week. Granted, those curls look great...but I know I need to comb that shit. :1 I layed in bed and watched tv.

I don't think they need encouragement when the writers themselves ship it all the time (the kissing between Missy and the Doctor, the bondage references with Simm's Master, Robert's Master "needing" the Doctor's body). I also find it is hilarious that in universe even the Rani seems to ship the two of them.
What's the big deal ? Men look for high value women too . The most attractive women are the most desirable . Does that mean that men are hypergamous too ?
You know that's a good point. I'm thinking from an organizational perspective, but he may be entirely separate from that. I'd imagine Talbot would do well in San Jose. 
This is not what is happening with Sherri Shephard at all. Shepherd and her husband agreed together to hire a surrogate and use donor eggs to have a child. AFTER the surrogate was already pregnant, Shepherd and husband's marriage fell apart, and now she doesn't want to pay child support or be listed on the birth certificate. It's a completely different situation because in that case, there is already a baby that needs support. 
The main problem was the heavy rainfall that occurred on the first night of the festival. Second day of the fest, it was a muddy mess, everyone was sinking into the mud. That said, rainfall was not the fault of the festival organizers, and they probably had a specific budget for helping repair the landscape. They helped where they could, the rest of it is the responsibility of the city. 
Haha yes! That goes for anyone in before mid 2000's. Although I did like the book study because there was one host family that would always feed everyone after.
My dad. When he got divorced we moved out together and although the house was all in boxes the only thing we set up was the stereo so we could blast his old records through the house so loudly you could feel the vibration. He then attempted to cook every meal we had on the bbq as that was the only cooking appliance he knew how to use. Love you dad. 
Alright, who left the blue box open for this dinosaur to creep in and get transported to this time to write this? It's like a modern day puritan and shitty stand up comic fucked and the ill-begotten conception was this pile of shit. "~~Life~~ Hack" more like it.

I think the stock sniper loadout is quite good for PvE if you don't want to risk wasting your motes. Maybe glimmer farm to buy another one to play around with?
Maccagnan blew it. This doesn't mean that Wilkerson is safe, on the contrary he's setting the stage to make the case that he is obsolete. They should have traded the pick. I wonder what offers he turned down. We'll never know unfortunately if there was something reasonable on the table, but using the full clock on the pick means he was trying to work something out.
I know right?  I had a good laugh at that.  I was frustrated that I stepped on the audio of him saying that, but it was still pretty clear, so I used it in the cut :P
yo. i think i can help, but the explanations are in-depth and lengthy. im currently helping a handful of guys from reddit - using instant messenger such as a fake facebook account. id be happy to lend a hand if youre interested. cheers
Input and output should be equal (otherwise the lake would shrink/grow until they were equal). Just remember to consider where the streams are coming from (typically from mountains).
Unfortunately, it seems a lot of people didn't like the video. Not sure if my voice will be heard, but I really liked it.A lot of people here are complaining about this "angry mob writeoff" where these guys label everyone who disagreed as a part of this mob. But in reality, the whole thing WAS a giant kneejerk reaction. Perhaps "angry mob" is hyperbole, but the whole thing was dramatised and blown out of proportion.Well done TB on the only real intelligent discussion I have seen emerge as a result of this insanity.
Don't worry; I just sent mine on Tuesday. I had no idea how expensive shipping was! Wish I had sent it earlier so I could go for a cheaper shipping option. 
I will PM you about this.  Can I ask you though, do you work for public or private school?  What other concerns are there about going to Korea I should think of?
Depending on who you ask you get slightly different answers. The main point is that they want to simulate "god" coming to earth with holograms in the sky and using vlf and ulf frequencies have him speak to people. Different regions of the world, different god, but same concept. "god" comes to people in the sky, tells them to follow (insert NWO leader here) as their new leader. It's the will of god obviously...
To date I have earned $3,500 on Fiverr over about 2 years. I don't really try to hard at it though. I have only ever had two gigs up at one time and I never did any type of marketing whatsoever.
I live in Sweden, I'm so lost here on this internet road that I'm not sure if it's you or me who is the tourist. But in the metaphor, the help you can give me is unfortunately not the one I need. But thank you nice stranger.
Chief,My husband's dream goal is to get a degree in Thermodynamics/Physics.  He wants to be one of those people that studies energy and tries to create an alternative energy source that won't harm the environment (better than wind/water power, and a lot safer than oil/fossil power).He has the smarts to be a Physicist in the lab, in fact, that's what he wants.  But he's also incredibly computer savvy, if he's not gonna be in a lab, I guess he'll be okay with something computer-related.I know the Navy has an awesome Physics/Energy laboratory in Washington DC.  But what we don't know is what path can he take to get there?  We checked out some of the Navy careers they have available (he wants to stay the full 20-30 years and get that PhD), and the closest thing was the Nuclear Energy program.Is it similar?  If not, what would be the closest program he can take that will take him down the Physicist path?  
Really, really bad grammar mistakes. Like stupidly bad. IGN posted the other week "I'm cried" and "I'm cried too" just...what the hell man...what the hell...
Hey traveler_x, thanks for sharing my article here!I want to also point out that my intention isn't to change people's viewpoints to one of poly or even open relationships - simply to change the way they relate to another by being completely clear and honest. It equally applies to monogamy as well.
My dad got me a plastic bench/barbell set when I was about 5 or 6 or so, something similar to this: http://www.amazon.com/Redmon-Fitness-Exercise-Equipment-Kids/dp/B001404UMO.  It was also in the basement next to his real set, so we could both knock out some bench press reps together.  [This](https://instagram.com/p/1BAOR5Ra2Z/) is also both adorable and amazing (slightly off topic).  
It should literally cost the equivalent amount of oranges it takes to make a carton plus the labor to juice, package, and ship it to the nearest distributor to you.See?I correctly used the word "literally" in a sentence.You can too with a little knowledge about vocabulary and the definitions there within.I would have calculated how much it should actually cost, but apparently you can not just look up how much any given orange costs in Florida.
Aaaaand now it's Thanksgiving. Maybe this episode is trying to make up for the fact that the first three seasons were one calendar year. At this rate, in an hour we'll be in late 2050. 
Whoa. Good point, even with the sarcasm. If the government is hell bent on treating being a woman as a disability which requires a full time escort (which they are with this statement) then they can pay for every woman to employ a full time caregiver! Also, if I am "disabled" in the eyes of the government, I would like to quit my nice productive job and collect disability. Since I'm "disabled" I should at least be given the benefits I deserve! /s

I'd recommend Ubuntu since it generally has the most support, is relatively simple to use, and really any problem can just be googled. But I'm extremely biased towards my dear Ubuntu.
As someone working in the recycling buissness I have to agree, at least in scandinavia, they are getting off way to easy. There is a suprising amount of people trying to make a quick buck doing this sort of thing.
Labels are used specifically to give someone an idea of what you identify with or as so they can make these conclusions. A poorly applied label is a bad thing, but if you aren't in favor of a socialist society, then you don't want to vote for someone identifying as a socialist.

Not usually, but I will definitely do this with a baked potato because it's all about the condiments. I like mine with half a tbs. of butter, 1/4 cup of spicy red salsa, and green onions (or, 1 tbs of ranch dressing, sriracha, and lots of black pepper).

Man I remember my 386 had a turbo button that jumped that sucker from 10 Mhz to 20 Mhz!  I had to turn the turbo off to play the DOS pinball game I had or it would play impossibly fast lol.  Then, I got this awesome pinball game called "Android" and it played normal no matter what setting.  Oh man, I spent so much time on that pinball game...

What do you mean when you say dominant, they won CCS but that is the only tournament they've made a significant splash in. Thorins rankings incorporate a broader perspective than just the most recent results to prevent teams yoyo-ing up and down the rankings. Otherwise NiP would be higher than EnVy for example and we know that is not true at this point.
Islam threatens you with burning for not being a Muslim. Are you scared of their version of burning? Are the Christians you talk to scared of their version of burning? What kind of loving being burns the people he loves anyway? Christians try to say, "Well people choose it." First off, we don't, but even if we did, could you burn a loved one of yours if they asked you to? I couldn't. I'd say, "No, that's horrible, I'm not going to set you on fire." Apparently God isn't as empathetic as I am?
Halp! On April 10th I was gifted an Attack on Titan bracelet but I can't find the gifted post and it didn't come with a gift note. Could someone help me locate the gifted post so I can post a thank you?

For the OP: Selling someone's else property with only a verbal agreement is very risky. For others: This may be stolen property. The type of people who are likely to bail-out on some renting/roommate agreement are the type of people that can't afford to gift expensive stuff. 
I was always in good health, ran a ton (40-50 miles a week on trails) and shit like that, but I remember the thing that got me lifting was watching Stargate SG-1 and seeing Christopher Judge's traps. That might sound retarded, but that's what changed me forever.

When my ex would cry, it literally killed me. Seeing him upset and hurting was awful and I hated it, and it happened very infrequently. But sometimes it felt like his lack of emotions, or his emotions surfacing in anger were harder on him than just crying for a while would be. Like, why not just let it out the way it wants to come out? I guess I'm just 100% into letting tears happen if they're there, and I guess it is just more universally accepted for me to cry than a dude... but it seems like it kinda sucks not letting it out.
If that was tough, I definitely wouldn't recommend "Irreversible" by the same director. There's like a 7 minute long relentless continuous shot of a very graphic forcible rape. It like seriously made me sick to watch. Def found myself apologizing profusely to my girlfriend for subjecting her to it.
Your edit sounds about right. There's a kid in one of my classes this year who is, as I have put it to my fellow teachers, profoundly stupid. Like, I am amazed that he has made it to 17 years old without killing himself somehow. It's terrifying to think that he can vote next year.
Satanists &gt; Muslims, believe me, Muslims cause more fear in me than satanists. Europe would be a much safer place if all the immigrants were satanists instead of muslims.

I used thick gauge copper wire (found buried), which I hammered into a point then hammered into a pithy wood to make a handle. I traded someone for an antler, I also see them in antique stores. Smooth sedimentary rocks by river beds, rocky beaches. I mostly used beer bottoms to knap, but I also found six large nodules of obsidian by an old volcanic flow out west. 
The camera in Mario 64 is garbage, and we all know it.  Mario 64 remains my favorite 3D Mario game by a long shot, but even I know that the camera is ridiculously bad.

My brother-in-law's brilliant response to this from one of my sisters while they were dating: He rang her doorbell the next morning and cheerfully handed her a hamper full of "her" laundry. 
Any answer you get to this would be speculative, so let's speculate.Presumably, putting in a bigger "screen" would be doable.  From looking at the pictures, it seems there is plenty of space without significantly changing the design.Now, they are probably using "off the shelf" components on this, especially given it is a prototype in limited quantity.  If so, they could very well be planning on a larger screen on the production model.Source: I'm a programmer who knows absolutely nothing about prototyping and fabrication

I'm not gonna argue or anything, but you do realize it happens in the animal kingdom too, right? And it's not harmful, it's not something you can change etc. You're entitled to your opinion of course but maybe consider if the hatred might be too much considering they don't hurt anyone. Daring to misplace your love doesn't sound like the worse thing in the world, at least not to me. 
As someone who has backed a lot of Kickstarters, and who also has a lot of respect for the designers involved, I nonetheless have no interest in this project. It's just far too little detail, far too many potential problems, and far too long a time period.I think there are individual designers involved that, if they had done their own campaign for "here's a vague idea for a game, trust me to make it happen", it's highly likely I'd have backed. But, 9 unknown games from 9 designers isn't a selling point to me -- it's a giant red flag.
The PM is an idiot for even trying to persuade the Indonesians one way or another. Politically it was never going to work, and Abbott should have known it. Where is his outrage over the many Australian citizens on death row in China? Australia is constantly humiliated by Abbott.

It's not on your list but if you can find it, Espolon. They have a blanco that is good for mixers and a reposado that is a nice sipper. It's usually around $20-25 US and is one of the best "bangs for the buck" out there.
Of course... That wasn't my point at all. the fact that their insightful comments are hidden is what gives me grief. I'm not saying that we should take verified peoples predictions as law, but it would be nice to maybe have a conversation with them instead of wading through the bullshit first.

Unfortunately I've done this on many occasions, but it was a long time ago so the shame factor has disappeared.  I mentioned this one before.    I was at my university departments semester ending party - got black out drunk.  Woke up in the morning a few classrooms over from where we had the party and there was this perfectly formed shit that was about a foot from my head.    Not sure if it was mine, but wouldn't have been unusual if it had been - went through a period of BO shitting.    Got up (this was morning around 9 am) looked around - no one there, and just quietly booked out of there - didn't mention a fucking thing to anyone.    Later, we were banned from having anymore parties on campus (had to have them off-campus). I often wonder if that had something to do with it.

Sam Ficken. He may not get drafted but damn am I proud of him. He was getting death threats after the Virginia game in 2012 and now very well may end up on an NFL team. Kid never let the naysayers get him down and battled back to become a reason Penn State was winning games. Also used the power of the Jeter locker to hit a walk off PAT to end his college career only months after Jeter hit a walk off single to end his. Kid is a fighter. 
That is way, way more than "just" enough fuel to get back. I've returned from orbit on like 5 units of fuel. All you need to do is burn directly over the Apoapsis, and as long as your periapsis dips into the atmosphere (under 70Km), you'll eventually fall out of orbit due to air friction. Just a tip!

Ironically he might get that trade but not for the reason he wanted.Nobody thinks Mariotta should start right away, and Mettenberger is already afraid for his job? If he can't beat out Mariotta in camp he deserves nothing more than a backup gig.

Thankfully the girl was fairly small so the ensuing tumble wasn't as hard as it could have been.**The pair hit the ground, the  orange and grey cap on the boy's head isnt so lucky though, the bells on the three tails jingling as it hits the ground. The rest of his outfit matches of course, a diamond pattern alternating in a vibrant orange and a dull grey, the pants colored the latter. He groans a little as he sits up on his forearms, the girl splayed out on top of him* "Why hello there my dear, you know, if you wanted another hug, you needed only ask" *He'd hoped to get the mood a fair bit lighter than their last meeting, so natually jumping down in front of her while she was going full speed was a good idea.*
That's the usual answer, and lifting is great and all,  but is it really a good suggestion to tell someone who is 300lbs to do SL5x5 while losing weight right off the bat? Isn't it better to get at a lower weight first? Doesn't that risk injury?
This is 2.0 because I previously posted with a similar build, but with /u/extremelylazy 's help, I was able to pick slightly better parts. I just want to know if the parts I chose will work with my intentions.

Fortunately I didn't pay for either.

Sounds very utopian. The basic income is appealing at first because it seems reasonable and practical. A more efficient way of providing a basic standard living to those who aren't making enough themselves. Then when you get deeper into you get all these utopian visions of a world where machines to all the hard work and the rest of get to spend our days being creative and living our dreams. I don't know. Sounds cool, but I just don't think utopia is that easy.
yeah, that album got expensive...i had the benefit of picking up a lot of stuff nice and early. i started listening to NIN in '99, and NIN records were some of the *very first* vinyl i started collecting. i think "things falling apart" may have been the third record i bought new, and "the fragile" was somewhere in my first 50 or so.so that saved me a lot of money. i had to shell out of some of the back catalog, though, and there's just a *ton* of variants of the PHM era stuff.
If you can't see a dr then if you feel a "pocket" of squishy area (relative to the rest of the ear) then you could drain it with a syringe. To avoid more fluid build up reduce contact with the ear (protector) and person dependent you may need to stay off the mat until the soreness in the ear goes away. 
Catalan has 8 different vowel sounds using the same 5 letters and it's overall pronunciation is a fair bit harder than Spanish (example: each 'a' in "casa" has a different sound). It should be easy to understand written catalan for any spaniard, though, or at least the overall idea of the text :P
Or he could install a ceiling fan that vents outside since he is remodeling, probably better than open window, since thats not always viable/comfortable
I have the new 13". Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, Portal 2, Civ 5 all run fine. Can't max out settings though. With my n64 emulator and a high res texture pack I get lowish framerates, but with the default textures it does fine. If you do very light gaming, or older games, you'll be fine. If you want to run anything more modern or taxing, wait for the 15" refresh and grab the discrete graphics option.I've used a 15" before, and the extra size and weight really doesn't make a whole lot of difference, for me at least.

I agree with the top comment. Smoking anything is harmful weed is no different. Get into vaporizing or make edibles. Vaporizing is a lot healthier than smoking but it still isn't healthy you get what I mean? And edibles that's your tummy not your lungs. But if you get a vaporizer you can also make edibles with your vaped weed so 2 uses in 1 but your burps and farts might reek of weed for that day.
The problem with those orders is that when the verb or Aux moves up to T position, that slot is now filled. You can't move anything else without incorporating it (something like "Havegone I to the store"). Now, you could explain it that there's double movement, Aux &gt; T &gt; C, then V &gt; Aux &gt; T. But then you run into problems with questions. But you could just inflect your auxiliary to reflect that it's a question or use a different one. Same deal with subclauses. You'd need a different word order.

It is one, its called *Garrity*.In *Garrity v. New Jersey*, the U.S. Supreme Court established some straight forward rules regarding situations in which police officers are compelled to provide statements to their employers.Under *Garrity*, an incriminating statement obtained from an officer who is compelled to provide the statement under the threat of job loss if the officer invokes the right to remain silent may not be used against the officer in a criminal proceeding. The court found that such a statement is deemed coerced if the officer is denied a meaningful opportunity to assert Fifth Amendment rights. The court reasoned that it is unacceptable to put an officer in the position of choosing whether to self-incriminate or to risk job loss for invoking the Fifth Amendment.
So what is the actual content? Is it anything I can't get elsewhere? If it is, I'm going to be pissed. You wouldn't like me when I'm pissed. I lose all sense of balance and reason.
I mean, a Hull E doesn't exactly have facilities to resupply, repair, or even board and properly launch ships that it would have in cargo. Not to mention the crates aren't exactly well-protected. Like I said in another comment, every step of the process from getting a pilot in a ship and a ship out of a crate would be awkward and clumsy, not efficient at all. The trade off being that a Hull-series ship is significantly easier to get than a "real" carrier.A dedicated fighter attachment would probably mean avoiding that whole problem. It would probably make boarding, resupplying, and launching (and protecting?) them much easier. Not to mention, and this is just speculation here, that you probably get more individual fighters in less space if you use an attachment like that.
I live on the 12th story of a building in a pretty big city (detroit). i was told by sprint that 3 of the 4 towers were down in my area. they also told me i was too high to get good quality service. use to get 2 or 3 dropped calls per phone call. i switched to verizon and have have 2 to 3 every 6 months.    why is sprint so much worse?     what are they doing wrong with their technology?     what is verizon doing differently?     can you post a go pro video of you blasting the bees with a fire and maybe a b4 shot of all the gear used to go into battle?

I concur.But foremost I think you are approaching your argument with too broad a brush. An individual would likely have to be entirely sociopathic to not approach each instance individually.* Would it make sense to debate household members on mundane topics until it becomes too heated? Not likely.* Would it make sense to debate a sensitive topic that a removed friend or family member says publicly? Possibly.Also not to mention that not everyone outside the ENTP personality type is unable to appreciate objective debate, so it's unlikely this behavior would cause an individual to become entirely isolated socially.In reflection, personally, my immediately family appreciates my approach, I have more frequent interactions so daily life is comfortable. Positive, regular interactions here and there with other people have been on the up lately.

Wow, I was watching that listing too, but figured I didn't need another pistol.1. You require a metal outer barrel, no ifs, ands or buts. You will also need to RTV silicone it to the hopup chamber - green gas is notorious for shearing the nubs within the chamber if the outer barrel is not properly secure.2. Blowback is nice, but be careful where you use green gas in it. I highly don't suggest summer usage or dry firing a lot - I blew off the fronts of two Guarder slides.3. Don't, whatever you do, buy the Creation inner metal frame. Makes the slide blow apart much worse.Past that, it's an AMAZING pistol. It's TM's first GBB that used the newer large diameter nozzle. Just be careful; the 5-7 hype has died down, so aftermarket/replacement parts are starting to get a bit harder to find.

When my husband first immigrated to Canada from China, he actually joined a church despite being atheist. He didn't speak English well, and these people were friendly and actually talked to him and showed an interest in him, unlike most Canadians, so he got to practice his English. Community and belonging are the big reasons why immigrants join churches. Churches actually "prey" on this, and actively try to recruit immigrants because they know how vulnerable they are. 
I mean. Eleven that matter. But another nine that will still ruin someones day.EDIT: crap, accidentally double posted. Forgive me, oh mighty hivemind, and my phone's struggle to understand that I really meant to submit the first time.
Keep in mind he sent those spies, and most of the 60s in the government were barred from doing anything and the council and secretaries controlled everything
The other links people have posted are great and you should go read those. I wanted to add that a lot of philosophies and paradigms and ways of thinking about MTG don't apply to Netrunner.Economy in Netrunner is persistent, which is a HUGE difference. You can have a huge board advantage, dump all of your resource into scoring/stealing an agenda and now you have no board presence at all, opening a window for your opponent to score. That's not how MTG works. When you get an advantage in MTG, you press it and now you have a bigger advantage. In Netrunner you invest into your infrastructure, but there's a constant back and forth of who has money and who has a window to score that doesn't end until the game ends.
the customer service is important to me, but price is also a big deal. considering I don't have a large down payment. I'll look them up though. edit: holy cow $689 processing fee?!?!
I'd say this is an example of Strine, the archaic form of the Australian dialect popularised in Crocodile Dundee. An example of the modern dialect (Strayan) could go:"Oi cunt me and Jaydo were gonna rock up to City Beach for some sick Element flatbrims but no joke there's like fukken a hundred Lebs there, right, and they're full on starting us like 'oi bru we will fukken bash you ay' and we're like 'yeah nah fuck off ya leb cunts'. Fucken most hectic day, ay
I forgot that was a problem. I did see someone else make a post on an ignore list integration where you can pick words to block and it will block the entire phrase if that specific word is in it. Seems like a relatively easy solution. (I'm not a programmer and probably wrong)Edit: Good point though.
Yes for general elections. For the primaries, it depends on who else is running. I have great respect for Hillary Clinton, although I do not agree with some of her policies. But what politician is 100% agreeable? I heard her basically tell a male politician to sit down and let the new age of gender equality come forward and it was pretty inspirational. 
Yeah as we can tell from the Jets who took him at a position where they already have 2 pro bowlers. I am sure they had a ton of people knocking on their doors also.
I thought Rito said that Chromas were going to be part of the mastery thing once it releases, and that they released it early for RP for reasons I don't remember.
&gt;Another Tumblr gender bullshit?It's a recognized thing, people just don't know about it. It's the same concept as asexual, where people don't experience sexual attraction, just with gender, they don't experience the feeling of being a certain gender.
"While Pixar movies cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Rogen and crew are making Sausage Party for under $20 million. But just because they are making the film on a budget doesn’t mean it will look cheap — Rogen insists it will look like a polished Pixar movie"Um, yeah, good luck with that.

I agree with you completely. I know that even if I got an extender I could cause other people issues, which I do not want to do, but they said that was the next step. I have tried many times to seek other solutions, but they say there aren't any. I asked them to contact the owner of the extender, but they said they don't know where it is or who it belongs to, which makes no sense to me. I know for a fact the extender is causing the issue because it pops up on my phone when I make a call that I am on an extender and gives me the two beeps to indicate it. I am just done trying to fight with them and would rather leave if that is how the company treats loyal customers.
Immaculate conception in christian dogma refers to the conception of Mary, not that of Jesus. Immaculate conception is conception without "original sin", not conception without sex. (not a believer; just saying).
I love make up and master it by practice and youtube/instagram. I think it's a cool idea! I'd love to share my knowledge and learn new. I won't go to classes though, but PM me if you want a makeup buddy =) 
I've looked into it but have yet to find anything that suits my needs. I'd imagine location plays a huge factor in all of this as well. Small town is only going to have so many people interested in paying for something like that.My local one is more or less an electronics shop at this point. Circuit boards, basic 3D printing, etc. Almost every tool that could be useful to me (nice table saw, planer, jointer, band saw, etc.) are on the wish list and have been there for some time. I think funds and organization are huge hurdles to clear when starting these things up. How to keep tenants responsible. Who's liable for equipment damage or personal injury.
I think that was definitely the intent in the beginning, but when you think about it, X-Men works far better as an allegory for homosexuality.Some kids are just born different, even when both of their parents and all their siblings are "normal," and they're automatically outcasts for it. These differences can go unnoticed for years but start manifesting themselves as the child reaches puberty. Some of the more reactionary political figures try to find a cure for these differences. I think you're right in that X-Men started as an allegory for racial discrimination, but the gay connection, I think, works way, way better, which is why some X-Men media has drifted in that direction as the franchise has aged, e.g., the Iceman coming out scene in X2.
Well, we should be careful about just how "general" your "general polynomial question" is. Everyone answering so far is assuming that your polynomial is defined over a field. (If you don't know what that means, then your polynomial is almost certainly defined over a field, and you can ignore the rest of this. I'm guessing that's the case, but it's good to be careful.)If your polynomial is only defined over a ring, then this result can be false. For example, the polynomial x^2 - 1 has four roots in Z/8.
Hows the invidia q300's? Is it the right fitment for the 2015's? Also how much louder is it? I've watched many videos, but can never tell, really. People say it's a little bit louder than stock, but HOW much louder? How much louder is it in the cabin? How much louder is it outside? Cause, I wanna be able to hear my exhaust, but at the same time be able to hold a conversation without destroying peoples ears, you know? Much insight would be helpful! Thanks! I was also looking at the Nameless Exhausts, but idk how much louder those are also. The struggle is real lol
How do you know that?  I once tried to start a referral website and went through an agency because I was too lazy to do all the work myself.  I was supposed to choose all the content and the agent asked me why I was excluding gay content.  I told her I had no interest in including that on the site and she insisted gay content makes huge money.  I never followed through with the site.That all I know about that market, but for all I know, she probably was making a commission.  IDK.
What's 1 divided by 2? Happened 3 days ago when I was helping a fellow class mate, we are enrolled in a telecommunications program. I had trouble responding. 
One recurring complaint of all the Souls games is having to redo the area from the lamp/bonfire anytime you die.  Often that has the side effect of making you burn through all your hard-earned comsumables.   I can see that as a valid turnoff.
1.35 million... I get quarterly checks based on how much above my quarterly target I was. It didn't push me that much further above my target. I netted a 6k bonus that quarter (which included another 1-2 mil of miscellaneous sales).
No, the majority go through the center. One of the devs has said they might tweak the NPCs and docking computers to follow the green side, but it probably won't be until 1.3
Yeah. On English lessons today we were watching a video blog about American vs British accents and in the background there was Totoro. Both of us recognized it - she loves Miyazaki films (and perhaps anime too)! We also tried to translate what was written in the background there, but I haven't translated it so far. I'll post it on the Japanese language subreddit later. Our teachers are pretty awesome.
Better results in regards with what? Body recomp, weight loss, muscle gains?A decent protein intake is almost mandatory to a healthy diet, but the other two macros can be much more flexible.  Then there's the issue of dietary fiber which is a core element of a healthy diet.For an average dieter, increasing fiber would probably the best single piece of advice I could give.
Interesting.I'm actually wondering if I can switch points over to VIT in mid-combat and summon Titan as a Summoner, becoming a kind-of surrogate tank in mid combat if things go sour. Could be real.Another thing--Ifrit's skills and attacks are based on the Summoner strength stat, right? What if I were to switch Int over to Strength and summon Ifrit? Then switch back to Int again. Would Ifrit retain those extra strength values? 
I looked it up out of curiosity.  Zombies was so hot we were trying to give people content they were interested in.All I can say in my defense is that we never made that mistake again. 
I also finished all of the dungeons a few days ago, but if there were no stamina, I would've done it on my schedule, not theirs. That's worth some coin to me.
At this point I don't think that they will be in the show. There's no way they could fit them in with all the current characters they are introducing this season.
&gt; Hell, my mice actively resist putting on weight on a high calorie dietCould you better explain that. Are the mice eating less due to higher caloric content? More active?
This is so so so so weird. So he's trying to brand himself as a do gooder? He's doing this campaign to help everyone out? Does he really think people will believe that bullshit? 
Haha, I am a crank when it comes to grants. I've written over 300 of them. Success has favored established and successful companies. It's almost like you shouldn't need the money to win a grant.It's very true that writing proposals make you sharper. The funders don't want fiction--they ask specific questions and make you do real work (like making a budget, involving partners). Having collaborators and a history of success are incredibly important, but that's hard to do. Takes more work than writing.If you take the attitude that it's a learning experience, then you will succeed no matter the outcome. You can repurpose the proposal and pitch to others. 
Iowa alum and current DC resident here.  Scherff is an awesome guy.  May have been a *bit* of a reach at 5, but honestly not by much.  Excited to see him here next year!
there is a clue in his answer: "The best feeling to remember that you look like **a** sperm..." I don't know about you guys, but I don't see myself having "a" sperm.
That's not the fucking point of this post, you dingle. No part of my post is talking about high level competitive play. The comment is sexist bullshit, period. Don't try to defend it.
Bros, this is great! The best way to get respect from the patriarchy is to elevate the attractive white members of our subgroup while suppressing the voices of everyone else! All I can dream of is that someday I too will be muscular and masculine enough to deserve equal rights! And if you're advocating for the rights of trans people who aren't thin, able-bodied, or binary-gendered, maybe you should stop that. You're like, holding back the movement. Come on. Nobody's gonna like us if we hang out with the weird kids. 
I remember playing a zombie type custom game where two of the elephants were suspended like 100 ft in the air. So much fun haha. Man I miss playing this game.
The way I see it, the team shouldn't have to ask for it, because that comes off as them wanting to sell more jerseys. It should just "become a thing" naturally, but in our case it can't because we've had too many different colour schemes.
Also, there are lots of people preparing for the start of next semester if they aren't in classes over the summer. Even then, a lot of students participate in summer internships/co-ops as well. So I would imagine there's still a good amount of activity.
So what you are saying is that the request for pilgrims to identify their sect has nothing to do with the sunni/shia violence in Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain? That there is no history of sectarian violence during the Hajj? That the Saudi states have a long history of welcoming Shia's into Mecca and Medina (for Hajj and Imam pilgrimage)?This change is not because of some statistical curiosity. Even the Pakastani agency in charge of Hajj visas say so. 
Not to be a jerk but at $250 you are quite a bit above retail... [PC has it at $200 CiB](http://videogames.pricecharting.com/game/playstation/the-misadventures-of-tron-bonne) and the game often sells in the $150 - $175 area too. Your also not paying ebay fees on here... So when you say "I just want it gone" then maybe you should consider a fair price for selling it here..
I'm trying to fast-track my degree, so that means I'm in school over the Summer. I have classes through the first week in June, then a week and a half off before I start all over again. I am taking a week off for a family vacation early on in Summer quarter (don't tell!)... Can. Not. Wait.

Those numbers code for chipsets, explained in [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gfA3H5XTAE)You'd want to go with either an H97 or Z97 chipset, since those are the most recent. There's also X99, but that only supports i7 Extreme processors, which are very expensive ($400-$1000). Z97 motherboards allow you to overclock your CPU, but only CPUs with a K in front of them (like the i5 4690K or the i7 4790K). H97 boards don't let you overclock.

I have attended many frat parties, and drank more then I should have at most, but rape occurs everywhere. You should be more worried about the random stranger that buys you a beer at a bar than a frat parties beer. First of all the beer is either canned or in a keg. They often have some sort of punch though, but I have never heard of anyone spiking it with anything other than alcohol. There was actually a case of a girl that was roofied at a frat party, but it was by a guy that wasn't in the frat, and picked the girl out and slipped it in her drink. You either attend a really shady school, or are just repeating horror stories you were told via word of mouth. No frat has beer in a manner that could be spiked. Like I said, it's either canned or kegged. The punch however, I could see some girls being sketched out. A standard bar has a higher chance of rape than a frat party though. 
I finished my last day at school today so I'm about to graduate later this month. I also had a job interview two days ago and I'll get an answer from that next week. Growing up and becoming "an adult" feels a bit strange.
I'm happy to watch it play out and as an Alonso fan I'm hoping it goes well. Your fancy metaphor doesn't change the fact that if they only have one car running last race they've really made little or know progress since round one.There is the distinct possibility that their design may never pay off.  There's is also the possibility that the engine could be ok, but Mcarens chassis is a dud, they underperformed last year with the best engine. 
Man, that video started out pretty out there but the guy gets deep into the stuff. Enjoyed the video! OP I would recommend you listen to it atleast once.
I feel like people assume Zetterberg and Pav came out the gate with 80-90 point seasons. They didn't. It took 2-3 seasons before they really hit their stride. People just need to calm down and give them a bit more time.
a friend of mine basically does that sans chatroom shenanigans in his mom's basement, but with her knowledge. she hates him and all, but apparently is some kind of self-harming sadist and just lets him wallow in laziness in her basement. sometimes i sit and reflect on just how many people in this country basically just exist in a parents' basement with only the internet for company.
Why is discussing rational self interest in anyone other than ourselves nonsensical? I don't quite get that. My main point is it's a little silly for people to say "poor people should just move to where the land is cheaper and commute!" because THAT IS exactly what people do most of the time when that course of action makes sense. 
That's how I survive. My issue stems from the fact that I'm 30 and the shows are usually filled with really rude 19 year olds who are drunk beyond belief and drugged up. 
When your son or daughter meets the person of their dreams - it's bittersweet.You're thankful they've met someone special, and at the same time, you hate to turn over "control" to someone new who you barely know, hoping that things will turn out for the very best.You work a lifetime leading up to that moment, and then it comes - he or she has a new life with their partner-of-choice, and parents take on a different role, as supporters more than guiders.Bittersweet, yet wonderful.

It was done in prefab sections where the concrete was cured. The 19 days is just assembly on site, which is a bit disingenuous to claim when they spent months actually making the sections.
Duh. Did you think that I hadn't researched my decision or given it any thought? I guess that is how most people do things... that's not how I do things.
What do you mean history in Denver? That he assembled one of the deepest teams that won 57 games without an allstar? You cant assign their success to merely having HCA. When they finally came along they were upset by a really fucking great warriors team. They were full of young players and set for the future until that pathetic ownership fired Karl.   and Toronto as people mentioned he hasnt been able to do anything with it. Kyle Lowry is injured in the playoffs but you should remember he is still a legit all star and will have great trade value. Who's the last FA Toronto was able to attract?
I have a possible motive - credits go to someone else in this comment section (find and up vote them, really good suggestion!)His motive originally could have been to basically threaten the owner into selling. He could have done the first kill (the puppet) way back when when it was a diner, because he saw potential in the franchise. This lead to them not being able to cope with rumors of the murder, and they failed. Purple Guy then rebranded to Fazbear Entertainment and moved shop to a new locale. But something changed in purple guy. He liked to kill children. So, he used the store as a front. A successful one that children loved.And he carried out his plan.Edit; /u/King-Of-Zing
My bf's little half brother is about 10, and definitely has something wrong with him. He'll go into a rage against his disabled (fused spine) mother and hit her. They've tried to take him to professionals cause his behavior just isn't normal but they've all basically said he's a little boy and there's nothing they can do.

&gt; How many times have people just AFK'd or quit mid game? It happens multiple times a day for me.You fail to mention how many finish the game. Just because a minority, fair enough a big number, it doesn't degrade that MM should be within everything.  I think if you had a choice to solo NF or matchmake with randoms in the hope someone isn't there then so be it. Quit the game, start again. I have a raid team so numbers aren't a problem for me, but I hate when people say they aren't raiders because they can't find a raid team. They are the best part of the game and people are missing out. It will be hard to maintain a set group over the raid but over time you will meet new people and eventually build your own fireteam.
I got a Mutation X clone (before people jump down my throat, it's a tobeco and I got it for less than $5) and I was curious if I could run a single coil on it rather than always using a dual coil. Thanks!
i wonder if they have 32 jerseys ready with all the names and someone shouts out.. JETS!! and maybe the groups are split in 5 groups or so and the one with JETS .. passes it up forward.. #justsayin
Had a team with Phoenix, Storm, QoP, Lesh, and a CM. Got out to a huge lead, then instead of pushing everyone went afk to farm Octarine Cores. Very nearly threw. 
Any idea what the cause of this is? Is he perhaps hiding something himself? Did you do something terrible in the past that gives him reason to mistrust you? Does he have money problems and you're the pot of gold to carry him out? This is a control issue: you are punished to stay downstairs til you say sorry, cos he's the boss! That's not how partners deal with eachother, one is allowed privacy and personal space. His immaturity to hear you is destroying your relationship. Why does he get to be the dramaqueen?Something else seems to be going on that's making him paranoid. You can't make him stop, because you're not the person with the problem here. He is.

&gt; And i will be the first to say fuck everything about 'private party lists' when it come to having a democratic process that is founded on regional representation.&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; MMP was denied twice because it's fucked. This is why I favour the MMP system used in Germany, I forget which state currently, that does not use party lists, and the proportional seats are assigned to candidates who ran for a riding in the election and lost the most narrowly.
I don't understand why people complain about devs balancing a SP game.If you don't care about balance, just set the difficulty the lowest and blow everything up by looking at it.Those of us playing on Hard &amp; POTD, balance matters. Including class balance.
Cops hate is real. According to people on internet cops are fking evil. Especially on /news. Almost every story is against law enforcement. This here sounds like the cop jumped the fence to shoot the doggie in the back. Everyone knows they can get their 15 minutes of fame this way. 
&gt; lol, at your butt-hurt reply. &gt; I asked your stance and you got angry. Get some therapy edgelord!&gt; You seem like a stupid angry cunt. Your first reply was an image. Are you 14? bahahahaha.So, now that you're done name calling, you might answer my question - what's your point in all of this? 
Definitely stepping up his game when it matters.I love the way he reads the play, and uses his energy and speed as a young guy. He sort of floats around, looking for interceptions, and covering passing lanes at both ends.If he turns over the puck or if theres a break out he can turn on the jets.I reeeally like his goal in the last game. He used his speed perfectly, by not just going full out, he skated as fast as he needed to maintain a passing lane and shooting lane for when he got the puck. Definitely a showing of great hockey IQ.
I saw him on an askreddit? thread, and saw his name. I wanted to see if he made his account on 12-20-2014, and he did, but I also saw he was a mod of this sub. I then went there, saw his "welcome" post, and then made a post. This was on 30th december 2014 iircAlso the sidebar used to be different, and said something about North Korea? i think
*Raises hand* - grew up in a fatlogic-heavy home on the standard American diet.  It's taken me a good portion of my adult life to overcome my own bullshit but I'm getting there.  It's sad to think about what my parents are missing by not taking proper care of themselves.
It's weird. It's been 30 days since I pressed, and every day the color purple looks better and better. I sometimes look at purple and just go "wow, what a beautiful color." It's just so bright and beatiful.
Not sure about thr chords however the solo is fairly easy. I can play it and I'm in no way a amazing guitar player. It's fairly linear, if that makes sense. Basically one string if memory serves correctly.  Give it a whirl and good luck!
I briefly looked there because of their warranty. Do you see any that look worth checking out?They all look pretty generic/kiddy, (at least not for the ones i saw) not even close to the caliber of quality on a GoRuck or 5.11. Did you see anything like the GR or 5.11 from LL Bean?
wait so why isnt she okay with you doing it if it is giving you that drive to be better in school, be a better son, boyfriend, skater, and be happy and stress free? 
That was my first thought! She is obviously angling for another baby, because "everybody else says..." so her husband should probably brace himself for an oops.
It's not quantum theory, but it often requires technical knowledge that most people don't have. Are you experienced in 3D modelling? High-end mathmatics and programming? No? Then you can't hang with the high-end mod crew.

It's also hilariously impossible to take it serious. The banana saying "No stop don't eat me please, no, ahhhhh!" Along with the woman's even more terrible acting. It's too good.
I didn't look at the thumbnail and presumed this was from /r/tsunderesharks before I clicked it. It was disappointing when the statue was neither a shark nor a tsundere.
I think the stupidest thing about this is that it would have had almost no effect at all. It was utterly pointless.Sure it made them *feel* like they were doing something right though.
Will be down in South Bay tomorrow, so will check out the rocking at Rookie's.Next away match, let's definitely get a Oaktown place established!I like McNally's, but whatever works!
Both parties have to agree to it.  Mojang approached the optifine crew about putting it in the official code, but they turned it down because they didn't like the terms and realized they could make more money on their own.  Of course it could get worked out, it's just a pain and probably not worth each others time.
Russian literature! Don't get me started! I love Gogol and Chekov's short stories. Finishing Tolstoy is for a certain kind of person! Dostoyevsky has made me laugh and cry and laugh again. Turgenev. Goncharov. Pushkin. Ahhh! Even LOVE Nabokov. Ok I need to stop. ಠ_ಠ
There are some darker scenes coming in later episodes of the kind you're referring to. I've been having to pay attention as well. Be careful around the middle of this season.
i said "im no fucking 2x4, im a fucking skate board. also what is the other thing?" to witch you replied "Its the internet age! Google that shit." what the fuck do you want me to google?

I have nothing against easy games, hell I'm a 'Dynasty Warriors' fan... you can't get more cathartic than being an unstoppable badass who kills half of China, most of whom barely even try to defend themselves. There's a place for that sure. When I say "hard" though, I mean games that challege your mind, reflexes, and perception; not just a mode that gives the enemies greater attack power and larger health totals, that's not difficulty it's tedium. I want games that reward ingenuity, test your timing and observations, and make you think. Few games do this and it's such a shame. 'Shadow Of Mordor' is fun sure, but with more challenging combat, more robust politics, and less "ubisoftism", it would have been so much better.
When I read that they had the same name, I thought it was kind of weird for any parent to do that. Then your post reminded me that I'm the fifth in a row with my name.
Thoooooooorin fanboy.Fnatic have plenty of picks, saying they don't is a flat out lie. Huni plays several champs at a must ban level such as Rumble/Hecarim. So does reign over and febiven. The only reason they would lose is by lanes and team fighting, as most of the other teams have players that are just straight up better.No clue why you used EDG as an example for beating them. If anything, Skt will pummel FNC. They have faker and Bang, both on different levels than febiven and steelback. However Febiven may have a chance as he did play well in his region, but there's no telling. There's no clear cut winner for MSI so you shouldn't make accusations like that.
Total wasted pick. We would've been fine with Mett if we had a good offensive line outside of Lewan. We have no weapons to out points up and even with Mariota unless he can do everything all game we still won't protect him or score enough points to get wins. We should've tried to trade to find. Ore picks and gone big with O-line and more weapons for the offense. Just my rant. 
They Declared themselves Kings.Down with Monarchy.  Only a Council that Follows Parliamentary Procedure shall Rule over all.Or.... Cause I am a Jerk. :)
